I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.\n\nBack in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.\n\nBut Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions.\n\nAs the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of "improved" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event "lotteries".\n\nDon't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did.","October 23, 2014","false","175.4"," 447 of 512 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","447","512","13","33"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nova_Terra/recommended/216150/","Nova_Terra","LoneWoof","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nova_Terra/","553 products in account","MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).\n\nAfter a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.\n\nFIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.\n\nThe music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium,  the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.\n\nThe original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds.\n\nThe Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.\n\nCombine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece.","November 25, 2013","false","598.6"," 517 of 620 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","517","620","0","21"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/recommended/216150/","Brightshine","Silverwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/","182 products in account","Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on "read more". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.\n\nThe good:  A classic 2D action platformer  Many character classes  Many areas to explore  The Bad  Character classes are horribly balanced  Classes do not particularly stand out from each other  (their niche's all blur together now) There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)  Traveling is a serious pain, and they draw it out ALOT to make you want to spend $$ money to make it easier.  Items purchased with $$ have a time limit (usually 90 days) The Worst   The game is so horribly coded it takes approx 2+ minutes to start even on high end computers  it will often take several attempts to start the game in order to start up properly (you will be getting lots of errors) The game crashes FREQUENTLY you could be playing for 5 minutes and it will crash so hard you must force shut down your computer  The game servers frequently need extended maintanence (often emergency maintenece; occurs several times a week)They force you to pay $$ real cash to have or upgrade abilities your character should have to begin with (such as the ability to hit criticals with magic attacks; which is INVALUABLE)  They make quests and grinding require so much travel you are essentially forced to purchase teleport rocks or other timesavers  Dying is exceptionally easy at higher levels, even the best gear can get you killed in as little as 5 hits (which you can get hit about every second), if you want to avoid the 10% exp loss you have to buy consumable "charms" to negate the 10% exp loss (which is many hours of work at higher levels).  Looting is atrocious (essentially requires spending $$ to get pets and items to have them loot for you.  They create artifical demand\nOn to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words.\n\nFundamentally flawed\nThe simple act of looting is to push the "loot" button which is both "Z" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting "mobs" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a "ticket fragment" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push "Z" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its "gear" to make it run around to loot things for you.\n\nYou are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the "Use" items and "misc" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).\n\nItems you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense "cash inventory" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the "adventurer" series of classes or the "cygnus knights." However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).\n\nThey purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the "free market" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to CRASH FREQUENTLY, and so hard you will have to FORCE SHUTDOWN YOUR PC!. So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.)\n\nCharacter balancing is pitiful\nThey come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets WORSE! because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!\n\nCustomer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.\n\nThere is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).\n\nThere are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!","December 12, 2014","false","280.4"," 398 of 487 people (82%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","82","398","487","52","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/216150/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche "lol" and "lmao" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.\n\nWhen I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest.\n\nThe music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory.","May 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 302 of 363 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","302","363","0","42"

Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat.\n\nThen came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent.\n\nSadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story.\n\nDo I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Undyneeee/recommended/216150/","Undyneeee","Ethereal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Undyneeee/","78 products in account","MapleStory is that one game you're probably never going to find another of its calibre. It has that feel of nostalgia, even if you're new to the game. Attractive art styles look cartoony and cute while retaining 2d and pixelation draw people in this game with its surprising uniqueness. Maplestory has been breathing since 2005, but is it stable breathing?\n\n-Leveling-\n\nMaplestory was in its prime long back when generation Y was around 6 years old (2005 debut). If you compare the leveling from old Maplestory to post-big bang Maplestory, youll notice a huge difference. Its easier to hit level 100 nowadays, but back then whoever was over level 100 was considered a god. Old Maplestory had challenging leveling, so challenging that it took months to hit just 50. If you see the game now, it's a joke to hit 50, a 5 year old could do it in an hour.\n\nOf course Maplestory's leveling system will never be as good as it was back then; it evolves for newer audience because Nexon know the older audience will eventually quit. This is an instant gradification era, people want to level up quickly, not like a snail, to a point where it bores them to level up only 10 times a week. So, Nexon implemented an easier leveling system. One could argue that Nexon actually saved the game from dying off earlier.\n\nI won't argue anymore about Nexon saving the game with the leveling system, I used to think it was a saving throw, but I realized it's pretty much easy if you have enough change in your pockets. You can buy your levels. That's right. Nexon milked the leveling system for money. (by buy I mean buying 2x coupons and smashing keys to hit 200 easy peasy granted you have the money)\n\n-You ultimately don't have to spend money, but it makes you look/feel like trash-\n\nNexon milked this game so much that its clear instead of a thick white. You ultimately don't have to spend money, since you CAN get anything you need without money. Let me elobrate, of course its convenient to buy cubes instead of pressing your mouse to farm for minerals and craft one, so the obvious logic is to do illegal activites and buy nexon points with mesos, the ingame currency, from a shady dealer with -239 downvotes. This game isn't really Pay 2 Win, it's more of Pay 4 Convenience. P4C makes you look like japanese eyecandy to people who get turned on to pixels, and makes your equipment hit like train, if that train holds 5 billion damage per hit.\n\nBut if you don't P4C, you look like absolute crap until you muster enough mesos to buy one permanent nx item that looks decent. Gaining mesos from scratch is a timewaster too, because to merch (the term for buying low, selling high) without staring at your screen and hitting up and down to cycle messages, you have to pay real money to get a stand that does it for you, for about a month. Then you gotta buy it again if you want to merch, or get Carpal Tunnel. Oh, also, unless you spend alot of time and logical thinking on cubing and boosting stats on CRA, might as well fight with a stick because you are doing absolutely nothing to bosses that matter.\n\n-The Community-\n\nIt sucks. Everyone will screw you over. I've seen too many stories when people grow up and try something like CSGO and leave for a month and the guild they had a blood pact with kicks them out, no matter how much they've contributed real life money for. People rarely work together anymore with strangers, guilds are just IRL friend camaradies, or a bunch of snobs who have superiority issues. Nexon realized this, but made it worse because they've made the entire game soloable (of course with money.) The community is just like anti-social teenagers at that one lunch table, if those teenagers tell you to CC if you step into their precious room.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nThis game, stripped of everything but gameplay, is so great. I love Maplestory's gameplay. I love it. But Nexon made a semi-working money making machine off of it, and completely ruined it for the veterans. I still play it on and off like that one chick in middle school, but Nexon makes so many schemes for cash and I can't believe people are blindlessly falling for it. Don't be tempted to buy that 90 day hair. Either voice your opinion of change to Nexon, or leave the game. It's not worth your time.","February 28, 2015","false","401.8"," 221 of 261 people (85%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","85","221","261","20","16"

Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it.

The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped  so much  that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of "events" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community.","June 7, 2015","false","101.0"," 64 of 72 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","64","72","4","2"

So if you get lost in a dungeon way too high for your level, you HAD to look desperately for someone to lead you out. There are also complaints that the community isn't nearly as big or as nice as it use to be, but that's entirely on the players' fault. Most people leave and blame it on the pay-to-win aspect, but I had just as much fun without forking over a penny as the guy next to me spending his entire college budget on NX Cash. Yes, social interaction with the game seems a bit more empty, but in the time I have been playing it I've had probably just a little bit less of a good time with the community as I remembered it years ago (just without all the @ spams....).\n\nPeople also ridicule the new gameplay style for being too over-the-top with visuals while being a button spam with no skill needed from the player (*cough* *cough* Zero *cough* *cough*), but honestly I prefer the faster and arguably easier gameplay. Leveling is WAY faster in this "new version" of the game, and it works well when I have a busy schedule and I don't have to spend 20 minutes slowly stabbing at a bunch of stumps.\n\nSo overall, I really, honestly think that people are judging the new changes to MS a bit too harshly. Yes, the Cash Shop does give a small handful of advantages to people who pay, but think of it in terms of a mobile game where it would be sweet to have some spare cash to spend, but you can still enjoy 99.99% of the game without it. The community is noticeably smaller and less interactive, but that change has its ups and downs. Still don't like the community? Grab a couple of real-life friends and play together, it's a lot easier to play and faster to level up with the new gameplay.\n\nSo give Maplestory another chance if you're really skeptical about all the new stuff. If you still REALLY don't like it, then maybe it's time you move on to something else. I used to be all about Pokemon back in my day, but now it's just sorta "meh" to me. That's fine if you're not interested, but just leave everything alone and stop ragging on this game. But if you honestly want to love it again but can't because of all the new changes, just try it again while looking at the positive side of everything, and you might just have a new appreciation for all of it.\n","September 22, 2015","true","630.9"," 81 of 99 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","81","99","5","5"

Originally, I played the game off of Nexon's actual download site so I'll take that into account. I've invested over a thousand hours into this game, and boy was it great! The community was very fun to just socialize with and everyone was nice. The party quests differentiated from each other so it wasn't too repetitive. Everybody also worked together to help each other level up, and villages were filled with friends; until about a year or two ago.. Those were the good days.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying the game itself is really bad now, but the community just went kablam. It's like napalm upon the nice people of the game. Henceforth, many players disappeared and the developers just turned the game into more of a pay-to-win aspect. "Whatever happened to the people?" I ask myself a lot. I always come back to this question as this was my all-time favorite game and community. I don't know. I miss the party invites from random people, and the occurence of running into strangers who become your best friend. Sometimes I think I'm all alone when I'm online since each instance is filled with afk people and others just walking around aimlessly, then logging off just like me, only to check if the game is restored to its former glory. There are also no players left that actually do party quests, an essential thing to leveling up efficiently. "The tears that come out of one eye are from nostalgia, the tears that come from the other eye are from how bad the game is.", quoted from another reviewer, is similar to what I feel about the present Maplestory.\n\nNow onto the pros and cons.\nPros:\n+Great concept of characters\n+Good storyline that provides a foundation for each character\n+OMAIGOD THE MUSIC\n+Many, many places and locations to explore, with hidden quests\n+Content (apparently still) being added every few months or so\nThat's all the pros I can come up with from memory for now.\n\nCons:\n-Pay to win\n-Screwed over community\n-Dead servers\n-Unbalanced characters\n\nWell, that's pretty much it. If I had reviewed this game much earlier, rather than 2015, I would've given this game a recommendation. Is this game worth playing at this point? Not really, unless you're just wanting to explore the game itself. That then concludes my review.\n\nIf you actually read to this point, thanks for doing so!\n\nUpdate: Apparently, its much easier to level up now. So easy that the game essentially hands you the exp, whereas in the past you actually had to work for it using teamwork. If you're looking for that nostalgia, it's not there anymore. Also, remember the ship you took took to Orbis and the people you met on that ship? Well, nobody uses it anymore. There's no more aspect of exploration since you can just use a dimensional portal or something, or a click and go item.\n\nUpdate Update: holy ♥♥♥♥ what the ♥♥♥♥, people still use basilmarket to communicate. thats a plus i guess","November 9, 2015","false","10.1"," 75 of 91 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","75","91","2","0"

We've gone through thick and thin with this game and i even won my first major event item Nekomimi back then and i treasured it with all my heart.  Sadly i can't say nexon treasured me at all even though i've spent quite a bit of money and give or take 7 years on it.  One day I came back to my account with my items missing and my scrolled untradeable gear reset to 10 slots and basic stats.  Personally i could've cared less about all my other items but my Nekomimi's were missing.  I spent years collecting the few that Bellocan had in its server and treasured the pair i won for myself.  So naturally i opened up a support claim asking if they could help get my Nekomimi's back.  Almost 2 months went by up until i finally got a response asking if i checked all my characters .... which you know.... all of them being nekkid and the fact that i did check all my characters and their inventories and storage means it wasn't there.  So i sent a reply saying that they weren't there and then the GM put a stamp on my claim saying it was solved and put me on my way.  So there my characters sat being nekkid and all minus any untradeable gear locked to them.  From that day forward i went and bought some NX and sent another ticket specifically for the Nekomimi's that were taken and the hacked account report and they didn't even bother looking at them.  I sent about 3 more over the course of 2013 and gave up.  I used the NX to get meso's and then try and find some more nekomimi's but being an item from 2006-2007 there were none for the weeks i spent in Free Market spamming buying Nekomimi's.\n*Edit*  Opened another ticket after retrying maplestory and got a gm response.  Basically he's unable to help because "hacked accounts" are a touchy subject and they can't actually verify that you were hacked and that the items were yours and not just transfered to another account.  This bit of info would have helped me in the first ticket but i can understand where the verifying it's yours can be a horrid downhill subject.  So bellocan's pretty much dead so no chance i'll get another but the gm's aren't  bad.\n\nNexon destroyed drop rates when they did the big bang patch and changed the Exp tables to make leveling up easier.  Nowdays you're expected to either use NX to get more gear, merchant, or craft some gear which isn't always possible seeing how the use of Nx to buy meso has sky rocketed free market prices making the crystals needed to craft a bit pricy.  Party quests were basically dumbed down over the years.  Ludibrium party quest was turned from a 30min+ quest into a 10min+ quest.  Guild rankings were taken down for no apparent reason and guild quest was made useless because of it.  Guild questing was used to get points to rank up your guild and had to be coordinated with the group with certain classes and skills were a must in order to finish.  Some of the party quests were even taken down with the big bang revamp like ludibrium maze, Carnival party quest, and some others.  Nexon now also guts any decent way to get exp from grinding or party quests.  Most of the old party quests give crap rewards and crap exp.  Grinding gives moderate exp and have very low drop rates.  I've seen a good chunk of new players resort to begging because when doing certain party quests for levels they'll be booted because they don't have strong low level gear or the gear will be out of date and party leaders won't accept them into the party.\nNexon also has a habit of gutting any places you can grind for exp.\n\nTL;DR\nNexon has slowly ruined maplestory over the past few years by making it short and sweet instead of a long savory flavor.  Also nexon's customer support basically can't help you if you're hacked for mutiple reasons.","November 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 76 of 93 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","76","93","5","3"

With the occasional buff to prevent the bosses from instagibbing you with one of their attacks.\n\nThe only challenge most bosses in this game have come from one of two factors:\n1, Attacks that reduce your health and mana to 1, dispel your buffs, or take control away from your character.\n2. Having HP totals somewhere in the billions, and a short time limit to bring that to zero. Not a problem for people who hit the damage cap with every attack (50,000,000), but for people too self-aware to spend loads of dosh on cash items to upgrade in-game equipment they're impossible.\n\n\nGetting away from the game mechanics, the servers are infested with hackers and botters. How infested? There are more botters in the game than actual players. There's a "Report to GM" function, but if a GM actually responds to it, you should probably either buy a lottery ticket, or more likely slap yourself in the face because you are in a dream world where the impossible is possible. GMs only show up to host godawful events and spam emoticons while spouting lies.\n\nOn that note, the game has an autoban function built into it, which 90% of the time bans nonhackers doing something mundane for no reason. On the off chance a hacker/botter actually is banned, they'll eventually be unbanned because Nexon likes giving people "second chances" and unbanning everyone who was ever banned up to that point. Why? Because hackers spend money too ya know! Gotta keep profits up!\n\nI said there is no customer support, but I was lying. There is a customer support ticket system, but it would probably better if it didn't exist at all. Tickets can go without a response for literally years. Nexon also has this opinion that having your account hacked into is the player's fault and refuses to compensate. One of the Global exclusive areas even has a quest line that mocks this, giving the middle finger to everyone who had their account broken into and laughing at them.\n\n\nLong story short, Unique art-style Platformer-MMORPG that crashed and burned and then was grinded into the dirt. Cause of death? Power creep, pay-to-win, and apathy and malice from the company that runs it. Avoid it like the plague if the plague were also on fire and making rude gestures at you.","September 22, 2014","false","11.7"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","83","105","8","1"

This game does not hurt if you play with some friends. Honestly, being playing with friends is the only good way to play this game since they serve as a reminder that you still have a real life. Without such link to the reality, it is too easy to be sucked into the scheme of Maplestory that is deliberately, fundamentally created to exhaust both your mind and wallet\nBecause remember: the philosophy of any MMORPG is to encourage competition between players strictly on the level of vanity and facile values, being how beautiful you look, how much money you have, how high damage can you hit...... Especially when you are lonely in the game, this emotion is easily ellicited because the game encourages so in any aspect. But the trick is, we all understand there is no ending to beautiful cash shop items and the amount of currency you possess, why can't we/I keep from not coming back to torture ourselves in the grinding and trading that ultimately lead to no real satisfaction?\nBecause those game developers(e.g. Nexon) understand how pleasure works in us. What human desires is not a specific, final object, but a differential value through a growing experience. That is to say, pleasure is only gained through change; and after you arrive at a threshold, being it posed by the game or your brain, you are only left with emptiness. And this is when you want to start the loop again, again, and again. This is precisely why we only want to make MORE money, why we want to spend MORE cash items, and get MORE levels/damage without it ending at a specific number. This is why Nexon created so many new types of characters and jobs: they want to give you the pseudo-novel feeling each time you restart the experience, while in fact, nothing has changed about how your pleasure works. It's an everlasting loop.\nSo instead of clicking the "Play Game" button. Why not think about something more valuable in your life? Whether or not you are willing to participate in this collective subconscious hell of pleasure looping is your own choice. If you really want to play, play it with friends. I am lonely, I don't have friends.

It really SHOULD be. It has everything it needs:\nAwesome music, amazing graphics (You get used to the character sprites.) and lots of things to do, tons of classes that function very differently the farther you go along, but eases you into them at first.\n\nSo why am I not suggesting this game?\n\nNexon isn't the 'best' company when it comes down to it.\n\nThey have a Cash Shop. You want a pet? Cash shop. You want nice looking armor to RENT to display over your current armor? Cash shop. Teleport wherever you want? Cash shop. EXP boost? Cash shop.\nLiterally anything and everything is a Cash Shop. Yes it's not the only MMO to have it, but it clearly abuses it so much and was (Likely) one of the first MMOs to truly abuse the heck out of the system. Don't worry if you forget about it, you'll get reminded with drops, quests, and so on that there is a way to buy your way out of everything.\n\nThe community itself? If you've played an MMO, you know what to expect. Generally this consists of people who speak nothing to you most of the time- except in a market, in which case you get spammed with lots of things you won't know what they mean.\n\nThe best way to compare the free market on channel one is like watching ants swarm a meal. It's fascinating and disgusting at the same time...and by the way, you're the meal.\n\nYou can use the forums to get in guilds which aren't bad, but even then most of the lingo is confusing- half because MS has a text limit shorter than a Twitter message, half because they have a filter that is so picky that I could never state my friend 'is' something because it gets filtered out, even if I wanted to say 'is great'\n\nAnother dislike about the game is the AI. 90% of the enemies you encounter outside of dungeons  (At least up to lvl 120) use the same pattern of "I'm gonna run into you and damage you that way!" which, yeah there's hundreds of enemies, but it's all just nothing short of a pallete swap if they all get the same functionality.\n\nIn the end, Maplestory has a lot of ingredients to be a great game, but too many spices put into the soup end up making a good soup turn rotten (But still look pretty). And that's the best way to describe it.","April 29, 2015","false","97.5"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","69","85","9","0"

I downloaded it and was hooked immediately. Except for Runescape, this was my first MMORPG. My friend moved away but we kept in contact for awhile through this game, and I also "met" a lot of people in-game that i became as close as you can be in a fake world. I felt cool pretending to be 16 and people actually believing me.\n\nStarting out back in the day this game was hard. Hard in the sense that it takes a long time, effort, and collaboration even to reach the second job advancement at lvl 30. I still have my very first character at about lvl 26. This game hooks you in and keeps you grinding and doing quests all because of wanting to be like those who were lvl 70+ and had the cool job advancements.\n\nOver the years things started to get a little easier. With a new account and job classes like the cygnus knights coming out things were still looking good for this game. I was playing it more for time-wasting instead of sheer need/addiction (yes, looking back i was wildly addicted to this game). It was still something to play with my friends, but i still recognized i needed a life. Getting my first character to lvl 70 (an assasin) was a very big step for me, and when it took me forever just to get it to lvl 72 thats when i started to realize i needed to stop.\n\nFAST FORWARD 2-3 years and its summer and i think, huh i kind of want to waste some time. That summer i fell back in love with Maplestory, but for a different reason, it was so easy to level. I was able to get several characters to higher levels (60s-70s) rather quickly and it was fun to experiment with the wide set of classes that were new.\n\nBut this is where Maplestory for me started to lose its touch. I would every few months or so log on and just think "Oh i wonder whats changed this time" and its always something. It isnt what I fell in love with anymore.\n\nNow in college i found myself playing this once in a blue moon if i had some down time and wanted to just relax. This game has a therapeutic sense to it that i just go around doing quests/grinding till 2AM. Nowadays it is so eay to level up i started a character and in about an hour it was at level 50. along with my 70 assasin, i have a 12X dual blade and my main character is a 135 Aran, one of my all time favorite classes (i havent really been interested in the new classes).\n\nSo if you're still reading this, im almost done. Why do i still play this game? Nostalgia. Plain and simple. when you spend as much time as i have on something like this it is hard to give it up. I have wonderful MEMORIES of this game and i play now to waste time.\n---------------------------------------------------\nABOUT THE GAME:\nPay to Win: A lot of people say its a 'pay to win' game but i have spent about $5 of NX just for looks purposes, i made my couple million mesos on sheer grit and luck with some equipment and scroll drops. Its possible without it, but it takes work.\n\nArt: This game is beautiful. Not much else to say really.\n\nCommunity: All about gone. As a "veteran" i can tell that it is all solo now, even the PQs can be solo. Also the free market is empty except for the stores, that should tell you something.\n\nGameplay: If you like doing quests and grinding and doing storylines, its for you. If you're expecting something more, look elsewhere.\n\nAs i have said before: this game was addicting to me, some may play for only a little but there are only extremes for this game. Either 10 hours or 1000. BE WARNED.\n\nNexon: They dont really give a crap about their players so dont expect very good customer service (which is why i would steer clear of NX, you dont need it)\n\nHacking: Theres in-game hackers and then there are people who hack accounts. Luckily after being off the grid for about 2-3 years i was able to come back on and have everything right where i left it. I guess i was lucky.\n\nBecause of the time i put into it and how much of this game i have seen, from the beginning to the end, i can only recommend this with a word of caution. Dont invest yourself into the game but still have fun with it because it is a wild ride.\n\nI believe this game can only get a 1/10 or a 10/10 and i have to give it 10/10 for what it has been for me.\n\nI apoligize for the novel but this is what Maplestory has caused, it is a beautiful game and it is something that has been that nagging baby sister for the past ~10 years and it is something that i will always look back and laugh about and think of how much ******* time i put into that game.\n\n","March 26, 2015","true","124.4"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","52","59","7","0"

(Since 2006) This game was fantastic, but it was ruined by it's absurdly high damage numbers, (which get so damn high that Nexon has to raise the cap on damage) The insane high prices of the free market, and the sheer amount of classes. (There's 32 classes! THIRTY TWO! I was so happy when Pirate first came out.) Oh and the community. Do you like 12 year olds? Well that's basically a majority of the community.\n\nHere's my recent adventures. Recently I played this game AGAIN for the 90th time. I chose Adventurer my bread and butter, I picked Magician and picked the Cleric tree.  As soon as you hit level 20 you get bombarded by all these alerts. "JOIN THE NEW CHAT SYSTEM." "EVENT!!!!!" "GACHAPON GACHAPON!" I got very annoyed very quickly. After a very quick leveling grind to level 100, I got my fourth job Bishop. I was very happy that I made it to level 100 because back in my day I've gotten a level 100 Dark Knight.  Soon after my 4th job I realised. ♥♥♥♥ there's 150 more levels. I gave up after that. The community annoyed me the grind was boring (Just spammed HS for bonus Xp) and I didn't want to spend any real life money to cube any items or scroll anything.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nIt WAS a good game. The game is no longer enjoyable. But my inner 12 year old makes me want to love it.  Nostalgia is the only reason I would see someone play this. The game on it's own is a grind all the way to level 250. The big numbers are blinding and are hard to track, the classes have no "uniqueness" It's all about DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE.\n\n5/10 Nice nostalgia trip, game isn't fun anymore\n\nEdit:\nWent from being most recommended negative review to not existing at all.\nIf you can't take backlash for your dying game consider fixing it instead of hiding negative reviews.\nThank you for hiding my review though!\n\nProof: http://imgur.com/nVIs5tX\nMy review doesn't even show up. If you can't take negative reviews please just delete all of them. If you say that this is an outdated review, please look at most recommended reviews. There's reviews older or just about the same age as mine. Please delete their reviews too then.","September 15, 2015","false","168.0"," 188 of 277 people (68%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","68","188","277","25","19"

I have spend many, many, hours on it. I was drawn in by the excellent storyline and seemingly endless levels.\n\nBut then it hits you. The level curve is absurd. The content is either sparse or not worth your time (good luck leveling between 120 - 150) and the top play is just far too repetative. There is always a best build, and they are painfully obvious. All these status effects, elemental damage, forget them. Only element that matters is holy, and most enemies die before you can do whatever horrible status effect to them.\n\nMaplestory, gameplay wise, seems to be hanging you between faster leveling crowd attacks or better boss-killing single target attacks. Usually you end up a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix of all of them, and it seems like that's the track most classes are now moving.\n\nReally, the only difference between most of these classes is their DPS and weapon of choice. While this one has to balance light/dark, this one rides on a panther, and this one is so adorably ridiculously pink, it doesn't make a bit of difference. You're either a bishop or a killer. Class synergy? Nope. Tanks and Strikers? Nope. I guess the best example of this are the boss battles, which just involve going down your attacks, drinking crap tons of potions, and watching a screen literally covered with colorful multi digit numbers. You do this for an hour, and if you can't do it under a hour, you lose. Fun.\n\nThere is so much to like about Maplestory, but even more to hate. Honestly, I play it for the community. I'm not saying the game is awful, I'm just saying it is intensely flawed.","November 25, 2013","false","263.2"," 125 of 182 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","125","182","0","0"

I have a few thousand on this game. I just played the client version most of the time. Honestly, when this game came out way back when in '05, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It was hella fun but it was also really hard. I mean if you were level 50 you had great respect. Now getting to level 50 can be done in 2 hours as apposed to 2 months of training 4 hours a day. I mean like if you got to lv200 back then people would waste money to acknowledge you for what you have done. Now if you get to level 200 its just a race to 250 or to get super high damage and solo bosses to make real money on paypal or some ♥♥♥♥. Then later on they made Big Bang which made it super easy. Big Bang continues on and now its hard again. They raise the level cap from 200-250. Still takes like 3-5 days to get to Lv250 is unknown how long it will take because no one has reached there yet. In my opinion, this game has become completely pay to win. Nexon has declined in their service from where they started. Before buying NX was for like for clothes that didn't do jack ♥♥♥♥. But then nexon was all like, "Lets make every piece of equipment ♥♥♥♥, and put a bunch of NX items to scroll them, reset their potenial, protect them from being destroyed and a bunch of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t." That really made me mad and now I ended up spending more then $7000 on this game. I ended up making Close to $10,000 in paypal credit over time but that was only because I played way too much. I farmed bosses and scrolled and sold items all day and all night. I got sucked in and do me a favor, never get sucked in. I was lucky to make that much money back. To be honest, that was over the course of 4 years. Its not worth giving up even a minimum wage job for that kind of pay. Go get a job and make something out of your life. Back when there was only 4 jobs and it was super hard, those were the good days. Like the actually unbanned hackers recently just to get more attention back in the game. Wait i'm sorry, let me say that again. THEY UNBANNED HACKERS SO THEY COULD GET MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. I hate to say shiity but thats what it has become. Probably 70% of the userbase how is Hackers/Botters. Freaking Angel Prossecer is free and theres also BT that just allow people to level up fast and ♥♥♥♥. For christ sake the 3rd best highest level is a hacker. ZeroByDivide better known as Divide By Zero on Gamersoul (maplestory hacking website). He has some of the rares duped items and IGN's and so much more ♥♥♥♥. He has CLB's that hes always using to find exploits and hes also leveling super fast. This game is just not worth it any more. Stop wasting your time on this stuff. If your a billionare, then this game is for you. Don't waste your time.","January 2, 2014","false","10.8"," 64 of 88 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","64","88","0","8"

As of recent, I mainly stick around because, yes, the game is QUITE fun if you find your little clique of friends, and because somehow, I enjoy the story of Maple's heroes fighting against the Black Mage. A few of the Hero classes have one hell of a backstory to them, and despite clunky, unfair gameplay mechanics, I like it. Yes, I'm aware Nexon couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how their players feel, and yes, they break the game continuously while providing "patch updates" to cover up their intentional ♥♥♥♥-ups.\n\nLong story short? Nah, can't really recommend it to anybody. Am I going to keep playing it? Probably; waiting to watch it burn is more like it. I can equate my experiences to sitting with a group of friends, enjoying their marshmallows around a campfire, when suddenly, a wild sasquatch arrives behind you and tosses someone into the flames.

Old maplestory was much more of a challenge and everyone actually interacted. Now it's just a bunch of Cliques and groups that people stay in together and keep away the noobs. Expect to see smartphones and dumb cliche stories about high school life and pre-teen focused content. MapleStory was a fantasy world full of dragons and magical items with a feel of that little Warrior, Thief, Mage, Archer. It's just thrown out that feeling that makes you feel like a true adventurer and puts you in these cliche IM THE MAIN CHARACTER AND I MUST DO THIS IN ORDER TO BE STRONGER stories. It's honestly stupid. MapleStory has become a game where everyone is pretty much anti-social unless you join them in their talks about being "azn" and saying "chuu~" and "imah pandah" thus making them more comfortable enough to invite you to their little clique. The old days were full of nice people, people willing to talk with you and go on quests with you. "Hey dude are you doing this quest to get this item" "Yeah wanna party up?" was a very common thing to hear. Nowadays it's folk rushing to level 30 and farming spots saying "cc pls". It's disgusting. You don't have to agree with me it's just how I feel as to what this once magnificient game has become.\n\nBy the way, almost everyone looks the same due to the popular looks taking over most of the population. Expect to see people with no pants, eyes almost closed, and hair that looks like it was straight out of Yu-Gi-Oh.\n\nRIP MapleStory. Big Bang damaged it.

Thank you.\n\n\nI grew up playing this game as soon as it was out in North America, all the way back in 2005. I was just a kid then, not even a middle schooler. I spent most of my free time on the computer playing the game with my brother and his friends. Back then, leveling was SLOW; it would take a week just to get to Lv.30. The only way to level at all in your 2nd job was to PQ the same quests over and over half a dozen times just to level up once, and even once you did, you didn't find much content at the next level.\n\nBecause of this, most of the original game was extremely social. The goal to getting anywhere was cooperating with other players, as interaction was key to success. Because of the snail-leveling, you would spend most of your time in one of the 6 towns, listening to gossip and learning important information, getting into Parties and Guilds, and making friends. This game was key to my survival, as I live in a hellish redneck ghetto town. My online friends helped me see the light through dark times, and I owe them everything; even a decade later.\n\nI stopped being very active after 2008, but did check on the game after BB. My original draft of this review was negative, but the modern maple is loaded with new content and 5x as many classes as the original game. Leveling is fast now; I could get 10 characters to level 30 in a day. Even then, there's still a lot of grinding. The EXP you need is a fraction of what it used to be originally. Money is still an issue, and the economy makes no sense to me.\n\nThe cash shop is still a waste of money, and you are forced to spend real $ on skillbooks, or else your characters will be stunted in their later growth. The modern community is very antisocial because of the soloing aspects. It's not the same game I remember as a child, but this could still provide you hundreds of hours of content, and it's been free for a decade!\n\nIf you're bored and want a free mmo to try, this would be one of your destinations for many years, and for good reason.","October 6, 2014","true","53.7"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","26","31","11","4"

Only very few hours were recorded because I always played through the launcher and not Steam. Anyways;...\nEither one of two things will happen:\n\n1) You won't like this game, and quit playing after like 10 hours tops.\n2) You'll really enjoy this game for the first 5,000 hours, then realize you wasted a couple years playing one of the worst MMO's out there.\n\nI enjoyed this game when I was a kid, quit playing it for a year, came back to it, quit playing, and so on. This game is one of those "Pay-to-win" games, where everything is based off how much money you feel like dumping into this game. And that right there, is what makes it so successful.\nIt's a nice game, yeah, but not worth the time and money you'll put into it. After a couple hundred bucks put into cosmetics, "damage", any stupid ♥♥♥♥ there is, you then ask yourself what you're doing.\n\n"Well, it's not a waste if you enjoy playing the game!" I suppose so. That's what I said at first, but hey. It's your money, your feel to the game.

Over the past 6 years (for me) they've consistently been dumbing down the game to where it practically plays itself with things like 100 level tomes which just make your character level 100 no questions asked, no effort produced. The sidequests are generally repetitive and unrewarding (and unrewarding isn't necessarily a bad thing if the quest was fun). They have special global quests (which when were created happened once a month or couple of months) every single day which reward you with gear for your level and experience automatically, you do not have to go out and kill mobs/bosses to get rare drops or complete a questline anymore.\n\nWhen I began playing Maplestory in 2009 it was a simple game that allowed you to do practically whatever you wanted, you had no guidance (or very little) and were encouraged to explore the entire world which made the game very fun, it was absolutely great at making you feel accomplished and as if you discovered something new. Now you have something called a Hyper Teleport Rock at almost all times (from the global quests mentioned prior) that can take you literally anywhere in the game, no long trekking, boss battles, or sense of adventure. You can avoid all of that.\n\nThe game was more challenging which made it more enjoyable when you leveled up. Back then (pre Big Bang), to put how easy they've made the game into perspective, to get to level 30 generally took around a month and level 70 took maybe 4-6 months. Now, with no exaggeration, you can get to level 30 in an hour and level 70 in about 4 hours. You can hit level 200 (which pre Big Bang would have taken a year or more) in a week, maybe less.\n\nThis game also never had a story, just quests. There was no "ultimate evil" or dedicated storyline, but they made that with the Cygnus Knights. I joined the game again just to play the Black Heaven storyline which was extremely boring. The character dialogue just droned on and on with no meaningful interactions, it was almost entirely just characters making cheesy jokes to eachother and other useless non sequiturs which completely dilutes the idea of an overbearing being, so I found myself just holding down my spacebar to fly through the dialogue a lot and I never felt like I missed any information. Then there were things you had to do, and you could tell it was just all filler content. You had to kill 30 of these robots, then go through the portal and kill 40 of them, then go through the portal and kill 60 of them and I wish I was kidding, you ACTUALLY do that up to 100 robots. And you do that a couple more times. You also do the same thing with collecting things from monsters you kill. They're forcing a story that has no weight and is so clearly thrown together that it hurts.\n\n\n\nThis game is great if you're looking for just a straight casual MMORPG to just ♥♥♥♥ around in and waste time, if you want an experience and a challenge I would go find another game.","June 13, 2015","false","27.6"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","1"

(cubes and all) while spending $50 on the game wouldnt get you anything except a pet and all its lame accessories\n\n\n\nHackers Everywhere: Now i don't care how secure your account info is, or how many antivirus scanners you got, or even if you use that anti-keyloggable steelseries keyboard, YOU WOULD GET HACKED.. skilled people know how to manipulate nexon's database, exploit the pando downloader, or even right through the cash shop and gain access to your character and pin.. NOBODY in that game is safe.. best way to be safe in that game is not to brag about your gears or show off in youtube videos\n\n\n\nLame Economy: The in game Meso currency cap used to be 2.1billion but with so many complainers they finally increased it to 10billion.. though 10billion couldnt even buy you a decent weapon in that game.. since very great or even godly equipments cost about 60bill~120bill a piece..\n\n\n1. purchasing equips that cost more than the meso cap (which is pretty much everything in the game except pots) will require you to have a voucher.. you are 200.1% likely to get SCAMMED\n\n2. large trades through the trade window violates nexons TOS, your likely to get mass perma banned for having fradulent meso or even trading with illegal website farmers\n\n3. by the time you buy all the equips you want, you WILL GET HACKED.. nexon wont compensate you at all\n\n\nBotters Everywhere: The reason why everyone bots in the game is because the economy is so jacked up and expensive, no legit person can even afford a decent equips set.. alot of people resort to botting to accumulate alot of mesos\n\n\n\nCocky Players: Alot of the players in that game are self centered losers with 2million damage range or higher, if your damage is lower than theres they would either kick you out of partys and raids, or killsteal the map your training on.. oh this happens very often during 2x exp events unless you play on one of those underpopulated brand new servers but they even started to do that over there too\n\n\n\nWrongful Bans: This happens ALOT and a good 85% of the people never do get their accounts back.. they have to start all over, some never play again.. you might be strolling through the free market, or henesys townsteet and walk into a map with a vac hacker, well your gonna get banned for hacking too not just that person, and nexon doesnt investigate nothing they just hellban everybody as they see fit, and when it does happen to you, their customer support takes great pleasure in refusing tickets and appeals\n\n\n\nI would recommend La Tale instead of Maplestory.. to anybody who plays it.. you've been warned","October 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 39 of 59 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","39","59","0","2"

It seems that Global MapleStory wants to make itself the superior version of MapleStory, but it has a very half-♥♥♥♥♥ way of trying to achieve this. So far, pretty much every attempt at being different from the mother version of the game, KMS(Korean MapleStory), has been an annoying step-down from what could have been awesome. For the last few years, GMS has made unneccesary changes to content coming from KMS to make it seem like their version of MapleStory is somehow "different". The problem is, these changes have always been sloppy, and they've continued to hold the game back from being much better.\nIn my opinion, what GMS should be focusing on is creating completely NEW content that could easily go side-by-side with anything we receive from KMS, rather than making nitpicky changes and removing pieces of content that players have been looking forward to for months.\nThe main problem with the game is how Pay-To-Win it feels, and it is sad to see that unlike KMS, which has been slowely making attempts to make the game fair for non-paying players, GMS has continued to hold the game back in its Pay-To-Win state. For example, in the Korean MapleStory as part of the "RED" update they added things like an Auction House, allowing players to buy and sell items from other users without needing to purchase a permit with real-money. GMS has opted not to add this to the game, claiming that it had some "problems that needed fixing" but months have passed and we've seen no news on it actually coming for us. Another example of ways that KMS had attempted to walk away from Pay-To-Win (and another example of how GMS simply ignored those changes to continue on their Pay-To-Win path) is the "Maple Mileage" system which allowed you to optain mileage through playing the game, and having the option to pay for Cash Shop (real money) items using Mileage instead! This meant that anybody who played long enough could have the option to EARN Cash Shop items through playing if they chose to do so. Of course, in a decision that surprised no-one, GMS simply did not make any attempts to add this feature to our version of the game.\nThere are many other features that helped even the playing field with paying players and non-paying players, and I could go on-and-on about what else GMS has decided to skip, but I'll stop there. (If you'd like, you could look up things like Additional Options which added all sorts of randomized stats to your items to help players who weren't quite powerful enough to fight Bosses for their loot. You could also look into how KMS added the ability to buy 'Maple Points' with in-game currency. Maple Points being an alternative to NX, which is what you use to buy things from the real-money 'Cash Shop'.)\n\nI continue playing this game in hopes that one day these things and more will be added to make the game friendlier to non-paying players, but only time will tell if any of these will happen. For now I would stay away from MapleStory, as it continues to give the Free-To-Play genre a bad name.","June 18, 2014","false","987.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","2"

(Note: my main interest is quests.)\n\nI remembered it was a game that, if you are a casual player, got harder and harder to progress as you went on. Eventually I stopped playing because it would take far too long to level up and make any sort of meaningful progress. Plus items like scrolls to increase certain traits of a weapon were pricey and overall the game was just slow.\n\nFast forward to 2016 and I am back! It's a lot of fun now. Nexon have made certain parts of the game painless and have introduced new niche areas. Not interested in monsters or mapleworld? How about becoming a star/celebrity over at Star Planet? Want something different to the world of monsters and magic? Check out Friends Story, one of the alternative dimensions that's set in the modern world where you play a student!\n\nIf you just want to do quests and wander about - the game now has a very good guide that will recommend the quests that are right for your level. I followed this guide and levelled up quickly, giving me more options to explore other parts of the game and even take on a big boss or two.\n\nImproving your weapons and equipment is now simple to do and doesn't take long at all.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is that it seems like a neverending mess. Little to no structure and if you were looking for a main storyline to follow there isn't really one. Instead there are lots of short story arcs, or series of quests (one leading on to the next), which is great while it lasts but leaves you thinking - now what?\n\nPlaying alone is fine, and I mainly solo, however playing with friends is a lot more fun.","May 1","true","24.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

I don't cover all the reasons, but I do cover one of the main ones. Please, take my word for it, you don't want to play this game past the early game.\n\nEXTREMELY pay to win. The end game is utter ♥♥♥♥ for this reason along with various other problems ranging from lack of content to game breaking bugs that take forever to fix to extremely unbalanced classes.\n\nNexon just doesn't care. Don't play this game, it's not worth your time. Find a private server, their service and gameplay is generally better.\n\n\n**Edit**\n\nI'm going to add this in due to some comments I've been getting about the game not being pay to win. Sorry if it's a bit disorganized, since this was meant to be a comment, however it went over the 1000 character limit :\n\nThe potential system, to those who have not played this game yet, is basically an extra 2-3 stats tagged onto almost any peice of equipment. These stats account for the majority of a player's strength/damage, much more so than the stats you regularly get through upgrading items by in game means. These stats start out very poorly, and are rolled randomly by using what is called a cube. Occassionally, the tier of the potential will go up when you roll (This is quite rare, maybe 1 in 30 rolls give or take. Some people need around 100 if they're unlucky), giving access to better potentials. Note that these potentials are RNG, so as a warrior, you may very well get DEX, INT, LUK, M.ATK or any other useless stat 95% of rolls.\n\nTo get a single cube through in game means takes up to a week, more or less. Crafting them is ludicrously expensive and trying to obtain them from killing bosses is pointless due to the ludicrously low drop rate ( To get one cube, you'd have to do a twice daily boss each day for on average a month, give or take. I say this from personal experience ).\n\nOf course, you could always BUY cubes. They're $1-$2 each (The $2 one is necessary for upgrading the final tier ), or they come in $10 and $20 bundles. Note that it's ONE DOLLAR TO BUY A SINGLE CUBE. Making a single end game tier item can take HUNDREDS OF CUBES, and that will get you almost NOWHERE progress wise. You need a FULL SET of these types of items to have a CHANCE at one of the end game bosses. This, coupled with the fact that group play is extremely discouraged in boss fights makes these end game bosses impossible (The HP on these bosses is in the hundred billions. Consider that I, a long time player who doesn't spend money can't shave even a fraction of their HP bars in 10 minutes. Now consider that most bosses have a 20 - 30 minute time limit).\n\nIt is also impossible to make money in the game from 'end game' activities, because unless you have an extremely high damage range, all the bosses you will be able to fight have useless drops.\n\nI didn't even mention the fact that a lot of boss drops are trade locked unless you pay $2-$3 to untrade lock it for one trade.","October 14, 2014","false","96.7"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","30","47","0","18"

This update made PQs useless and really any type of party related things useless [PQ = Party quest] you would in the past need to make a group of 5 + people to go into dungeons, the dungeons would depending on where you had been in game need a certain group in order to play/beat it, like in Ludi PQ, you needed 1-2 mages, 1 theif, 1-2 warriors or so or a archer class in order to do areas within the quest, the theif would use their darkness skill [or what ever it is called] in order to sneek into a room full of mobs that 1 hit KO you, the mages would use their teleport skill to warp to spots others can't hit and the archer would use their bow and arrows for distance kills, the warrior was for dmg and tanking of the bosses\n\nI know this is a long text wall and I am sorry, the memories I use to have of making friends while in line waiting to do a PQ was awesome, having to do dungeon raids with them was great, the reason I also mention it makes doing parties useless is now that the exp tables have changed someone can solo lvl faster then when in a party, sure a nice exp buff from a Bishop is nice tho it isn't needed.\n\n2. The game is super easy to level up in now, in the past it use to take people atleast 1-2 years to hit level 200 sure I know that is a long time, tho now you can within 1-7 days hit that, since all you need to do is find out where high exp monsters spawn and grind kill them, now this is another factor as well, this will cause you to KS people [KS = Kill steal]  who happen to be doing the same thing as you and or would be doing the same thing as you.\n\n3. Changing of the classes, some for the good, the rest for the worst, I made a Dragon Knight, wanting to use it how it was in the past, you know with dragon roar, anyone remember that attack? I sure hope so, it was quite a scary and powerful attack that would hit 16 or so mobs within the AOE range for massive dmg and this was a warrior based class, that also you didn't have to be job class 4 to use it, only needed to be lvl 70, well now the Dragon Knight has been changed to be more of a spear based class, so dragon roar is gone, the most useful skill in my eyes for lvling up, I forgot the rest of the changes to it, tho it seems they gut a lot of classes for the worst.\n\nI will end this review here, I do like Maplestory, tho since the Big Bang update, it broke the game in my eyes, no longer do you need a party, you can just KS grind up to lvl 200 + by your self, they made the game to easy, if they could only add alt servers in that played like before the exp tabel changes but keep all of the new classes and what not, I think it would be more fun, since you would have to party up with people in order to get any where, it made me angry to see they would change their full game on their hard core fans like this and bring the game down the to such a level.","January 27, 2015","false","8.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

As an older player myself (I've been playing Maple off and on since 2006), I disagree. What brought me back to Maple after the last four year haitus I had was the nostalgia, but what kept me playing was the complete rehaul of the game.\n\nWhen I was a kid with dial-up internet, getting to the first job advancement was difficult. Fast forward to today: I have played almost every class through into the fourth advancement. Yes, it's been made a lot easier, but it's also reasonable now; any player can get a good diversity  of content regardless of experience or skill. The endless 10-20 level grind on the same map is gone, now theme dungeons and quests offer the best leveling chance, which is loads more fun. In fact, quests used to be altogether useless, so this change is super awesome.\n\nThere's so many classes now! I was super happy when I came back to all the new classes. I actually can't wait for more to come out so I have more skills to try out. (I'm hoping there's an all-new class soon with new clothing equips and not just weapons.)\n\nThe addition of spell traces and the equip enhancement system actually reduces the pay-to-win aspect that has ALWAYS (as in FOREVER, as in THIS IS NOTHING NEW) been a part of Maple. It offers people the chance to have good equips but without the ridiculous cost and rarity of scrolls. Equipment drops have been completely rehauled and now have hidden potentials, allowing players to find their equips without having to spend mesos or real money and to make a decent bit of mesos that help in the later game with pots and the like. (Side note: I remember the days of the scrolled out sauna robe, can't nobody tell me the new equip drop system is bad.)\n\nUs older players are not the major target of this game anymore and that's OKAY. It's for those kids coming in at the same age when we started back in the day. It's not entirely Maple and Nexon's fault that the previous audience left, a good deal of people left because they got older and found other games, particularly MOBAs. (Admittedly, the game community has gotten quieter and some party quests are dead, but, again, see previous point.)\n\nAll-in-all, it's not right to make a crappy review on the game because it's changed over the course of over a decade and a half. The game is different, even easier, and that's totally cool. I think it's a great choice for new, young gamers with its cute graphics and background music. And if older players approach it as a different game than the one they remember, it can be really great for them too.","April 8","true","312.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

Four classes, places to go, and you can conduct social activities/experiments? Welp, sign me up!\n\nExcept that was 5 years ago. Now, I felt that the game is just swamped with 'features' (being that they are a little more than gimmicks). PvP arena has, in my experience, died out after a few months of activity 3-4 years ago. I'm now swamped with event quests that I'm not even interested in doing. Hell, even the community as gone worst over the last five years. I still remember the times where, at the boat from Ellina to Orbis, the players, as passagers, would do some kind of crazy shenanigans to pass the time (hell, there are dedicated Balrog killers just in case one showed up). Now? you buy a plane mount, head to the station, go into transit, and then stare into the screen in boredom as you count down the timer. Now, if you are the adventuring type, prepare to lone-wolf the game 90% of the time; most of the 'social' groups camp in Henesys nowadays.\n\nAnd the grinding. Yeah, prepare to mindlessly grind your way through. At least a few years ago you would have parties that would happily join you. Now? *sigh*\n\nFive years ago, I would of recommended this game. Now? Nah. Look for something else, or do stuff in real life.

Hackers and botters were always an issue so I won't touch on that, as well as the P2W nature. We all know P2W is bad and I've sunk easily far too much money into this while I was still on my parents' alllowance. Still, many MMOs follow that route and I've become inured to it.\n\nNo, what gets me is how far the game likes to think it's come when in reality it hasn't moved at all. On the one hand, I like the multiple character classes, as even though they feel just like all the others of their niche(Tank, glass cannon, rogue, etc.) there's little perks that make the classes interesting for a time(My favorite so far being Mechanic, though since I haven't played in ages they've likely been nerfed). That leads me to one of my main gripes: The lack of balancing for the numerous new classes. Not only that, but the game itself doesn't change to suit each new class and their newfound overpowered strengths or crippling weaknesses. This leads to many classes being pointless or obsolete(Who even plays as the classic four/five character classes anymore?) which clutters up the game.\n\nThe game itself is very cluttered, as well. I get that traveling is a big part of any MMO or any game with a large world for that matter, but if your game is a 2D, linear style, the back and forth of traveling is a lot more tedious than choosing the shortest route in a 3D game. Not only that, many parts of the maps are just lines with no connecting rooms or hubs, leading to a lot of needless backtracking. However, this is another feature of the game that I got used to(Though pre big bang the map was a circle, which was very nice).\n\nThose are my two biggest qualms right now, though for the most part I don't feel comfortable completely bashing this game since I've had so much fun with it since when my brother introduced me to it as a young teen. I wouldn't recommend it in the state it's in, though. I'm going to try Mabinogi and other Nexon MMOs, though, because I've heard they're better now than Maplestory has been in a long time.","June 8, 2015","false","43.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

At the time, it had four classes.  Now, over thirty.\nTo be perfectly honest.  Once the breaking (an event in game that reshaped the map and landscape) happened a couple years back the game went from being awesome to being unimportant.  No longer did I feel connected to my character or the world around me with its great stories and characters.  It became all about how much damage a character could put out and how fast you can max your levels (and with multiple classes).\n\nMaple Story is a game I love, a game I cherish in my memories and had some really great fun playing with many of my friends.  I would love to recommend but can no longer do that.  The game I love is no more.  I really just doesn't exist anymore.\n\nAll that being said, I have read and heard others saying that they always come back to it.

I have put countless hours into this game and it will forever and always hold a speical place in my heart.\nThat being said...\n\nThe Good\nThis game is MASSIVE! By virtue of it being such a long standing MMO, it has more conntent then I could ever hope to see.\nGrinding (And ooohhhh yeah there's A LOT of that...) has some suprising little challenges that make it more tolorable.\nIt has a unique artstyle and gameplay as compared to most MMO's.\nIt has a lot of charm if you're willing to sit through the other stuff.\n\nThe Bad\nUm... There's a whole lot.\nThe comunity seems to have fallen appart. I've heard of MMO's with toxic comunities. Maplestory's is non existant. There's a group of max level players that seem to... enjoy? them? Selves? (They sit in cities waiting for people to "fame" them.) I Actively attempted to have social interactions with other individuals, and failed. Miserably. They're just... not there. Or they simply seem to not care. At all.\nIt's so borring to do anything after a while. I've been playing since I was ten, and it probably took me 25+ hours just getting one character to level 100 (Which is less than half-way to max level) and... it wasn't fun after the inital 20 or so. I did it just because it was like my childhood dream to have a character at the final job advancement.\nAlso, balance is non-existant. Certain classes are just WAY more fun and WAY stronger than other classes. That's just part of the game. (I guess that's not nessisarily bad. It's just something to be aware of)\n\nThe Ugly\nIt's... it's an old game. It shows. It feels like they keep trying to put more and more paint on it, and now it feels like it's just that... Paint. A facsimile of it's former self. Almost like someone has taken a dead relative and taxadermised they're corpse and prettends like they're still alive. (A bit of an extreme example, but acurate nonetheless.)\n\nThe end.\nI am done with this game, it's not fun for me anymore. If you decide to play it, maybe you'll find something I didn't and have more fun then I did. I sinceerly hope you do. But I honestly suggest you play a different game. or wait for Maplestory 2 to come out. I know I'll be giving it a shot, haha.

Here is a few:\n\n-The core Explorer classes have been overshadowed by the numerous and, to a degree, overpowered new classes. Granted, this was all part of the overall storyline, but I still love the original classes more.\n-What hooked me most was the social aspect of the early days (year 3 onward...).

But now that nexon has actually gotten a support center after all these years and they helped me get my hijacked account back, un-banned, and un-bound from a steam account I can say that the game is now about 50/50. It's not as good as it used to be because games are now mainly in 3d and they stuffed to much stuff in and made it confusing, but it is still fun and nostalgic. Though the game has died alot since the good years back in 2008.","September 7, 2015","true","6.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It says I have 0 hours logged because I've haven't been playing it on steam, but I've probably wasted well over a thousand hours on this thing.  There's this thing called the cash shop.  You can buy a crap ton of stuff from the cash shop, but there's a catch, it's all temporary.  You buy a thing and then it disappears after, say, 90 days.  I feel like this rips you off so damn much.  But if you play for long enough, you come by more than enough events,  So you don't have to spend any money.  But the thing is, if you actually want to get cool stuff like chairs and good looking clothes with amazing stats on them, you HAVE TO spend a crap ton of time in game grinding on mobs.  So if you want to get good at this game without spending any money on it, it's possible, but you have to have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time on your hands on your hands.  Also, to be tolerant of this game, you have to be tolerant of anime.  If you want to be good at this game without spending money OR time, give up, it's impossible.  Unless you have someone else play for you... I guess...? But what's the point of that?\n\nOverall I do recommend this game because of the nostalgia it causes to me and how fun and obsessing I first found it like 6 years ago.","September 2, 2015","true","10.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","8","10","4","0"

I used to play this game as a kid for hours. This game used to be perfect with a very large community, awesome party quests, easy and comfortable controls, awesome class balance, people spending hundreds of dollars on NX, and a community of Maple videos. The awesome video makers from dray86 to greencream to goldentot. I used to even make some of these maple videos. You can check them out at youtube/NaBeHobby.\n\nIt was paradise if you loved mmo rpgs where you can easily make friends and have tons of fun for hours. People were having in game relationship and marriages for the love of God. This game was, in my opinion, by far a better game than WoW until... They completely ruined it after the Big Bang Patch. Everything is simplified, new classes overpower the older classes, people leaving the community, and devs only care about your money.\n\nThis game used to be a 10/10 game for me. I used to spend hours and hours everyday throughout my middleschool and halfway highschool. Now it's 2/10. It's very frustrating when my most favorite game turns out crappy because the devs were corrupted with greed. I can only hope Star Citizen will be able to replace this for me.\n\nI will miss you, Maplestory. You were that hot girl that I had a crush on, were going out, but then cheated on me.

In this review, it appears that I have less than an hour clocked in; this is due to the fact that you are locked into creating a Steam account and cannot log into an existing one. What a drawback. I really enjoyed the wide selection of classes that were available, but at one point, Maplestory only started adding classes for account-buffs or to attract returning players. The entire market is basical broken on a regular basis, and hackers commonly plauge popular maps. Hell, even I hacked to see how easy it was. Despite the boost that insta-teleporting, auto-macros, and godmode gave, the entire game was still just a slow grind to the next level. After that it's all about the equipment. For what though? Don't get me wrong, I loved this game for the longest time and I wish I could find that pleasure in it again, but Nexon has turned this game into a cash-cow, claiming 'free-to-play' in their advertisements. Trust me when I say it's free-to-start, pay-to-compete, hack-to-play, quit-to-win.","January 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I've recently decided to use Steam for it.\nTo break it down, Maplestory is a fun game, provided you have a good reason to start and to continue playing. It helps with the fact that the game has constant events and promotions. But even more important than that is to have friends to play with. Like every other game, without friends, Maplestory becomes a bit dull.\nI originally fell in love with the game because I absolutely loved the fact that there were so many places to explore, so many hidden areas, and so many things to do, accomplish, and to figure out. I played pre-Big Bang update (Shoutout to players who played around that time xD), where leveling up used to be an accomplishment. Now, levels (at least early on) are given practically for free. With 2XP events going on all the time, and various different things that boost that even further like Cash Shop items, Maplestory ceased to become the thing I first fell in love with. But eventually, they added the new level range 201-250, and then I took that and started playing the game again. It had the same frustratingly difficult level system like before, but it was nostalgic.\nMaplestory is a nostalgic RPG game, still having most of its former charm, and it continues to draw in many players. Though many Steam players do not play the game because people on Steam are mostly there for the large online community of FPS games and the like, it's still an amazing game. I recommend it 100%, provided that you have the continuous motivation of playing the game.\nOh, as courtesy, here's the summarization\nTL; DR: Farming Simulator for over a decade, enjoyable with friends","December 10, 2015","true","13.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","4"

Yes, they are challenging and I like that, but, no, they have such annoyance and can be TOO hard to where it's not even fun, but a nuisance.\n\nHonestly, I just hope Maple Story 2 isn't as annoyance as this, and much less of a grind fest, or Pay-2-Win\n\nFor a side scroller, if you're annoyed by the nuisance it has, you're better off playing a 3D sidescroller called Elsword, which is basically the opposite of the bad I posted about this game\n\nThis is basically an edit of my original review of this game, when first reviewing it I was a bit rash and having it come out to not turn out as a review.","January 28, 2014","false","7.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There was literally so much dialoge that after 5min. of reading everything and not even getting to any kind of action I just started skipping everything and still it took another 5min. just for me to kill some little rabbit things? I don't even know if i'm fully done with the tutorial I refuse to go back and check because of how boring it was just sitting there trying to skip everything and play the game. The game could also do better with a more readable GUI. Everything is extremely small and also crazy confusing. I had to change my controls also because it just felt too weird attacking with ctrl and jumping with alt. How hard could it have been to just implament a jump and climb mechanism into 1 keybinding as a default setting? Anyways clearly I have no write to fully go over this game as I'm still in the tutorial I think and don't even know how good it is due to the lack of enjoyment I had trying to just get the the part where I PLAY the game and not read 5 more chapters of bs they put in the beggining. So if you think the game is fun that's cool and all, but until they make a better tutorial I'm going to just uninstall this game as it bored me within the first 10 min. of hoping I could kill something or get to the action.\n\nOverall: 3/10\nGameplay: ?/10 (wish I got to experience this)\n","July 2, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Though the time it takes to get to an acceptable level to really explore the content that the game offers has been shortened, it still feels extremely long and drawn out. And even if you end up actually making it to this level you reach a point where getting gear overtakes leveling in priority, the cost of acquring entry level gear for fighting some mid difficulty bosses becomes pretty high. At this point is where the game really blossoms. There is a rather decentvariety of bosses and encounters, and are often rewarding and create a cool sense of progression and challenge. But, after this point is where the fatal flaw of the game lies. You reach a point where the only way to  progress is invest a major amount of money into gear, larger than many other f2p games.

The developers have implimented a lot of interesting events, bosses and mobs into the game. As of recent updates, Maplestory have come in contact with 2 huge anime series, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan. These have been 2 of the biggest events in Maplestory.\nIt's large community astonishes many people on just how great the game can be. And the large amount of diversity in the game just adds icing onto an already beautiful cake.\nThough this cake might not be like be everyone, as grinding is one of the core elements of the game. The game consists of hours of grinding mobs for exp, mesos (currency in-game) and rare drops. But these grinding will be reduced greatly as you level gets higher as you'll be going into the stage of bossing to gain more mesos, and leveling once you've hit the 200 mark will just not be as engaging.\nThis game is not pay-to-win, this will be a statement that I am willing to make. This game if more pay-to-grind-less-or-just-have-hours-of-grinding-if-you-don't-want-to-pay kind of game.The majority of your cash is mainly to get cosmetic items that will make your character look very fancy. The minority of your cash will go to items that will enhance your gear, which you can get by grinding of buying it off others.\nAlas, this game at its core has achieved what the developers have wanted to achieve and it is not likely to change too much from the state that it is right now.","September 6, 2015","true","217.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Instead, the tutorial treated me to a forced stealth mission, which was probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest "stealth" I've ever seen in a video game. After a few times of getting inevitably cased on the large, flat, open platforums with guards just walking back and forth, the game just teleported me past them. Later, in my fancy airship house, I had the worst time trying to navigate up the wierd 2D staircases and such. My screen was flooded with a million menus, all of which were rather un-responsive to trying to close out of them. Then I got my first "real" quest: kill mushrooms. My options: 1: a really slow and low-damage poke, 2: some move that sounded complicated and I never even used. 3: a jump-dash that did damage, but was super hard to aim and usually does more damage to me than the enemies, or 4: a double-slash on a large crowd of enemies that killed most of them instantly. Basicly, the whole fight was running up to mushrooms and pushing the "kill them" button. And it wasn't fun to do cool combos, cause my other moves sucked and the mushrooms dropped a ton of mana potions, and the move didn't even cost that much mana. Later, I got lost (like as soon as the game stopped railroading me) and found two areas full of enemies way stronger than me who just insta-killed me. Finally found one of those odd menus with way more stuff than I needed, but this one had a "teleport to places you don't even know what/where they are," and I chose the mushroom one because it was the first one, and killing mushrooms sounded like a new-player thing to do. Found another quest: kill more mushrooms. While looking through my stats, I noticed that for leveling up, they had a convenient button of "auto-assign points." This sounded good to me: it would probably have some cool algorithm to balance strength, dex, and int, while still prioritizing luck (my class' main attribute). Nope, it wanted to dump every point into luck. I also noticed that after another one of my quests, "drink instant-level potion" I still had the potion in my inventory. I used it about 6 more times or so before it dissappeared, which could be either due to durability (which was not listed anywhere in its description) or a glitch. In short, the only thing I could really grasp about the game was "kill mushrooms," which, as great fun as that is, doesn't make a game. Despite the "massive multiplayer" part of it, I didn't see a single other person on. My friend was trying it out too and we planned to meet up, but his game crashed, had trouble loading, and stopped itself because it "detected cheating" (and no, he wasn't cheating). I really wasn't expecting to be blown off my feet, but when your menus are more difficult than your enemies, then you're doing something VERY wrong.","December 30, 2014","false","2.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

At first it seems boring and think this game is stupid but then after a while you get addicted it is absolutly no fun at all just press 1 button to kill something and keep doing that over and over until u lvl up.\nBut the desire to get new better equipment keeps you going grinding forcing yourself to play through this boredom for better equipment.\nSince I started playing so much stupid random things have been added so much that any person who is not willing to play litrally 24/7 could not possibly do everything or obtain everything on this game, BUT you could pay nexon of course and save all that time to get your rewards and obtain whatever you want as long as nexon gets into your wallet.\nThis game is pay2win nexon and the most greedy corporation you could imagine I played for sooo long at know the ins and outs of this game but still im considered a noob because I have bad damage and equipment because I did not pay any money for equipment or damage therefore I am noob even though I know exactly how this game works, have played for ages the fact that no money was spent I have very low damage.\n\nNexon do not care that your accounts get hacked their support system takes ages to get back to you and when it does get back to you they do nothing to help you anyway. Hackers run the game and nexon pretends\nthat they care. If you did pay money for this game and want to buy end game equipment well guess what? nexon says that is illegal your only allowed to carry 10b at one time and end game equipments can be worth 100b+ making scams easier. Don't waste your time with this game...

Unlike most MMOs, you have to REPEATIVLEY kill enemies friendly or not, until you just get bored and give up on the quests. All the quests are is to kill monsters till you drop or talk to a certain person thats a few worlds away. This is also a P2W. Sometimes, the game just begs you to buy stuff (Mostly clothing). The storylines are just like the story authors just copy pasted a whole fanfiction onto the script. Another thing is, it gets bored after a while.

That's totally wrong. Ever since the 2005 beta started ( yes, i was 8 years old), I played the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Its fair to say I have put tens of thousands of hours into this game.\n\nIt was REALLY good when it first started. It really brings back good memories playing this game when i was younger. It allowed me to escape my depressing child hood life. That being said, this game has really declined from being an awesome f2p into practically a p2p. The reason it is a pay to play is that you either have to spend thousands of dollars in order to become strong. Or spend hundreds of hours hoping the farming will pay off just to get one item with 3 lines of maybe decent bonus potential.\n\nI dont regret playing this game. But, If i was asked if someone should play this game at where it is now. I would never in a million years agree recommend it. EVER\n\nEdit: I still don't recommend this game if you dont have the time to put into it. I played between october 2014 to january 2015 and clocked over 500+ hours (steam launch wasnt working from when i played some of the time.). I got to lvl 205 and 6+ other character to 120+.. That being said, I put over $200+ into just because I wanted better equips to go bossing. It's also pretty hard to get into training parties without hitting 500k+ a line. Was it worth it? at the time yes. But do i regret it? ♥♥♥♥ yeah i do...\n\nAll in all, if you have the time to put into it, then sure, do it. If not, then dont waste your time.\n\nTIP FOR STARTING PLAYERS: You go into the game and they recommend you a very low populated server; dont do it and thank me later. Join either Windia, or Bera. Maybe Scania if you feel like being edgy.","August 10, 2014","false","544.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I spent two years getting to level 70 on a Page, which was one of the harder, boring classes to play back then.  It felt awesome getting to White Knight status (being probably the only one running around) after two whole years of grinding and socializing in-game.  Then, almost over-night, it all became for nothing.  The White Knight became seriously overpowered, the levelling system went from taking two years to two weeks to two days to get higher levels, and everything I knew and thought I had worked for became almost worthless.  The point is, this game changes really quickly (as MMOs should to survive).  The tactics I had painstakingly learned became obsolete, as had my dedication to being unique in the game.  The reason I can't recommend this game is simply because it's very polarizing in structure: either you're dedicated to playing full-time, or you're not.","July 19, 2014","false","155.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In MapleStory there are many servers (over 10 servers to choose from), but a majority of the servers contains unfriendly community and tends to lag a lot. I would recommend this game to those who are willing to play more than a year, but overall if you play for a few weeks you will quit. Not only that MapleStory contains a lot of hackers and the the company, Nexon tends to get DDoS attacks (at least once per month), this will affect a lot of games including Combat Arms and Mabinogi, which will cause massive lag and disconnection.

It goes to a black screen then remains running in the background but does not play. Unacceptable in my book considering this game was made long ago. The bugs should have been ironed by now.

But after 2010 the game went to ♥♥♥♥. Why is this? Because of Nexon  being greedy mother ♥♥♥♥ers. MapleStory had a system called hidden potential. Which means your weapons had bonus stats attached to them, not all items had this but some did. What they did that destroyed my love of the game was make it so that you can buy items in the cash shop that will change the stats of items with hidden potential RANDOMLY, so you may have to blow 100's of dollars just to get your preferred stat and might not even get it. But this meant that you can PAY to have your items do more damage. Before they added this the game was perfect, the game was socially awesome you could group with a bunch of random people and grind or do party quests with them. After they added the ability to upgrade your items potential, everyone just cared about one thing: Having the most damage. This ruined the social aspect of the game, and to be actually RELEVANT in end game on todays servers, prepare to blow $10000's on your equipment.\n\nNow today the game is not about questing or party questing anymore, it is just about taking part in a boring, solo grind to max level so you can one shot bosses. There really isn't a end game, games like WoW have one, were you participate in raids with other people and try to skillfully handle strong bosses. But the end game in this is obsolete.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, they recently added something called Reboot servers. These servers are pretty much the MapleStory servers with cash shop items (except for cosmetics) disabled. No player trading is allowed and monsters are harder to kill. Some people say that this brings back the old feel of MapleStory but it doesn't. Reboot servers are pretty much an Iron Man mode version of MapleStory. With the abscene of an economy they are not that fun, but play on these if you are first trying out MapleStory. They will last you about 3 weeks depending on how fast you level, and then you will get bored.\n\n\n\n\nSo do i reccommend this game to other people?\n\n\nIf you are new to the MMORPG genre: No there are several better options, such as free to play games being TERA or RIFT, or buy to play/pay to play such as WoW, FFXIV, or GW2.\n\n\nIf you are familiar with MapleStory and want to try it agian: Yes, give the game a shot and see how it has changed.\n\n\n\n","May 21","false","129.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Warrior, Mage, Bowman, and Thief. Over the years Maplestory has evolved into something almost completely different. Some old players have given it up because the game has grown at a rate that rivals other popular MMORPG's like World of Warcraft.\n\nThe main draw of this game is cooperation. Without friends by your side, the climb to become the most powerful mapler in the land and the challenge of defeating the Black Mage, who has inflicted chaos on the Maple World is a very long one. Luckily the game doesn't require much to run and it's even easier to make friends on your first day of playing. I've met 5 people myself who I owe my well being to. They made me who I am today.\n\nNow what's different about this game? What makes it stand out? The art style. Today, 2-D MMO's have either died out, become obscure with about 500 players playing a day, and/or become a 2-D 3-D hybrid. Maplestory is one of a kind where you can compare it to those days of playing Megaman on your NES. 100% Sidescrolling, Shoot em' up, Beat em' up, RPG, Multi-Event, Party Questing, Adventure that anyone can get into.\n\nSo what are the cons? Every MMO has 1 or 2. What's wrong with this game? Well, you remember how I said this game relies heavily on community? Unfortunately, the community has become more secluded/hostile than it used to be. Pre-BigBang you could jump on a ship that goes to Orbis and meet up with some of the most powerful players in the game or the weakest and have friendly conversations with them for about 20 mins until you arrive at your destination. Today, Maplestory has become elitist. So unless you come in with friends or decide to take a weak player under your wing it's a bit more challenging to make strong relations here.\n\nSpeaking of relations beware of Gender Bender players. Quite a few players choose excessively appealing avatars to swindle money and items from people of the opposite sex through marriage. Yes, this game has marriage. Always a juicy source of gossip in the maple world, marrying someone who divorced a top player is practically the same as being a top player.\n\nOverall, Maplestory is an amazing game that not only has an entertaining storyline, but also has some of the most addicting RPG gameplay to date. Despite what many people say, unless they put in their first 8 hours the review typically isn't worth it. Give it a try! Play for 2 hours and watch your time fly away!","December 2, 2013","true","54.1"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","27","49","0","0"

I have played for a VERY long time. This game used to be fun. I remember spending HOURS grinding (which was FUN! Fun grinding. I KNOW!) and leveling my character. I remember how hard it was to chhose between the classes. They were each fun and awesome. Then everything changed when Aran was introduced. HOLY ♥♥♥♥. Some of my fondest memories of all the games I've ever played come from the experience of swinging a giant pole-axe around and wrecking face. But it was hard as ♥♥♥♥ to level. And I loved every minute. But I slowly got older. I stopped logging in as often. Why? New classes. The freaking new classes. The little ♥♥♥♥ of a dragon wizard was the last straw. I couldn't take it. What had they done to my beautiful game?\n\nThen, to blow my fondness and love for this game into tinier shards, BOOM! BIG BANG! (Man, ♥♥♥♥ big bang.)\nChanging the entie world? What idiot that that would be a good idea? Whatever. It can't be that bad! So, I decided to start playing again, and I realised something horrible in the first couple hours! HOURS! My lovely, cute, AMAZING game had been corrupted. With power creep. SO. MUCH. POWER CREEP. (If you don't know what that is, search it up.) Like come on! I got to level 80 (80!!!) with SO much ease. It sickened me. What had happened? What made it this way? Oh right. Money makes the world go 'round eh?\n\nI love this game. But it is a bittersweet love. I hate what it has become. I love it for the friends, memories, and good times it's given me. But I hate it for not telling me it was going to change, so I could play just a little more, cherish it a little harder. It's hard to find good MMOs nowadays. This is... WAS a shining example of a good MMO. Now, it is a glammed up, shiny, flashy carcass. A shell of a once amazing game. No. Not a game, but a masterpiece, because everytime I look at this game, I remember a happy time. And everytime I look at this game, a sadness for what once was creeps into my heart.\n♥♥♥♥ you, Maplestory.

I have experianced everything this game has to offer and here is my opinion on the game. The game definitely has a lot of potential, however like most mmorpgs there is a lot of mob grinding involved in order to go to a high level. In maplestory, you must grind for hours in order to reach your desired level. Unless you pay real money! Maplestory as you see is a Pay-To-Win game. You need to spend money to get good equips, more xp while grinding, pendant slots, more backpack space... I really wish I could give this game a good review, however the game is crap because it's all Pay-To-Win.","July 28, 2014","false","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

An idea of what classes are offered range from explorers that can advance into a warrior, mage, bowman, or thief to the master of dragons, or the elf queen of elluel, to more extreme things like magical girls or an animal girl with the power to fight with beasts.\nTo put it straight, you can make a new character, explore the world, level up, go through job advances and have more flashy skills, but eventually that magic dies.\nYou realize how much time you wasted on this game, how boring and tedious it was to sit down in one spot for ten levels, holding one button down, level up, and move on to the next spot. Then you repeat the process all over again on a different character.\nThis game sucks with ease of access. You want the best equips? You gotta work for it in the free market. A full set of the best and optimized equips has the potential to cost billions of mesos depending on how popular the class subset is. You can barely get ten million by normal play. So to make more mesos you have to learn the ins and outs of maple's economy, this has the potential to take weeks. Then you need to scavenge whats good and in high demand to sell in the market, and then, merchanting, buy low sell high. Even when you get to the point of learning the market, results are not immiediate. You can't begin with 5m and end the day with 5b.\nThe game is pay to win, but you can get nx buy gambling with other players and paying your hard earned mesos at a certain rate per 1k nx. The cash shop has many things you may want. All the items purchased in the cash shop can not be earned in normal play, you need real money for certain things like changing your character's appearance, pets, stat changing and stat enhancing items.\nBut don't get me started about hackers. This game is poorly managed by nexon. The market time and time again has been dominated by hackers. Tales of people losing everything they worked for due to hackers, with no compensation. There is no escape, and no salvation for the hacker situation in Maple.\n\nThis game is tedious, money siphoning, poorly managed, boring and not worth your time,but go ahead, play for a week or two, but don't take it too far. I lost thousands of dollars on this game, and I don't think you would want to do the same.","July 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you play it, I'm not saying you won't like it. What I am saying is that one day, you could really regret it because Maplestory is essentially a really simple-♥♥♥ game that hooks you because Nexon cleverly knows how to design it in a way that will keep you engaged. In other words, the game is designed to be addictive but it isn't really designed to be fun. You will play it, you will spend lots of time, you will spend lots of money, and then you will really regret it.","July 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crowdance/recommended/216150/","crowdance","Synchestra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crowdance/","66 products in account","I remember playing this game for hours and hours on end when I was younger and I did have fun for that time. Although, I hate everything Nexon and everything Maplestory pretty much I still get dragged back into it. I always give it another try and then I realize again that all you really do in this game is press spacebar and spam one attack for some amount of hours at one monster, then go to another map with a little higher level monsters and do the same. This is ridiculously boring after a little bit and get really stale fast. Even though there's a huge amount of jobs to choose from (way too much), there's honestly not much variety in what they do, because usually most of their attacks, buffs, and passives are all the same or just reskins. Also, after a while this game gets to be pretty much pay to win. There's also the problem with there being too much god damn hackers.\n\nSo unless you're okay with endless, boring grinding, hackers, sometimes getting banned just because you are in the same map as a hacker, and a really annoying community that mostly consists of 6 year olds, then this game is perfect for you. If not, then ignore this game and never come back to it again.","July 31, 2014","false","24.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On one hand, enemy pixel-art is quite impressive, on the other, player characters are still samey giant heads & hats. Combat effects from player characters and enemies alike can be so oversized and garish that the entire screen is blotted out continuously while you're left staring incredulously at the developer's excuse for a UI.\n\nAudio design will make you mute the game.

That being said...\nWhen this game came out it was incredible, I was quickly addicted and like most RPG players I played on and off mostly during the summer. I loved the character sprites, the anime/chibi theme. The 2D  aspect was done really well, navigation was easy, combat was entertaining, and the frustrating platforming jump quests were proof that even moving could be mastered. Back in Maplestory's hayday Bosses took hours to do and were seldom done. People cared about guild leader boards, the game broke up grinding with enjoyable party quests, basically minigames but with a nice EXP reward. Maplestory also had a great social environment, not typically your hardcore game types but people of all kinds had an easy time finding a guild and friends.\n\nThe elephant in the room....This game has many flaws, but i'm just addressing the two that KILLED the game.\nWhat killed this game is the horrific cash shop and formally MTS, even more than rampant hackers. For a long time now the cash shop has been sucking players dry with ridiculously priced non permanent stuff. You will pay up to $10 for a single piece of rental clothing.\nIt gets worse, with the addition of cubes, Meso sacks and some necessary conveniences(pets, scissors of karma etc) Its a pay-to-win mess. Its impossible to play this without spending money at some point, or else you'd be wasting your time now that is so grindy. This is the WORSE implementations of micro transactions in a game i've ever seen. Its completely unacceptable. Nexon does not care about its customers. Maple is showing its age and what made it great is rapidly dying.\nHackers are a big issue too. But At this point I can hardly blame them since its so hard to progress without real world money.\nIf you want to play Maplestory, Go on a private server. Its still a good game, Nexon is not a good company. Worse than EA.","February 24, 2015","false","900.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is fun but there's a LOT of grinding. Not like world of warcraft grinding where the quests are all different. Maplestory is go to this place, kill X amount of these, and repeat for every quest in the game. Once you get to a high enough level boss fights are pretty fun but that's after grinding up to that level. Party quests are fun to do though. It makes the incessant grinding a lot more bearable.\n\nThe loot system is pretty basic where all the enemy's stuff gets thrown to the floor and you run over it button mashing to pick it all up. That gets kinda old after a while but luckily there's pets that pick up the loot for you! That you have to pay for... Gotta make money somehow I guess?\n\nOne of the charms Maplestory has is the platforming. There's a few quests where you parkour around to get to the next one. Those were always enjoyable (if infuriating at times) and a nice breather from the grinding.\n\nOverall Maplestory is a pretty basic game. Kill this, get experience, level up to get new skills so you can keep grinding. It's more of a game you play if you have a summer with nothing really else to do. It's not the best game but it's not the worst either. The events were always really fun though and one of the reasons I keep revisiting this game. So yes, recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.","October 8, 2015","true","468.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Years later and a college degree later, I've re-downloaded a game (which was quite heftier than I had remembered) to see what kept the game around for so long.\n\nThe graphics are still cute as my memory had served, and the music delightful with each swing. However, the key mapping was awkward and different enough from the norm that it proved a bit difficult at first to remember which key did what. The story's dialouge was heavy, and although sprinkled with jokes, did not hold my interest in the least bit, and I found myself clicking over and over trying to finally get to any of the gameplay. I appreciate the vast amount of options you get with picking a class as well as customizing your cosmetics to truly make your avatar unique- unfortunately, I spent a lot of time just on the class alone, lost as to where to go or even start. It felt like too many options presented all at once, and given the lengthy and chore-heavy of the tutorial quests, I did not fancy the idea of going back to replay these areas over and over again just to find which class suited me, unlike in many other notable MMO's.\n\nWhen it comes down to the bottom line, this game does not hold up as well as I thought it would have, especially considering that it's still kicking around today. Fun for maybe a little while, but in the long run, time is best served on a game less clumsy.","July 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have thousands and thousands of hours on this game.  The 200-ish hours that are logged with Steam is the winter break of 2012-13 I spent with nothing better to do.\n\nHere's the sum of it.\nDo you enjoy spending hours and hours killing the same enemies at the same place just to gain a level?\nDo you enjoy doing quests whose effort to reward ratio is even worse than the method mentioned above?\nDo you enjoy playing games where the majority of the (dwindling) community is under the age of 18?\nDo you enjoy games where the only thing that matters is DPS?\nDo you enjoy paying to win?\n\nIf you answered "Yes!" to one or more of these questions, then you have every right to download and play this game.\nFor everyone else, you're better off trying something else.\n\nNow you might be saying to yourself, "I'm sure there is more to this game than that."\nNexon tries their best to add new content (which is either a mechanic that will be exploited to death or a new class that breaks the game) and apply balances (removing said mechanics and nerfing said classes).\nHowever, what hasn't change through the 8 years that I've spent on this game are the questions I asked you above.\n\nAre you familiar with the classic board game, Monopoly?\nMaybe you and some friends are hanging out one day with nothing to do, and one friend mentions a cool new version that has come out recently.  Being it that you're on an extended vacation with time to kill, you think to yourself, "We've been down this road before.  We're probably gonna start up the game, sit down, roll the first pair of die, and instantly regret doing this.  But I'm feeling optimistic.  Maybe this time will be different."  You turn to your friends and say, "I'm down if you're down."  So you and your friends start up the game and you're starting to get really into it, but a few turns later your friends are already sick of it and you immediately regret being so optimistic about this whole idea.\nMaplestory is exactly like that.","April 18, 2014","false","201.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The graphics are pretty good, there's excellent custimization, and as of late, there's a LOT more choices for classes. This makes the game a lot more fun and interesting to have multiple takes of the same general class. (EG - Mechanic Vs Pirate Vs Angelic Buster) The game has also become less party quest based (although PQ's are still fun and helpful), which is nice considering the game used to be almost based on this.\n\nThere's new engaging story quests, and MapleStory as a whole has grown a lot since the original launch date. I hope Nexon keeps up with the awesome content for Maple, as this will always be my go-to game when I'm bored of everything else.\n\nAlso, nexon, PLEASE fix the one-time account link.

Or 2007....The game has certainly changed much over the years...and will always keep changing, don't ever expect it to be the same for more than 3 months.\nMy main character has been level 200 for many years now and I have a 200 NPC In Kradia. So take my word for it, the game is now, just as playable as it ever was.  Many of the things we know and love are gone, like the challenges, or Temple of time being the most difficult location in the game (most players walk over pink bean now like he's a snail)..The direction of the game has changed, and is much more story driven now. Before you just made a character and made it your own story. But you can choose from several. AND I MEAN SEVERAL...different classes with a pre-determined story. And advance them to lv 250 (new level cap)  by grinding on monsters or doing party Quests.\n\nThe game seems overwhelming at first, but once you get the world map down, you'll be navigating like a pro in no time. The 2D anime style chibi art makes the game much more social than any 3D MMO so feel free to take a break and grab a chair..(literally a chair) that you can buy or collect from events...and sit down and make some cyber friends! Or go gear up and be the God of Damage and solo every boss in the game and wow your friends.\n\nMy major complaint about the game (and it's been this way forever) is that many ways to grow are all based on luck....nothing makes a person more angry than to spend Hard earned cash on a scroll, that ends up failing. It's always better to let other people do it....but on the other hand...you can sell sucessful gear at a higher price.\n\nThis game used to be VERY ADDICTING...fortunately I was able to break off of it and do other things with my life after I hit 200, but the new update and all still hasn't pulled me back in. If you plan on getting into this game....you will certainly have a blast...all the confusion at the beginning is worth it and it has something for everyone!","December 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY\n\nThe sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at Fifth\nAvenue and 42nd Street.  In the adjacent park area, pretty hustlers and\ndrug peddlers go about their business.\n\nFRONT STEPS\n\nA few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions.\n\nINT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY\n\nPeople are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tables\npolished by decades of use.  Reading lamps with green glass shades cast a\ngolden glow on the tables.  The patina of age is everywhere.  It is very\nquiet.\n\nLIBRARIAN\n\nA slightly stout, studious looking girl in her late twenties circulates\nquietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart.\nEverything seems completely normal and peaceful.\n\nPOV\n\nA single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strange\nlooking down on the Librarian from a vantage point high above the room.\nIt follows the Librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner.\n\nINT. WORK AREA\n\nThe Librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving.\nBehind her is the card catalogue.  One of the books attracts her interest\nand she starts leafing through it.\n\nTHE CARD CATALOGUE\n\nAnother eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides open\nbehind the Librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out.  The\nLibrarian continues reading completely oblivious to this strange\nphenomenon.\n\nShe gets up and moves past another row of cabinets.  Two more drawers\nquietly slide open, and thousands of file cards start shooting out of the\nopen drawers just behind her, but the Librarian still doesn't notice.\n\nTHE STACKS\n\nThe Librarian works her way through rows and rows of old iron shelves\ncontaining many thousands of volumes stacked from floor to ceiling.  As\nshe puts the books back in their proper places, she slowly gets the\nfeeling that she's being watched.  She continues her task but suddenly\nhears a scratching noise and stops.\n\nLIBRARIAN\n(puzzled)\nHello?  Is anybody there?\n\nA ROW OF BOOKS\n\nAs the Librarian walks down the aisle, books start shooting off the shelf\nbehind her.  She turns suddenly and sees the fallen books.\n\nTHE LIBRARIAN\n\nFrightened now, she walks slowly to the end of the aisle and tentatively\npeeks around the corner.  Seeing no one, she starts to scratch her head\nand suddenly a dozen books fly off the shelf right in front of her and\nfall to the floor.\n\nLIBRARIAN\n(frightened)\nAll right!  Who's there?  Lyle? Is that you?\n\nVery slowly now, her heart pounding, the Librarian tiptoes to the other\nend of the aisle.  She gets to the corner and starts to peek around it,\nafraid to look but unable to resist.\n\nINT. THE NEXT AISLE -- DAY\n\nThe Librarian comes slowly around the end of the stacks and gets her first\nlook at the thing that's been watching her.  Her eyes go very wide and her\nmouth opens in horror. She screams.\n","April 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

As a mapler from a long time ago who was stuck at my second job, nothing feels like a challenge anymore. The skills are inconsistently changing and annoying, and overall my character feels either too powerful or too weak. There isn't a "just-right" tier for me, it seems, and I'm only at level 60. I really used to enjoy Maplestory, but now it's changed to the point of "Who are half of these classes?" In fact I remember when the Cygnus Knights came out; that was an interesting character class, compared to the other classes that are essentially all plot-driven for reasons that I could truly care less about.\n\nAn example of this is the new and seemingly more interesting classes. I can't remember the specific names because, as stated, I could really care less, but one of the plots was that this fellow seemed to have a bond with the Empress and it involved teddy bears as well as some sort of accusation and revelation of evil chums...? Something bad happens and aforementioned fellow is injured for some reason. I enjoy the inclusion of plot in tutorials, but I also enjoy brevity. Most plot cutscenes were completely irrelevant to the tutorial which is exactly WHY I didn't care; because it wasn't teaching me anything impotrant that was integrated into my current objective or learning how to play as my character.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that this game has done what I believe quite a few other video games have done; stooped too low to helping out new players. The game feels pathetically easy and there's no real motivation for me to continue playing the game... All in all, it's a bit like an old friend that you see after five years and it turns out they're almost like a stranger to you.

Another factor about this game that i would critisize is that nexon has dropped the idea of roles for bosses. You dont need a healer to defeat a boss, which means that parties don't use any teamwork.

Eventually, I started hating all the changes but kept coming back. Once I finished high school I quit because my college blocked the game. I came back to play for a while one summer when i found it on steam, but found myself bored since all my friends had quit playing. I have no doubt that I was addicted to this game in high school.\n\nThe changes were okay at first, but then they became frequent and way too crazy. I was okay with a few simple changes, even when they added a new class. Then they started adding a new character every 5 minutes and it became hard to keep up with the game or the economy in it. Go on vacation with your family for a week and some of your most valuable items are worthless because a new update had a new boss which gave it out like candy.\n\nIt's your typical mmorpg grindfest, and there's very little appreciation for a newcomer in older worlds... although they will complain that the server is too empty 2 minutes after making fun of someone for not knowing where the next quest is or whatever "noob" question they asked. I joined the game because of a friend, but then I kept playing because of the community, now I would I avoid it because of the community.\n\nI enjoyed playing for probably the first half of my time. Most of the second half I tried convining myself it was going to be fun again, and tried finding new people to play with. I thought it would be better once it came to steam but it didn't really help.

Repeat.\n\nBeing a person who has not spent a single penny on this game, I still probably found fun in this game. Possibly just because I like wasting my time because I have barely any games to play, and still at least have some satisfaction included.\n\n\n\n\nI'll go with some pros with the game.\n\n\nFirst is the graphic design... It has a unique appeal to it while giving itself a charm. Even the most evilest looking of all enemies look clean.\n\n\nFrom the attacks, there is a lot of "WHOA HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME!!!" ones cosmetically, while at times practically.\n\n\nMost of the notable characters in the present main story are pretty original. Cygnus, Neinhart, Orchid, and so on.\n\n\nand As part of the story, the clans within it are quite official feeling, the Black Wings, the Cygnus Knights... The black wings especially due to the amount of backstory with their characters.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now... the cons.\n\n\nAs most of the people know, yes, this is a freemium game by all means. Making the game's experience the more fun using actual funds. As for the same time, there were a lot of freemium items I found that only had a 90 day trial.\nIt is like valve making a system where you pay $30 to have a certain unusual for a temporary amount of time, Except less attention instead.\n\n\nThe playerbase is 95% of people at the age of >13, the first time I encountered someone who chat with me and requested to play together, I denied the request in the most polite way I could think of saying... All he said was "*********" after that, and that is the only time I actually talked to someone out of the hours I played with this game.\nAlso the amount of times I've seen someone who wants to get married using the shout system.\n\n\nQuests in a nutshell:\nFIND ME 150 OF THIS AND THAT EACH AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXP!!!!\nFind me something that is almost impossible to do until you level up 50 more times.'\nI need you to hunt the monsters till they drop something, the programmers made it very lucky to find.\n\n\nand Classes are unbalanced that it felt like it was measured using kilometre rulers, and thought a 1Km difference didn't mind much. After playing the Evan class for a while, he started to lack power, tried out the revamped mechanic class and it was much more powerful.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a rating sentence of...\nVery mixed, but finding fun without pay to win stuff is a likely chance with the right mindset.","August 18, 2015","true","124.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rinse and repeat that cylce.\n\nAnother thing to bring the relation between Nexon and the community was terrible for a large period of time, no commmunication tickets going unanswered for weeks/months. The last several monthes something changed and Nexon is currently attempting to repair the damage they caused.","December 31, 2013","false","355.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bc1151/recommended/216150/","Bc1151","Bc1151","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bc1151/","62 products in account","Some background at the bottom, clear cut facts here:\nPros:\n- Unique.\n- Free.\n- Highly social.\n- Virtually endless amount of story line to follow, I've been playing 10 years and I have not even completed half of it.\n- Not a game you need to play every day, you can drop it for a few months and pick it back up no problem.\n- Everything you can pay for, can be obtained through (sometimes tireless) ingame efforts. I did not pay for nx for the first five years.\n- Consistantly updated, always being worked on.\n- Great bug support, I have contacted them about obscure bugs before and (when they were at fault for it) they had a fix for it within the day, I call that response time. Like, for a MMO: fixing a obscure bug (flight with my classes mount) within the DAY has got to be the fastest MMORPG response time I have ever seen.\n- Although it has a light overtone, it is actually quite a dark and graphic game. If you actually read the story line, the things that go on are quite morbid and macabre. It is not nessesarily a childs game.\n- I see A LOT of older players on, the fact of the matter is that the younger demographic does not tend to interact with the community. The usual demographic for the social towns are around 16-30. Although there are many young players, they don't tend to be as prominant.\n- The community, I mean.. Come on guys, It's maplestory! I have NEVER played a more social MMORPG, EVER. This game not only has a massive community, but I would say you are unlikely to run into some nasty people. It is largely populated by nice people! I mean, yeah. You will run into some nasty people, but that's the same for everything. I am a massive collector of chairs, and when I sell them, I spend about twenty minutes with a mercher on each chair to tell them about how I got it and what it meant to me. One of them said that they were literally crying and that I made him really nostalgic about the game.\n- The story, It is beautiful. Not only is there a pratically endless suply of it, it is quality content. Their newest update black heaven literally made me cry. It was SO intense, I can not listen to the ending credits song without a tear rolling down my cheek. I can't tell you how amazing it is. My absolute favourite character to play is the Evan, it ties SO nicely with the other story lines. It ties seamlessly with Silent Crusade, Black Heaven, Glowing Sylph, and so much more. It is really deep and meaningful to me.\n- I could go on, and on, and on. Just download it for Goddess of time's sake.\nCons:\n- It is a grinding game, I would put this on my pro's list but a lot of people don't like this. It is a korean based MMO, it is the standard. Just walk in knowing this.\n- The game can crash for a variety of reasons, although it is not near as bad as it used to be.. it is still a problem.\n- PC Master race! I am a big hater for apple, however I can't run this on my linux machines - which is a major bummer.. Like, Through a windows wrapper you CAN, but it will be laggy.\n- There are some botter problems, it is not often that you will run into one anymore.. but when you do it's annoying.\n- Names. this game has been around for over a DECADE, there are A LOT of taken names.. But there is hope! this october (2015) they are releasing 15 MILLION names! That is a lot of new names to use! Be there to claim the good ones!!!\n- Pretty big hog for resources if you have a dated computer.\n- At this point I am struggling to come up with more cons, just download it.\n---------OLD REVIEW-------------\nI have played this game just short of ten years, I have never had a dull moment in it. When you're not off killing hords of unimaginable beasts, you're in town talking to friends from around the world. The game is brilliant, many people don't like the game due to the graphics, but it's the graphics that make the game. The story line is phenominal, in the Black Heaven update I cried - literally. It was a perfect addition to the story line. There are events on much of the time, so it's always tonnes of fun. This is not a pay to win game, I love it for that. I recommend you try this game fully before dismissing it :)","September 4, 2015","true","166.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The natural first reaction to this game would be that it’s too complicated, it’s hard to level up, its pay to win/ pay to do anything fun, Exa. That’s understandable and was actually my initial reaction when I first started playing. Note that this was in 06, and the game has changed very much since then. I also noticed after hours on hours of playing, I was only level 24 and had gotten nowhere. I then decided to quit the game, to come back to it at a later date near 2008. Many things had changed, and even some new classes were added as well. I tried to level up some more managing to get to level 60 (third job) and noticing I was having tons of fun.\n\nAfter that I kept playing, getting higher in level, making new characters, and even making some new friends. It was weird how a game I hated with a passion became one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nMaple story is a game that you need to invest time into to get its full potential. As more time goes in to the game, the more fun it gets (depending on how you look at it). When you reach level 120, the game really get fun and entertaining, discovering new things, getting flashier attacks, beating bosses, and more.\n\nThe only warning I give is that the game is very confusing, and for a long time you won’t know what things do, such as menu icons, items, and even some npc’s. it will try to tell you, but its lacking explanation leaving you clueless on what it even was.

Every couple months since 2006 I wanted to play the game as a game I could sink some hours into just to get the grind out of my system, but due to compatability issues, I could never ever return to the game unless I went through these ridiculous changes to my OS and when I did, the game was so different and I felt I missed so much and the learning curve was so drastic at the point of where I was that I simply was dettered from rejoining the game, so my Maplestory experience so far ended there.\n\nFast forward to 2015, I find out that Maplestory is now accessible through Steam. So I decided to do a little research and see if I could pull up my old account and start up my Bowmaster and just be higher average in the game. I get my archer back, but man EVERYTHING is different, but in a good way.\n\nGame was much easier to get into, the learning curve and leveling process was MUCH easier, there were a lot of classes to choose from, all with their own style of gameplay and storyline, and each as good as the last.\n\nPros:\n- Easy learning curve\n- Every class is good and visually pleasing\n- Big numbers are oddly satisfying which there's plenty of\n- Grind Heavy, but time will fly easily\n\nCons:\n- Grind Heavy\n- There are certain parts of the game where you can get experience bottlenecked for certain classes\n- The social aspect of the game is near none, so it's very hard to get a group or make ANY friends at all\n- Some microtransactions are neccessary to get min/max unless you play for a LONG time\n\n********\nTL;DR\n********\nEasy learning curve, a lot of classes to choose from and each one is as good as the last. Big numbers everywhere, but very grind intensive. Be prepared to play this game alone, as there's no socialness here.","April 5","true","119.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It lags constantly, and I don't mean that it has high graphics or latency. I mean the menus have so much input lag, it becomes unplayable.\n\nMoving past that, it feels kinda empty now. It used to be you had four classes to pick from, and if you reached level ten, you could turn that character into a knight. But they have added so much stuff, I don't even know what to do.

Let me say this, I played the game once a long time ago. I didn't like it but it wasn't a terrible game at all. I downloaded it and tried to start up again. After finally getting able to log in, I was greeted with a wonderful 10 minute loading screen. Then I had to create a character and the character selection screen was set up so terribly that I couldn't figure anything out. I finally chose a character and was asked to create a PIC. The Soft Keyboard they gave me was so horrendous and confusing. I entered a PIC and kept being told that it needs to be 6 characters long (and I tried many different codes, each was 6 charcters long). Then I FINALLY got it to accept my PIC and was asked to re-enter it. I did so with my PIC and was told that my PIC was incorrect, even though it definately wasn't. This rocked on for about 30 minutes before I said "♥♥♥♥ IT." Everyone I've talked to about the game says that it is heavily bugged (being unable to actually PLAY the game, I don't know how true that is). One of my good friends, who WAS an avid player of the game, told me that he doesn't even remember them ever updating the game with bug fixes. In conclusion: Save your time and don't download this piece of ♥♥♥♥.","August 25, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Truly magical."\n\nIt's awful what Nexon have done to this game. Such a giant mess of pay to win where everyone only cares about their gear. There's no longer any social aspect to it. The leveling is  100x faster - there's no challenge. I remember it taking me 6 months-1 year to hit level 30 for the first time. I felt so accomplished and excited, and I had only gone through 30/200 levels. Now, you can reach level 30 in less than half an hour. These days no one does the party quests unless it's to farm one stage for the duration. This game is no longer any fun. I still come back every now and then for a little bit for the nostalgia, but I can never stick to it. New comers won't like this game.\n\nI miss my guild buddies so, so much. I've never had so much fun playing a video game. If by the slightest chance anyone was in The Romantics guild in Khaini around before and after the Big Bang patch, please send me a friend request.\n\nIf you're honestly interested in playing this game - please play it on a private server that runs the game atleast sometime pre-Big Bang patch. http://mapleroyals.com comes to mind.","October 11, 2015","false","683.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arevela/recommended/216150/","arevela","Kirinon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arevela/","40 products in account","I've been playing Maplestory since I started Middle School (I'm a second year at High School) and I know that because I'm young I can make a few biases, but Maplestory is not a super, terrible, never-play game. It's a game that's only likeable to people who can make an honest judgement after putting a good few to several hours into the game and get to the in-game point and not just be an ignorant angry reviewer that makes a judgement after the tutorial (seriously, why do people do that xD).\n\nI will not lie, the game has it's pros and cons, some pros would be that the game is really fun to play with friends (especially for boss fights and Party Quests). There are a lot of unique quests, questlines (there is a difference xD), dungeons, and PQs (Party Quests) (These quests usually have stories that can be a little cliche, but, in my opinion, are still good). There is a vast amount of unique playable jobs (Somewhere around twenty to thirty). Each with a playstyle that fits almost any MMORPG player (I will admit, the jobs are really unbalanced but the game is 99% PvE so I tend to disregard that fact but it's out there)\n\nSome cons I will name are what take people away from the game (they're both good and bad reasons). One con that really takes people away is long-leveling (Really, let's be honest, can you name an MMORPG (that's pretty popular) that has a fast leveling system that doesn't get you to max level within 100hrs of gameplay?). Another bothersome (even for me) con is the amount of grinding (Ok haters, you got me there, grinding is a pain, but it's as well popular in a lot of MMORPGs). The worst con that people can't stand (for some reason) is the game is pay-to-win (from the reviews I've read) (That is ridiculous, I've seen the cash shop before and everything I saw was purely cosmetic or gave purchasable currency for events for cosmedic items).\n\nI know that this sounds pretty bias but a high majority of the things I've said are true, I've played the game for almost six years so I know what I'm talking about, I know this sounds a bit more like a rant but I'm just trying to convey the fact that this game is worth a try if it caught your interest, but I won't promise you'll like the game, but I'm sure it'll be worth the few to several hours you spend on the game. I hope you found my review/recommendation of Maplestory to be helpful or encouraging to you. I mean this game is free to play and you shouldn't spend real money on it if you're testing it's worth. Altogether I hope you enjoy your brief to everlasting Maplestory experience","October 30, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For an entire week the game has been completly broken to the point where 1/3-1/2 of the playerbase can't even load. No actual fix has been released, and no anouncement by developers. Tech support and customer support don't help either. They've just ignored us and ran away with our money. To add salt to the wound they also had a double xp event when no one could log in. I've given up on this game and you shouldn't waste your time on it.\n\nEdit:\nWell It's been about 5 months, and maplestory is up an running. They updated some of the UI, as well as changing a lot of the mechanics. The game is a lot easier to get into now, but harder after about lv 200. I enjoy the game, however i'd recommend downloading the nexon version instead of steam.

MapleStory focuses so much on just catering to the instant gratification aspect of human nature that they neglect to develop the team-play aspect of the game at all. It used to be, you needed a certain number of EACH job to get quests/bosses conquered but now you can either SOLO bosses and/or quests or just fill an expedition with all the same class and get the job done. The main reason for this is because MapleStory is so caught up with creating new classes that overpower its predecessors without focusing on gameplay aspect. Everyone wants to be the same class of character simply because it can beat out the rest with little to no effort and it is because of this that the economy in MapleStory fails as well. With so many websites to buy mesos and gear from, it's really hard to find anything affordable from other players at all.\n\nEverything about this game simply doesn't nurture any long term desire to stick with this game. There is no Team aspect like there once was, Market prices have escaped the realm of reason, and Nexon just keeps feeding this solo-play craze which simply defeats the purpose of an MMO all together. There is no sense of community here anymore, which really is a shame.","December 27, 2013","false","917.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job.\n\nI kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.\n\nAfter returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player.\n\nThese days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.\n\nIN THE END:\nThe game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.\n\nI really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.","January 19, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are into cute graphics/sprites with feel attracted to this game. I know i was when i was like 11, still am though. Mainly because i like the "ANNNNNNNNNNNIME" feel that it's got going for it, and alright, cute looking things beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of other cute things, why not? Beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things is really satisfing to me.\n\nI've grown up with beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. Final fight, Streets of rage, King of dragons, hell even Sonic blast man II. So yeah, i really enjoyed this game and was a "MIGHTY WARRIOR OF ANIME"\n\nI got around my 2nd job advancment and then, my eleven year old mind noticed something. "HOLY FRICK I SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET THIS" and then i stopped playing for four years and got back into it with a new account because the eleven year old me was like "FRICKING LONG PASSWORDS MWHAHAHAHAHA"\n\nAnyway the now fifteen year old me blasted to level 45 in one day and he was like "Excuse me? b...but why? Last time i played this i CRIED BLOOD to get my 2nd job advancment. Now i can get to this high within one day? Jesus this game is so.....FUN" And then i lost about a months worth of my life playing nothing of maplestory and then mysterously quitting it again.\n\nnow we come to the present. "WHOA, NEW MAPS?! NEW CLASSES?! EXLUSIVE SINGLE CLASSES?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!"\n\nI mean no disrespect to the new classes at all, i was just tooken aback when i first saw them. It was like the eleven year old me just took control a flipped the hell out.\n\nEven though i keep coming back to this game....I....I can't recommend it to others, no matter how hard i try too. Yeah the games charming but beyond that the game is riddled with problems.

If you are into cute graphics/sprites with feel attracted to this game. I know i was when i was like 11, still am though. Mainly because i like the "ANNNNNNNNNNNIME" feel that it's got going for it, and alright, cute looking things beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of other cute things, why not? Beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things is really satisfing to me.\n\nI've grown up with beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. Final fight, Streets of rage, King of dragons, hell even Sonic blast man II. So yeah, i really enjoyed this game and was a "MIGHTY WARRIOR OF ANIME"\n\nI got around my 2nd job advancment and then, my eleven year old mind noticed something. "HOLY FRICK I SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET THIS" and then i stopped playing for four years and got back into it with a new account because the eleven year old me was like "FRICKING LONG PASSWORDS MWHAHAHAHAHA"\n\nAnyway the now fifteen year old me blasted to level 45 in one day and he was like "Excuse me? b...but why? Last time i played this i CRIED BLOOD to get my 2nd job advancment. Now i can get to this high within one day? Jesus this game is so.....FUN" And then i lost about a months worth of my life playing nothing of maplestory and then mysterously quitting it again.\n\nnow we come to the present. "WHOA, NEW MAPS?! NEW CLASSES?! EXLUSIVE SINGLE CLASSES?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!"\n\nI mean no disrespect to the new classes at all, i was just tooken aback when i first saw them. It was like the eleven year old me just took control a flipped the hell out.\n\nEven though i keep coming back to this game....I....I can't recommend it to others, no matter how hard i try too. Yeah the games charming but beyond that the game is riddled with problems. Hackers, scammers, botters, Non-existent Gms, and hostile community.\n\nYou'd best stay away unless you want to turn into a demon....And not spend MILLIONS OF HOURS ON THIS GRIND FEST OF A GOD DAMN GAME.

For those starting now, they are limited to 3 character slots, which is abysmal compared to the 20+ classes. So you have to pay for more character slots, and until you get a bunch of classes, it is almost impossible to play late game due to the limitation of getting in game money. To get in game money, you need to be able to kill late game bosses, but to get to late game bosses, you need to have a bunch of characters. So its a catch 22. You can't reach late game if you start the game now without paying real money, which is around $50 for enough char slots.\nAnd even if you do manage to get all the character slots and make all the classes to buff your main character, getting enough dmg to solo late game content is realisticly impossible unless you pay more real money to either get in game money or items that improve preformance. One could just buy godly items in the free market, but the amount of in game money required to get those items is astronomical, thus realisticaly, unobtainable without paying. There are in game events occasionally that can make money, but a lot of the best events are past and gone, so any new players missed out on some of the best items.\ntldr;\nwithout paying a lot of money for this free game, late game is almost impossible to reach","April 22, 2015","false","987.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're pretty much required to spend at least $100 to be successful at the endgame level, and you'll spend hundreds more if you want to get there without carpal tunnel syndrome or an anyeursm. Steam only has 17 hours recorded for me but I've thrown at least 1,000 hours into this mess over the past 7 years, ever since GMS first came out.

I have played this game, not on steam, but just got it on steam because Maplestory does not work on my new laptop for some reason. This game is very grindy, but isn't that with all MMORPGs? They add new content all the time, so you'll never get truly bored of it, want a game with the nearly same elements of WoW? Well then this game is for you!

Nexon America made reaching the higher lvls a bit easier rather than grinding for weeks to only reach level 30 (Level cap is now 250.) As a person who played in the early years and currently, I honestly understand that they're upset about it, but those people need to get over it. They give the game negative reviews because they don't like change. With that being said, here is my review.\n\nA lot of reviews claim the game is Pay to win which is true to an extent however there only thing that makes the game Pay to Win is the cubing feature from the Cash Shop. For those who dont know what cubing is, it's a way to reset the stats on your equip's potential (Bonus stats) which cost 1.2k nx or $1.20 each for red cubes. However, There are cubes that don't cost any money, but drop from boss monsters or can even be crafted in game.\n\nOther people complain thats the game is pay to win because aesthetics (NX equip covers) have to be bought with real money. Most games sell aesthetics for real money (League of Legends Skins, H1Z1 clothes, CS:GO gun/knife skins) which people pay for so that isn't even an issue.\n\nWhile yes, Maplestory is a game that can be made easier for you by spending money, if you put in the time and effort to fund your character in game by bossing, farming, and utilizing the Free Market in game, you can easily enjoy the game without spending money. The only reason people complain is because they're impatient, and is that really the game's fault?\n\nWith over 30 characters to try and many different bosses to fight, Maplestory is much more promising than these reviews lead you to believe. If you don't plan to spend a lot of money on the game to fund your character, I would suggest trying characters like Demon Avenger, Aran, or Zero (Must have a level 100 character to create, but worth it.) These classes have high base damage on skills and don't require nearly as much funding to do high damage on monsters/bosses compared to other classes. They're great for first starting out in the game!\n\nYou could also play support classes like Kanna, (3rd job has a skill to increase spawn rate) Bishop, (3rd Job has +Exp Buff)  or Beast Tamer (Exp Buff in Cat Mode.) These classes are always wanted in training parties, especially high level training because of the support skills that they  provide.\n\nFor help with training, bossing, or even game knowledge, make friends and join a guild! There are hundreds of guilds in each server, you just have to find the right one for you! Also check out the Maplestory reddit and Twitch.tv streams for even more help!","September 6, 2015","true","802.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But now Maple is 50% pay to play. Plus, everything is made so easy that it's not very fun or replayable anymore... The storylines are similar and getting bland while trying to be dramatic. The classes are all overpowered and are pumped out too fast. The leveling is too easy, the combat is repetitive, the grinding is annoying, the hacking is pointless. I played this game since way before the pirates came out, back when there were only 4 classes. I enjoyed it when I was younger, but now it's not worth much of my gaming time. If you're a really casual gamer and you like simple games with super easy controls and no gaming skill required and a childish community, go for it. I mean the one positive thing it has done over the years is it's gotten cuter so you might enjoy the realxing, lgiht graphics. But in all other respects, the game has gone downhill in my opinion. Enjoy if you go for it... but you probably won't be enjoying it for too long.","June 22, 2014","false","16.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Maplestory 2 is technically a prequeal but do you really want to come back to play this game afterwards? Get the old one out of the way.\n-It was kind of a revolutionary step in time. Being one of the first platforming MMOs it deffinatly has a decent ammount of appeal.\n-Killing things is some how satisfying despite the combat system.\n-The minigames are a ton of fun and if you can make friends in game or get your friends to play then its even better.\n-It defined a point in history that encouraged internet safety as many angsty kids stole from their parents to buy ingame items. THIS IS NOT NEXONS FAULT!!! The parents should have kept a better eye on their cards, the kids shouldnt have stollen, and to be fair they could have used it on anything else online.\n\nWhy you shouldn't play maplestory:\n-The community does kinda suck.\n-Its hard to train on anything but bosses unless you are in a party.\n-The combat leaves something to be desired.\n-The cash shop will burn a whole in your wallet. (If you use it.)\n-Its kinda a waste of time\n-Good luck getting your friends to play it.\n\nPersonally I'm just here to get ready for maplestory 2","April 20, 2015","true","44.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

What I list below are the pros and cons of maplestory that I have come across and are commonly talked about. I personally play in bellocan as a bishop because I like the social aspect of chatting while I buff players so they can more effectively beat “that boss” or level up. Though it can come with a downside of party members constantly nagging you to buff/heal them, most of the time the only hard part is training alone  since bishops have one of the lowest if not lowest attack ranges of all the classes . Just below the pros and cons section I will list some common game terms to help new players and also a link that has a bigger list.\n\n\nPros:  It's free to play (ftp)\n\nThere is a lot of characters to choose from (explorer, resistance, cygnus knights, heroes, nova and sengoku so far)\n\nThere's a live market called the free market (I refer to it as the black market because the duped items you can sometimes find and the outrageous prices)\n\nYou can make a party (6 people group who share exp and can fight most bosses) or expedition (multiple parties designed for harder bosses)\n\nThere are many maps to explore. Victoria island (where most players start there journey) elnath, mu lung, nihal desert, minar forest, ludus lake, the temple of time and the "future of the maple world" to list a few.\n\nEvents happen almost monthly. Between the common 2x exp event and the less common anniversary event(s) there's all ways something happening.\n\nYou can create or join a guild.\n\nYou can, with a cash shop item, get married and gain a small boon for hunting/training/grinding with your partner.\n\nLess crowded. with 19-20 "channels" per “world” you have the option to change channel if someone is hogging a map or try out a completely new world. To make things clear each “world” is just a specific server and each “channel” is a sub-divide of that server so if you decide that you don't like a specific world because -reason(s)- then you can go to another one without worry because all events and quests are the same per world. The only major difference is the people on the world and the prices in its free market. Cons:  There are, like any game, cheaters/hackers/advertisers though its nowhere near as bas as some games or like it was during maples hay-day. No going around this one really.\n\nThe grind. It's a MMO so you would expect some grinding though depending on your class it may take a couple days or even a week of wiping out mobs just to level once. This mostly applies to those level 200-249 (250 is the current level cap) but to some extent it is also felt between 140-165\n\nPay-to-win. Though you can play without using the cash shop it becomes harder and harder as you hit the higher levels. At about 200 the map second drill hall gives about .01% meaning you need about 10 thousand kills to level once and with each level the effectiveness of the map decreases as you need more exp per level.\n\nThe "free market". Most items in there cost hundreds of millions or billions of mesos (in game currency). The only easy/cheep means to afford that kind of price tag is through breaking your TOS (terms of service)  by selling doped items, hacking, or buying mesos from a 3rd party  or, though not easy or cheep, by getting super rare items from "hard mode" bosses such as hilla or horntail or by using cash items such as gachapon.\n\nTerms  ftp: free to play. A game that you don't need to pay for in order to play and usually will include a form of cash shop to supplement the fact that the creators are not charging for the game.\n\ncs: cash shop. Usually just an abbreviation but can be used as a heads up to tell party members that you are going into the shop so they know where you disappeared to.\n\nfm: free market.\n\nsok/psok: scissors of karma/platinum scissors of karma. A cash shop item used to enable trading of high level equips\n\ndrill hall/ HoH. Drill hall and Hall of honor are maps only accessible after reaching level 160. They are located in “the future” door at the temple of time.\n\natm, btw, cya, ttfn, ttyl, idc, idk, wth: at the moment, by the way, see you later, tata for now, talk to you later, I don't care, I don't know, what the hell\n\nafk/brb: away from keyboard/be right back\n\nbf/gf: boyfriend/girlfriend\n\nbl: buddy list\n\ncc: change channel\n\neq: equipment\n\ndc or d/c: disconnect\n\nl>/lf>, b>, s>, t>: looking for, buying, selling, trading for\n\nj>, jpq, r>: joining, joining party quest, recruiting(usually for guilds, alliances or fillers for expeditions)\n\ngtg/g2g: got to go\n\nimo: in my opinion\n\nks: kill steal\n\nl/n/o: leave name and offer\n\nlol/lmao/lmfao, omg: laugh out loud/laugh my ♥♥♥ off/laugh my ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥ off, oh my god\n\nleech: to party with someone training but be afk in a “safe” spot to get party exp.\n\nnub/noob: usually someone new but can also be derogatory.\n\npc: price check usually for things in the free market\n\npls/plz: please\n\npro: professional\n\nirl/rl: in real life\n\nmega/smega: megaphone/super megaphone\n\nvent: ventrillo.

This premise of challenging gameplay where you had to grind away many days to earn the most simple goals is what originally attracted me to the game.

It's cute, charming to a degree, and was once a great way to meet great people, many many years ago. But it's a shell of what it once was, a  "pay 2 win" title of the worst kind. When you aren't in game, throwing away hundreds of dollars on NX cash so as to remain somewhat viable, you're wrestling with the game's frequent crashes and server downtime. In addition to that, hackers have been a looming problem in this game for as long as its been available, and they tend to not only disrupt the game's already struggling economy, but put you at risk for loss of valuable goods. It had gotten so bad at one point that players were pointing fingers at each other, essentially saying "You should know what you can and cannot buy!" and "Even if you got it legit, you shouldn't complain, its for the good of the server, it has to be done!".\n\nFlawed. Broken. Buggy. Filled full of unfriendly people, and is a shell of its former self. This game is a has-been.\n\nIts terrible. Avoid at all costs.

What a walk through Memory Lane.\n\nEver since I left you, and that home I was in, I wondered what would happen to my old stomping grounds.\n\n----\n\nI gave it a go.  After playing Warcraft, Rift, every Kongregate Flash game alive, League, countless Steam games, and every MMORPG that was on MMOhut.   What the hell happened here?\n\nNexon was always terrible at customer support, that was a given for a very long time.  But the product was cute and the environment fun, flirty, innocent.  You fought angry mushrooms.  How adorable was that?\n\n----\n\nThe neighborhood however turned.   The hacking community is thriving, the marketplace is literally filled with vultures preying on the uninformed, and the game's advances over time did nothing to recapture me.\n\nThe game has always been pay to win.   If you want fame and don't look good, you're not getting that fame.  Be honest with yourself, we all know this to be true.\n\n----\n\nI am going to give it a go on a stream to see how people react to it.  But I'm already thinking of scratching MapleStory Memory Lane Stream as a terrible idea.\n\n----\n\nIf you want to call this an RPG Platformer?  It has next to no plot.  Jumping quests are extremely punishing, especially during a lag spike, throw in the PVP element (hahahahahaha), and what exactly are you left with?  Cute over-sized chibi head characters.\n\nThis used to be the go to entry level MMORPG for younger players, it no longer should be.\n\nScore: 3 of 10.

I have really seen the game grown over the years, for better and for worse however it seems it has been for the worse.\nAs Nexon releases updates, they have added many new classes that outclass and overpower the originals. These new classes are usually much more flashier and stronger than the orignals, making them more popular. The new classes can often solo bosses, something that use to be impossible and defeating the purpose of teamwork.\nThrough several updates, the game has also become much too easy to level up, unlike how it use to be. Also, Nexon has made the game very pay-to-win like. Often people who have the money to spend on NX have the better equipment in game from the equipment enhancment system.\nAs the game advanced, Nexon has made many changes which altered the game drastically. One of these changes made in game world feel much more smaller than it use to be. Many and almost all of the maps have been compressed into compact versions, making traveling very different than it use to be. The game world use to be much larger and you could get lost in it and still have fun.\nFinally, Maplestory has been a host to many bugs/hacks/down time. The game has been hacked many times, often causing damage to the econonmy and forcing server rollbacks. Hackers seem to also be quite common, seeing as a hacker(s) posted the login ID's of over 50 thousand players, including myself. The also game has more than a few bugs that can affect gameplay or quests, forcing unexpected maintenances.","December 14, 2013","false","137.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Unless of course you're like me and take pleasure from watching 12-14 year olds scream and use leet/tumblr speak constantly, spouting useless trash. Honestly there is sort of alot of content for beginners, but for somebody that has already played this in the past you will notice a huge difference in gameplay. Everything is much easier, to the point that you could probably level a character all the way to about 180 (or somewhere close to that, maybe even past that) without even coming close to dying, there is no strategy, and most classes are pretty much the same besides one or two quirks and some slightly-different looking abilities. Maplestory is simply the type of game that literally takes a step back every update, In 2006 it was a classic 2d sidescrolling action platformer with a bright and quirky style, now it's pretty much a high-maintenence dolled up doppleganger of it's previous self, that being said, you can still find a decent amount of fun in this game, even if it's boring and repetitive.\n\nP.S. Some of the music in this game is incredible, particularly Ellinia's or Elluels music, I could listen to it for hours.","September 2, 2014","true","423.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The spells at high levelsa re very illustrated and the audio quality is awesome. If you have to choose between Maple Story and games like Runescape and Neopets.. go Maple. If you got money its a real tie between the great visual quality of WoW (which servers allways crash) or a smooth running quiet Maple.

A lot has improved since then, but I feel like there have been more negative changes to the game. Just recently getting back on, I found that the game is mostly p2w. I got a few characters to level 120+, but as you get further into the game you are almost forced to spend money. The game is practically built around the players that spend money upgrading their equips with cubes and maxing everything out. Also, the classes are extremely unbalanced. I was trying out the Thunder Breaker class, and I was playing with someone I met who was a Demon Avenger. We were at the same level, but his max HP was at least 8k higher than mine. He also had significantly higher damage and mobbing skills, and he told me it was his first time playing. After that I decided to make a Dark Knight, and even though it was fun, I was eventually unable to complete content that was supposed to be at my level because I wasn't funded. While I did have fun leveling from 1-100, making many new friends and completing quests as a group, I had to give the game a negative review for forcing you to spend money and not having a balance between new and old classes.","March 22, 2015","false","197.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I say this with an unbiased view simply because I don't have long term experience affecting what it is now and thus I'm not making that biased comparison. This means I'm giving this review based on the NOW -- reduces review bias/corrupting a review from a nonbiased standpoint.\n\nNow that I've said this lets get it started.\n\nI started as a Xenon and dove right into the Resistance in which the class begins to take on the persona of it's intended story line. After a few hours of play there seems to be a bigger change that kept making me quit the game in the past. This is the grind is much easier. Now I'm not sure if it's because of the current model or because the Xenon class is quite powerful for an all around class, but it is definitely much more easier to level in the game.\n\nIf you like Anime and the storyline within Anime then you will quite possibly enjoy the game simply because it has some of that similar style within its dialog -- specifically the Episodes which is a short version of titles like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online.\n\nThe only down fall I'd say the game actually has is the navigation system. Now by this I do not mean movement of the character but instead the finding of NPCs for quests that need to be completed is quite hard sometimes. I had to do some google searching to find out where the NPCs for a quest is at so I can complete/begin them.\n\nIn the end, if you can overlook the fact you level quicker in the game than years ago, and are able to tolerate the fact you may need to do some google searching on where the turn-in NPC is for a quest. Then you're going to enjoy the game so as long you don't dislike sidescroller games, and Anime. If you do dislike, then this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe graphics are the same as they always were though so no real graphical improvements unless you want to talk effects...\n\nAnyways, try the game. If you wonder whether or not the cash shop is expensive or not then I'd like to say it isn't because your money does go pretty far if you spend it wisely. Now, if you don't do cash shop then that is fine because your not really missing anything other than maybe an auto-loot pet and the chance to win some in-game money to give you a good start at earlier levels.\n","January 31, 2015","true","30.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its unique style made me try it back in 2006, thus it became my first ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. Rich 2D graphics, relaxing music, anime-style cuteness in every detail. It came a long way from being a hacker-infested grind-fest to what it is today, a rather fun game with a lot of things to do in a huge world. There is still quite a lot of grinding involved, but the EXP curve is much more relaxed now with bosses taking less time to kill, which leaves players a chance to try out different characters. Level cap is set to 250, so level-chasing never stops. The hardest part of this game is becoming rich without investing real money into it, so don't expect getting yourself top equips easily.\nAll in all, MapleStory is not without flaws, but despite its publisher's attempts to turn it into a pay-2-win kind of game it still managed to keep its charm thanks to its adorable design and unique platform-like mechanics.","September 5, 2012","true","545.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nexon is a greet company and i think Maplestory is on of there best games.","July 11, 2014","true","215.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot has improved since then, but I feel like there have been more negative changes to the game. Just recently getting back on, I found that the game is mostly p2w. I got a few characters to level 120+, but as you get further into the game you are almost forced to spend money. The game is practically built around the players that spend money upgrading their equips with cubes and maxing everything out. Also, the classes are extremely unbalanced. I was trying out the Thunder Breaker class, and I was playing with someone I met who was a Demon Avenger. We were at the same level, but his max HP was at least 8k higher than mine. He also had significantly higher damage and mobbing skills, and he told me it was his first time playing. After that I decided to make a Dark Knight, and even though it was fun, I was eventually unable to complete content that was supposed to be at my level because I wasn't funded. While I did have fun leveling from 1-100, making many new friends and completing quests as a group, I had to give the game a negative review for forcing you to spend money and not having a balance between new and old classes.","March 22, 2015","false","197.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I first start playing I pick the old Dawn Warrior as my starter class and I ended up loving it. I put alot of work and money just to make it to 120 and.. I never did. Back then leveling up was much more challenging and I'd say it's alot of fun. Now after I recently played again and create a new Hero class called "Shade"level up from 10 to 120, I said to myself"What the heck happen to the game?" I thought I was a pro, but it turned out the game was now just too easy. I even got bored of training and nowadays, trainings is just a labor you want to do.\n\nBosses are now too easy most only required 1 player doing a solo run,not even breaking a sweat.Now it's the amount of money i don't always likes, the poor amount of money after a lv.10 mob dropped is ranged from 8-20 mesos(in-game currency) while a piece of equipment lv.10 cost 1k and you might think thats easy but a lv.50 cost about 55k+.Still,it's not the money I'm complaining, it's the fun I had thats gone.I could have recommended this game but those days are over,the gameplay feels so hollow now.\n\nIf you play this game anyway, you'll regret it.\n\nP.S I know it said I play zero hours,but trust me I play it on the official website.","October 1, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to possess great patients though as the game takes a long time to level, roughly level for level with World of Warcraft. The spells at high levelsa re very illustrated and the audio quality is awesome. If you have to choose between Maple Story and games like Runescape and Neopets.. go Maple. If you got money its a real tie between the great visual quality of WoW (which servers allways crash) or a smooth running quiet Maple. I personally would pick Maple Story as it is a much more relaxed game.

Unless of course you're like me and take pleasure from watching 12-14 year olds scream and use leet/tumblr speak constantly, spouting useless trash. Honestly there is sort of alot of content for beginners, but for somebody that has already played this in the past you will notice a huge difference in gameplay. Everything is much easier, to the point that you could probably level a character all the way to about 180 (or somewhere close to that, maybe even past that) without even coming close to dying, there is no strategy, and most classes are pretty much the same besides one or two quirks and some slightly-different looking abilities. Maplestory is simply the type of game that literally takes a step back every update, In 2006 it was a classic 2d sidescrolling action platformer with a bright and quirky style, now it's pretty much a high-maintenence dolled up doppleganger of it's previous self, that being said, you can still find a decent amount of fun in this game, even if it's boring and repetitive.\n\nP.S. Some of the music in this game is incredible, particularly Ellinia's or Elluels music, I could listen to it for hours.","September 2, 2014","true","423.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have mixed feelings about post Big Bang Maplestory. While it made the game much easier and a bit of a grind fest, lots of content had been added that makes the grinding feel fun at times. Since I lasted played I've heard they added some features to encourage group play which is also good. Many people say Maplestory is pay to win and it certainly does help; however, you can still get just as far for free. Overall, I'd say Maplestory is a good game to play if you have friends and some spare time.\n\nTL;DR: Play with friends 7.5~8/10, Play without friends 6~6.5/10","December 22, 2014","true","244.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamillia/recommended/216150/","jamillia","Jamillia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamillia/","22 products in account","This game has been on Steam since 2012 I believe. Since then, Nexon has gone through countless updates, time and time again, breaking Steam MS. I was forced to play MS through the website most of the time. This was not the issue. I have been playing MS since a month out of Beta. It was the best thing to happen to me, to date. However, what really got me down was when my friends quit, or I got hacked, or if I was being ks'ed, etc. I remember when Victoria Island was the only continent and there were only 4 Adventurers and HPQ was the only pq. Everything changed after the BB patch. It became SO much easier to level up that anyone could get 120 levels within 24 hours, without 2x EXP. The game changed from being too hard to too easy, it was ridiculous. Now, though, Nexon has finally caught up to all of the demands of the Veterans and have made the game harder to level up from level 30-60 and 170-200, which are the prime levels. After many updates to nerf the OP grind fest and 24 hours max leveling, the veterans are now complaining that the game is too hard. Ha! Too easy now too hard? Pick a side and stick with it, I thought. I'm starting to agree with them though, the game has become harder than it was after the BB patch, but it's still easier than before. The major updates, like Chaos, Legends, and Jump were all very exciting, especially if you play with friends. This game is hugely based on friends. It is SO boring without friends to play with. The game actually rewards you for playing with your friends now, apparently. I used to have MS open 24 hours per day for 7 days a week, even though I wasn't there to play myself - I just wanted to have it open for when I got home. (That's kind of exaggerated; My longest time on MS was only 77 hours, after which I had dc'd).\n\nIf you were to ask me what MS is about, I couldn't tell you. There is just so much to it, you have to experience it yourself. But let me warn you. The game doesn't like new players. It feeds on the old ones, like me, who have characters over level 150 (the max being 250). I really like it though. if I were to start all over, I'd only be willing to do it with friends (and if I had the time. I basically have no time for MS anymore because of school).\n\nBack to Steam MS though. This Steam version is weird. It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't work. Many people experience trouble with the Steam version for a variety of issues: someone typed in the wrong email address, and so you can't change it; someone forgot their pin; the game doesn't load for some people; and the list goes on. My suggestion would to just play MS through the website if it doesn't work on Steam.\n\nPlease disregard the amount of hours I have played MS on Steam. 80% hours are just from me afk'ing A LOT. The other 20% of those hours are me enjoying the game with my (now-dead) friends.\n\nSteam: Jamillia\nMS: ZeroJana\nMain Class: Zero\nLevel: 199\nWorld: Broa\nFavorite Channel: 17\nLongest friend: iForgettable (aka Joanne; she was just as old as me - in terms of how long she played - before she quit)\nPreferred Character: Bishop\nAll of the classes I have ever created (in order to at least level 100):\nBishop, I/L, Pirate, DB, BW, DW, Aran, Evan, NW, Bucc, Shadower, UA Sair, BaM, NL, CS, Merc, DS, TB, Jett, Phtm, UA DK, Mihile, Kaiser, Lumi, AnB, Hayato, Kanna,  Xenon, WA, BT, DA, Zero, Eunwol\nHighest level character: 201 Luminous\n\nIf you have any questions about the game, go ahead and shoot me a question. I may not be able to help with every question, but I can try my best (I've been moderating the Steam MS forums since 2012).","December 2, 2014","true","253.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","1"

Been playing it on and off for almost a decade. As soon as you think you're done with it, it just pulls you back in with it's cartoony adorableness. I remember it having only Scania,Bera and Broa as its servers, and Maple Island, Victoria Island and Ossyria(Orbis, El Nath and Dead Mine) as it's only continents(not sure if Ludibrium was there at the time). It has drastically changed since those times because of new content and all which is great but everything looks "messy" to me now compared to the old times. Despite the mess, I still enjoy traveling the colorful world that is Maple World and listening to the nostalgic music tracks like the ones played in towns such as Ellinia and Henesys. Good times and hopefully some more to come.","January 28, 2015","true","678.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I find the graphics enjoyable, the economy fairly easy to grasp, and the "pay to win" statements quite false. I do, however have one major gripe with Maplestory, and that is that it suffers from what most free to play MMO's suffer from. The beggining of the game is extremely boring and tedious at times. From level 30 - 60 I wanted to just quit, and 90 - 100 was even worse. in between was ok, but it as well was nothing special. However after hitting fourth job at level 100, you start to see what really makes up Maplestory. You see the community working together  in PQ's and Boss expeditions, and can partake in them yourself as you become increasingly powerful. Overall I have to say that you cant really outwardly judge this game untill you have experianced the late, higher levels of this game. As for the "Pay to win" claims, they are false. While Maplestory does have a sparkly, tempting, real money shop (The Cash Shop), most of the items there have little to no effect on gameplay. In fact %95 of the Cash Shop is simply timed based equipment that give no stats and fit over your normal equips, but simply change the look of that equip. Which, if I might add, I love. The other %5 are things that actually "effect" the game and its gameplay. Out of all the items, there are really only 4 things that are important: pets, teleport rocks, pet equips, and merchants. Now, merchants are where people begin to point fingers at Nexon for making "Pay to win" games. Merchants are things you can set up in the highly populated "Free market", which is an area where players trade with each other. Merchants can be placed in the market so you dont have to sit in the Free market and spam "S> 2 handed sword for 2 million mesos" for 10 hours to sell something. You instead simply place the item in the merchant, set a price, and move on with your training. While this is not nessicary, I can see purists of "free to play" getting fustrated if they play on low populated worlds, like me. Selling things to other players to make a ton of money without a merchant is simply near impossible. However, while merchanting is the fastest way to make money, and buy yourself those godly equips, its not the only way to make money. Simply put in the effort to pick things up that other players, and monsters drop, and sell those to NPC's and you can still eventually be a maplestory billionare. The last thing that makes Maplestory worth playing is definatly the boss expeditions. Bosses are huge, difficult (For the most part), and make you feel godly for taking them down, solo, or with a group. Not to mention the pools of loot.\nAll in all absolutly give maplestory a try, if your willing to put in all you've got!","March 8, 2014","true","275.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I stopped playing MapleStory when I reached Level 200 but then again, there was a new level cap, 250. I noticed MapleStory 2 is coming out pretty soon which seems fun. I would consider to wait for MapleStory 2 instead of playing the original. But then again, MapleStory has more features since its been out for a while with big updates. Who knows, my decision is tha both of them are great either way. What's your opinion on this?\n\n7/10 - " The story is pretty interesting and really nice to keep playing like a anime but, farming, leveling and quests are really difficult for players that aren't stable for long boringness.

It's most likely the most pay-to-win game you will ever play, and it has even degenerated into a hack-to-win game instead of less because of the decreasing value of even the most essential drops despite of their increasing rarity. Even in-game upgrade items not coming from anything related to its cash shop aren't worth it anymore.\n\nBack then, we didn't have a gambling-based upgrade feature called the "Potential system" plus it has always taken nothing but your own patience and a single pay-to-win item called the "Regular Shop Permit" in which you only had to spend $2 and it's always been taking you far. First of all, the value of most items has deflated whilst the hardest-to-obtain items were not only expensive but also obtainable only from the hardest boss battles (something that only people who spend thousands of dollars in this game will likely not going to achieve). Second of all, the values of most drops were slowly decreasing even further along with an increasing amount of funded players obtaining drops from the hardest bosses, making the $2 Shop Permit even less powerful. Now valuable drops are either rare in-game, or only obtainable from the Cash Shop.\n\nNot only the game itself has degenerated into pay-to-win/hack-to-win, but also the vibrant community itself has turned into a more hostile environment where it's no longer an athletic competition, but instead more a mix of a bodybuilding and weightlifting competition with a twist of gambling as its performance-enhancing element. In other words, skill doesn't matter as much as I usually found this game before. Also, even though the game's features were being adjusted to favor the more matured demographic, even 22-year-olds don't act like their age and are harassing in their most serious ways possible, such as starting drama and reporting each other. It's a complete nightmare come home!\n\nAlso, it is important to note the game's also imbalanced in the aspect where ever since an update called "Unleashed", you cannot hit anywhere near maximum damage even if you spend $2500 in this game, and this is more pronounced if you opt for high hits-per-second classes such as Kaiser and Dawn Warrior, or you cannot solo the hardest bosses despite you've spent that much for it. It does do a disservice to even a funded player, unless once in a blue moon you win a jackpot on a casino or something. Just to know how imbalanced the classes are, I spend $700 to fund a Hero (which is a warrior) whilst I could get about the same results by spending nothing on MS but the $2 Permit with less endgame gears or potentials. To make things even worse, they promised fifth job once and they said they'll not going to open fifth job any time soon, and they never did.\n\nNow, the only two things that are saving MapleStory are its original 2D gameplay that not even Elsword or WonderKing Online can compete with the original thing, in addition to Nexon's over-the-top events and MapleStory's vibrant community that they always have had. I wonder if this is any longer going to be the case, because I doubt so. I doubt it even more because of the nerfs that happened during the updates named "Unleashed" and "Shining Star" which made it even harder to gather up merchandise for your Shop Permit without relying on random reward features such as "Gachapon Tickets", "Marvel Machine", or "Premium Surprise Style Boxes", because of the amount of nerfs and HP increases pertaining to Party Quests, training, and boss runs. If they continue to nerf the game even further, you can kiss goodbye to this pastime you've loved too much.\n\nAs far as I know, this is about one of the few games I ever know where the community is as bad the the game itself.

I too am an older player in Maplestory having played since I believe 2006, on and off. I agree with most reviewers when they say this game has a completely different look then what it started as. Too me, that's great. I remember the hours I put into this game when it first came out and now I'm sure that is going to quadruple here shortly. The game is a blast. It is free to play. It has great visuals and a vast amount of items and clothes so no two maple story characters look like.

Man, this game is pretty.. lame honestly. The game itself is fine, but how it runs is atrocious. It has issues with certain headsets, keyboards, etc. Still hasn't been fixed.. and I've seen stuff about it since 2010.\n\nOverall, the game just would freeze every 4-5 seconds for about half a second for me, even without the set headset plugged in, and I couldn't figure out why. I've tried playing without any usb's plugged in, still nothing. I've tried messing with about everything on the game and still freezes every 5-ish seconds. For whatever reason the devs still have not fixed the issues with the game when you use those headsets/keyboards/mice after several years so I cannot suggest this game. Like, 6 years and you still don't solve an issue like that? lmao...\n\nMy issue with the game doesn't seem to be with the headsets/etc. It just freezes constantly, and honestly its stupid. Well, if I want to play a game I guess I can go to every other game and it would work perfectly fine however this one doesn't. I can't recommend this when there are better 2d/fighter/brawler games out there. Especially when this one has had issues for 6 years not being resolved, then it just not working for me.

I never thought I'd see this game again.\n\nWhere do I start? I played this game since I was very little, when I was about 6 or 7. Every Saturday morning, I'd wake up extra early, start up the family computer, and run this game. And oh, the hours of fun I'd have. Killing the Orange Mushrooms, only to be killed in a matter of seconds by the pesky Green ones(MapleStory veterans will know). Celebrating every level up as if it were my birthday. Challenging the Jr. Balrog at the end of the SleepyWood caves, and him killing me with one shot. All of those are now qualities of MapleStory that people no longer feel(unless it's on a private server that runs the old MapleStory), which, you know, sucks. Now, at level 10, you can one-shot every Mushroom(except Mushmom). Leveling up is made way too easy, and Jr. Balrog might as well just be a dungeon for Level 40ish characters. The game changed. And the change was good... for a while. Eventually, the continous growth eventually cummulated to the Big Bang. That's when things got... weird. The game just became... different. That was when the very atmosphere of the game changed for the worst. That's when the game accomplishments just became... unsatisfying. As someone who played this in Beta, who downloaded the game at the actual Nexon site, this game did... go down in quality. While my opinion may differ from others, this is just mine. A couple of months after the Big Bang, this game, once one of the best MMORPG's of all time, just became another game of "Press a couple of buttons, kill everything, loot, repeat". A "Grindfest", if you will.\n\nIn conclusion, this game was good. It probably is still good, and I just didn't play it. However, It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Unlike the good ol' days, this game gets boring after a couple hours. However, I will say that those couple of hours will be one of the best gaming experiences you'll ever have. Or so I think.\n\n\nTL;DR: Good game, gets boring in a couple hours, but still try it.","December 17, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I went from level 1 to level 50 in the span of 3 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snuggup/recommended/216150/","Snuggup","Snuggup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snuggup/","88 products in account","I started playing Maplestory years ago. There were three classes, with a fourth not entirely finished yet. Speed ahead, the number is probably 30 or more, and what has the game got to show for it? About 5GB's, apparently. Maplestory is a seemingly simple game when it comes to design, however, this is an understatement in magnitudes. The amount of detail put into the tiniest of things is fairly impressive, and the overall composition is balanced, visually at the least. To quantify it, I'd give it a 9 of 10, as it has a very certain style that it has kept to for many years, improving it with each update.\nThe game, the game, you are probably criping about. The game is... Well, bland, if you let it be. The original Maplestory would take upward of hundreds of hours to gain only a few number of levels, often resulting in the player gaining access to OTHER ways of burning hundreds and hundreds of hours. My first account was around level 70 before it was lost to the stupidity of youth. It took some two years of leisure play, that as I now look back at, was sickening. The Maplestory today has enacted a story-line for the player to follow, one that of course, is entirely optional, but is largely beneficial to the player seeking to access everything in a timely manner. From the start to 70 again, it took roughly 12-24 hours in total play time. Some quests would level the player massively, and this made for a huge jump in playability. Yet... in doing this it crippled the need to explore a lot of the lower-level maps. You find yourself swamping back and forth in the same few areas that match your level range, seeing the same monsters over and over until the quest and level set is complete.\n\nWhy play this, you ask?\nWhen you can get a set of people to join you, it's a genuinely remember-able experience. Bosses in this game are NOT easy to take alone, and you'll often need to coordinate in a huge number of ways. Thankfully, each class HAS A PLACE. The game has a balance between each class that makes it so when the individual is party-searching, they aren't met with any EXTREME class bias. Aside from the healer being chosen first. But say you are alone, what then is there to amuse you? WELL! Discovering all this constantly expanding world has to offer. The quests are endless, and if you don't fancy doing them, just kill things! Each monster (after a certain level) has a different set of attacks that you'll need to account for. You'll be hard-pressed to find a situation where you can just spam one attack infinitely (not to say there aren't opportunities). On this, each class has a moderate-to-diverse range of available moves that will require a balance to use in a successful manner. Hotkeys a plenty, the user will likely stick between 5-6 moves they prefer, and use them as the situation calls need. This game can be played ANY TIME, there is rarely a situation where you are FORCED to stay on or else feel some emotional, internal struggle, when you leave it behind. It's simple to pick up... sorta?\n\nIn recent years, the game has been working on adding and building on the game... without much improving what is there? They've added personality traits that influence your ability, POTENTIAL for weapons that influence them in some way or another, and yet, it looks clunky and visually, confusing. When I joined, it was a simple set of 5-6 buttons and the buttons to operate these menus as appropriate. Now, you'll be bombarded with tabs on tabs of flashing icons that all HOPE to enhance your playing experience. Usually... it just leaves you confused. The game has made strides in playability, enjoyableness, and the content that is available to all without the need to throw money at the screen. Yet, it still has a while to go. To again, quantify it, I'd give it an 8 of 10, as what it has added has enriched the content, by being oblivious to mechanical things that desperately need improvement.\n\nI'd say, play the game, give it a few hours, and you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week out of the sheer quantity within it you'll have to discover.\n","August 25, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
