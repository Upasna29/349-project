Either that or somehow make the sound so it is physically based and bounces around the room more. It felt distracting just coming out of one ear if I was facing perpendicular to the piano player. I suppose you could fake physically based audio by simply placing a few lower volume sound sources around at various places.\n\nBut thanks for making this! It's better than a lot of paid experiences out there.","June 4","true","0.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I'm not much for museums but if art was presented to me in this way I would likely never forget any of it, and explore every available square inch possible. This is also something even my parents, who don't game at all, can enjoy fully!","June 4","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You'll see what I mean.\n\nOther than that, 10/10. Show your friends.","June 4","true","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yet another "wow" Vive experience for me.  If you have any appreciation for art then this free title is absolutely worth spending some time with.\n\nAs the title says, it is a tribute to artist Vincent Van Gogh and I'd liken it to the fabulous Studio Ghibli (My Neighbor Totoro) tribute that was made by "Fire Panda" (unfortunately that one has since been pulled by copywright owners).\n\nI am going to put this on my 'come check out the Vive' rotation for friends and family that are curious but not necessarily technology enthusiasts.\n\nThank you to the author for spending the time to make this, and thank you Valve for keeping your development platform open and accessible.","June 3","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In gearVR you have a touch button that allows you to walk forward but on steam you warp around the room and it really breaks immersion. Its amazing to be able to crouch and look around things on the vive but warpping really takes you out of the experience by breaking the continuity. Also, a custom controller other than the standard vive one would be great.\n\nOtherwise, I love it!!!","June 4","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It's awe inspiring to see Van Gogh looking back at me as I look at me through his eyes and ponder if he saw this coming before it ever happened. This short experience acheives the creation of relateable characters through which we can ponder time and conscious experience. Bravo...and free!","June 5","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
