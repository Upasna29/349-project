Far from it in fact.\n\nI'm trying to think of some pro's and cons, but the only pros I can think of are that it is cheap (I got it for £1.33), the actual animation of the 'Alien?' was pretty good.....I guess, annddd it ran smoothly on my piece of S*** Laptop! But I'm scraping from the bottom of the barrel here.\n\nAs far as cons go I'll just say:\n\n- Unoriginal\n- No settings option, so I couldn't change the resolution or anything (Unless somehow I missed it!)\n- Not scary at all\n- Some of the gameplay mechanics don't really make sense.\n- Not entertaining\n- Either the time goes too slow, or the power drains too quickly\n\nI did a short let's play video of it if you fancy seeing a bit of gameplay.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487896314\n\nYeah, I suck at reviews, but I think what I'm trying to say is: Just play FNAF and don't waste your time and money on this, unless you wanna laugh at it.","July 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","63","73","3","0"

Devoid of anything new, lacking in artistry, backwards in content, singularly lacking in fun. An example of the worst in "me too"-type game design.\n\nMy experience in this game is sadly documented in this video, because I've made it my goal of covering all new horror games:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=490678359\n\nThis is the first time I've truly regretted that decision.","July 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","36","41","9","0"

A simple game built around, simple functions required to keep the numerous animatronics at bay. Of course the back story, and the ingame methods used can be anything but simple in the juggle to stay alive. Love them or hate them the FNAF series are the pinnacle in their genre.\n\nSo where does Naninights fit in? Well the entry is £1.99. It covers the very basics of a point and click horror game. There is a threat, cameras and at least 3 ways to stop that threat. You would think that its all that is required to give Scott nightmares? Well no.. you see where Scott has mastered and understood what makes FNAF what it is. Maxim Moore clearly doesn't understand whats required or hasn't the ablitiy to put it in place.\n\nFor a start off, the game launches only in windowed mode. The night lasts forever more or less. Only one threat, which I'll add doesn't add any horror to the title. The bare min of rooms and cameras added, unclear instructions, poor translations (or getting Mary's sex wrong), Testube Mary disappears somewhere while still viewing the camera and just overall a game that feels dull and put together with little thought.","July 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","39","47","5","0"

Well too bad Naninights is a terrible FNAF clone with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nPROS:\n\n-none\n\nCONS:\n\n-horrible graphics, it looks very low res and blurry\n\n-you're stuck in windowed mode with a terrible Windows-style menu tab on top\n\n-barebones soundtrack\n\n-laughable sound effect\n\n-the enemy is not menacing at all, in fact it looks and sounds silly and its jumpscare is cringeworthy\n\n-broken gameplay punishes you if you play as you're supposed to, the third level also seems to be totally random in how and when you die\n\n-little to no story\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551030044\n\nNaninights is a mess, there's no way around it. The graphics and sound are horribly bad and being forced to play in a small borderless window is something I honestly have no words for, just look at the image that goes with this review.\n\nThe gameplay is also terrible, you're supposed to be looking for the kid through cameras and use the according objects to make it go away, sadly it doesn't work. This is because the enemy will sometimes switch rooms in a matter of seconds leaving you with no time to react: this is made worse by the fact that certain things, like the mirror, are bugged and show the enemy even when it has already left.\n\nI finally managed to beat the first two levels by simply doing nothing, waiting for the indicator that tells you Naninights is near to show up and quickly activating two defences while spamming the mirror up and down (cause keeping it up doesn't work, another bug). This dull exercise worked until I reached the third level where the mirror stopped working: it basically either didn't stop the kid or just showed its face making me lose tons of mind power: is this purposefully broken to make the game "hard" or did they just not bother to test it? You decide.\n\nNaninights is an embarassing "thing" and I can't help but think it's been cobbled together in a few minutes by people with no shame just to ride the FNAF hype train: it's not worth your time, not even for a laugh, just watch a video on Youtube.","November 9, 2015","false","2.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

It's not horrible, but in my opinion, it's nowhere near good.\n\nI've beaten all phases, and have beaten all phases on Hard++ mode.  I still don't get it.\n\n{ Gameplay }\n- I beat the first two parts of the game by closing the gate and lighting the cube whenever I saw the warning graphic.  I ended each of these parts with just about 100% in each category.\n- I beat the third part of the game by staring at him the ENTIRE NIGHT with the mirror with the gate open and the cube off.  Hard+ and Hard++ mode, you can do the same thing if you see him up close in the hallway.  None of this is explained.\n- Hard++ mode seems really random, but after beating it, you just hear the alarm go off and you are taken back to the main menu.  Absolutely nothing special for winning this due to a bug in the .ini save file.  If you transfer the info written to the wrong file to the correct file, you see a new background image...but I have no clue what it means.\n\n{ Presentation & Bugs }\n- The game has tons of spelling and grammatical errors (see 'How to Play' for the ultimate example -- e.g. "keep you Mind", "greater then", "keep your gate close", "Naninight need to make 3 steps", "for the rest levels").\n- There is a flicker on the home screen that makes it look like a graphical bug, even if it's not.\n- The "jumpscare" noise is more hilarious than anything else.  It sounds like a one-take random growl noise.\n- The "A.L.I.F.A." mask is never explained, and the story is not drawn out to any satisfying level.\n- The font on the Hard+ and Hard++ menu is all messed up...way too big, and overlaps the text you need to see.\n- The About screen has a big blank text box...no content.  Just the author up top.  It's also a pop-up window, which isn't characteristic for any of the rest of the presentation.\n- Instructions in-game are also incorrect.  The cube won't stop "Naninight" unless he is in the "bedroom"/crib room...but there's really no advantage in looking at the "camera" or whatever until Hard++ mode, when the alert for Naninight is disabled.\n- The music also cuts out and never loops on the How to Play page, which is very odd.  Loud with no resolution, then nothing.\n- Volume is deafening on some of the piano riffs on side menus, but gameplay isn't nearly as loud.\n- Hard+ mode is labeled as "Standard difficulty" under the text that says "Hard+"...\n- Beating Hard++ mode all the way through gets you NOTHING.  This is due to a save file error.  The main game saves to Enjoy (file), but the other modes save to Enjoy.ini.  The background is based on Enjoy, but it never gets the updated data to put the actual ending graphic.  You literally get nothing special due to that bug.\n- Fun fact: You can hear the alarm noise and still die.\n\n{ vs. FNAF }\n- At least Naninights doesn't mess up your screen resolution by defaulting incorrectly in CTF application settings...but this is due to the restriction set in-game.  It's a simple fix for FNAF, but it was never actually resolved properly.  However, there is no title bar, so you can't move the Naninights window.  Even more, clicking on Fullscreen doesn't work at all in Naninights.\n- Music still plays when the window isn't in focus, which is a good thing.  FNAF?  Change to another window and you don't get any audio.\n- Disabling Music doesn't Disable Music.\n- Story in Naninights isn't nearly as endearing as FNAF, and story frankly isn't explained in any real depth in Naninights.  Why does lighting a cube stop a kid with a mask on from...growling in your face?  Does he kill you?  Does he just make you laugh and thus, you lose since you can't laugh at your job?  It's never explained.  A.L.I.F.A. mask..what even?  Also -- what does "Naninight" mean, and why is this kid nicknamed that?  Why does the kid wear the mask?","September 27, 2015","false","6.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/386320/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","We’re reaching that time of year where, once again, the ghosts, ghouls and vampires come out of the woodwork and begin to walk the streets in search of brains, blood and ungodly amounts of sweets. With Hallow’s Eve soon to be upon us all I was eager to find a suitably scary game in my Steam library, to get me in a spooky mood. It was slim pickings except the FEAR games, Five Nights at Freddy’s and a little-known game called “Naninights“. Having never played Naninights before, I loaded it up and boy was I terrified by what I saw.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Naninights is Five Nights at Freddy’s. Well, it would be if Five Nights at Freddy’s was a complete piece of ♥♥♥♥ing dog ♥♥♥♥.\n\nInstead of Freddy and his band of animatronic bad guys, Naninights gives us some sort of failed infant experiment, wearing a gas mask. Spooky ….(!)\n\nThe basic premise of the game is the same as Freddy: keep an eye on the other corridors and rooms in the building, and manage your energy reserves effectively so that you can make it through until morning. Failing to keep your eye on the titular “Nananight” results in the usual jump-scare and the game spits you straight back on to the menu screen. Yet, even with the barest of feature sets, Naninights’ developer still manages, somehow, to ♥♥♥♥ things up even further.\n\nGraphically, the game looks beyond dated, sound effects are on an endless loop and there are zero options whatsoever – not even for resolution. Naninights is the kind of game you’d expect a group of executives to greenlight at a business meeting, I imagine the meeting went something along the lines of:\n\nCorporate guy:\n\n“I hear jump-scares are all the rage these days, can we make something quick to take advantage of that?”\n\nDeveloper:\n\n“We could, but Scott Cawthon has that market pretty much cornered. He’s published 8 Five Nights at Freddy’s games since Monday”\n\nCorporate guy:\n\n“Well tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The market wants jump-scares and we’re getting in on that action. Make me a clone of these Five Nights at Freddy’s games you mentioned. If you could, give it a really stupid name, try to make it look much worse, be really boring to play and be a generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience for everybody. Oh, and have it on Steam by the end of the day. Thanks!”\n\nDeveloper:\n\n“Uhh..”\n\n\nOnly, there was no corporate meeting. Naninights is the ‘effort’ of a single developer; a cynical ploy to line their pockets and to dupe unsuspecting gamers out of their hard-earned cash. That’s the scariest part of all this.\n\nI’m not offended by Naninight‘s attempts to clone Freddy, rather I am offended by the sheer lack of effort put into it by its developer – and that the people at Black Shell Media could publish this tripe with a straight face.\n\nThis game is a product of the “me-too” generation, where no marketplace can be too overcrowded. It’s a quick cash-in farted out in a couple of days and then ♥♥♥♥ out on the Steam storefront. For the love of God, don’t buy it.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed my review, why not visit my website?\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/10/5-nights-of-development-if-that-naninights/","October 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ok, I give up, I don't know why I liked it! It's garbage but I got sнit for free! And if you can do the same, I recommend  Naninights	. Just... do not pay money for it...","November 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","2"

Stuck at windowed mode\n2. Crap graphics\n3. Poor explanation of the game mechanics\n4. Poor presentation\n5. Feels rushed\n\nIs this an early access game, a flash game, or was it simply made to insult players' taste?","November 26, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The "scares" make you giggle and you feel like a baby sitter running around yelling, "come back Jimmy! You forgot to wear pants!" I bought this game because of the FNAF clone idea and the fact that it has such poor reviews/sounded funny. It did not disapoint (on sale) as my little brother is content with the FNAF clone idea and Im just sitting here giggling at the "jump scares." If its on sale and you're bored out of your mind and feel like foolinf around with a kind of so bad its funny game, this is the game to get lol","May 31","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
