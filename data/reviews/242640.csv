It's also a damn fine pure stealth game. If you lose stealth you can recover by parrying and trying to hide again, but we all know if you get seen you are supposed to reload your last save. That's how you play a stealth game.","June 1, 2015","true","30.7"," 1,006 of 1,095 people (92%) found this review helpful 656 people found this review funny","92","006","1","656","25"

(Even the ending is satisfying) I can’t go too far into the story without spoiling it, but basically you play as a goblin assassin/rogue that has forgotten why he is on a mission to steal the heart of the amber tree. You follow him through his journey learning his past and his true self. The stealth gameplay is amazingly polished and any true stealth fan will love it, but the combat for when you get caught is very clunky. (You will want to be playing stealth throughout the whole game) The first 15 or so minutes (the tutorial portion) is very unforgiving and turned me off of the game, but I powered through and it got 100 times better once the tutorial is over. Most of the in game levels/areas have tons of different ways to traverse the map and you can replay all of the missions. Another really cool thing in Styx: Master of Shadows is the skill system. You can basically level what skills you use the most and these dramatically changes the way you play the game.\n\nPros\nAmazing story and lore\nGreat stealth elements\nGreat level design\nNice Parkour/climbing\nGreat voice over\nAwesome ending\nCutscene art style is awesome\n\n\n\nCons\nClunky combat\nA few issues with gameplay (nothing game breaking or too annoying)\nThe beginning is really unforgiving\nA few clipping issues\n\n\n\nConclusion\nStyx: Master of Shadows is a great stealth game with tons of different features that make this game worth playing. Unfortunately, the combat when you get caught is very clunky, but this doesn’t ruin the game. It actually make the player fight the stealthiest way around. I highly recommend Styx: Master of Shadows to anyone who loves stealth games or just wants an awesome story with a challenge.\n\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPi4gHdYmmQ\n\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/242640/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","Well, long story short, this is a hardcore stealth game. Would seriously only recommend to those who like the old school stealth games, or are used to bumping up the difficulty settings in the newer ones. It's not a bad game...no, not at all. Just that anyone who's going to be playing this for anything other than stealth will have to endure a mightily frustrating time! I consider myself a semi-hardcore (if there's such a thing even) stealth gamer and I found it just a tad frustrating on Hard difficulty. No complaints though...I'm gonna man up!\n\nAnyways, the biggest pro is that the levels are huge (like really huge...it took me just under 2.5 hours to complete the intro alone!). Lots of routes to take, and there's lots of verticality to it. There are ample number of collectibles to find, and potions to collect and conjure more magic tricks. And you are encouraged to not kill anyone, or not be detected, or steal all loot by unlocking rewards at the end of levels. AI seems to be decent too, if not unforgiving!\n\nThe stealth elements are standard from what you'd get in Thief for example. Guards can see you when you are in light and in their line of sight. They can hear you (even tripping over pails and broomsticks). And you can hide in the shadows, where a tattoo on your body will glow orange. However, you cannot abuse the shadows as much as Thief. Even when you think you are in a dark area, if a guard comes too close, he will smell you out.\n\nStory is so-so for me. Too early to read too much into it. Visuals are just OK as well. Some textures look like they're brought right in from 1998 though. But on the plus side, I get to max out this game on my meager GTX 750 and get 60fps most of the time at 1080p. So yeah, it's not at all graphically demanding. Voice acting is mediocre as well. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. The same goes for the soundtrack/sound effects.\n\nThe controls are a little finicky and you will need to spend time in the early game to get used to them. Certain jumping actions are not properly explained in the tutorial. But aside from the jumping controls, the movement controls of Styx otherwise are solid.\n\nIn closing, the game feels like the most brutal stealth game I've played, and I can assure you I've played just about all of them released in the past 5 years. Still it should be a good challenge, and I assume as I progress and get used to the gameplay more, the experience will only get better.","October 7, 2014","true","23.2"," 496 of 558 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","496","558","4","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/si3nss/recommended/242640/","si3nss","El Science","http://steamcommunity.com/id/si3nss/","100 products in account","Has the classic vibe of a stealth game, massive maps, and an alright story behind it all.\n\nPros:\n\n\nLots of potential with maps.\n\nI've a mere 4 hours and I have only completed the first mission on "Goblin" difficulty (which is the hardest of the difficulties. The maps are incredibly large. full of many possibilities of your sucess or demise; be it the convinient tunnel, heavy objecting hanging above a guard, malfunctioning machines, gob in a box, the common ledge, the miscalculation of one's eyes, and much more.\n\nA game for nitpicking.\n\nThere's quite a handful of enemies on each map, you can keep to the shadows and aim directly to the objective, or you could just run aimlessly assassinating every living thing you can find. While I could have skipped a good 90% of enemies without killing them, I simply could not pass on finding and assassinating EVERYTHING. l got a lot more of this game trying to clear an entire map over simply running towards the next loading screen.\n\nSmooth Graphics.\n\nCyanide certainly knows how to make a good optimized game with some nice graphics. It's no next gen, but I'm sure many of us care for gameplay over graphics these days. I'd say I ran at a smooth 60 FPS at the highest settings, with very little tearing. I'm using GeForce GTX 560 Ti, non overclocked with 12 RAM.\n\nGood Handling.\n\nControlling Styx is quite seamless with a gaming mouse. The amount of his abilities make a gaming mouse quite useful, but for those that don't own such luxuries can change any keybind through the options. I attempted playing it with a 360 controller, and I would say I much prefer Mouse+Keyboard combo due to easy access of key binds. Let's just say Styx isn't the best at grabbing ledges sometimes...\n\nIt's better than Thief.\n\nThat poor poor franchise.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe AI\n\nThis is a stealth game, so I constantly had many "Really?" moments. The enemy AI is no different from any other stealth game and pretty much comes in two ways: the first being "Guard notices you, you run to hide, guard can't find you despite being a few inches away with a very obvious glowing orange tattoo" or the second which is "Guard notices you, you engage, dodge, parry, counter, dead guard, move on". I noticed I went through a lot of the second way through my first playthrough on Hard. To combat the non-stealth feeling and linear gameplay, I simply switched the difficulty to the highest which is "Goblin". I would not recommend any other difficulty if you truly want the feel of a "stealth game". Getting one shot can be quite annoying, but hey, what kind of "Master of Shadows" would get caught in the act of murder?\n\nBugs like a Bethesda Game.\n\nI have only experienced a few bugs, but none that made me reload. Any bugs that I did encounter were in a "Bethesda" way. Floating bodies, launching dead bodies after a kill, stretching rag dolls, teleportation when assassinating, and minor clipping. None were game breaking, and is clearly something all games these days face. I'm sure patches are to come.\n\nA "Bioshock Infinite" feeling.\n\nThose familiar with Bioshock Infinite might get a retaste with Styx's abilities. While Styx has several abilities, you might find yourself only using a few of them in most situations that aren't forcing you to use them.\n\n\n\nOverall opinion:\n\nIt's definately worth the $30, but I HIGHLY recommend you play on the highest difficulty to get the real stealth feeling. You can easily make the game last a few hours if you simply run through the enemy and go for the objective; make the most of it by slaughtering everyone in the area and collecting relics/coins. Abuse the amber! Amber powers can easily be forgotten if you don't use them often, they can be quite helpful on many maps! Exploration is important. There will always be more than one way to kill an enemy. Sometimes there's ways of clearing an entire map by the push of buttons...Keep your amber vision lit... Oh and, I hope your virgin ears are ready for the constant f#cks and sh#ts both Styx and NPCs spray out like a rainy day.\n\nI give Styx: Master of Shadows an 8/10.","October 9, 2014","true","53.8"," 235 of 261 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","235","261","5","0"

It has all of the typical stealth game properties in abundance, but it lacks any novel ideas.  It is a solid game, but certainly could have benefitted from some extra features and more finely tuned controls.  That said, if you are a fan of third-person adventure/stealth games, and you are looking for a new game to beat, then you will probably enjoy this.  But it is unlikely to become one of your favorite games ever.\n\nThe best aspects of the game, in my opinion, are the game-world and the atmosphere.  A good job was done in creating an unstable, militaristic city in the steampunk style.  The narrative was mildly interesting, albeit confusing.  Even after beating the game, I’m still not entirely sure I “get” everything that happened in the story.  The voice acting was also subpar and cringe-worthy at times, but ultimately it was tolerable.\n\nThe gameplay itself was fun.  You really need to use stealth to get by, and there are usually multiple paths to choose from in order to accomplish your goal in a stealthy fashion.  You definitely want to avoid combat, especially in later levels.   The controls are mostly good and fluid; however, there are some situations where the controls get a little clunky… particularly while climbing.  Throughout your playthrough you will probably encounter a handful of situations where the controls screw you over.  If you make use of quicksaves, this will only amount to a minor annoyance, if at all.  If you are someone who buys into the “save-scumming” nonsense, and want to play using only checkpoints, then this could prove to be significantly more frustrating for you.\n\nThere are a handful of abilities at your disposal to facilitate your stealthy progress, and you can increase the efficacy of those abilities by using skill points to upgrade them.  Most of the abilities are available from the start, and you don’t get access to that many new abilities by leveling up; so the incentive to earn skill points dwindles midway through the game, when you already have all of the effective ones.  This may not be the case if you are after the achievement for unlocking every ability, but doing so will require multiple replays of each level and this probably won’t appeal to most gamers.\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows is a fun game.  It has some flaws and it is lacking in some areas, but ultimately I can look back and honestly say I enjoyed the experience quite a bit.  I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre; it is worth a playthrough for anyone seeking a new stealth game to beat.  Just be aware that it isn’t perfect.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 21, 2015","true","15.3"," 228 of 272 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","228","272","7","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/santashelper/recommended/242640/","santashelper","Santas Helper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/santashelper/","352 products in account","After 72 hours I can still say this game is AMAZING if you love hardcore stealth. While some people gripe about the combat system in place I find it a refreshing pace when I rarely DO mess up and have to defend myself. I do the little parry dance/kill minigame or dodge/roll thrown knife and/or escape and see if I can successfully hide away then I load a prior save and do it again the right way... without being detected... EVER. I personally enjoy finding how to kill EVERY SINGLE enemy on a map without ever being detected. As such, it has kept me playing this game for a long time. You have to use some pretty clever tactics when you start coming across multiple knight patrols (immune to takedowns) and more sinister things I won't spoil for you. While a mission will take me 4-6 hours to beat in this manner of killing every single enemy without being detected, as well as finding all the loot, it is a very enjoyable time. Then after I beat it like that I redo it in the handy 'mission replay' feature as a speed + mercy + shadow run. So I guess I can vouch for all styles of play, both the fast paced and the ridiculously slow, super careful, pace. This game is well polished all around and worth the price tag even at full value though it tends to go on sale often. The freedom of movement is something to be really thankful for after seeing recent quote unquote stealth games have a push button to win method of movement. If you like to engage your enemies head on, this is NOT the game for you. This is a stealth title as they were designed decades ago, don't get caught or you lose and hit your quickload key. Story is top notch, voice acting is superb as well (and only 5 people did all the voices). Game runs extremely well and looks/sounds/feels fantastic. I use a keyboard and mouse to play and it feels very natural and fluid. Having full control over what happens in your movement is very important here. There is no "I win" button for ledge traversing and there are no defined paths... if you miss a jump, it is your own fault. Make use of your shift (slow walk) and drop/lift/jump keys to do all you need exactly how you need to do it. This is something many early reviewers did not take time to realize and as a result many people think the controls are bad when in fact they are very intuitive and responsive. You just need to be smart enough to utilize them properly. If you lack patience, you likely won't enjoy this. The original Thief games (not the remake from a few years ago) are something to compare this game's approach to. If you enjoyed those you are likely the target audience for this game. On that note, Age 30-45 gamers who grew up playing unforgiving titles that challenged you and didn't hold your hand should find this a nice nostalgic feel compared to the current trends. Well I sure dragged on and on... but:\n\nTL;DR This game is amazing! WELL worth the price tag and then some. If it goes on sale, grab it. AAA title at a B price. You can't go wrong with that, unless of course you don't like this type of game. To each their own though!","December 17, 2014","true","70.9"," 119 of 132 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","119","132","3","0"

I didn't break my controller....completely, the left trigger is kinda sticking now, must be where it hit the wall ^^\n\nLike any good stealth game, I wind up screaming at my television frequently when I do something stupid or when the game does something stupid and I have to reload a save that's like 15 minutes back, because I'm too stupid to abuse the save system like you're supposed to do for a game like this.\n\nNormally I'll join in the crowd and do a no-kill run, but since there wasn't an achievement for that, I decided overtly that I'm going to kill.....everyone.\nYou know that scene in the movie Leon, where Gary Oldman screams "EVERRRYYYYYONEEE!!!"\nIf there's a guy, he's dead.\nIf there's an elf, dead.\nOther goblins, dead.\nWeird bug things, dead.\nGary Busey...not in this game, but he'd be dead too.\n\nIts actually been a fun challenge, to murder every single living thing on a level without ever getting caught.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charza/recommended/242640/","charza","-=ORC_Charza=-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charza/","129 products in account","Once upon a time (in 1998) there was a game called Thief.\nThief was one of the first games  that actually had stealth as a main gameplay mechanic.\nIn the same year we were also treated with a game called "Metal Gear Solid" on Playstation (1).\n\nStyx reminds me of those games in many respects, and you know what, thats a good thing.\n\nSo what is this all about ??\nSo where are we ?\nRemember the game "Of Orcs and Men" ?\nWell, we are in the exact same world and we find ourselves in the labyrinthian Atrium of Akenash.\nA behemoth of a tower that was build by the technocratic human empire to encapsulate the magical Tree of Life.\n\nIn this world humanity is an imperial race with a knack for technology.\nTheir world views however are fascistic in nature.\nHumanity considers itself superior to all other races, and Elves, Orcs and Goblins are all persecuted or enslaved.\n\nWe see this world through the eyes of Styx, a cynical Goblin, who is after the Tree of Life and the devine powers it is said to have.\n\nStyx however is a Goblin, which means he is small, and not very bulky, so don't expect a warhammer wielding tank type character here.\nStyx however has other tricks up his sleeve, and this is where the game gets interesting.\n\nGameplay\nSince we already established that Styx isn't a bulky fighter, he has to think of other ways to defeat his enemies.\nNow Styx happens to be very agile, meaning he can use the environment to his advantage, and boy, does this game offer you a lot of options in this regard !\nWith the Atrium of Akenash being riddled with all kinds of hallways, tunnels, hidden passages you can approach every single situation in at least 3 different ways.\nIf you start throwing Styx's more magical abilities into the mix, things get even more interesting.\nThis is where the game shines.\n\nA well planned takedown feels rewarding and using your magical abilities and the environment is fun.\nBeing a successful pickpocket is also good fun.\n\nStyx also evolves throughout the course of the game as several new skills are learned in different skill trees.\nThese RPG elements add another layer to the gameplay, and you can build Styx in many different ways, suiting your playstyle.\nThis means that my Styx characterbuild can be very different from yours, each with its own pros or cons.\n\nYour inventory is very limited. This means you really have to take care with using your resources, since they can't always be replenished.\nHow refreshing !\n\nCombat is hard in this game.\nBasically all of your opponents are bigger, well armed and stronger than you.\nSo don't expect fancy swordplay and enemies waiting in line for you to hack them down like in Assassins Creed.\n\nStyx is lethal to the unsuspecting opponent, and has a good chance in a one on one combat situation, but facing more than one opponent at the same time, is doomed to fail.\n\nThe combat system relies on well timed parry moves and lethal stabs you can perform after a successful parry.\nIt takes a little time to get the hang of it, but once you understand the mechanic it will feel good.\nDirect combat however is best avoided and the game is rather unforgiving, so don't expect to charge into a room, and kill 20 opponents with only a few strikes.\nCombat is not the focus of this game, and it's all the better for it.\n\nPlatforming is also part of the experience.\nAs already mentioned before, Styx has to use the environment to his advantage.\nThis means that you can jump and climb on many things, hang on ledges, and use your platform gusto to get around the place.\nThe controls are very responsive, and if you connect a gamepad to your PC, the controls will soon be 2nd nature to you.\nWhat I particularly liked was the fact that the climbing and jumping actually requires skill.\n\nStyx can't just climb everywhere, and is not necessarily auto snapped to a surface. So getting around also requires you to use your brain and plan ahead. This feels strangely refreshing in a gaming landscape where platforming has become an easy access semi automatic thing.\n\nGraphics and sound design\nSo how is the game in term of graphics and sound design ?\nWell in terms of graphics the game is above average and the art design is simply great.\nEnvironments look beautiful and characters have a very unique feel to them.\nThe style can be described as comicy, yet things are still grounded in reality.\nThe world itself is largely medieval with a hint of steampunk.  Iseria is a well realized world with a lot of dark secrets, and the artstyle reflects this perfectly.\n\nTechnically the game runs smooth and it has some incredible lighting.\nThe charactermodels and textures could have benefited from some extra detail, yet the graphics do not disappoint.\nThe game's sound as stated before is great.\nEspecially the little details stand out, like the many different creaky noises a wooden floor can make.\nSound design is important in a stealth game, and Styx doen't disappoint.\nVoiceacting is overall very good.\nSome lines are delivered a little bland , and sometimes you will notice that certain bits of dialog are recycled, yet most of it is done very well.\nFor a game that was made under a very tight budget, it has some very nice production values, and it makes me wonder what this team is capable of when having a very high budget.\n\nConclusion\nSo this brings us to my conclusion.\nStyx Master of Shadow is a very well made stealth RPG game that will bring you to a very different medieval fantasy world.\nIn terms of gameplay the game was made following the rules written in the "old school era".\nThat means that the game doesn't hold your hand, and is less accessible.\nIronically a game like this shows me the many things wrong with modern day game design.\nWhile many modern games look amazing, they simply lack any bit of soul or substance.\nThis game made me truly feel like a shadow assassin. More than any Assassins Creed game ever did !\n\nIt might not be everyones cup of tea, but if you like a good challenge I would certainly recommend you to buy this game.\nSurprisingly good !","March 9, 2015","true","20.2"," 103 of 112 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","103","112","3","4"

A gorgeously conceived world, sprawling open world levels and intuitive gameplay make this one of the best Stealth titles in recent memory.\n\nCampaign: Developed by Cyanide Studios and released in late-2014, the game puts you in the role of a treacherous, conniving Goblin named Styx – a skilled assassin and mercenary-for-hire – who has descended on the fortress city of Akenash to steal its most prized possession. Each of the games 7 levels (each with ~4 sub-sections) take you across a beautifully rendered medieval city featuring stunning backdrops and large open world levels with both indoor and outdoor elements - all of which are bathed in bright disarming light or cloaked in shadow - and the player is faced with navigating a path filled with patrolling soldiers, jittery townsfolk, monstrous Orc's, traps, spills and other surprises at every turn.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: In considering hardcore Stealth titles such as this, it’s important to understand upfront that you will not fly through levels taking on all adversaries – on the contrary, the game punishes direct confrontation most severely, and a careful, considered approach is almost always required. Gameplay is smooth and fluid, and level design is particularly noteworthy with each section built like a large 3D-puzzle – in length and breadth (similar to other games) but also in height – featuring a truly refreshing use of vertical scale,  with levels frequently allowing for free-running Parkour-like movement across 5-10 storey’s. This provides for a multitude of ways to approach each section - slipping by completely un-noticed or taking everyone out – building in lots of replayability to the title as well. To aid in your quest, you can unlock and equip Styx with an ever expanding arsenal of Weapons (Throwing Knives, Poisons, Dagger’s), Magic (to include Cloaking and Cloning powers), a variety of Takedown / Finishing moves and various Armor options. Great graphics and a brooding background score only serve to heighten an overall immersive experience, while collectible Seals, Relics and Achievements for Speed, Mercy and Silent runs, round out a robust title.\n\nFlaws: For all it does so so right, the game is unfortunately not without its flaws – poor textures and voice-acting are small annoyances exacerbated by gameplay issues like clumsy combat mechanics and occasionally wonky camera angles. Perhaps most damning for a platform-heavy Stealth game is inconsistent ‘ledge/grappling’ sensitivity and loose K&M controls, making the odds of crashing the aforementioned 10 storey’s to your death ever more likely – ‘Save Early, Save Often’ is the watchword here. While none of the above are game-breaking issues, they betray a lack of exacting standards, and certainly detract from the overall experience.\n\n‘Styx: Master of Shadows’ is an ambitious and at times, difficult game – but also the finest interpretation of a pure Stealth game in recent memory. Your success hinges on careful observation, opportunistic timing, use of shadows and the dark arts of distraction and trickery, and most of all, bleeding composure, to navigate a visually stunning world. While rough around the edges in parts technically, its flaws are certainly not game-breaking, and Stealth fans will largely be having too much fun to care. An instant Classic for Stealth fans, and generally Well Recommended! – Rated (8.4/10)\n\n\nWant More Recommendations?\nMake sure to click the 'Follow' button on our Curator Page (Link Attached) to get the latest reviews updated directly onto your Activity Feed.

Graphics No the graphics are not great. The general scenery I found to be appealing, but when you look a little closer you will notice how this games graphics really are a let-down. Faces are jus.... well let’s say they could be improved.\nBut when did a games graphics become more important than gameplay when considering buying a game?\n\n2.Game mechanics The biggest issue people seem to have with this is ledge detection, I personally haven't missed any (well placed) jumps due to this on my end. I don't really see much of an issue with regard to ledges myself, sure Styx enjoys hovering in mid-air just off the edge of a ledge but that can be forgiven. (You can't however hang-crawl from one ledge to another...)\nOther mechanics issues tend to be with shadowy spots being difficult to determine, which is true it isn't easy to tell whether Styx is hidden from view judging on whether it seems he is in a shadowy spot or not, BUT he does have a tattoo on his arm which lights up when he IS hidden (very easy to see and make use of)\n\n\n3.Poor controls This seems to be causing people to miss jumps and plummet to their deaths, are they perhaps just not good at the game? I couldn't say, what I can say is that (again) I haven’t had any real issues with this, but then again I have only played the game with a (Xbox 360) controller so I don't have any real experience using a keyboard to control Styx.\n\n4.The map It's terrible, it will NOT help you don’t use it.\nThat being said, it encourages the player to explore the areas a little more.\nAlthough some navigational input via a map that actually helped would be nice.\n\n5.The Combat system is not fun it isn’t engaging and it leaves Styx utterly useless at fighting... well pretty much anything. THIS IS A HARDCORE STEALTH GAME! If you're using the combat system you're doing it wrong\n\nSide Notes I read that someone found it frustrating that there was no way to distract enemies.\nAll I have to say to this is THERE IS A WAY. Styx is able to make a noise (default is hold 'x' on the keyboard or 'down' on a gamepad) this noise will lure guards to the source of the notice. "Great" you say thinking how useful it's going to be luring all guards to your current location. But fear not! Your clone can also make a noise, in the same way Styx does. So move your clone around the other side of enemies press 'x' and boom guards walk towards the noise and out of your way.\n\nTHE PROS\n-It's got an interesting story\n-The Gameplay is absolutely wonderful (personal opinion here)\n-It's difficult! Which leads to much planning and enjoyment of your success\n-Huge maps, with multiple ways of navigating and completing levels\n-STEALTH STEALTH STEALTH! This is a stealth game, it relies heavily on stealth, and stealth is needed to accomplish anything! So if you're a fan of stealth games this is for you\n\nOne last thing Quicksaving IS your friend do not be scared to use it\n","October 17, 2014","true","7.9"," 120 of 143 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","120","143","8","5"

It centers around Styx, the first Goblin, on a quest to discover and understand his origin...while at the same time amassing a huge fortune. While Styx is a good game, there are a number of small issues that hinder it from being the best it can be.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nYou control Styx, a small-statured Goblin, and guide him through an enormous miles-high structure called the Tower of Akenash, where humans and elves protect the World Tree --the source of a magical substance called Amber. This tree is the ticket to Styx understanding his past, as in the Amber lies the memories of all living things.\n\nBeing a stealth game, the game has a very heavy enphasis on stealth. In fact the game discourages any other approach but stealth, due to how the other mechanics are setup. Styx is at a huge disadvantage is direct combat. We'll go over this shortly. The majority of the game you will be sneaking around as silently as possible, positioning yourself behind unsuspecting foes for a stealth kill. When you do so, you can either kill them, or stealth kill them. The difference is a stealth kill is a quiet kill. Here is where one of the small issues I mentioned occurs: even if you perform a stealth kill, sometimes nearby enemies will hear you anyway and come to investigate, which results in you engaging in a melee battle. This presents yet another issue: combat is very stiff and relies entirely on precise button presses to parry enemy attacks, until you are able to perform a kill. Nothing in this game is more frustrating than the combat. At times you can be engaged with 2 or more foes, but you can only focus on one at a time. This means while you are parrying one foe's attacks, the other two are still wailing on you, dealing massive damage very rapidly. The only way to eliminate this problem is to avoid direct combat entirely and stick to the stealth approach.\n\nUnfortunately, even stealth has it's issues. Even while sneaking and staying in the shadows, enemies can sometimes see and hear Styx, resulting in an aforementioned direct confrontation. This is where making use of your skills and abilities can really help out. Styx has access to an ability called Amber Vision, which is like the Detective Mode from Batman or the Hitman senses. It allows you to see any foes and later items in a wide range. Careful use of Amber Vision can help you avoid direct fights. Another skill Styx can use is the ability to create clones of himself. Once created, you can take control of them, moving them out into the light as a distraction to help setup kills. It can also be used to cross certain types of terrain and obstacles.\n\nDarkness is Styx's greatest ally, and to that end you are able to extinguish torches you find throughout the tower to give Styx a shadow to hide in. When completely hidden, a tattoo-like mark on Styx's arm will glow orange. Another issue presents itself here, as even when completely hidden enemies can still detect you. Another trick up Styx's sleeve is the ability to throw balls of sand to extinguish torches from a distance. Doing so is useful, but risks detection. Styx can only carry so many balls of sand, as well as a limited amount of other items. These items are throwing knives, vials of life, and vials of amber. Your special abilities cost amber, which the vials restore small amounts of. Vials of life restore roughly half of Styx's health. Both vials can be found throughout the game world, sitting on shelves and tables out in the open...or pickpocketed from foes. If a foe is carrying an item you can steal, you will see it on their belt. Once you kill them, the item on their belt disappears, so if you want the item make sure you pick it from your target first!\n\nAs you complete objectives, Styx earns skill points. In between missions you can spend these points on a number of different passives which increase Styx's stealth skills and even grant him bonuses. For example, one skill dampens the noise of landing from falling from heights, while others allow him to carry more knives and vials. Some even allow him to detect if enemies will sense him before they actually do. The best thing about these skill points is that they can be unspent and redistributed as many times as you wish. This allows you to customize Styx to an extent in preparation for each mission. Oh, missions can be replayed, so you can try new approaches to each situation, or go back and try to find those hidden collectible coins in each area.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nStyx isn't a slouch in the looks department, but it does lack some detail here and there. It's very dark and shadowy game. Styx himself is very well designed, and looks very good. Enemies are equally detailed. The environments can lack variety at times, but are still pretty detailed in their own right. For the first big portion of the game you will be seeing a lot of stone and wood designs. Amber vision is mostly orange, which can get pretty bright and irritating. This is my only complaint about the graphics, really. There is a small amount of clipping here and there, but it's not a big deal.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nStyx has a very light soundtrack, as the majority of what you hear is the environment around you. This is very important too, as there are some audio clues as to enemy behaviors and locations. You can hear them walking around, studying ancient scripts, or eating. Listening to the world around you is one of the keys to success. Combat and stealth kills are really satisfying when you eliminate a target. Snapping a man's neck with a stealth kill is oddly satifying as well. Pardon me, that sounded terrible...\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI was able to run Styx surprisingly well. It is a very detailed game that uses a large amount of resources at times, but it ran between 30-50 FPS at all times. The only time the framerate dropped was during combat with multiple targets. I experienced a little bit of slowdown here and there, but it was never during a crucial moment or while sneaking around. I don't know what caused it. No random crashes ever occurred for me either, thankfully. The gam ehas full controller support, and is the recommended way to play the game. Mouse and keyboard controls can also be used, and is pretty comfortable considering.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nStyx is a good stealth game, but it's many small issues hold it back from being an excellent game. I'm not saying it's terrible, but it's still a game worth checking out. Once you figure out the mechanics and learn the timing for parrying attacks (which may take awhile...) it can be an enjoyable experience for fans of the stealth genre. I thereby recommend it, but only when on sale or when heavily discounted. If a sequel is ever made I can only hope the developers learned from this experience, and that the next game is a lot better.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IPdNiXsLf8\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nSpecial thanks to Liroku for the gift!\nThank you!\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","September 1, 2015","true","11.9"," 125 of 152 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","125","152","10","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979875574/recommended/242640/","76561197979875574","Fantoche Dreemur","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979875574/","1020 products in account","Styx Master of Shadows is a third person sneaker, which feels a good deal like the first two thief games in which there is a living world, guards, civilians, elves and such have their own agendas and every map feels "functional".\n\nOne thing to note is that the game itself seems to be made to be played on the highest difficulty, "Goblin", which is just above "hard".  The combat system feels completely out of place, when you have to fight someone, you're locked in a sort of duel where you need to parry attacks and strike when you see an opening.  This is the main reason why the Goblin difficulty feels much more playable than any levels below that.  You're a weak little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pretty much everyone except scribes and librarians can kill you in one hit.  See that guy just repairing a wall?  if he grabs you, he'll splatter your head on the floor.  That nonchalant guard?  Slit your throat before you can say "♥♥♥♥ you".  With that said, there is something amazingly fun in picking off targets one by one, stuffing them in cupboards or chests, like removing the layers from an onion.  There are a few more skill points to be gained in each level if you do NOT kill anyone but it's very minimal.\n\nThe story shines like a diamond with several plot twists you won't see coming and you keep playing just to see what will happen next.  The whole thing happens in a world where orcs exist but goblins don't, so think of it as a sort of genesis for goblins story.\n\nYou're also never treated with kiddie gloves.  All your special powers are available from the start with their respective upgrades available for purchase.  There are six skill trees with 4 skills each plus a unique tree that unlocks depending on which trees you've completed.  These range from the semi useful, like having better clones to the workhorse skill "killing from a corner or below" which you'll use pretty much the whole game..  to the incredibly useful and almost overpowered skill that lets you see throught walls AND all collectibles in a map.  Using that skill is very much like Batman's detective vision from the Arkham series but more balanced since you pay it with mana and it lasts for about 10 seconds only.  Fortunately, the mana always regenerates to a minimum so you can always use the amber vision and cloning if you wait a bit.\n\nThe music is fantastic and the voice over is convincing, if lacking a bit of diversity.  Still, considering how large the maps are and how you're expected to take your time, it's forgivable to an extend.  No complains about the graphics, the whole game looks great and runs with no slowdowns at all even with several enemies at once.\n\nThe game's mechanism also means that your devious plans all might work.  When you mess up, you never feel it's because the game's cheating or it's too hard, it feels like it's your fault and you think of ways to get throught situations.  You'll grow to see some parts like puzzles, where you examine patrol routes, try to distract people to eliminate them one by one.  When you'll get to the part with elves in the late game, you'll need to rethink your strategies since being silent and sneaky isn't enough anymore as they SMELL you.  Fortunately elves are far, far less numerous than human targets even in a dedicated elven map like the last two so you will learn how to deal with them.\n\nNow for the problems.  In my opinion, there is one major one that I tried hard to forgive but it left a sour taste in my mouth.  Map recycling.  The whole game takes place in a single tower so I understand why it happens and when you revisit a map, you get why you do it... but it does feel pretty cheap.  There are two maps where you play throught them THREE times and there's an especially annoying mission where you go from an aqueduct, a jail, a laboratory then a high security prison... only to do all these in reverse at the start of the other mission!  There are new objectives for each but you feel like that second part could have been done by narration.\n\nAnother problem, which some gamers won't find annoying but I do have a bit of ADD regarding collectibles.  Each mission has 3-4 maps each, so about 24 maps, each will take 1-2 hours depending on how quickly you move throught them.  Each map has ten tokens scattered all over the place, some easy to find, others maddeningly well hidden.  You get a small bit of skill points if you gather ALL tokens in a mission (so either 30 or 40) plus one relic.  If you miss a single one, you get nothing.  The payoff, 20 skill points, feel pointless since you get about 250sp per mission if you do secondary objectives.  I did enjoy gathering the tokens but man, is it an all or nothing deal.  If you don't care about a few skill points ignore them but otherwise, get busy.  There is a skill that makes the whole thing immensely easier, the one that lets you see tokens and enemies all over the map so some people might want to wait until they get that one and then return to previously finished maps to gather them all.\n\nPlus :\n-Solid story\n-Amazingly fun to be a sneaky little goblin\n-Living environment\n-Large maps with multiple paths to get where you want\n-You can puke in people's food and water to poison them\n\nCons :\n-Very little payoff to gather all tokens\n-Map are recycled a LOT\n\nVerdict?  8/10.  Recommended to any fantasy fan and a must have for fans of Hitman and Thief.","February 24, 2015","true","47.3"," 82 of 91 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","82","91","5","4"

They aren't fantastic, not by any means. I've seen quite a bit of texture pop-in, and a lot of grainy, ugly textures throughout. However, when the graphics work, they work. The outside bits are incredible, and watching the ships floating around this huge, open castle is pretty awesome. However, sadly, most of the game keeps you held up inside the castle, seeing the same damn white tiles over and over and over again. The character models are also fairly rubbish, other than Styx, the protagonist. Texture pop-in is rampant, their clothes clip through their bodies, and they just look a bit washed out and ugly. Styx, however, looks great. His glowing orange tattoo is very nice looking (it's glowing when you're in the dark, neutral when you're in the light - a cool way of telling the player whether they can be easily seen).\n\n5/10 - serviceable\n\nControls\nSooo, the controls may be another downside, but not as bad as the graphics. While waddling around on the ground the game works just fine. You can move around the shadows nicely, and navigating under desks and tables is easy to do. However, platforming can be a bit tricky. For the most part, it'll work fine - until you need to jump to a ledge. The ledge detection is occasionally terrible, causing Styx to plummet to his death or clumsily crash right in front of a guard. This sort of hit-or-miss platforming wouldn't be too bad if the game didn't rely on Styx platforming so often. You will, many a times, find yourself enjoying climbing around guards, stealthily navigating the side of a building until - whoops, the game didn't detect that ledge, now you're dead.\n\n6/10 - Good enough\n\nGameplay\nThis is where the game shines and for all intents and purposes makes up for its other shortcomings. Gameplay is more than solid, it's great. It's very much a stealth game, the focus is not at all on combat and you will almost never find yourself directly confronting guards. Other than when you're playing on Goblin (the game's hardest difficulty, which makes getting caught too close to gaurds an instant death - they pick you up and stab you), the game's combat is basically a quick time event. You parry the guard's attacks until you find an opening, where you promptly stab them in the gut. This isn't a great system, but luckily you won't be seeing it often or ever. The core of the game involves platforming around, sneaking, and stealing. You crawl under tables, up walls, and hide in shadows in order to avoid guards. Styx also has a special ability which allows the player to create clones, become invisible, or use a sort of super vision similar to the one used in the Arkham series. Clones allow you to distract guards, pull levers, and in some cases dispatch enemies. Stealth allows you to become completely invisible for a short time, though you still make sound. The super vision (forgot what it was called) allows you to spot guards, items, and places to climb on. All of these really help the game shine, and it truly feels like and old school stealth game, especially when playing on Goblin mode (recommended).\n\n9/10 - Fantastic\n\nStory\nI won't linger on this too much, as I haven't reached the ending. So far it's pretty good, and a nice way of progressing the game. It's your basic dark fantasy universe, and it's used well.\n\n-/10 - Will be updated in the future\n\nTL;DR\n\nAll in all, you'll probably enjoy this game. It definitely refers back to the old school days of stealth gaming and I really appreciate that. It does have some pretty gnarly graphics, but that can be excused as they are plenty good enough to still enjoy. Its biggest issue is poor platforming controls, which will hopefully be fixed in the future. The gameplay is fantastic, and makes this game one of my favorites of the year. The story, so far, is good.\n\nFinal score\n8/10 - Great\n\n(My final score is normally based off an average of the other scores, which would have put this game at a 6.6, rounded to 7. However, since I haven't finished the story, I gave it an extra point - as the story is good so far).","October 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 121 of 151 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","121","151","0","0"

I’ve not been disappointed.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWN5n1lSwWo\n\nLevel design is such that it does feel like you usually have multiple ways to reach your objective. There are also areas of the map which are completely out-of-the-way of your objective which you can explore, making the areas seem more realistic.\n\nStyx controls smoothly for the most part. Moving along cover, jumping across ledges and up walls is smooth. There are some curiosities though, such as being unable to hang-crawl from one ledge to an adjacent one. For the most part though, it feels natural.\n\nGuard AI is my biggest gripe. Guards have some of the classic stealth game problems. For example, guards will find a dead body, go into alert, check the immediate area, but then give up fairly quickly and go back to what they were doing before. “Guard Dominos” is in full effect; kill one guard, leave him where another guard will find it. While he’s investigating the body, double back and stab the new guard. Rinse, repeat. However, they will check under tables, in chests, etc., if they are alerted so it’s nice to see that those areas aren’t magical portals to duck into when being spotted as they could be in other games.\n\nPlotting out how to get through an area undetected and studying the patrols of guards is still an important, rewarding aspect of Styx. If you get caught by one guard on all but the hardest difficulty, you’ll probably be fine as long as you don’t alert others. 2 or more and you’re going to need to run for it… and that’s how it should be. On Goblin difficulty, getting into melee range of an alerted enemy is instant death.\n\nIf you are a stealth fan at all, I highly recommend picking this one up. Given there aren’t many games in this genre, this one is too fun to pass up and at $30 it’s a steal (no pun intended.)","October 7, 2014","true","6.9"," 160 of 210 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","160","210","0","1"

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect, but it entertained me really well for 40 hours and did so for a price of 22€. Even if I had payed the full 30€, I would not regret it. Let me tell you why.\n\nThere aren't many stealth games around these days and I really miss them. Styx reminded me of how fun they used to be. The gameplay mechanics work really well in this game and there are some that I haven't seen in any other stealth game, such as cloning yourself and booby trapping your clone in a chest or just use it as a distraction for guards. You can even become invisible for short time spans. These things cost you amber which is basically something like mana. You can replenish it with vials you can find during the missions or pickpocket from some of the guards. But those are rare, so don't worry, you can't just walk around the whole level invisibly.\n\nThe skill system is also a good thing. It motivated me to get all the insignias and do all the side objectives in the missions, since you get bonus skill points for doing so. With them you can unlock helpful skills such as aerial kills or the aforementioned booby trapping of your clone. You can go for stealthy skills if you like to sneak through the missions or, if you're more into clearing out whole areas, you can invest in more aggressive skills. Every type of player should be able to find some skills they think are cool.\n\nThere are also different types of enemies, such as your ordinary guard, crossbowmen, knights, which have plate armor and can only be killed through poisoning or dropping chandeliers on their head, and some more that I won't spoil now. Every enemy has its weak spots and is in his way fun to kill or sneak around.\n\nWhat I think is really outstanding in Styx is the environment. The level design is just awesome. There are many routes to your destination and you almost always have a choice of how to get there. In synergy with the mostly good graphics (at least good enough for me) and the great lighting effects it often led to me just stopping and looking at the beautiful environments. It's just eye candy to sneak around in the shadows avoiding the bright sun rays falling in a room through a window or climbing a vertical wall in the sunset.\n\nSadly the fun exploring the levels ends with the exact half of the game. After that you will be back tracked through many levels you have already seen. In most cases this isn't that bad, because there are other guards on other positions with other routes and the levels are still awesome with all the alternative routes. But I have to say that there were one or two areas that just didn't work properly backwards, which was sometimes a little annoying. Nevertheless the back tracking wasn't so bad, although I gladly would have payed 5 or 10 more bucks to just see some more of this really great level design.\n\nThe story line was okay for me. It had its suprises and pulled me through the missions and that's all I was expecting from it. The plot is told through voice acting and comic like cutscenes with mostly static pictures of which some were reused a little too often, but that's perfectly fine thinking of the price for the title. The voice acting was good and I personally liked the fact that although the story is set in a fantasy world, the characters swear a lot and talk more like you would expect from real world rogues. That added a special feeling to it and I liked it.\n\nAs you can see I have played for 40 hours to get every insignia and every objective. Insignias are badges you get after missions for each of the following things: Staying hidden, not killing anyone, finishing the mission in a given time and collecting all 10 coins in each area of the mission (each mission has 4 areas). In the first run of each mission I killed a lot of guards, stayed hidden, gathered all the coins and did every side objective. The second run was always a speed run without killing any guards and for the fun of it also staying hidden, ignoring everything else. I would estimate that if you just play through the missions doing the side objectives and aren't perfectionistic about being seen or not, you could play through this game in 15 to 20 hours. But where's the fun in that? ;)\n\nOverall I loved this game and though it has its flaws the whole experience is just great, because every mechanic and every element come together to form a really fun time of stealth gameplay. And since it's worth even the full 30€ in my opinion, I recommend this game to every gamer who enjoys stealth games.","October 20, 2014","true","40.0"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","75","86","2","0"

Styx came to show how to make a decent stealth game.\n\nStyx is a goblin,trying to reach his object in a place filled with humans, some cockroaches that can hear you breath,orcs that will eat you for breakfast and elves that wants to tell you high with the pointed side of the spear. And as goblin you are nt one of the best fighters so you have to be sneaky. In you arsenal you have a dagger,throwing knives, vials(health,amber(aka mana),acid) and some skills(clone,amber vision,invisibility) .\n\nCombat and Stealth\n\nYour main weapon is the shadows. One of your arms will glow when you are hidden in the shadows.Still if a human comes to close he can notice you even if you arent moving. So you have to be careful. Covering near wall/corner can hide you even better but best place to hide are chests,wardrobes,vases and under tables/beds/desks .\nYou can kill humans from behind either in an instant while they scream,or can choke them till they pass out. Then you have to get rid of the bodies,throwing them off a ledge,hide in chests/wardrobes or pouring acid on them. If someone spots the body you will be in a lot of trouble.\nEven though its a stealth game,if you get caugh in close with guard you will end up in a duel from which you cant escape and ends with one of you death. But have in mind, everybody else can attack you while in combat so it often ends up with you death.Now if its 1v1 then you have to parry number of attacks before you are able to kill the guard.\n\nControls\n\nFor a good stealth game you need fine controls... Sadly Styx got some control issues. But most if not all of them are around ledges. If you want to drop to a ledge there is a high chance that you will fail for most part. Or if you try to grab the ledge without climbing so you can do a hanging kill? Too bad,you will fail too.\n\nAI\nAI depends on the difficulty though issues with it may be the same on all difficulties. Like guard is looking towards you but cant notice you. Or get stuck in spot or 2 guards after clash in each other enter in a loop to circle the same spot. My advice.. quick save often else you will have a hard time\n\nLevel Design\n\nLevels are big enough to give you some freedom and small enough to not get you confused and lost. Still their are places  to the main object that there is just one way to reach it but its max 1 per level. On the other hand the game will make you pass twice through all levels.. Once from Mission 1 to 3 and then from Mission 4 to 7(though for 4-7 there are some additions).So be ready to visit the levels twice with just the change of direction.\n\nStory\n\nStory is linear,there isnt any decisions for you to make so only reason to replay the game is just to unlock achievments.\n\nOverall\nA great game for Stealth fans.Rough on the edges.

Fortunately, you’ve got a few tricks up your sleeve as Styx eventually learns to throw knives, spawn clones, pull off a series of different kills and even turn (briefly) invisible. Ultimately, Styx is a lot of fun but it’s clearly a game that’s geared towards true stealth fans.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, Styx is nothing like other modern “stealth” games like Assassin’s Creed, where stealth is essentially optional and you can choose to play the game as if you’re Rambo if you want. If you don’t hide in Styx, you die. Simple as that. And die you will. I played through the game on normal and I died literally hundreds of times. Auto saves are uncommon, so you need to get in the habit of saving after every guard slain or corner passed unnoticed.\n\nWhile I found Styx to be a lot of fun, the difficulty and uncompromising nature of the game will put a lot of people off. If we’re going to go off Steam achievements - less than half of players even finish Styx’s prologue, and a mere 8% make it all the way through the game. You’ve been warned. I’ll also admit that there are times in the game when the developers make it a challenge to a point that doesn’t even make sense. For example, there a plenty of areas where the beetles and humans interact freely - why don’t they attack one another? Wouldn’t that add another layer of depth to the game? All that being said, if you love classic stealth games like Thief, look no further than Styx for your next purchase!","May 3","true","25.4"," 46 of 47 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","46","47","2","0"

(recommended when it is supposed to be even more difficult [you will cry and rage])\n\nShadow: No guard had seen me in the whole game! [recommended if you want to become frustrated]\n\nLevel: 7, one of which is made up of 3-5 smaller levels.\n\n\nStory  ~  5/10 Points\n\nI don't want to talk to much about the Story, because its not the best. The Story is really strange. You will get thrown into the story, not really knowing why and what is the heart of it. But later in the game it will all make sense. But in my opinion the story is a little bit too shallow.\n\nGameplay ~ 8/10 Points\n\nClimbing: It's nothing very special in the climbing actions, we can see this in so much other games too. Like ac. And sometimes it has the same problems! You want to drop, and he will climb and will stop in front of a guard. You jump on a hook and he will not grab it.\n\nSkills: You have so much Skills but in my opinion nothing overpowered. I think the best Skill is the invisibility Skill but its not time related its movement related. You can stand 10h on the same position but you only can run up to 10-15 meters. You can spawn mirror images and control them to kill, activate or simply take the whole attention to them. You have the Amber Vision which allows you to see people behind walls and its highlight items and interactive elements.\n\nItems: You have 5 Items. 3 Elixiere and 2 Throw items. The first Elixiere recovers health. The second the very important Amber (what you need to use your skills!). With the third you can get rid of a dead body. The two throw items are sand to put out the torches, and the knives that kill fast, silent and over distance.\n\nAI: The guards moving on prepared ways, so you can watch them, and make your plans. Sometimes there are trigger events and a guard will come straight to your position. In this situation it's important to know whats around you, tables, hooks or maybe a big jar. If there is nothing, you only can hide using your invisibility skill, but if they step on you they instantly know you are here. The Elves are the hardest ones they can feel your presence (over, behind, below, right, left, behind walls,jars, and in front of them ... horrible!!!). But think not the guards are stupid guys... they nearly see everything and interact really good together to find you in the area.\n\nLevel Design ~ 10/10\nAwesome. You can't say anything else. I think it's impossible to find every single way to the goal! The Levels are sooo big and there are so many ways to get to the destination you want. The ways also related to your kind of playing it, because if you don't want to kill somebody you may should search sometimes for an other way.\n\n\nConclusion  ~  26/30 Points  (22+4 Points because its sooooo hard, and give me that awesome feeling after finisch)\n\nFirst of all, this game is a m*********** b******, its hard like hell.\nIts not like some other stealth games... in this game you will probably find your master!\nSometimes the AI moves nearly perfect. You sit there under a table and ask yourself "how in the ******* world, i supposed to get out of here just again!"\n\nI think everybody plays this game like this: RUN! (5m) ok done, nobody seen me! (SAAVEEEEE!!!!) RUN! (3m) nobody seen me ? ok (SAAVEEEEE!!!) ... RUN->SAVE->RUN->SAVE...\n\nYour Save is full in the first hour of the game! =D\n\nBUT this is what i like! I like hard games because you feel sooo much better if you bring it to an end.\nThis game is for people their are looking for a challenge and want to prove something for himself. You have to like yourself to torment.\nThis game is not for people, who starting to cry when the game gets hard. You maybe must accept that you will probably never finish it.\n\n\n=) ok thats it. i hope it will help you!","November 25, 2015","true","27.3"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","50","56","10","6"

It's works perfectly with mouse and keyboard, the only thing required for this game is a teeny tiny bit of motor skills.\n\nI'm fairly certain that the people complaining about the controls have played entirely too much Assassins Creed and are used to pressing a single button, running towards a wall and letting your character climb huge buildings by himself. Styx has a much more Jump'n'Runn-y feel to it that requires precise jumps, those however are ALWAYS possible, as long as you aim correctly. It has nothing to do with bad controls, just with bad players.\n\nApart from that, this game is a true stealth game, meaning the combat is (luckily) virtually nonexistant. The highest difficulty is absolutely challenging and incredibly fun, the rewarding feeling of beating a level without killing anyone/being seen and grabbing all the collectibles and relic is amazing.\n\nA definite recommendation for any fan of classic stealth games, this is pretty much the only game I have ever played to come close to the original 'Theif' series.","October 9, 2014","true","13.7"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","62","77","0","1"

I am about 8 hours in as of writing this and have yet to have been disapointed with any aspect of the game. If you are a fan of games like the Theif series or Dishonoured you will enjoy this. The game can be very challenging, requiring you to be aware of your surroundings at all times as well as making sure your timing is perfect with patrols and what not. You can use your abilities to create intersting and helpful combinations such as using your clone to lure gaurds underneath a crate which can then be quickly unfastened by you to kill the gaurds making it look like an accident. The story is fairly good and Styx is a very likeable witty sarcastic goblin that entertains you with his thoughts.\n\nThe game feels a bit like a hybrid between Thief and Dishonoured mixed due to the various abilities you have access to. If you enjoy all the fancy kills in Dishonoured such as drop assassinations, theres those plus more. If you enjoy skulking in the shadows avoiding gaurds and putting out torches to help you sneak around you are able to do that with the hlp of balls of sand you can replenish throughout the maps as well as moving up to them to put them out. The different skill paths create very different experiences for you such as the kill line which enables things like cover kills and aerial kills, while the clone line enhances your clones abilties to distract and harrass enemies. The AI can be tricked using various things in the environment as well as your abilities, while some say the AI is bad I have found it functions just fine and very rarely if at all messes up aside from the ocasional getting stuck on something for a moment.\n\nAlot of reviewers haver some reason given this a low score due to issues they had with the climbing and ledge detection which is an integral part of the game. I however have had zero issues with this and found that as long as you are directly facing what your are jumping for and your jump is timed right, you will never miss a ledge grab.\n\nAll in all I would highly recomend this game especialy since the price is so low, I would give it a solid 8.5, it's a hell of a lot better than alot of the big games that have releaed this year.","October 8, 2014","true","18.8"," 70 of 91 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","70","91","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricasso/recommended/242640/","ricasso","Ricasso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ricasso/","256 products in account","This game reminds me of the first Thief game. There is very little hand holding and you can take several routes to achieve your goal. Throw in some odd abilities like creating a clone of yourself and using it to face hug a guard while you slip past, and you end up with a fun game that feels open and interesting.\n\nI'm about halfway through the game now and have already gone back to try different tactics through a couple of levels.  I've seen a few comments on difficult controls, but I disagree. I like the fact that I have to land a jump or grab ledge instead of the game automatically performing the action for me because I held down a couple of buttons. There is no automatic parkour action. Also, your inventory is limited. So you're forced to vary your abilities and hunt for replacement items when you run out.\n\nI like the storyline so far and the voice acting is pretty good. Especially considering the price. If I have one complaint it would be that the cursing in the game seems forced. Almost like they added it just to have it in there. I noticed the same thing in Of Orcs and Men as well.\n\nI definitely recommend getting this if you enjoy older style stealth games.

A master of stealth, deception, thievery and murder, Styx finds himself in the dreaded giant tower of Akenash but by his own doing. The Tower is a labyrinth fortress where the humans and elves hide the mysterious world tree which produces the magical ooze known as amber. Styx wants to steal the heart of the world tree and unlock its secrets and unlock the secrets of his origin too however there’s two things in his way. First the leader of the tower governor Bariman and the second, the Governors legions that guard the giant complex.\n\nThe PC port has a good amount of graphical option settings to optimize your visual experience. In terms of controls I would recommend playing with a controller, the mouse and keyboard controls while they work don't feel as fluid or natural as a controller. It is much easier to control Styx and move around with a the thumb sticks of the controller than using the mouse and keyboard, which is very important in a stealth game.\n\nIn Styx, stealth is of the utmost importance, if your looking for a game with lots of combat, this is not for you. Styx is a goblin as thus by nature smaller and weaker than your average human soldier. This forces you to as you travel through the tower to think and plan your attacks carefully. Light is also a big factor, its important to put out sources of light such as torches to remain in the shadows. You can do this either up close or by throwing sand from range. Styx's tattoo will glow to indicate that you are fully concealed in the shadows.\n\nYou have two stances, one is your normal run stance where you will move faster but also louder. The second is your crouch stance where you move slower but you are also quieter, harder to spot and can enter crawl spaces. Not getting spotted is so important as soon as you do, nine times out of ten you'll be in a situation you can't fight out of. The game has a simple but effective cover system to help with this, you can wall hug with the press of a button and move around it easily. One thing I did notice that is absent is the ability to jump from cover to cover which seems an odd exclusion in a stealth focused game.\n\nStyx can hide in an array of places to avoid detection, including cupboards, crawl spaces, chests even under tables. While in stealth you can take down your enemies in multiple ways. If your in melee range you can either do a instant stealth kill however it will be noisy and attract anyone who is close enough or you can do a silent kill which requires you to hold down the kill button until the target is dead however it takes more time and leaves you open to being spotted. Styx can also carry a limited number of throwing knifes which also instantly kill enemies so if you can't get close enough for a melee kill its often best to use one. Lastly some of the environment can be used to cause kills that look like accidents, stuff like pallets on cranes and such can be detached to crushed anyone below. The good thing about environment kills is that if the body is discovered enemies will not then form a search.\n\nShould you kill an enemy directly, unless they are relatively secluded from patrols you'll have to hide the body. Places that Styx can hide such as trunks and cupboards can be used to hide bodies. Should a patrol find a killed enemy they will begin to search for the culprit. Not only this but there is a mechanic which I like in the game where by even when they go back to their guarding positions they will still have their weapon unsheathed and be more alert to their general surroundings.\n\nShould you get caught in the act of doing anything enemies will pursue and attack you with both ranged and melee weapons. If an enemy gets close enough for close combat then you get locked into combat with that single enemy. You have a chance to win by pressing the parry button at the correct time, then pressing it again when the kill sign comes up. It can sometimes take several parries to be able to kill an enemy. This is by far the weakest and ultimately most frustrating part of the game. First pressing the parry button even a the right time can sometimes not respond and you get hit anyway, the mechanic feels very spongy on occasion. Second ranged enemies will still be doing damage to you and Styx can only take a few hits before dying. Thirdly you cannot escape once locked into close combat so you either kill them or they kill you the downside is if your surrounded by enemies you'll end one lock in just to go straight into another. Essentially if your caught and surrounded by even a few enemies unless your really, I mean really damn lucky your going to die.\n\nStyx has many abilities to help with avoiding detection though the use of amber. One such ability is amber vision which when used  briefly lights up enemies and objects of interest including special amber drawn signs to follow. Styx can also use a considerable amount of his amber bar to make himself temporarily invisible which comes in very useful for sneaking past tough rooms or making a quick escape. Finally using the power of amber Styx can clone himself creating a mindless goblin to directly control. The cloning mechanic is extremely useful, not only can you scout ahead without the consequences of getting caught but your clone can open doors for you, access areas you can't and be a decoy for enemies so you can slip around behind them. One thing I did with the clone was place him under a crate attacked to a crane cable while I had Styx on top of the crane. The enemies spotted the clone and as they came in for the kill, I released the crate killing them all below.\n\nStyx's abilities can be upgraded as you progress in the game. Every time you complete a objective you earn skill points to spend on improving your abilities. The skills you can unlock range from improving amber based abilities such as your clones or improving your general stealth abilities such as unlocking the ability to stealth kill enemies from cover. You can only improve your skills at the skill table at your hideout in-between missions. Depending on your style of play you can mix and match on what skill trees you want to improve. If you like using clones to go through a level then improving the clones will unlock things like increased health and new abilities for them. Or if you like to go through a level without being seen once you can improve your invisibility and your movement to be quieter.\n\n\nGraphically the game is fairly good but not great. While Styx looks good and some of the environments are nice the quality of some the textures isn't brilliant. There is fairly regular graphical bugs, nothing game breaking but things like objects clipping through walls is fair often occurrence. In terms of sound the game has a fairly decent soundtrack that provides a good tense atmosphere, the voice acting on the other hand is a mixed bag. Styx and the majority of the main characters are voice acted well, however when it comes to the array of enemies, not only is the voice acting bad but the script writing is cringe worthy.\n\nIn my opinion the solidity of the gameplay makes up for the disappointing graphics and voice acting. The story is good, well told and fairly engrossing, any fans of Styx from the previous game will get a kick from returning to the world and from hearing from the smart mouthed rakash. For me its a complete turn around for cyanide with Styx, of Orcs and Men was filled with great story and characters but had failings across the board with its gameplay and mechanics. In Master of Shadows they have ensured that the gameplay is solid barring a few hitches here and there.  Overall its one of the most competent stealth games that has been produced in the last few years.","October 7, 2014","true","12.3"," 95 of 136 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","95","136","0","3"

Sneaking around archaic ancient towers and killing indiscriminately seemed like a fun past time? Then this is the game for you.\n\nTake on the role of Styx, a foul mouth, psychopathic, half pint killing machine as he carves his way through a massive tower filled to the brim with guards and death. All the while continuing on his quest to steal the heart of a tree….. It’s a magical tree so not just a chunk of wood.\n\nUsing a large array of upgradable powers and skills you have to traverse huge, and I do mean HUGE, open levels whilst achieving side objectives, stealing loot and trying not to get carved up. You can achieve this last goal by either going hot and heavy with your wicked knife, stealthily murdering your way from one shadowy hiding place to another. Or the more civilised and patient route of remaining nothing but a ghost making everyone question whether or not you were just a flicker in the corner of their eye.\n\nThe tower of Akanash is a real sight to behold, every area was crafted to look wonderful and have an immense gravitas to it. There are multiple paths to complete every objective and so much to explore and discover all over the place. The story is great from start to finish, not too long or complex but that’s not a bad thing in this case. Why write a novel when a few pages are memorable enough.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome; control of Styx is fun and challenging. The sneaking and stealth aspects are some of the best I have seen but it’s a necessity. For everything Styx is a master of in the shadows he fails at when he’s in the light. Never face any opponent head on; much more often than not your little friend will get cut down before he has a chance to even utter a witty oneliner.

Exactly the way I like my stealth games.\n\nThe common criticism about Styx constantly knocking into stuff like chairs and cups, thereby alerting guards, is valid.  While kind of silly for a master of shadows to be walking around like a cat on a dining room table, these common obstacles are also something you're forced to consider when plotting how to get from one side of a room to another, and further increase the challenge of the game.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the clone related traps and puzzles, and kinda wish there was just a pure co-op option.  Maybe in the next one, I hope.\n\nI also didn't know this was sort of a sequel to another game, Of Orcs and Men.

A game is only a stealth game if you are the underdog, which is definitely the case in this game. In spite of all your tricks, it only takes a moment for many of your foes to cut you down if they discover you, and they are so much better at doing so than in many games featuring stealth. (Note, I play on the hardest difficulty mode, so engagements are quite deadly; on easy this may be an entirely different game.)\n\nThis game is fun, thrilling, frustrating at times (but not in a broken way) and forces you to either think ahead or learn from your mistakes and try again. You'll probably get very used to quick-loading, but you'll still love it! (Caveat, for those with little patience, you may find that this game is not a good fit if you want to complete all the objectives.)\n\nOne complaint with the game is that I'm not a huge fan of modern crude language, and prefer dark settings that use their own crafted vocabulary and descriptive phrases instead of just throwing in common English curse words for the theatric value of it. (Refer to games like Thief and Planescape: Torment for good examples of what I mean.) There's only so much depth repetition of phrases like 'f- you' add to the feel of this game and I find this choice more immersion-breaking than immersion-enhancing. If I was giving this game stars, I'd dock one as a result of this.\n\nStill, very highly recommended.

Well it was a nice and fun journey. Proper stealth game in a good setting. Good main character and nice story (and i'm usually skipping stories) which made sence and helped to get into the world of Akanash. (Though there's alot of swearing but that's cool spice for the story).\nGraphics felt pretty much oldskool but somewhat stylish despite using Unreal Engine.\nControls are responsive and fast, no troubles when ledge jumping and hiding under the tables.\nGameplay was varied and had nice twists like poisoning guard's food and water so they die, etc.\nGame uses its level set twice though, you go to the depths of the tower half of the game, then you get back on the same levels but with a bit different sets of guards. This has two sides: bad - you don't see  new settings half of the game. But replaying already visited levels backwards has some nice touch as you've explored them already and can play more effectively.\nAll in all a solid stealth game for its money.

This is not a AAA, there are a lots of buggy scenarios, animations and objects collisions that can be improve it, also i could have better textures, however has a loots of fun, every time you effort in not been saw, don't kill or  kill in a very strategic/fancy/cool way is really satisfactory\n\nStory 8/10  I loved the story as much as Of Orcs and Men, is a fantasy world very original, were Greenskins are not "evil just because". This game explains the origin of Styx and the Goblins in this universe, there are several twist and i personally love it. Besides i'm a fan of this universe, the story is pretty decent, i didn't saw coming the twist and i hove that everybody enjoys it\n\nGraphics 7/10  When you are jumping and climbing and looking at the huge maps and buildings looks awesome, but a lot of playing is from above a table or in secret passages have a very close camera angles/first-person view, which reveals that the textures are not best. The light effect are very great, fire are decent, the water effect are very very poor and the dust/particles physic doesn't exist.\nThe artistic design is very great too, moving images will be telling you the story when you finish missions, and the cosmetic of the maps is original and decent.\n\nGameplay  (Extreme mode 8/10, Easy/Normal/Hard mode 5/10)  When you play in Hard mode and above to be honest, the game doesn't make it, when someone catch you the duel mode is like a quick event, but is pretty straightforward.\nWhen you play in the Hardest mode (Goblin mode) when an enemy has you in range he just kill you in 1 hit, also range attacks makes you a lots of damage or kill you in 1 hit, this forces you to play it has is meant, been an very small creature which advantage is to be really sneaky .\nI Played more than 64 Hours, unlock all achievements and all the Badges and Skills. And was very fun, and very rewarding each sneaky kill avoiding been catch, and explore the entire maps, the maps are HUGE! (besides, you are a tiny goblin), also unlock all the badges will give you Skill points, some are useless (skills related to make duels) and another ones adds new ways to kill enemies, animations and was very nice to unlock skills that don't just add you more Life/Defense or increase other skills duration.\n\nPrice 7.5/10 I think that the price is almost reasonable for the content, in generals terms is a great game and i really hope that this company continue making games from this universe and this kind of games, but to be honest is very buggy, you can tell some quality has been cut, there are animations that are missing and collision between objects is not awesome, some physics are missing, like you can kill someone jumping insanely high, etc. If you are doubting about buy or no this game, and there is a sale, i think that you won't have any regrets.\n\n\nFinal 7/10 Good Story, good Gameplay, decent Graphics, I only recommend to play it in Goblin Mode.

Its absolutely superb environments, with great use of verticality, are breathtakingly well designed. The music, overall sound and all other aesthetics fit the game perfectly.\n\nIt is, however, a very difficult game. You’ll find yourself using quicksaves on every small section you manage to pass through, especially because autosaves are scarce. Trigger an alarm – reload. Tumble – reload. Accidentally kick over a bucket – reload.\n\nAll of this makes Styx a great title for the veterans of the stealth genre. You’re free to go for a careless run towards the exit, you could slaughter everyone on the map, but nothing beats the sense of accomplishment for completing the huge levels without ever being seen.\n\nIt is a low budget game, but don’t let this scare you away. Sure, I could fill this review with plenty of negative comments about small glitches and poor voice acting, but I knew what to expect. It’s not without its flaws, but none of those break the immersion Styx has to offer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techzwn/recommended/242640/","techzwn","KnightErrant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techzwn/","383 products in account","My review on TechZwn:\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows is a surprisingly good stealth game from Cyanide Studio. It captures the same feel as some of the best stealth games out there, and while it may not be groundbreaking, it does have a  few tricks up its sleeve that make it a valuable addition to the stealth genre.\n\nThe game is a prequel to Of Orcs and Men. You play Styx, a 200-year-old and oddly unique goblin out to discover the true history of your origin. You’re the goblin master assassin, and you’re mission in the game is to infiltrate the Tower of Akenash—basically a really huge tower city that stretches high into the sky—in order to steal the heart of the World Tree which produces a valuable (and apparently addicting) magical substance.\n\nThe overall feel of Styx is kind of what you’d get if you took the atmosphere from Thief, the environment interactions from Assassin’s Creed, and the level concepts from Dishonored and filled it with characters from World of Warcraft who behave like they’re in Game of Thrones.\n\nBut don’t let these similarities fool you. Styx is a unique and very well designed game. You’re a small goblin that can scurry under desks, dash through tunnels, and hop around the rafters above your enemies. It’s unlikely you’ll last long in combat, which forces you to stay true to the stealth approach, and the level design works wonderfully with the gameplay.\n\nLike most stealth games, darkness is your friend in Styx, but unlike many stealth games the game isn’t filled with completely black shadows you can disappear into. Enemies can usually see you even when you’re in the shadows, which brings an interesting and welcome change—you’ll need to rely on actually hiding. That is hiding behind or hiding under stuff, or climbing onto high areas where enemies can’t see you.\n\nAs you explore your environments, you’ll also need to watch your step. Items can be knocked over, jumping down onto hard surfaces makes noise, and catching the attention of a nearby enemy will more often than not send you scurrying towards the nearest hiding spot.\n\nThe levels are very large, and you’ll have plenty of options on how to reach your objectives. There are hidden items, optional objectives, and enough diversity in each mission to make you try different approaches when one way feels too difficult. There were a few times when I was stuck on different parts, dying repeatedly, when I realized I could just take another road across. Many of the alternate routes are not immediately noticeable, which makes you feel like you’ve really accomplished something when you find a good route.\n\nSome areas of certain levels are also filled with NPCs, often in large groups. This makes the world feel very much alive, and it also means you’ll often need to look for other ways around. The focus on stealth and rapid punishment for being caught makes you really think differently about your surroundings—you’ll always look ahead at a new area, try to spot ways around enemies, time things well—this all makes you better explore your environment.\n\nThe combat mechanics in Styx can be fun. When you engage an enemy, you’ll need to use careful timing to parry their attacks, and after parrying a set number of times, you’ll get an option to get a kill strike. The combat works fairly well, but really only when you’re facing a single enemy, which isn’t that often. If you’re playing for combat, you’re probably going to die a whole lot in Styx, and it’s often not feasible when facing more than one enemy since they’ll be tossing blades at you the whole time.\n\nStyx has four difficulties, three of which are more general, but the fourth of which is “Goblin Mode” that mostly removes the whole combat system. Goblin Mode is for hardcore stealth fans, and in my opinion actually works a lot better with the design of Styx. If you get seen, you’ll have a very small window of time to escape before the enemy catches you, stabs you, and stomps your head in.\n\nBut direct combat aside, you have several tools and abilities at your disposal. You can of course make silent kills, but Styx adds a few other skills. You can temporarily turn invisible, use the game’s “amber vision” to look for ways around the levels, or create a clone of yourself to act as a scout or decoy. The game also adapts to your playstyle using a skill tree which lets you learn new abilities—maybe you’re more into stealth kills and you’ll want to unlock new takedowns, maybe you’re into using your clone so you’ll go for new skills to make your clone more useful, maybe you’re more into stealth, or use your amber vision frequently. Maybe you like using agility to avoid conflicts altogether. You basically choose how the game plays as you advance.\n\nAs for story, the world of Styx is one with deep lore. It’s a high-fantasy universe with humans, orcs, elves, goblins, and a handful of odd creatures. There is enough politics, conspiracy, and backstory to make you feel like you’ve come into a world with a deep history. The story is relayed in several ways, partly through the narration from Styx, partly through comic-like cutscenes reminiscent of the early Thief games, and occasionally through interactions with NPCs.\n\nThe characters and levels sit well in this world. Nothing seems out of place. But I do have one complaint about how it is relayed: there is very little contrast in character alignment. To say it like an RPG fan, all the game’s characters seem to range from Neutral-Neutral to Chaotic-Evil. There aren’t any Good-aligned characters, and because of this it doesn’t do enough to convince me that the bad guys are any better than the good guys.\n\nBut that’s kind of the feel the developers seem to be going for. You’re an anti-hero in a corrupt world. There is often a grimey tint to things. You can barf up a clone which you can use as a decoy or a scout and curse words are often used in dialogue (although the bad language usually seem out of place, in my opinion).\n\nWhile the cursing does at times feel immature, however, the voice acting in Styx is decent. The main characters are done very well, voices of some of the NPCs are so-so, but overall it works.\n\nAs for graphics, Styx is a next-gen game (PC, XBox One, and PS4), but it surprisingly runs very well on my upper-mid-range laptop. I was almost able to max out the graphics without any lag. The game is also fairly long, with about 15 hours of playtime.\n\nOverall, Styx: Master of Shadows is a good game. Players who are not into stealth games will likely find it frustrating. Despite its varying difficulty levels, it plays overall like a hardcore stealth game. But for fans of the stealth genre, Styx is sure to be a memorable and challenging experience and is one of the best stealth games to come around in years.\n\nReview is online here:\nhttp://techzwn.com/2014/10/review-styx-master-of-shadows-is-one-of-the-best-stealth-games-in-years/","October 7, 2014","true","3.4"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"

Cyanide have worked on a few notable releases including the Game of Thrones RPG, Blood Bowl and the Pro Cycling Manager series.\n\nThe story revolves around the goblin Styx who has woken up in the Tower of Akenash with no memory of where he comes from. He does know that he wants to steal ‘The Heart of the Tree’ from the World Tree. A mystical tree that produces Amber, a golden sap that grants those who consume it magical powers. Styx, with the help of some acquaintances, must sneak past an army of humans, elves and other creatures to steal the Heart and maybe learn something abut Styx’s past.\n\nMaster of Shadows is a game of stealth and timing. Staying in the shadows or high above the guards on ledges will help avoid detection. There are many ways to get to where you are going, only some of which require killing every guard you see. Sneaking up on a guard will give you the option for a slow silent take down or a quick noisy kill. Learning the guards patterns will help you assess the need for violence. Styx can fight back if caught but if more than a few guards are present the likelihood of survival is greatly reduced.\n\nStyx has a few abilities up his sleeve to help him navigate the tower all of which take some of the precious amber flowing through Styx’s veins. The ability to clone himself comes in handy if there is a tight space to squeeze through or to be used as a distraction for some nearby guards. Amber vision gives Styx the ability to see secret markers, hand holds, guards and items. Styx can also make himself invisible for a few seconds to go truly unnoticed or escape unwanted attention.\n\nThe Tower of Akenash itself is a place filled with massive buildings, airships and smelly sewers. Certain parts of the tower feel like a bustling hub with people everywhere making it hard to navigate without being seen. Using crates, hand holds, ledges, etc to traverse the environment can give the feeling of sneaking around while still moving quickly.\n\nThere are some beautiful places within the tower, but that beauty is hampered by a very last-gen presentation. It looks like a first wave Xbox 360 game, even at 1080p with everything maxed, with some blurry texturing and the kind of rigid facial animation that isn’t even on the same continent as the uncanny valley. Fortunately, the game is usually dark enough to mask these issues.\n\nThe music throughout the game is used to great effect. While sneaking around the music is quite relaxed and mellow. If a guard hears you or finds a clue that you’ve been around the music changes pace. If spotted the music becomes much more frantic which helps amplify the feeling of panic as you try to escape to somewhere out of sight.\n\nThere is some funny dialog in the game along with a wide variety of British accents. I was pleasantly surprised to hear a broad Scottish accent from one of the scholars that litter the city.\n\nThe only annoyances I had with Styx was with the save points and ledge and hand hold grabbing. With the hand holds it can be quite difficult to judge where Styx is going to jump leading to quite a few missed ledges and fatal falls. There are contextual clues when going between hand holds but nothing when going between ledges. The save points are placed awkwardly, which means that manual saves are required before attempting any complex move, which is a shame for a stealth-focused title.\n\nIf you can get past the minor flaws you’ll have a good time with Styx. It’s particularly recommended for hardcore sneak-em-up fans looking for a genuine challenge: a stealth-action game in which the emphasis is unapologetically on the stealth, and not the action.","August 30, 2015","true","289.8"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","4"

It's not absolutely perfect, but it does nail a lot of elements that a lot of other stealth games miss. That said - I strongly suggest playing it on the Goblin difficulty (hardest one) as it is a LOT more enjoyable IMO this way. The dark fantasy universe crafted in this game is great, and the narrative is decent enough. Voice acting is also fun and overall, a very good experience. Should probably have a AAA price tag as it certainly holds up against it's contemporaries (Assassin's Creed and the others), but it doesn't have that... so... go for it :)\n\nFor the full review, head over here: http://shoddypixels.com/styx-master-shadows-review/","October 7, 2014","true","20.0"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","36","54","0","0"

I wanted to like Styx, I really did. But it's so rough around so many edges that it's just a frustrating slog. I've got 4 main issues:\n\n- The controls and ledge collision detection aren't perfect. And in an assassin's creed/uncharted style system, like this game emulates - where a missed jump is often instant death, that's just unacceptable. 90% of the time, Styx will grab the ledge you want him to grab, or do the move you wanted, but 90% is just enough to be frustrating as hell. Quick save before every tough jump and maneuver, basicaly.\n\n- The lighting engine is horrible. That wouldn't be so bad, but this is a game all about hiding in shadows and there's no real way to visually determine where the shadows actually exist. Oh, the game has shadows allright, but only some of them function for stealth. The big glowing mark on your arm tells you when you're in shadow, and that is absolutely necessary, because there's no other way to tell if you're hidden. Sometimes the blackest, dustiest corner doesn't provide any stealth-mechanics shadow. Sometimes a super-lighted area will. You can find areas where there's no difference at all in the lighting, right next to eachother - but only half of it's stealth-friendly. There's no way to tell except by your glowing tattoo. I went the extra mile and tested all graphics configurations the game had to offer, see if I could force the shadows to display where they actually were, but no dice.\n\nTL;DR: Styx: master of shadows is all about using shadows for stealth, but you can't visually determine with your eyeballs where shadows actually are.\n\n- The xp reward system is entirely binary. Kill a single man, trigger a single alarm, get 99% of the collectible gold pieces in a level? Too bad, no extra skill-up grist for you. If you're looking to get those bonuses and screw up a single time-- too bad. There is no lesser tier to get, just quick load your frequent quick save or go without. Full reward or No reward. I know some people will get a kick out of the oldschool sensibility of that, but I don't see oldschool as synonymous for good, and there's a reason reward mechanics like this got left in the past.\n\n- Horrible map screen. This one might sound silly, but in a way it's the most important. The levels in styx are massive are exceedingly vertically designed. Styx might have the most vertical level design I've ever seen -- and the 2d maps used are the worst possible way to convey an area from that perspective. It's nigh impossible to tell where you are via the maps, and in a game that prides itsself on non-linear massive levels, this leads to you just having no idea where you are or where to go for long stretches at a time.\n\n\nStyx was within sight of the 'good game' finish line but faceplanted its ugly goblin mug just short, is what I'm saying.","October 9, 2014","false","26.8"," 244 of 427 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","244","427","5","15"

You play a goblin-type character with various primary and optional secondary objectives to meet in each mission, tokens to collect (if you wish), and a relic to find in each mission set.\n\nYou gain points from completing the various objectives, which can be used between missions to upgrade your skills and abilities.\n\nThe storyline I found to be a bit uninvolved.. there's no lack of it, but I just didn't find it to be that deep or expansive.\n\nLevels are decent in size and usually fairly open, so you have lots of options for taking down guards or evading them. They're not so big that you get particularly lost, but not so small as to have few options.\n\nDifficulty is always a matter of opinion. On the hardest difficulty, I found it a bit easy as someone who games alot, but that's also with the added difficulty of trying to get all the insignia at the end of each mission, which is probably just more about time, patience and reloading. If you weren't doing those, and were living with getting spotted, you'd probably have a harder time in some respects. Depends on your playstyle, but I'm a completionist ;_; You can fight back, but can only defend against one enemy at a time, so you really don't want to have multiple guards hitting on you, as you get locked into a parry/attack timing sequence. The game's really designed for stealth, but with the option to get out of scrapes if you make small errors.\n\nYou will find that the second half of the game is pretty much doing the first half's levels again, but backwards. Understandable design choice, as it meant they could put their budget elsewhere, and it means the levels are somewhat familiar, yet different at the same time. guards and items are in different places too. Would have been nice to have more new levels, but I won't hold it against them.\n\nOverall it's a pretty polished game and I enjoyed it. Would recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games, though at the moment it's £25 outside of a sale.. If you're ok paying full price for games, go for it. As someone who only tends to buy sale games, I'd struggle to put that kind of money forward, but then I work for a pittance :P\n\nOh, there's a sequel in the works too, which apparently is due out sometime 2016, though I haven't looked further than that just yet.","May 17","true","52.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

This game was quite difficult, although at first it seems the usual product of this genre borrowing others' ideas. But the further you go through the story, the more you realize how difficult it is usual games of this genre. There is no ower power ability or weapon that simplify the game. On the contrary, there gradually appear almost immortal guards (can only be killed if anything to lose them), the elves who smell player, beetles that can hear you (how I hate them) and others. Equipment as a player is usually very small, there is no automatic mana regeneration (amber) and health, on the need to spend them wisely. Enemies in open combat is very difficult to kill (at the end of the game almost impossible) because of the curve enough battles. This game is not like the modern stealth action games, it is more like a game of this genre that came out about 5 years ago. Stealth it is not an option, but a necessity. Also in the game has great music, interesting plot and memorable protagonist. From distinct disadvantages in the game you can only select 1 - obsolete technical part. Also, this game may not like players who do not like very challenging game.\n8.5/10\n","November 6, 2014","true","16.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

It's not a BAD game, but it feels several years old already. There are a wealth of things you can't do that I've been doing in stealth games for years. The RPG aspect is extremely shallow and feels incomplete, the motivation to explore the large maps is slight, and the story is very poorly told, dumping us straight into the role of who appears to be the bad guy, brutally murdering seemingly innocent people for some reason he won't tell us (we have a goal, but not a motive).  We don't know where we are, or when, or how we got here, or what any of the terms being thrown about mean. The dialogue writing is wretched, throwing in modern profanity in a very awkward "appeal to the cool kids" kind of way, alot of it framed as a flashback for no real reason. The graphics are fine, but the sound is just terrible; the voice actors remind me of Fable, aka, goofy English. Their canned lines are often repeated ad nauseum, and there's no real flavor to any of it. The music is also very lousy and downright annoying, and it's rare nowdays that I feel the need to just turn off the music because it's so bad. Combat, as others have pointed out, is so terrible that you will just never do it, making some learnable skills completely pointless.\n\nBut the biggest complaint, really, is just how limited it feels for a modern stealth game. I can hide in a closet, I can hide a body in a closet, but I can't reach out and pull a dude in and kill him and then walk away. Also, you can only put one body in a closet, you can't hide on top of said body, and you can't remove said body if you wanted to, say, set an ambush. I can snuff out torches to make it darker, but only one kind of torch; the other 12 types are apparently magical flame that can never be put out. When hanging from a ledge, I CAN move right and left, but I can't go around a corner, and it's very inconsistent how and when I will be seen while hanging from said ledge. I can't attack a guy from, or even hide a body in, an air-duct sized tunnel or crevice, Adam Jensen style. I can jump on a guy from above and kill him, but it's extremely loud. I can't kill two people at once. I can carry, to start, TWO throwing knives to kill SOME enemies immediately, replacing any notion of ammo conservation and skill for an automatic kill. There is no way to mark enemies and no mini-map, and your "high-contrast" vision has a short range, lasts only 5 seconds, and is of little practical use except to see the details of a dark area (even upgraded, it still sucks). Even controlled, muffled kills can be unpredictable, because it's random which direction the body will fall in, and no, unlike Dishonored, you can't automatically throw the guy over your shoulder, you have to let it fall first. Enemies are often hard to take out simply because the game will put several of them standing on top of each other in a tiny room, two of them not moving, which is an incredibly lazy way of making a stealth game hard, because it's not really believable or natural, it's just obviously a roadblock because screw you player. Games like Shadows of Mordor or even Far Cry 4 have better, more natural stealth mechanics, and those aren't even dedicated stealth games. An expert, I'm sure, can utterly destroy this game with ease, but for most players, cheesing will be the only way to play this game successfully, just abusing invisibility and the clone/decoy making ability, and using alot of throwing knives. That is neither skillful, nor is it mentally challenging, like a puzzle; you just stumble across area after area where your ONLY choice is to use the auto-kill button and then disappear, if you want to be stealthy.\n\nSummary; this is not a BAD game, it's not poorly made or poorly coded, but it just feels dated, constantly making you wonder why you can't do things you can in other games. I do like the vertical movement of this game, something only a few other games really do, but even that feels weird, because you sometimes can climb a thing and sometimes you can't, and you'll see climbing things in the wall that you can't actually get to, and it still just feels kind of limited. In the end, this game is hard to recommend to anyone but die-hard stealth fans, because it's just not a very fun game in general. Despite being a purely stealth game, they still botch stealth elements that other games did right years ago, while those games ALSO gave us alternative play methods. Ultimately, it's just rather boring.","May 28, 2015","false","15.8"," 210 of 372 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","210","372","15","9"

However, the most important part is how enjoyable the gameplay is. There are simply so many tools for you to use in so many creative ways that it's mind boggling.

If the idea of a few unpolished bits in a game makes you cringe, look elsewhere.\n\nThis isn't a game where you can charge into a group of enemies and come out alive. You are a goblin, half the size of a human and half as strong. Enemies wreck you in open combat, which you should avoid at all costs.

Former means, that you CANNOT hack'n'slash or fight your way through the game. It's plaingly not possible, because once discovered and engaged, you can only fight a single enemy at a time (or run for it).\nOf course you can ASSASSINATE your way throught he game and murder every single living being. But that still requires you to be sneaky, for the most part.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable, but as mentioned elsewhere most textures are a bit plain. Which didn't bother me to much. What DID bother me, however, are the terrible animations. Enemys hover about at times, I saw at least one guy standing around in a T-pose. I saw a lot of glitched kill animations (like strangling a guy 2 meters away) and a fair amount of model hickups and unsmooth animations even in cutscenes.\n\nThe story is very nice and keeps you interested in the entire game. As does the atmosphere.. albeit it's occasionally broken by the constantly repeating 5 phrases each guard seems to know when doing smalltalk.\n\nThe controls... Well, let's say they're back to old school. Don't expect AC style where you hold a button, rawly point in a direction and watch your character doing fancy moves. You got to aim every jump here and will fall off (and die horrible) a lot. To the degree where you will have the habit to QuickSave before every difficult jump, because even several hours into the game you will still miss some.\nOn top of that, the controls often aren't as well-designed as they could be. F.e to hang from a ledge, you either need to fall along it and hold the jump button. Or crouch-sneak off it. Former is rarely an option, latter takes a valuable second andI had a lot of moments where I got discovered because Styx couldn't quicly drop along a ledge.\nOr cross a ledge-corner. Or move from a hanging fence to the ledge next to it, without first climbing onto the fence, take a step to the side and then drop down again (of course triggering guards).\nThe cover system has the same pain and feels rather over-precise. You're in a guards direct sight, but press against a transparent glass container? No problem. But don't let go of the right mouse button for just a split second, or the guard willinstantly spot you.. because, you know, you aren't rubbing your face against the glass anymore. (And even worse if you save in such a spot... because saving does not store the covered state and just plops you next to the object.\nOh, whilst we're at it, saving is... questionable. You would expect a save feature to save the world just as it is, and thenlet you load that state. Nope. Player rotation is always reset to the same direction, sometimes guards are suddenly turned about. As well, they seem to suffer from memory loss after that, restarting conversations (if you saved mid-in) or running over to the same dead body they had alraedy inspected a minute before the save.\n\nI could keep talking like this, but let's summarize:\nThe core gameplay is nice, the atmosphere/story is very good, the controls are on the verge to annoying, Styx feels much more clunky then a master thief should be, The difficulty is so tough you are glad for the (sometimes infunctional) QuickSave and in the end you will probably get a few hours out of this.\n\nBut would I recommend it? Hmmmr... Lets say it this way: This game feels like a budget game. Which, it official is. But to me, a 30€ priced title isn't a budget game. A 10€ title is budget. A 30€ title is a full-fledged game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/242640/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","A challenging stealthy assassination/objective game with a great story. The main focus is on stealth, and becoming a master of the shadows, as the name implies. This means that anyone who gets frustrated at dying after making a mistake, or anyone looking for casual gameplay should probably look elsewhere, but at the same time it's a great world to simply explore and soak in the story and lore while backed by fun gameplay.\n\nHighlights\nMost of the fun of Styx comes from the level design. Levels are huge AND detailed, and have some of the best vertical depth I've played in a video game. There are a ton of different ways to accomplish each section of each map, and proceed with the story, and a subtle encouragement for a Stealthy approach while keeping other methods open is really appreciated. There are also really well placed hidden collectibles, and even things like potions have been placed in ways that they subtly add to the gameplay, giving the levels even more depth.\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is the Skills/Abilities system which use a resource called Amber. These Amber abilities are under stated and you can easily forget about them, but have a useful skill tree which adds depth to your gameplay. They often provide a very interesting useful addition to certain sections and help add a little something extra to the gameplay.\n\n* The prime voice acting and the mature, well written dialogue work so well together, and feel like something you'd expect from an episode of Game of Thrones, never mind a video game\n* The story is pretty damned good, and does a fair job of keeping the player engaged before paying off in the late game. It also feels like there's good Lore which the developers have made a note to treat with respect\n* 4 well customized difficulty modes, Easy, Normal, Hard and Goblin, all of which explain their differences and are well balanced. Hard and Goblin give extra challenge and are truly difficult, and don't feel like a cheap add-on\n* The Relics system puts a hidden objective or collectible in each level, and offers a hint in the menu system which is another small but fun addition\n* Really good settings out of the box and some great attention to technical options and player experience customization\n\nMistakes\n* Finding and assassinating multiple targets can be great fun, but combat on the other hand, is rather boring and at times pointless. This isn't a huge issue in a stealth game, and probably exists to make you try harder at remaining stealthy, but it can be frustrating to have to engage an enemy after being spotted when a fast reload option would've  been better\n* Graphical texturing is a mixed bag. Some textures and map sections are truly beautiful, others feel rather crude and low-res\n\nRecommendations\nStyx: Master of Shadows is available on Steam at the time of review for £24.99/29.99€/$29.99 which is a fair price for a title of this calibre, with so much content. Game time clocks in at 18-23 hours, but will vary depending on your playstyle. When played in Goblin mode or as a more stealthy approach, game time will be nearly double titles like Dishonored GOTY and BioShock Infinite at the same price range and gameplay standard. In short, if you're at all into stealth gameplay, this is almost certainly a good choice for you, especially when on sale for -50% or less.\n\n* There are multiple styles of play for Styx, but a recommended tip is to play in Goblin mode, which basically removes combat as an option and makes the game harder, but also feel far more like a true stealth game\n* You can actually find the body of Styx in one of the later levels\n* Fans of the Lore/story may want to check out the prior game Of Orcs And Men, a prequel in terms of story, RPG game also available on Steam","July 1, 2015","true","23.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/recommended/242640/","sgtnapalm","Cherchez la Steak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/","272 products in account","A very solid stealth game. Plays like if Thief and Dishonored had a baby that was then babysat by uncle Hitman and auntie Assassin's Creed.\n\nThis is a somewhat traditional stealth game that mostly borrows from Thief; light, sound, and shadow are a huge deal here. Also like Thief, the player gets certain gadgets, such as sand spit balls which are able to extinguish torches. Unlike Thief, however, darkness won't perfectly conceal the player. Up close, guards will see you.\n\nLike Dishonored, the game features RPG elements in the form of upgradeable magic skills and abilities. These are different from how Dishonored approached them and, in my opinion, is much better. Players are able to clone themselves, utilize "amber vision," (think Assassin Creed's eagle vision,) and temporarily become invisible. This uses a resource called amber, which can be regenerated up to a certain amount and can also be found in bottles in the environment (also like Dishonored.)\n\nStyx, the main character himself, is also very agile. He can scale the vertical environments with ease, not unlike Assassin's Creed. This is a very useful ability as the levels are massive with tons of verticality. Levels are vast and non-linear, and are crammed with secrets such as environmental "accident" kills, just like Hitman. I'm having a blast exploring the sprawling dark steampunk-fantasy world, which seems inspired by, you guessed it, Thief and Dishonored. Additional challenges such as remaining undetected, killing nobody, and speedrunning levels allow for even the most advanced stealth players to find just a bit more challenge and replayability.\n\nThe game is not without problems, though. It can be difficult to drop down from ledges with precision, though this can be mitigated with careful planning and judicious use of saves. Combat is clunky, boiling down to being a quick-time event where players must parry enemy blows in succession, but it works for a stealth game where the player isn't meant to be an expert fighter.\n\nThese comparisons to so many great stealth games may make it sound like this game is something of a ripoff, but it uses these elements almost flawlessly to make a much better experience than the sum of its parts. This is a game that out-dishonors Dishonored, and out-thieves Thief (at least, Thief 4.) A must-have for any stealth fan.","June 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","11","13","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Technope/recommended/242640/","Technope","Technope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Technope/","188 products in account","I have thoroughly enjoyed  Styx: Master of Shadows\nTL;DR Summary\n\nStyx is an extremely enjoyable, difficult, and rewarding Stealth game that I consider one of the greatest I've ever played in the genre. It has a great story, compelling and unique gameplay, a protagonist who isnt a morally righteous busybody, and a very nice artstyle. From beginning to end this adventure held my attention firmly and kept me coming back for more. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game like I describe.\n\nGame Length\n\nThis game is very long and I am not kidding when I say this:\n\nRushing: 18 Hours\nNormal: 20 Hours\nTake time: 22-26 Hours\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance wise this game runs very well and throughout my 20 hour playthrough I've never dropped to my knowledge below 60 fps. Running an r9 390, i5 4690k, and 8 GB of ram at 1920x1080 @ Ultra Settings.\n\nGameplay\n\nStyx: MoS follows Styx, a goblin assassin with almost total amnesia beyond the ability to remember that his name is indeed Styx. Styx must navigate his way through the dangerous Tower of Akenash guarded by thousands of ruthless humans with a uniform hatred for all things greenskin. His goal is to acquire the heart of the tree that grows within the tower, the source of the ingame  Phlebotinum	[tvtropes.org], Amber.\n\nStyx is in my opinion a masterpiece of the stealth genre, it is a game that I have desired to play for many years. This game nails many essential elements to any great stealth game and brings more to the table. This game is not only rewarding but challenging, something missing from alot of new stealth games. You always have to be on lookout for guards, secret passages, areas to climb, ways to outmanuvere and survive your encounters. I personally recommend playing this game on the max difficulty as it really adds to the depth of this game.\n\nAs Styx is a angry little goblin, surrounded by angry large humans, he needs to keep to the darkness, on the hardest difficulty even a lowly worker hammering in nails can quickly overpower Styx within seconds and smash his head in with ease. But size isnt everything, and if he gets the drop on you, the tables will quickly turn. This game is not the type of game you should play if you expect any deep sword play, there is parrying below the max difficulty, however it is not anything like Assassin's Creed or the newer Splinter Cell games where you can rely on your combat skills to get yourself out of a situation. If you're caught, you have to run and hide or else you will die simply.\n\nThe game has an RPG element to it in that Styx' skills can be upgraded to acquire new techniques that can then be used in the field. From basic things like silent landings, the ability to carry more throwing knives, to things like planting trap's with Styx's imperfect clone, or dive onto enemies from above for aerial kills. Styx has a variety of capabilities in his arsenal. With amber he can create a imperfect clone of himself, see in the dark, and turn invisible for a short while. He can throw daggers, whistle, and of course stab his enemies in a large variety of ways and whistle to collect people's attention.\n\nThere is also a parkour element which is easy to learn but difficult to master, however when you have figured it out Styx becomes a acrobatic wunderkind and can soar down 50 foot chasms onto ledges at your whimsy without taking a scratch. Enemies slowly become more difficult as you go along and the game allows you to proceed with a Non Lethal route if you so desire. It rewards you with skill points after each mission depending on how well you did and grades you on things such as how much were spotted, bodies were discovered, etc. I wouldn't worry about this though if this can get to you. It is much more enjoyable for a first playthrough to just play the way you think Styx would.\n\nGraphics\n\nStyx' graphics are pretty good in my opinion, landscapes can be very visually appealing although I feel the game does not have enough anti aliasing for some reason. Styx' character model is very nice looking and the enemy designs are also quite appealing.\n\nPlot\n\nI primarily play games for the story, this is mostly a curse as I cannot enjoy games lacking in a decent narrative. Styx I felt delivered on it's plot and delivers a satisfying beginning middle and end. Very similar to a Coming of Age story is how I would describe it. Cutscenes are beautifully drawn and the voice acting is quite good as well, although some human NPC voices can feel a bit overused.\n\nIf you liked ___ then you should like Styx\n\nDishonored: Styx is very very similar to dishonored in many ways. It has a very similar almost steampunk universe, magical powers at the protagonist's disposal, and both have very similar stories. Styx is basically like Dishonored with 3rd Person and more focus on Stealth.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Parkour elements like Assassin's Creed, larger focus on assassinating in Styx, and no distracting future plot.\n\nOverall\n\nI recommend this game if you're a fan of Stealth, this game is amazing and I am glad to hear it is getting a sequel in 2016.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nStory 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nPerformance 10/10\n\nPersonal Score:  10/10\n","March 22","true","21.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Personally, it annoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\nPros:\nOpen levels that offer several pathways.\nAbility to play completely non-lethal.Cons:\nUnpredictable A.I. that sometimes bugs out and gets stuck in place.\nBuggy Physics. I cannot tell you how many times I stealth killed a guard only to have his body fly the ♥♥♥♥ across the room and land in front of three other guards.\nSame levels used multiple times. Throughout the game many of the levels are recycled, forcing you to backtrack your way through the same levels over and over.\nAnnoying enemies. I don’t know who thought the beetle enemies were a good idea…\nGetting spotted through solid objects while standing still in the dark… I had this happened on several occasions.\nYou cannot kill enemies who are right next to you if you aren’t standing on the ground. This made no sense to me whatsoever.  Many of the contextual executions you can perform suffer from similar issues as well. Pulling guards off ledges or killing them behind cover is impossible in so many places that it shouldn’t be.\nGrabbing onto ledges (THIS IS BYFAR THE MOST ANNOYING THING IN THE ENTIRE GAME)\nIn order to hold on to a ledge, you have to hold the walk key and walk off. Doesn’t sound so bad? Well, if you’ve just been spotted by a guard and you want to dash out of sight, holding the walk key is not a good way to break LOS. This doesn’t even work on some ledges and you will always fall to your death. This really should have been handled by a separate key press.\nThe ledge detection issues don’t stop here. Want to jump to a ledge and hang on so you’re not spotted by the guard above you? No problem, just hold in the jump key, but guess what?! Sometimes it doesn’t work… like everything else in this game and you’ll pull yourself up and be instantly spotted.\nPoor Voice Acting.\nSuffers from UE3 streaming/stutter issue.I suppose Styx would be a decent stealth game if it wasn’t for all of the annoying bugs and control issues. Sadly I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless you are really desperate for a new stealth game. I suggest you pick it up for under $5.00 if you do.\n\nRating: 2/5","January 6","false","21.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","6"

To their credit they try and keep it fresh by starting you at different points in the already completed level but to be honest, Doubling the guards and re-using maps is fooling no-one.\n-Abilities seem to be gimmicky, In the sense that you'll use them once.\n-Story telling is sub par, You'd think the people were robots "YES, WE ARE GUARDS AND WE ARE GUARDING LOOK OVER THERE, IT IS A SECRET STASH BUT DO NOT TELL ANYONE"\n-Some cutscenes and other things feel bland and frankly unfinished\nBut, really, The bad parts only make up less than 1% of the overall gameplay.

Its hard to master and thats at normal. What im trying to say is styx: master of shadows is the best stealth game i've played PERIOD! In fact it might be one of the best stealth game yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterWafflejaw/recommended/242640/","MasterWafflejaw","Wafflejaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterWafflejaw/","192 products in account","Styx: Master of Shadows is a fantasy stealth game that has you go through various maps as the plot progresses. You'll be given different tasks and challenges, typically with the formula of primary objectives, secondary objectives, and various collectables. You have multiple paths to choose from, as well as an array of abilities in case you get yourself into a sticky situation. Combat is intentionally difficult and one-sided to make you want to avoid conflict and rely on stealth, which is not a bad thing in the slightest.\n\nBefore I really delve into the best parts of this game, I want to focus on some of its flaws. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. The flaws this game does have are VERY obvious and noticeable, so I feel like they're definitely worth mentioning first.\n2. I enjoy this game immensely, and honestly it wouldn't be doing it justice if I didn't end the review on a positive note.\n\nWhen you play Styx, it becomes apparent that the developers didn't have a huge budget to work with. This is no triple A platinum title. This game has its fair share of glitches, poor controls, and clunky AI.\n\n-I've had several instances where I quicksaved when I was safe, reloaded the quicksave, and then got caught immediately by an enemy that didn't even know I existed beforehand. Be careful where you save.\n\n-Climbing up things is a breeze. Climbing down them is another story. One thing that frustrates me to no end is when I try and drop off a ledge to grab the one below, and Styx will just grab the first ledge and climb back up it. This is especially infuriating when you're trying not to get spotted by an enemy coming around the corner.\n\n-The AI is muy estúpido. They have no concept of each others placement. They usually walk in the same looped path, be it around a room, up and down strairs, or from table to table, etc. When you alert them they may stop and look, or even go towards the noise to investigate. During and after this sequence is when you get to enjoy watching them bump into each other. They'll sometimes walk in place towards each other until one of them somehow gets around the other. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=514439404\n\n-Some of the subtitles need to be proof read. I get the feeling English wasn't the developers first language.\n\nNow that that's done, I can focus on the things this game does well.\n\n-The plot. My god, the plot. The story is surprisingly captivating, intriguing, and well thought out. I won't spoil anything for you, just know that the devs are some creative ♥♥♥♥ers and I admire their story telling ability greatly.\n\n-The stealth portions. Despite what I may have said about the whole climbing down issue, the stealth itself is very well done. I'm sure there are better stealth games out there, but this games sneak mechanics feel nice and balanced to me. I never feel like my ability to sneak is overpowered, nor underpowered. What I'm trying to say is the game itself feels very fair to the player.\n\n-The artwork is lovely. Some cutscenes are done with drawn stills of what is happening with dialogue dubbed over, rather than animated 3D characters like some other cutscenes. I'm sure this would be a complaint for some people, but I really enjoyed it. The art is really well done and it really sets some scenes apart from the others.\n\n-I really love the way the game rewards the player. Essentially you receive skill points when you do primary and secondary objectives, as well as gathering collectables. However, the icing on the cake for me was the insignias. You will also receive skill points for the following:\n\n1. Not being spotted during a mission.\n2. No kills during a mission.\n3. How fast you managed to complete a mission.\n4. Collecting all the treasures. (Collectables, as already mentioned.)\n\nThis effectively allows the player to be rewarded and congratulated for things like ghosting or speedrunning, and for me it also allows for more replayability.\n\nIn summary, this is not a perfect game. It's riddled with flaws and I understand why people wouldn't care for it, but for me it was fun as hell. I loved playing it and it's admittedly become a personal favourite of mine. I can't recommend it enough, and I implore you to at least give it a shot. It's a real gem and I'm stoked for the upcoming sequel.\n\n\n\n\nPS, ♥♥♥♥ the elves.","April 27","true","23.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","3"

The levels are very large, offering many ways to get across them and accomplish the mission objective.  It includes the typical no-kill in game bonuses (though they aren't relevant to the plot), but the game actually provides stituations where killing very often makes things harder, which was incredibly refreshing.  Overall the stealth and platforming elements of the game are good, the level design is exciting and flexible (you revisit most levels), but all is not good news.  The combat system, what there is of it, is not only slanted against you, which is to be expected, but is also pretty crude, which makes some of the perk options you get a little odd.  Actually engaging in battle is a terrible idea, and will usually lead to your death.\n\nThe plotline, voice acting, and cutscene artistic choices were all very solid, providing enough mystery to keep the player going, and ensuring what the player discovers is interesting enough to be worth pursuing.

There are plenty of routes to try out in every map. The game rewards you for being unseen and for not killing enemies. The controls are good and climbing actually requires a little bit of skill unlike Assassin's Creed or Middle Earth, which is not a bad thing in my opinion. The enemies can see and hear you in the way you would expect from a stealth game. You also gain skill points for completing missions and other optional tasks which you can spend to upgrade your character.\n\nThe things that are not so great in this game are the animation quality and the combat mechanics. This however is not enough reason not to buy the game. If you want good combat mechanics and be able to fight your way through, then this is not the game for you.\n\nI recommend this game to any fan of the stealth genre.","October 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Props to the development team for making the levels large with multiple pathways, but the gameplay tools made available to the player are actually pretty limited.

However the overall effect doesn't engage the player as much as it should. It does have a unique story and world. 7/10\n\nSTEALTH- The stealth mechanics for the most part are things we've seen before. The AI rarely looks up or sees anything in the slightest darkness. However the cloning mechanic is fun and fairly unique and everything to do with the stealth plays very solidly. Sound is used in the same way we've seen in the past however, I'd say these enemies are more sensative to sound than most seen in other stealth games. 9/10\n\nCOMBAT- This could almost be considered a part of stealth. The game punishes any combat with a horribly clunky mini-game that I cannot imagine anyone finding fun at all. In a stealth game this is the type of thing I love. However if you are looking to fight and kill the enemies in this game you will hate it. 8/10\n\nACHIEVEMENTS- The achievements in this game were completely reasonable and not very grindy. The problem comes in 2 forms. First, the AI on the enemies is slightly broken and they can accidentily push each other off ledges. This leads to a kill on a kill free run often enough that I had to redo a few missions multiple times because of it. Second, two of the achievments cannot be earned on a save that is set to the hardest difficulty. On the most difficult setting the game doesn't allow the combat minigame and if you are ever directly engaged by the enemy you just die. However two achievements require you to kill enemies using the direct combat. After completeing all achievements on the hardest mode I was forced to start a new save and play on a lower setting in order to complete the last two. Mission replay is available after completion with very clear guages telling you if you have killed, set off an alarm, how long you are taking, and how many hidden coins you've collected. I found this a rare and valuable addition to the game. 7.5/10\n\nOVERALL- If you love stealth games, this is something you should play. It has everything that makes the stealth genre good with very few of the more recent additions that detract from the stealth ambience. The reuse of maps was a bit lazy and the errors I've described in AI galled me a bit. I would hope to see more unique maps and smarter AI in a sequel. That said I give it 8/10.","January 10, 2015","true","67.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This can get frustrating in certain areas and/ or ruin your stealth thus forcing you to quickload and try again\n\n-open combat is bad as you're locked in a quicktime event where you have to parry X amount of times before you can deliver a killing blow, if more enemies are present you'll still take hits while fighting one of them. You're basically better off just reloading the save\n\n-enemy AI is hit or miss, they'll sometimes notice you right away or hear you dropping on the floor even from a decent distance but other times they'll just get stuck on a wall or not respond properly to your actions\n\n-areas are recycled in later levels, despite the different enemies and patrol routes this repetitiveness gets dull\n\n-the overall plot is a bit too murky to be interesting and suffers from pacing problems\n\n-last boss encounter is honestly "meh" at best\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520136655\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows looks dated while you play it and some of its design choices fell old aswell ( like having to unlock kills from corners, from above etc): there's no denying that the game offers an enjoyable and challenging stealth experience though. As a goblin your combat prowess is questionable at best, but your small size, agility and bag of tricks will let you move unseen while leaving a long trail of bodies if you're so inclined. It's also refreshing to see that, being an antihero, Styx has no problems with killing enemies that'd be classed as civilians in other games: unless a mission restricts you in some way you're free to do as you wish. The huge levels are also nicely designed and you'll always have several routes to your objectives, some more risky than others.\n\nI got Styx for 8$ on sale and, for the price, it offered an enjoyable and lengthy experience despite its noticeable flaws and perhaps being a bit too long. Would I recommend it? It really depends on how much you like stealth and how patient you'll be with its blemishes: if you're ok with avoiding combat, having to resort to quicksave/ quickload to make sure clunky controls don't get in your way and the fact the later levels can get somewhat dull then go for it when it's on sale to enjoy its proper stealth and challenging missions.","September 19, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

After hearing a lot of positive buzz about it and being a stealthfan I decided to blindly chip in, plus greenskins are the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game tries to be a classic 3D stealther the likes of old Splinter Cells and the first Thief and it succeeds for the most part. It's all about staying hidden and using the environment to make your way across an area without being seen, detection will lead to bad situations really quick, engaging in combat with guards is almost pointless when theres more than one. I've seen people complain about the difficult and bad combat system in this game but they don't seem to understand that it is very deliberately designed as such. When an enemy gets close to you, it locks you into a duel where precise timing is needed to parry his attacks and wait for a timeframe to kill him, but it should always be a last resort and the game heavily penalizes you for carelessly running around. You also have to be careful of obstacles in the environment like vases, chairs and washbuckets which will create noise when tripped over. Kind of a neat mechanic which I've not seen fleshed out like this before.\n\nWhere this game shines is the leveldesign. The whole game takes place inside a castle and the massive rooms whith lots of verticality give you sheer endless possbilities to try out alternate routes and find shortcuts to avoid patroling guards. And even while some missions make you revisit same arreas, theyre big enough that you don't really notice it. I've often found myself loading up old quicksaves just to try other ways and often to my delight found that theres always a plan B, C, D... etc. to each situation. With the ability to create a clone decoy and to go invisible for a short time (just to name a few of the very playful and versatile skills you can aquire in your hideout after each mission) you get enough variety to find your own playstyle. Allthough some of the skills can make it almost too easy, they get balanced by being bound to a ressourcesystem that is very scarce, so wasting amber to go around a difficult spot invisible is always something that has to be thought through, it may come in handy later in the mission.\n\n"Styx" doesn't come without its' flaws of which most are attributed to it being a budget title. Allthough it bodes some interesting dialogue and a great misanthropic little goblin as a maincharacter, the story and presentation often fall a little flat. There's a potentially great twist like halfway through the story, that isn't delivered too well though and it leaves the rest of the plot often very convoluted and confusing to the player. The ending was a bit disappointing, as the final conflict is merely portrayed through a still image cutscene that I really wanted to play myself, bummer! The aesthetic of the environment and the characters and the sounddesign are excptionally well though and give the game some needed atmosphere. The controls got in my way a couple times especially when climbing onto platforms, but nothing gamebreaking, it's playable both with KB+mouse and a controller.\n\nOverall, "Styx: Master of Shadows" is a surprisingly good stealthgame that takes the genre back to its roots but doesnt feel antique at the same time. I dont mind the modern trend that the genre has taken where the protagonist is more like a predator than a fragile unit, I enjoy those games very much too, but getting something classic und unforgiving like this again after a long time is very refreshing. If you enjoy stealthgames, I highly recommend picking this up.","October 16, 2014","true","18.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

A no-brainer for stealth fans, but make sure you play it on Goblin Mode(hardest difficulty, which disables the awful combat)! You can still stealth kill enemies, but if you get caught, you're pretty much dead. Just make sure you quicksave every now and then and you'll be fine.\nLots of small bugs, writing and acting very mediocre, graphics are alright but not great - But I still love this game to death, thanks to the, IMO, perfect stealth gameplay.\n\nStory - not great but the gameplay holds it up.\n\nLevel design - Lots of ways to sneak past guards in most levels, does get gradually more linear towards the end though, which is a shame.\n\nReplayability - 17 hours in and just completed the game, but I will definitely go back and play a couple of hours more to get better score on some levels and some more achievements. Would've been awesome with a level editor!\n\nI'ts definitely worth getting at full price if you're a stealth fan, maybe wait for a sale if you're unsure.","October 24, 2014","true","17.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The game rewards you with actually using stealth and avoiding conflict. Assassin's Creed plays more like a combat focused parkour open world game.\n\nWith that said, the controls (played with m/kb) are a bit wonky and the camera movement seems a bit strange in transition areas behind cover or under tables. There are handholds on the wall that you need to use instead of the "grab anything" design of AC. It is a bit wonky to jump around the hand holds to ledges and you occasionally fall when you think you should have grabbed something. It can get a little frustrating when you have a well thought out plan to fail in implementation due to a bad jump.\n\nThere is a hardcore difficulty which doesn't allow you to fight back if you are seen. You have to run for cover and do your best to escape - which is difficult. You can also remove the objective arrows and enemy awareness indicators to give you another level of exploration.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the few hours I played of the game. There are so few true stealth games on the market, Styx has good voice acting and good cutscenes and the gameplay is rewarding when you make it through a level.\n\nOne of my contacts has 11 hours into the campaign and feels like he is halfway through the game on the hardcore difficulty. The $24 price point seems fairly good to me.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPe-qmUybRE&list=PL4D232HeetQNf9r_kw_aml5Z0yUBbg4i3&index=1","October 7, 2014","true","24.4"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

He was created in a lake of amber. He isn't a monster, he's just good at what he does: master the darkness.\n\nrakash lost his memory. The Heart of the Tree is the only way for him to regain his past. But deep inside the tower of Akenash, a conspiracy from the humans against the elves is already made and they have their own plan with the Heart. War is coming, and rakash just can't ignore it. But what he can do when those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can bash rakash's head in one hit ? Hide inside the shadow, reach higher places, use covers and press F5. A lot.\n\nOh rakash you little ♥♥♥♥ing rat, you haven't learned anything don' cha ? Amber is a blessing, not a curse. The tattoo marks your shadow shield. Your army of clones is ready to serve you, from binding a guard to being a mobile smoke bomb. Your amber vision is what made you a superior creature than those so-called themselves "superior race", humans can't see you through walls, but you can. Your invisibility can help you deal with most situations, so use it as your advantage when an orc blocks your way.\n\nNow, you think you're ready to make those filthy humans pay ? No you're not. This is not some child's play for modern stealth-ACTION gamer. Hiding in the shadow doesn't make little rakash completely safe. Every jump counts, every action  you made must be precise. Don't blame anything if you fail, because it's your fault. Little rakash just needs more training, and he doesn't go into a corner and cry because he kept failing a jump, right ?\n\nrakash rarely sees daylight, but he has lived long enough to see the beautiful and corrupted skyward tower of Akenash, the dark prison deep inside the dungeon, and stupid and fugly modeled guards too. At least rakash has a reason to kill all of 'em now.\n\nrakash was born in a dried up lake bed. There was a big dead tree. Dozens of his kind crawling around, like rats. But he was not like them. He was a rat of another kind. Everything he could remember was a name - Styx. He's coming, for everything he has lost, for a reason why he exists, and for redemption... and he will blow your mind.\n\nThis is not your modern kiddie stealth game, this is the true stealth-action game that we hardcore fans of the genre has been waiting for. It feels clunky in a great way, it does everything right in term of stealth gameplay, it has great artstyle despite technical issues, and most of all, it will test your sense, your skill and your patience.\n\nIt's been a long time coming, rakash.

There are a few small twists that really turn the narrative into an interesting experience, which was unexpected for this fairly unassuming game world.\n\nBetter than the recent Thief reboot, although perhaps not as polished as Dishonoured - although at least the main protagonist actually speaks.

Up there with the likes of Chaos Theory, Theif and dishonoured for me. Suprise gem from an unknown dev. Well worth the praise its getting in the steam reviews.\n\nThe stealth mechanics checklist is well covered with suprisingly clever AI that follow object noise, last positions, searching hiding places, varying patrol patterns and degrees of alerts.\nYou can hide in the shadows although not to the point blank invisible degree of Splinter Cell or Thief. There are many different ways to kill, some can be considered as accidents IE Hitman style (which won't count as kills on the statistics). Its mostly about enticing guards with noises and clones and getting the upper hand by traversing the complex terrain.\n\nThe main unique mechanic is the ability to make clones which closely mimic your abilities but can do things like crawl through certain gates and more importantly are completely expendable. Just remember to cancel them for complete return of their costs.\nEarly on you won't really need to use your abilites. Keen observations, layout knowledge and a couple of key stealth kills will easily get you through most challenges. However towards the second half of the game you will find yourself relying way more on your clones or even just your own cunning ability to manipulate guards.\n\nThe levels are massive and complex with widely varying paths through them. Although you do revisit some locations (albeit with some additions to the layouts and of course way higher guard count) which did sour my opinion of an otherwise phenominal game.\n\nI recommend playing it on hard and not to be afraid to kill lots of guards on your first playthrough because the animations for each of the different kills are worth seeing. Going for all the coins in each level with 0 alerts and completing all secondary objectives for a lengthy 20-25 hour first playthrough. (Remember that clones causing alerts or clones doing anything for that matter will not count towards any statistics except kills (unless accidental like cranes/poison/etc)","January 7","true","28.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I haven't found a stealth game I have enjoyed this much since Thief 1 and 2. This game definitely is a true stealth game that can require lots of patience; you are rewarded for not killing anyone, not raising alarms, finishing a mission quickly, and stealing all coins. Combat is difficult to survive if caught by multiple enemies, but there are still plenty of ways to kill without getting into combat. And there are plenty of ways to get around guards without killing them.\n\n\nYou replay some maps as you progress through the game, however I did not find this disappointing because the maps are very large to begin with and many of the destinations change when going through again. These levels also obviously include more guards and are more difficult to progress through.\n\nThere are some mechanical issues, having to do with hanging onto walls, that I found frustrating at times, but I didn't encounter any terrible problems.

And this game does this sneaky-stabby part really good - I had really lots of fun while either crouching under the table until the guard went away so I could steal the shiny token unnoticed, or dropping the chandelier onto his head so I could steal the shiny token unnoticed.\n\nOne pointer though - game allows for free saving-loading in the middle, when I discovered this I immediately restarted on the hardest difficulty - which even then was not that hard but enforced nicer, more sneaky walkthrough. I advise everyone to do the same.\n\nStory itself was great - with very nice twist in the middle and nice uncertainty almost to the end. Before playing this game I played Of Orcs And Men to which this game is a prequel (OOAM being released two years before Styx).

If you're looking for a spot on review, I'd recommend you check out GameSpot's review, as I feel exactly the same as they do. The AI system is loaded with bugs (which can be really annoying at times), jumping to and grabbing ledges is often more difficult than it should be, and the fighting system is horrible. You're locked into fighting one guard, having to perry their blows by pressing a button at just the right moment, and while you're doing this, the other guards around you are attacking you, often from a distance with throwing knives, and there's nothing you can do to stop them, making being detected almost always an immediate 'load previous game' moment. This can be avoided by simply pressing the quick save button literally every 5 minutes, or as soon as you do someting that you're not sure you'd be able to do again, whichever comes first. But despite all it's bugs, the fact that the plot is really hard to follow (and the cut scenes are voiced over watercolor paintings, rather than 3D animations) and the fact that I (one who is terrible at video games, but loves them anyway) beat the game in under two weeks (35 hours of play), I still thoroughly enjoyed playing.","October 19, 2014","true","34.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/242640/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account",""Real" stealth games don't come along very often these days since it's more profitable to play it safe and add in optional combat elements, but every now and then one comes along like Styx. This is a game more like the old Thief games, where if you get caught it's effectively quickload time because your chances of escaping a fight alive are fairly slim. It feels a bit budget at times for a $30 game, mainly in the graphics and voice acting, but the gameplay is solid enough that I didn't mind. The game is seven missions long, but each mission is split into 3 or 4 somewhat large areas which each have a main objective, a side objective, and 10 gold coins per area (so 30 to 40 per mission), so it has a fair amount of length to it. You get experience at the end of each mission to spend on skills, with bonus experience rewards at the end of each mission for not killing anyone, not being seen, finishing the mission in a certain time limit, and collecting every gold coin in the mission. You have a few special abilities like being able to make clones of yourself or temporarily turn invisible, but they're heavily limited and the main focus is on traditional stealth.\n\nThe only real problem is that the game lacks a real motivation to actually do the bonus rewards - you already end up with at least around 200 experience per mission just for completing them, and the rewards only add 20 each. For the rewards like not being seen and not killing anyone you might just get those anyways (though I can almost guarantee that you won't bother sparing anyone in the final mission, because after a few seconds of sneaking around elves you'll be ready to slaughter every last one of those beady-eyed hellspawns), but the time limits are usually around an hour less than my final time and seem to be based around speedrunning through the mission instead of exploring to look for items, and the coin challenge is an all-or-nothing deal, so I'd almost guarantee you won't actually get it on your first run of any mission if you plan on going for any of the other rewards. But at the same time, just like I didn't criticize Thief 2014 for not forcing you to steal gold, I don't really mind it here either, because at the end of the day you'll steal everything you see anyways because it's just fun to do it.\n\nOverall Styx is the type of game that just sets out to do one thing and does it pretty well, and while it could definitely be better it's just nice to see a game with a budget that caters more to purist stealth fans. I think $30 might be a bit high, but if you're into stealth games it's worth getting sooner or later.","July 7, 2015","true","21.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Also, I liked the approach of not playing an agent with thousands of technical gadgets or a thief with his obligatory bow and arrow.\n\nBut after about one hour I noticed the first technical and logical issues of this game:\nWhy can one go around a corner while taking cover, but can't do this while hanging from a ledge?!\nOne can't I drink a potion while ducking under a table.\nOne can't throw a ball of sand to extinguish a torch while ducking under a table (neither a dagger).\nBlurry textures from close up\nWhy does one need a dagger to choke someone to death (muffled kill)?\nSometimes the spoken-word tracks are overlapping and cutscenes are jibber jabber.\nThese were the first issues which spoiled my enjoyment.\nBut it got worse.

Styx delivers that package in my opinion. You have the typical shadow and light mechanic, torches that can be blown out, whistling to attract enemies and of course the option to eliminate your victims in silent. Nothing new so far but it was implemented very well.\n\nEnvironment:\nThe game is set in a medieval castle that has huge areas to explore. The levels are designed to offer more than a couple of possibilities to pass through the enemy lines and therefore giving you the opportunity to end a level without even killing a single person.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are not top notch but they are appealing to the eye. Though I wish the developer would have used another anti aliasing because even on highest settings it is still a little rough around the edges here and there.\n\nStory:\nI am not very far into the story yet that's why I'll skip this one.\n\nI'll give that game a 4/5 due to its high replay value and I recommend it to game who like challenging stealth adventures.\n","October 10, 2014","true","35.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

If you replay missions to get achievements the marker for the next level disappears and you can't finish the game. I lost my first save file (25 hours or so) because of it.\n- Dated graphics\n- The second half of the game is replaying the same levels as the first half but backwards\n\nOVERALL\nI'm not sure whether to recommend this or not due to the game breaking bug. I was really enjoying the game until I encountered it. Apparently there is a fix for it now but the developer seemed to go out of their way to ignore the many reports of it, the related thread in the steam forums is easily the largest for this game yet remains unpinned. The fix itself is buried about 10 pages into aforementioned thread.\n\nIf they ever get around to patching it or making the fix clearly available then I would recommend it because it's fun but until then I can't say it's worth getting.\n","October 14, 2015","false","41.8"," 64 of 119 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","64","119","5","3"

Its intrincated story is very good and it's well told. The main character is very funny and its comments are totally enjoyable (be forwarned: his language is not pink and soft). Its gameplay is very focused on stealth, although there's plenty of ways to finish each level. If you like frontal combat you'll find this game very challenging and difficult, but even if you alert the enemies you can always go back to a semi-stealth gameplay. This doesn't mean that you must always be silent or that the enemies are unbeatable -you can always get to defeat most of them if you want to or just stay in the shadows and be a quiet boy. Every mission can be replayed to accomplish all main and secondary goals, visit all the corners or just do things in different ways.\n\nThe level design, graphics, overall atmosphere, special effects, voices, music and sounds are all excellent. The cutscenes are very artistic and don't interfere too much in the pace of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is not totally flawless but it is very good; you won't be banging your head against the wall, Styx always goes where you want him to go. He doesn't get stuck nor moves when you want him still. You can always choose what skills to improve to match your own gameplay style. The frontal combat is a little bit strange and Styx feels slow when trying to run from a bunch of guards but again, stealth is the name of the game and that is not really a problem.\n\nI recommend this game if you like good stealth, dark stories, good parkour and exploring different paths to get to the same goal. By the way: there are no stupid sidekicks, no foolish minigames, no upgradeable weapons, no non-sense vendors or stores along the way, no funny costumes, no princesses to save and no... no female characters at all (strange but true).","July 1, 2015","true","64.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

They learned from their own mistakes. Cyanide sadly hasn't learned from other people.\n\nTo end the game with a series of boss fights and characters with radar which makes you visible regardless of sound or light, it just defies every effort they made in making a stealth game.\n\nBeyond that the controls were simply appalling, being in 3rd person I wasn't able to tell how far I was from a target to leap to, the prompts to climb up and down seemed to randomly appear depending on the mouse moving. Grabbing ledges was so hit and miss I had to save before every major jump. It caused me to take more breaks from the game for any other reason. The rage-quittiest game I've ever played.\n\n\nAll the negatives aside, I would prefer to stress Styx many many virtues, the dialogue is hilarious at times, especially the guards and such, the same level of comedy as the original Thief games. The voice acting is great, the mid Atlantic accent of the main character surrounded by various British buffoons reminded me so much of Thief I felt incredibly comfortable playing, in spite of the 3rd person perspective.\n\nThe look of the game was excellent, though lower technical quality than Dishonoured, still very pretty and fetching, although nothin to match Dishonoured's painted feel. But the designs were up to that mark the game engine didn't seem to match it.\n\nThe music was excellent, although one track, on the prison map, made me turn it off because it had parts which grated my ear too much, but that may well be me. The main theme was very hummable, giving the game a real signature.\n\nThe stealth was great, although there was no light gem, I didn't feel that the enemies were finding me too easily, well except for the end with the telepathic radar guys. So sneaking about was excellent, although sneaking through, aware of all the hidden paths and nooks, made the gameplay  go very quickly I felt like I was missing a lot of it. But the dense amount of guards and very broad patrols gave quite a challenge mostly.\n\nPlot wise it was quite interesting, made sense, and I felt enough empathy with the main character to stay interested. In fact I felt quite sad at the death of one particular chap. That said I think they should have hired an English speaking writer as well as a translator, these jobs are not the same and directly translating the words doesn't equate to tranferring the feel and humour, just ask Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge.\n\nSkills and powers seemed a bit sparse and sporadic, although not as sparse as equipment which was so hard to come by, you were forced to ration them at every moment of the game. Throwing knives being very over powered but impossible to reuse seemed quite strange. I would have preferred the abilty actually main rather being auto aimed with misses shattering the blade. It would have a more intelligent way to handle the issue.\n\nDifficulty was OK, I played it through on Hard, killing everyone I was able too, just to make the game last and I managed to get through without too many tears. Far and away my deaths game from the controls more than the enemies!\n\nAll in all, a lovely time, not better than either Thief 1 or 2 or 3 or Dishonoured but as they are my top 4 games a happy 5th can't be scoffed at. Certainly more fun and more playable than Thief 2014!\n\nHave a go!","February 14, 2015","true","156.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It isn't a deep story but it works ok. Graphics are fine and works well with the game.\n\nThere are some issues in the game but nothing that ruins the experience.\n\nIf you want a nice challange and enjoy a game with sneaking around, exploring, challanges, have fun and have patience, play it!\n\nHave a jolly good day!\n","February 14","true","24.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But while the Thief series turned macabre in mood and more "loot based" in gameplay, Styx is a refreshing return to the original style. You'll infiltrate castles, mansions, and prisons as opposed to ghost ships or haunted houses. There's very little supernatural nonsense. The guards are (for the most part) the charmingly dumb human muscle with swords and chainmail that I grew to love from playing the Dark Project. And Styx won't bore you by having you open a gazillion drawers in a room or anything like that. It's all about creeping around being stealthy.\n\nThe enviornments were so visually beautiful that I was sort of disappointed when they had me run backwards through the same levels in the latter half of the game. I get that reusing content is the most efficient way to extend the game, and it's not as if they did it poorly, but it was a disappointment nonetheless because I loved seeing the new environments. But perhaps the best part of the environments was the audio which was always really good in every aspect and helped keep the game properly emmersive.\n\nI've read reviews that say the combat is clunky but I played it on Goblin mode (the hardest) where the guards kill you instantly if you're detected, so I didn't get to experience it much. I think if you're going to play a game where the fun is in not getting caught then you shouldn't care about the combat. The wealth of abilities and skills you develop as you gain skill points will help keep you entertained - it's way more satisfying to kill a guard with a successful clone trap than it is to parry and slash.\n\nThe story is kind of dumb - lot's of unoriginal stuff like Bioshock-style amnesia, characters that aren't who you're led to believe they are, betrayal at every chapter, etc. There at least seems to be some originality to the lore behind the game, but not much is fully explained. The voice acting is good except for the strange decision to give Styx an American accent when everyone else is British. That, and the gratuitious amount of swearing, are annoyingly conspicuous.\n\nThere's some replayability in the form of side missions and "insignias" which are like achievements you get for completing a mission in a certain way (for instance doing it without setting off any alarms). And it's not possible to get all the insignias and all the steam achievements in one go since some of them conflict. But I hesitate to use the world "replayability" because doing a mission without killing any guards and then doing it while killing all or most of them poses two very different challenges. It doesn't feel exactly like "replaying" the mission to me.\n\nOverall I'd say you'll be happy with the game if you decide to buy it. If they came out with a sequal I would buy it without hesitation. Hopefully I was able to convince you that despite it's flaws it's still really fun and a good experience.\n\n-nyte","October 16, 2014","true","81.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Written part below\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3amaCVY03I0\n\nThe game oozes quality, from the detailed graphics( despite using Unreal 3 ), and mixes in some very atmospheric music, and sounds. It makes you want to play more, and you definitely need to take your time in this game. Watching guards, tracking their movements, and planning your next move.\n\nI’ve been playing on Goblin difficulty, which means you cannot fight anyone head on. They kill you instantly, and they are relentless in hunting you down. Often calling for backup, and placing other guards, or workers on alert.\n\nOnce someone has seen you and their weapon is drawn, they are far more alert. Even the smallest sound of dropping down on a stone floor, or even stealth killing someone can set them off. ( Stealth kills are just muffled kills, the victim still makes some noise as you cover their mouth. )\nThis can be countered by making them think the overall threat has been dealt with. You do this by making a clone and purposely getting him seen, and then killed. Once they kill it, they believe you have been killed. They’ll then sheath their weapon and carry on. Although rarely do guards go back to sleep after being woken in such a manner.\nSometimes the AI can seem a little dumb though, as you can easily sneak by someone and almost touch them without noticing you. Or if they’re a certain distance away can look straight in your direction and not spot you. These were rather rare occurrences though.\n\nIn the game darkness is key, you turn out torches as much as you can, either doing so by hand, or throwing spit covered balls of sand. The darker it is the harder it is to be spotted. Thanks to the Amber in your veins you blend in even better.\nAlthough sound is very important as well, if you move over wood, stone, metal, or carpet it all sounds differently, and reacts in different ways. When dropping down from a high aiming for carpet is essential. As it’ll dampen your fall and not alert any guards.\n\nAll of these aspects can be upgraded through the Skill Point system, and this is done in the Hideout; which is discovered a bit further into the game after the beginning.\nThere you can stock up on supplies, and upgrade your much needed Amber skills.\n\nThe story is very gripping, and I’ve been having a blast with the game. It plays off as a narration in some aspects, but it’s far more complex and in-depth than people will think at first.\nI’m 11 hours in and still playing, still having fun, and still wanting more.\n\nThe difficulty blends in brilliant with the game’s mechanics and you can’t just rush through or go on a killing spree. As mentioned, you need to watch, plan, and move.\n\nIt goes through a variety of areas, all detailed and extremely good looking. All taking place in the same tower that spans upwards for miles, and miles.\nEach time gradually increasing the difficulty, and adding in more foes. Even without playing on Goblin difficulty there are foes you cannot take on, such as Knights, Orcs or Elves. Each of which will kill you in a single strike.\nElves are particularly annoying, even when invisible with amber they can small you and strike at you.\n\nThe visuals are very good, and the game has no issues playing in Ultrawide 21:9 aspect monitors. Although sadly all the cutscenes are pre-rendered in 16:9, so multi screen or ultrawide users will suffer from pillar boxing during those.\nThe lighting, and shadows are particularly good for a game using the Unreal 3 engine, and they’re key to the game’s atmosphere.\nUnfortunately the game seems to be framerate locked at 62FPS, most likely due to the consoles, and textures seem to be at 1080p. As moving in closers to a wall at 3440x1440 shows some blurriness on them.\n\nStyx offers quite a bit of replayability, and offers challenges such as finishing missions without being spotted, not killing anyone, or stealing all the gold tokens on the map. You can also  replay missions at any time when in the Hideout through your log book.\n\nAs far as stealth and infiltration games go, Styx is one of the best I’ve played in years. Easily besting Assassins Creed, and being up there with the original Thief, Hitman, and Splinter Cell games.\n\nIf you’re a fan of any of the mentioned games, or just want to play a brilliant infiltration game; Styx: Master of Shadows is what you want.","October 7, 2014","true","12.9"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

I freely admit that I am a filthy casual AND bad at platformers, and I'm having zero trouble navigating around the gigantic mission maps. The controls are fine. You just have to actually practice and PAY ATTENTION, to both the tutorial and the environment in general.\n\nIf you're the kind of gamer that's going to get upset that you can't stop time and fight fifty guys in close combat with guns and superpowers (don't get me wrong, I love Dishonored), this isn't the game for you. If you're the kind of gamer who, like me, really loves a good gratuitous murder simulator that lets you scramble all over the map (and I do mean ALL OVER, the maps are enormous and have multiple routes through everything) and come up with all kinds of elaborate ruses and trickery to accomplish your goals while killing people in awesome and sometimes hilarious ways, you will likely enjoy this game.\n\nThis is also the first stealth game that's made me care enough to go back to earlier missions and try for things like a no-kill run without being spotted even once (clone trickery definitely helps with this, since clones being spotted doesn't count as a strike against you). Those skill points are a sweet, sweet reward, and make the added challenge a lot more satisfying.\n\nI liked Of Orcs and Men, and I love that it got a prequel. Styx is a great character and I'd love to see more games in this universe.","October 10, 2014","true","80.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

To me, this game was amazing and it had a lot of the things I look for in a game. Compared to its sequal that was released a few years ago, Of Orcs and Men, Styx: Master of Shadows features many changes. First off it is a completely different type of game. The mechanics are totally different so do not expect the same gameplay. As many other reviewers have said before me, this is a hardcore stealth game. There are some minor RPG elements but they all relate to stealth and there isn't really any way to make a "build" in this game. You just get better at what you already do.\n\nAll the visuals are drastically improved. The graphics look beautiful and the levels are wide open and dynamic. I usually turn the shadows down in most games because they usually look pretty bad normally no matter the graphics setting, but they are important to a game like this and look great. There was even a few times I was able to track an enemy by watching their shadow.\n\nSpeaking of levels, the level design in this game is outstanding when compared to its predecessor. Most levels give you the opportunity to navigate them as you see fit. Linear is the last word I would use to describe them. In fact the levels are so big that you can play them twice and halfway through the game you must navigate your way through levels you have already played through in different ways with different enemies. So good is their design that in no way does the experience feel "recycled." For those of you with a good memory though don't expect to be rewarded by remembering the layout from the first play through. You may find a nasty surprise in what used to be a safe passage.\n\nJust like in Of Orcs and Men the story in this game is well written and original. As a lover of Fantasy and a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player I must say it is very very good. You really get inside the main characters head. I can't say too much without revealing spoilers so your going to have to trust me. All I can say is expect the unexpected.\n\nI only have three complaints. As many have said before the combat system is pretty bad. In a lot of ways this is good because it gives you real incentive to be stealthy (the point of the game). That being said there are certain times where I would get cornered and being able to fight at least a little bit better would have been nice. The way combat works is you have to parry an enemies blows enough times then you can kill him. Some enemies have magical attacks that can't be parried and must be dodged. To parry you have to time a mouse click just right and it takes some getting used to. It's a little wonky to say the least. Still over all it's hardly a complaint. I look at it like this; if you don't screw up in the first place you will never have to do it after the tutorial.\n\nSecond, the ending seemed a little rushed. They just revealed a whole new type of enemy that I must say was very challenging and I felt like I had barely any time to test my skills on them. The final "boss fight" was also total rubbish in my opinion. You didn't even get to go head to head with the games main antagonist (or the secondary antagonist for that matter. Maybe we will get him in the sequel).\n\nLastly, I don't think there was a single woman in the game. I am not one of those "gamer femenists" but it would have been nice to see some women in the game. Some of the random comments a few soldiers made in the game though implied that there where no women in the location where Styx: Master of Shadows takes place. Given its uniqueness and the implied culture of the people guarding it this is believable. Still it would have been nice.\n\nOver all I highly recommend this game. The hardcore stealth gameplay and unique and original story of Styx: Master of Shadows makes this game a winner in my eye's. As I said before with Of Orcs and Men I cannot wait for the sequel. Keep up the good work Cyanide Studios.","February 10, 2015","true","19.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike most recent stealth games, Styx has ditched the trend for narrow, linear levels for large, mostly non-linear spaces with a huge amount of verticality.  Styx takes its gameplay and level design influences most from Dishonored and Thief 1 and 2.  Dishonored also seems to be the graphical style most emulated here; it's a pretty enough world, and I appreciated it's 'clean' style. It's clear that the developers looked to some of the best stealth games for inspiration.\n\nStyx narrarates throughout the game, offering his cynical and often humorous take on the world around him.  Exploration and environmental storytelling help flesh out the story, which rarely resorts to lengthy exposition.  Voice acting is competent, though music was not memorable.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the stealth genre, it's a type of game where the player is not the most powerful person in the world, unlike most action games. Unlike action games, also, when combat occurs it's because the player has messed up The player must avoid combat and hide, creating a wonderful tension.  The importance of hiding and finding a path around enemies connects the player to their environment in a way that most action and FPS game do not.\n\nThere is a great feeling of exploration and discovery in these levels, with multiple paths to take and secrets to discover.  Aiding Styx is a smart arsenal of items and powers that he can upgrade as the game progresses.  The AI is pretty standard, following set patrols and pursuing Styx if they spot him.  Beyond the basic guards are sprinkled a handful of other enemy types, including more powerful humans and some monsters.  It's refreshing to explore environments that don't treat the player like an idiot, and where every secret passage discovered feels like one that the player earned through experimentation and observation.\n\nWhile level design is overwhelmingly the game's best quality, the same can not be said for combat. If a chasing enemy catches up to Styx, the game essentially becomes a frustrating QTE, which is bad enough.  However, other enemies are still active during this, and they will mercilessly attack Styx while he's helpless to run away.  I found these moments profoundly frustrating, since if you're caught in any of these moments and there's any more than one enemy around, you may as well sit back and go get a drink while the 15 second combat event plays out, since even if you do it flawlessly you'll be killed by an enemy against whom you cannot defend. I'm not sure what game the developers were looking to for inspiration here, but they should have simply emulated the model of Thief. A much simpler solution would have been to keep Styx, ditch the mini-game, and encourage him to simply run away.\n\nThe developers also seem to have taken the inspiration, rather poorly, from the original boss battles of Deus Ex for the game's 'final boss.' It's a clumsy, lasy, and, frustrating experience that left a sour taste in my mouth.  It's unfortunate that this was the last moment of the game, since nowhere else was this type of encounter attempted in the game.\n\nOverall, despite these annoying flaws, Styx: Master of Shadows is a solid, enjoyable game that refreshingly treats the player like a patient adult and based its gameplay around building a world of interesting choices that reward observation and exploration.  It's a trend I'd like to see repeated.  I recommend this game to all fans of stealth titles.","March 8, 2015","true","24.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Gameplay is based on staying in the shadows, moving quietly, finding ways to navigate the level around the threats, and adapting to the different AI of different enemies, just like Thief (not the 2014 abomination). If Dishonored was the best stealth game since Chaos Theory, Styx is the best stealth game since Dishonored.\n\nThings that make it good:\n\n▲Near-perfect control: This game doesn't help you move. You do it all yourself. You need to be careful near ledges, and you need to land your jumps. But the jumping has precise air control that lets you execute your navigation with perfection. Climbing and jumping around a hundred meters from the ground feels awesome and scary because it's all your own doing. It's not Assassin's Creed that just plays nice animations for you and you can't fail.\n\n▲Level Design: The levels are expansive, non-linear and very vertical. You don't get a precise map, and everything encourages thorough exploration and crazy climbing. Enemy patrol placement is challenging but still the levels are designed so that you can get through without a single alert or without killing anyone. You even get to steal things, and many of the side objectives tell you to do so. This game does that optional crime better than Thief 2014 did, even though it was supposed to be that game's primary element.\n\n---\n\nAs expected/doesn't matter:\n\n►PC features: No mouse acceleration or problems with overcontextualized controls. Fully rebindable keys and a functional unrestricted save system.\n\n►AI: The enemy AI has multiple states of awareness and a reasonably complex detection system. It's almost exactly the same as in Dishonored. Enemies can be unalerted, suspicious, investigating, alert, or in combat. Alerted enemies will change their patrols and inform unalerted comrades of an intruder. Enemy variety is also decent, and different enemy types are introduced incrementally, going from armored killers, to blind enemies with super-hearing, to enemies who can smell you when you get close. Stealth game 101. Nothing wrong, nothing special.\n\n►Graphics: The game looks a few years dated and it doesn't have mo-cap animations. -Which  is entirely irrelevant so we'll move on.\n\n---\n\nThings that make it bad:\n\n▼Bugs: Hanging behind railings makes you invisible to enemies on the other side, but dropping down to a seemingly even safer area gets you instantly seen by an enemy looking into your direction regardless of how dark your surroundings are. Wall-anchor jumping sometimes has unreliable grab-detection, and loading a save sometimes makes nearby guards suspicious for no reason.\n\n▼Reliance on handholding: Levels were not designed with investigation in mind. Very early in the game you will run into a situation where you are required to turn on "Objective indicators" because the information required for you to find what you're looking for simply does not exist in the levels themselves. No readables, no extra maps, no eavesdropping. Just an arrow that points at the goal.\n\n▼Field of View: The FOV is slightly too narrow for a game played on a desktop display 50cm away from your eyes. The default for that setup is ~90° and there should be an option to expand it further.\n\n▼NPC speech: Not enough lines for idle NPC chatter. The repetition isn't as bad as in Thief 2014 but it's still a bit annoying. A game that discourages killing should make it interesting for your enemies to be alive on the background, and not annoying. It's also supposed to serve the purpose of soudn feedback.\n\nIn Conclusion: See above. Don't read reviews if you don't want to read reviews. No score here.","February 3, 2015","true","24.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The other reviews are correct in that this is a solid stealth game which has been missing from the genre for some time. The combat is functional but it is made clear that it is secondary in the game.\n\nThere are not many puzzle sections, the tricky part of a level typically involves evading patrols and environmental hazards.  The game has a dark, nasty, gritty feel that makes none of the regular game mechanics a chore. Im going to say 9/10 as the AI is a tad predictable, but i still have 2 more difficulties to amp it up by so i wont attack the AI programmer just yet!\n\nOn the whole i feel its a very playable successor to games like thief and hitman, in which playstyle is everything and the levels are HUGE. Not open world, but immense enough to find many ways to succeed in your goals.

You have to play a little smarter and come up with the best senario for the situation at hand. Sometimes it's necisarry to be reckless and take on 5+ gaurds at once. Its a thrilling game and I'm sure you will enjoy it.\n\nPros:\nGreat stealth gameplay\nHundreds of ways to tackle a single situation\nGood Replay value\nGreat story to go along with such a good game\nDifficult and worthy challenge to those who love this genre\n\nCons:\nSome may not like the combat system\nVery long missions with few save points\n(If you're a perfectionist like me and try doing 100% every mission dying once and starting all over is somewhat annoying)\nDifficult game at times\nSmall mistakes will often be your downfall","June 12, 2015","true","20.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Quite a revolutionary concept!\n\nThe Good:\n- Good stealth mechanics with a nice use of cover and light/darkness\n- Combat with more than 1 opponent is very hard, forcing you to be stealthy\n- Different enemy times require different approaches\n- Finding Relics is like fun treasure hunts\n- A skill tree gives it a bit of an RPG-vibe\n- Good story and interesting lore\n- Cloning yourself provides a nice new way to solve problems\n- Lots of different ways to move around the maps\n- You get to play as a Goblin\n\nThe Bad:\n- When loading the game, guards forget everything that happened and start over. If a guard already saw a dead body and you load the game, he will act like he saw it again for the first time. This can be both be exploited and can ruin things for you\n- Not enough useful skills in the skill tree. Most of them are pretty pointless\n- Voice acting is not very good\n\nOverall I highly recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games.","September 16, 2015","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Much thought as been put into the location of collectible coins – while optional – present a satisfying challenge to obtain, and fun for those who enjoy exploring.\n\nVery few cons are present: lack of an in-game encyclopaedia and location indicator on the map, and while the story is interesting, it is told in a fragmented style which can be difficult to piece together.

Let me list them for you:\n- One does not simply walk the same path, over and over again.\n- If you're detected, the person will shout for his comrades' attention, or even ring the emergency bell.\n- Your enemies need to acquire a pair of glasses.\n- My head isn't poking out, but I can see/sense where my enemy is.\n- My head is poking out, but what difference does it make? He's not gonna see me either.\n- You are the strongest. Holding down an enemy who's much taller than you (and most likely to be stronger), the said enemy wouldn't put up much of a resistance beside struggling while holding a sword.\n- And last but not least, the enemies like to leave items that may help you in killing them. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nWell, with that being said, you must be thinking I hated this game. Nevertheless, this game is still enjoyable.

Fortunately, Styx: Master of Shadows seems to be the exception to the rule. Their latest attempt is a third-person stealth game—a loose prequel to Of Orcs And Men—that harkens back to the days of the old Thief franchise, when stealth games were hard, and a single mistake could cost you your life.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is how original the game’s universe seems. The very fact that you take control of a goblin is in and of itself incredibly non-cliché. And the characters, locations, and events you encounter rarely fit into any sort of overly stereotypical category. It’s a refreshing change of pace for a fantasy game. The level design is generally quite open, the various mechanics work well for the most part, and the story is interesting even if some of the voice acting is questionable. Being a Cyanide game, however, it’s not quite without its issues, the most glaring of which is the combat. Similar to Garrett of the Thief franchise, Styx isn’t a very capable fighter. When you engage in combat, you’re locked in a duel with a single enemy. After parrying his attacks a number of times, you’re able to go in for the kill. While you two are duking it out, other enemies can join in and stab you in the back. Eleven times out of ten, this will lead to your death.\n\nNow, that’s not a problem in and of itself; it actually makes sense, as Styx is significantly smaller than most of his opponents. Just avoid combat then, right? Well, that’s the issue. If you get too close to alerted enemies, you will automatically be forced into combat, with no way of escaping. For a game that actively encourages you to stick to the shadows and avoid direct confrontation, it’s an extremely illogical and occasionally infuriating design choice to lock the player into combat in this manner. Luckily, the quick-save feature helps keep the tedium from building up too much, and in the end it’s more of a minor nuisance rather than a game-breaking problem. Beyond that, Styx is a competent stealth game that manages to compete with big budget contemporaries—and it’s sold at half the price. If you’ve been on the hunt for another hardcore stealth game, then you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck with Styx: Master of Shadows.

Stealth is not only 'the name of the game', it simply is the game.  Is there combat?  Yes and no.  You can engage the guards but the combat system is almost non-existant (understandly as it is a stealth game) that to succeed (to any degree) you will have sneak your way through the game.  Patience is not only a virtue but a necessity.\n\nAlthough there are three level of difficulty, I recommend the hardest one (Goblin) for optimal game experience.  If you're playing S:MOS in the first place, you're no shrinking violet in the 'slow is smooth, smooth is fast' department.  Additionally, you can make the game as hard or as easy (to a degree) as you wish.  By pursuing the Ghost insignia (ZERO guard alerts) and Mercy insignia (kill NO ONE), you will increase the difficulty.\n\nThe levels are large and various rooms/sections within the game can be sprawling.  All are well designed as there are multiple paths in any given situation.  No definitive path to accomplishing objectives exists so play as you wish.  One feature I particulary enjoyed about S:MOS is that you have to THINK your way to success.  Act rashly and the guards will not be kind to you, at all.   You will need not only to learn your initial skills, but to master the ones you use most.\n\nYou will earn 'points' for accomplishing your main/secondary objectives and finding 'Relics' specific to each level.  Additionally, you receive points by earning the the various insiginas (Ghost, Mercy, Swiftness, and Thief).  You can accomplish one or all four four depending on your skill level (and number of playthroughs).\n\nHonestly, I was not expecting much from S:MOS in terms of story/plot but was I proven wrong wrong in a big way.  The story begins at  about a 5 (scale 1-10) then takes off into the stratosphere roughly halfway through the game.  Once the story hits its stride, it never lets up until the very end.  The top notch storyline was an extremely pleasant suprise.  The ending ends on a perfect note.  It fits everything you've done up until that point to a tee.\n\nSome negatives did pop out to me during my playthrough (one playthrough so far).  Guard pathtracking can be just awful at times, though I found this to be the case closer to the start of the game.  Guard dialogue is **extremely** repititous throughout the game.  The same lines are simply repeated over and over.  A minor grumble, I grant you, but an annoying one.  You can use mission points to 'level up' abilities within any of the four skill trees.  Pick and choose as you wish;  they only augement existing abilities so you will never 'Superman' your way through a level.  One skill tree, Agility, I found to be way out of wack (epecially if you're playing Ghost/Mercy style).  The ability to land much more softly than you would normally would is VERY handy but the remaining three deal with combat themed issues. It seemed strange, but again a minor grumble (easily worked around).\n\nI personally hated the last level but in hindsight I believe it was my own impatience (to get to the end of the story).  You very well may love it.  It will test your patience and skill; very fitting for the game's final section.\n\nThe graphics are are quite good but by no means 'Next-Generation. However, this can be a big plus if you're not running a state of the art gaming rig (most of us aren't).\n\n\nThe biggest compliment I can give a game is that I would gladly pay full price for said game.  I managed to pick up Styx: Master of Shadows for 50% off list price.  I would have gladly paid full price and then some.\n\nDon't forget about FastSave (F5) or FastLoad (F9)!","January 15, 2015","true","77.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I have played a few stealth games.\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows was completely new to me, I found about it a week ago and I tell you, I am glad I bought it.\n\nStyx is our little green friend, who isn't afraid of throwing out clever jokes at guards while basicly making fun of them in shadows. He is a burglar with a taste for shiny trinkets and overdoses stuff called 'Amber'. But even he masters the sneaking and climbing, he has a weakness; he isn't a fighter and this is something you should keep in mind of while playing the game. Styx can't take too many hits from guards and the fact that the fighting system isn't the best (basicly you just keep trying to counter their attack and then kill when successful).\n\nI don't mind that the fighting system is clunky and to be honest with you, quite bad. I'm not here to fight. I am here to sneak and let no one know I was there. And that is what this game does very good, I really like it. It isn't too easy, even though Styx has 'Amber Vision', which is exactly same system as in new Batman games. It helps you to spot things to climb on, guards, items and so forth.\n\nThe story is kind of funny, I won't write about it as the game describtion does tell enough. Not the best, but it isn't bad. I also like the characters in game.\n\nThere are 10 treasures + a relic in every chapter to find and if you wanna collect everyone of these with one run and in full stealth, it is challenging. I will personally do this after I have played through the story.\n\nI have always liked Cyanide Studios artistic taste and Styx is a beautiful game. I can run it max'd with these:\n\nCPU: AMD Phenom, 6-cores 2,8Ghz\nRAM: 8Gb\nGPU: GeForce GTX 650, 2Gb\nOS: Windows 7\n\nIn short:\n\nAudio: 8,2/10\nStory: 7,9/10\nVideo: 8,9/10\nGameplay: 8,8/10\n\nI bought the game at price of 29,99 euros, which is the full price.

I suggest you ensure you have three throwing blades when you enter the final battle, just saying.\n\n*     Bascially the controls are different than Assassin's Creed.  In order to fall and grab a ledge you have to walk slowly off instead of pressing 'B' or 'O' or whatever.  And if you want to jump at a ledge and hang instread of climb directly up you have to hold 'A' or 'Jump' whatever.\nThis was a huge complaint when the game first came out but, if you learn how this game uses the environment/controls you'll be just fine.\n\nOverall - 9/10.  If you find enjoyment by moving through a level and not being detected by anyone, pick this game up!\n\nExtras -\nI played this game on Hard mode and got a ton of extra skill points by doing two of the four Insignias every level except the last - 1. Don't kill anyone and 2. Don't be detected.\nThis made the game /significantly/ more difficult but equally rewarding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igurukyuu/recommended/242640/","igurukyuu","Iguru Kyuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igurukyuu/","84 products in account","Styx is currently one of my favorite games to play. Most negative reviews talk about the difficulty of the first fight, but it's actually rather simple, as you don't block, but rather parry. Trying to fight is definitely one of the harder things to do, as it's not a stealth-combat game (you'll die very quickly if you try and actually go a combat route), but rather a stealth-platformer. I find the game to be very enjoyable and the controls easy to pick up, while the world itself is rather immersive. From what I've gathered, after the patch, the game is now much more forgiving when it comes to grabbing ledges, but will sometimes do things you don't want it to do; such as automatically making Styx move onto the top of the ledge rather than hang from it.\n\nThe game truly is very interesting though, as it's not quite as forgiving as other stealth games when it comes to the actual stealth mechanics. When first starting to play, I find that it's very important to pay attention to everything that you're told in order to truly learn and understand the game. I have yet to run into any glitches or anything of that matter and find that whenever I'm caught and/or die, it's always my own fault, rather than the game mechanics. All in all, I really enjoy the game and recommend it for anyone who likes stealth-based games and/or anyone who wants to find a game that can really challenge them to analyze their surroundings and think on the fly.","September 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/recommended/242640/","MrJenssen","MrJenssen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/","520 products in account","\nCyanide’s fantasy games tend to be a bit hit and miss for me, and although their heart is in the right place, their games tend to miss more often than they hit, overall. Fortunately, Styx: Master of Shadows seems to be the exception to the rule. Their latest attempt is a third-person stealth game—a loose prequel to Of Orcs And Men—that harkens back to the days of the old Thief franchise, when stealth games were hard, and a single mistake could cost you your life.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is how original the game’s universe seems. The very fact that you take control of a goblin is in and of itself incredibly non-cliché. And the characters, locations, and events you encounter rarely fit into any sort of overly stereotypical category. It’s a refreshing change of pace for a fantasy game. The level design is generally quite open, the various mechanics work well for the most part, and the story is interesting even if some of the voice acting is questionable. Being a Cyanide game, however, it’s not quite without its issues, the most glaring of which is the combat. Similar to Garrett of the Thief franchise, Styx isn’t a very capable fighter. When you engage in combat, you’re locked in a duel with a single enemy. After parrying his attacks a number of times, you’re able to go in for the kill. While you two are duking it out, other enemies can join in and stab you in the back. Eleven times out of ten, this will lead to your death.\n\nNow, that’s not a problem in and of itself; it actually makes sense, as Styx is significantly smaller than most of his opponents. Just avoid combat then, right? Well, that’s the issue. If you get too close to alerted enemies, you will automatically be forced into combat, with no way of escaping. For a game that actively encourages you to stick to the shadows and avoid direct confrontation, it’s an extremely illogical and occasionally infuriating design choice to lock the player into combat in this manner. Luckily, the quick-save feature helps keep the tedium from building up too much, and in the end it’s more of a minor nuisance rather than a game-breaking problem. Beyond that, Styx is a competent stealth game that manages to compete with big budget contemporaries—and it’s sold at half the price. If you’ve been on the hunt for another hardcore stealth game, then you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck with Styx: Master of Shadows. It is, funnily enough, a lot better than the game it’s supposed to be a prequel to.","September 3, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I agree with the other positive reviews that if you like stealth games then get Styx Master of Shadows. Don't expect to be going around fighting all the time, thats not what the game is about. You are a 3 foot tall goblin with a dagger not a big badass warrior. It's a stealth game not an action game. That doesn't mean Styx isn't deadly. He is skilled at killing enemy after enemy from the shadows. Sneaking up on your enemies for a kill or avoiding them all together is the best way to play the game.\n\nStyx is a great character with a lot of personality. It's fun being Styx. The stealth works well and the abilities you earn add to the choices you have when making your way to the next objective.. The problems people had with ledge detection and climbing when the game was released have been patched so that is not a problem any more.\n\nI think the graphics are good, not the best ever but they get the job done for sure. The environments and characters are detailed, the lighting is pretty good. I lowered the brightness to make the dark feel dark. The world you traverse is big and there are lots of different paths to discover as you explore the environment. The background music fits the mood and the voice over is good.\n\nIf I had to fault the game at all I would say they should add an animation of Styx crawling over the edge of ledges and make it so you can move to the next section of the ledge at a corner. Also, they could improve some of the character animations for Styx and the NPC's to look and feel more natural.\n\n\nEDIT : When I got to the end of the game, almost 30 hrs, the developer forces you to fight these clones and it does not fit everything you did to get to that point. Its a stealth game not a slasher button masher WTF ! I am really disappointed in this design choice. I am leaving the positive review but just barely positive, just know that If I had to rate it I would drop it from an 8 to a 6 because of this stupidity. I will probably just uninstall it now. I may avoid part 2 as well. The guy who thought this was a good idea should be fired.","July 1, 2015","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics is not overly impressive but functional and runs very smoothly at a solid 60 fps on a decent computer. The story is good and it's got the most original protagonist you've seen in a long time, the atmosphere is excellent and you really start to feel for the little goblin. But the game mechanics is where this game really shines. This is made for gamers by gamers, a super smooth engine that just does things right. The gaming media basically gave it mediocre scores because it was not Assassins Creed, but the critics failed to recognize what a brilliantly balanced game this is. It's challenging yet hardly ever annoying. There are many little details that are just right, like you can save anywhere you want and very solid controls. Personally I prefer this game over Dishonored, mostly because of the atmosphere and level design.\n\nAlso, the so called "game breaking bug" isn't. It is extremely rare that it happens, never happened to me, and as long as you keep more than one save game you are safe so don't freak out about that.\n\nFor fans of fantasy stealth games this title is well worth a buy at full price and a steal on a sale.","May 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I am very far from it. Things I like about it. The game reminds me of Far Cry 3 and 4 without the big guns.  When you take over a base you can do it guns blazing or stealthy like.  The levels are big and you can kill things on the easy level. I give much props to people who play the default or higher as I think the game is already on the hard  difficulty meter on easy.  The fighting system while not perfect does work ok on easy at least. The game is not about direct fighting. The game has a lot of Far Cry in it. From the kill from above to the kill from hiding skill.\n\nI like the graphics. They are colorful and easy on the eyes.  The music is boring but doesnt bug me much.\n\nSo the things I dont like about the game. The guards and their sometimes super vision and their sometimes cannot see 2 feet in front of them. Thats annoying. Their is a skill to detect this however. The jumping from a handhold to another hand hold can be touchy. I have died a few times because of this. This can be avoided by waiting for the button prompt to appear when your looking to grab something. The map system is not very good along with the equally vague location of the relics. This is not a run and gun game. It is a sneaker game. In my opion only it is a lot easier then the thief games.\n\nSo I hope this helped you out with your decision to buy or not to buy.  I did not pay full price. I bought this for $15 and I have gotten my moneys worth out of it and I havent even finished the game.","March 10, 2015","true","12.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You are in trouble if you are caught but you can use powers to help you in most situations. There are some minor issues in regards to map and dropping to a ledge but the pros heavily outweigh the cons.\n\nPros:\n- Choose your own path! You decide how you want to get where you have to go\n- You are not spoon-fed the paths. If you want to sneak around then take risks and discover the paths\n- Take the time to study the guards, know their paths and use to that to your advantage. Each different room seems like its own puzzle\n- Powers help you along but are not the main focus as they cost a lot and potions are tough to find\n- Hideout at the end of every level where you upgrade and refill on everything\n- If you get caught, you will likely die. This is good in the sense that it motivates you to not get caught but challenging to those who may be coming from an assassins creed style of play where battles are welcome\n\nCons:\n- The map is a little difficult to get used to as it is just a blue print of the area with no layers for floors, just an overtop view where you only see the topmost floor and the lower floors in the gaps. Keep track of where you are or you will likely end up chasing your own tail\n- The vision does not seem as helpful as I thought it would be. Everything just gets lit and its too bright to discern from highlighted objects and the walls\n- Might be getting picky here but you cannot transfer sideways to another ledge\n- The drop to ledge mechanism could use some work. It does not seem guaranteed that you will catch the ledge when walking slow to the edge so it could make for some rage moments\n- The character seems a bit vulgar at times, swearing unnecessarily to make his point. I would say leaning towards neutral evil.","May 25","true","42.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Styx is a stealth infiltration game with much potential. Little do I know that this game was actually set within the "Of Orcs and Men" universe. The game has interesting story but fails terrible in presenting them in game. You have to pick up the bits and pieces to figure out what is going on. The voice acting is fine really but they can really put in works for the story board and dialog.\n\nGraphics wise is not top notch but suffice. Rarely there are glitches nor bugs but the ledge hanging detection can be nuisance sometimes.\n\nYou basically receive a quest to infiltrate certain location and traverse through an intermediate sized map to complete your quest with optional jobs in most of the area. The game play however is rather repetitive and even there are multiple approach for you to tackle your goal. The areas are reused heavily in later stages with more and more enemies and lesser option for you to progress or killing them. The enemy A.I. are quite similar and you can expect most of them to behave the same except some higher ranking ones have better awareness.\n\nIf you are up for a challenge, try completing the game with the given challenges which is the hardest and time consuming part of the game. You don't get much reward for them except for the satisfaction and extra experience for you skills. Speaking of which, I find only some of the skills are worth investing in it and actually makes a different in helping you in game. The best thing is, in order for you to acquire all the achievements you do not need to actually complete all the challenges.\n\nAnother drawback of the game is that it lack of mini map or at least a map that shows your current location. You are only given a sketch of the layout and some rather vague landmarks of the area in the map. The rest, you have to figure out on your own, which then again, have close to zero usefulness.\n\nYou may come across puzzles sometimes but really nothing challenging but finding all relics may put you up for a test and the biggest one of all is actually figuring the location of the relic itself.\n\nOverall, Styx isn't a bad game if you are into stealth games and I will definitely up for its sequel if there are improvement in the areas that I mentioned.","May 25, 2015","true","40.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I had to restart the level so many times because the developers were too lazy to make the controls for climbs good enough. It's a stealth game, I play an experienced theif, who can't hold on to specific places designated to hold.\n\n- TRERRIBLE AI, they'll hear you or see you when it really seems they shouldn't, or vice versa, when they don't react even when they really, really should. This is a single player game. It lives and dies by this feature alone.\n\n- YOU CAN"T PICK UP OBJECTS IN THE GAME, you know a thing with two hands can usually do that. That means no throwing things you find to make noise, you even can't even hoist people over or on minor obstacles\n\n- you can't leave when someone fights you, you can't really fight back, it's like that isn't even an option. Why? To make the game harder? Reducing my choices for no decernable reason doesn't make the game better. It's just makes it more boring. If you wanted to make the game harder, then put more time into level design, or add in a minor puzzle\n\n- Other important missing details: multiple bodies don't fit into massive containers, thowing sand shuts the torch cap to put out the torch, "press A to continue".....if you sell a game on steam, that's not OK, its just blatantly lazy.\n\n- Boring, predictable characters, and the story meets all the fantasy tropes, which I expected, but usually people deviate enough to make it interesting, the main character's motivation for going forward is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThis game came out last year, but really, it feels just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth game made in the early 2000s with updated graphics.  If you want that buy it. If not, then avoid it, even at reduced price.\n\nIn the end, I don't think the developers really cared about making this game really great. It certaintly doesn't seem that way. I'll never buy a game from these developers ever again.

Only difference is that your a squirmy goblin. The items are simple, the bad guys are simple (hide in shadows attack out of sight). You can also stuff bodies in area's like a chest ect to hide evidence which is a neat little idea.\n\nThis is really fun game, a bit simple on the outside but the game itself masters wonderfully in the basic principles of a stealth game something which assasins creed and Theif 4 fail to do considerbly. Dishonored comes close to this game in being more stealthy but without as many choices to kill your enemies. Killing is something I was kind of suprised they did not have a blackjack like theif, as blood stains from using a cutting weapon was a great little addition in stealth games for bad guys to notice someone is around. Minor but somewhat important if you want to be above the rest in stealth games.\n\nThe downside I felt was the lack of intergration of Orcs and Men. The first video game with greenskins which even though are seperate stories and completly different combat/years apart, having them linked to bring the unique world more depth would of helped a great deal.\n\nSecondly  I dislike the save system, its like the old school save system. Usually if you play harder difficulties like me, and die the save takes you back way too far in the game and have to repeat (I usually just quit and cant be bothered repeating 15 minutes of hard work). Have not checked if there is quick save yet but does not seem to be. That said, you should save regularly if you get this game.\n\nAlso don't listen to those fools talking about objects making too much noise, your character jumps like a pogo stick and can prety much avoid anything, grappling like assasins creed almost but without the prince of persia feel.\n\nOverall this is a great game, and the price is well within acceptable purchase range. If your a stealth fan you will love it; If your a call of duty/Assasins Creed fan you probally will hate it cause its a proper stealth game not a smash and grab the loot game. Also Skyrim Fans may enjoy this, if you were a fan of the stealth skill tree.","October 15, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, lets start with him actually. Styx is a strangely lovable little goblin, who has a knack for stealth, quick hands, and is good with his beloved dagger. He has a bit of a mouth on him, which I don't care for, and honestly seems unessasary. The stealth mechanics in this game are honestly some of the best I've ever played. You aren't invisible when you go into the shadows, just harder to see. You can't get away from enemies very well, since you're only a little guy, and you are just good enough in combat to fend off a lone attacker. So yes, this game is all about stealth. Now the levels. The levels are pretty dang big, and give you a mulitude of options to take into consideration when polaying them out. Something I really love is the difficulty of the game. I'm playing on normal right now, (there are two harder modes above that) and I've gotten stuck tons of times. Not stuck as in I didn't know where to go, but stuck as in I didn't know how to proceed. I was hiding under a table for fifteen minutes once trying to figure out the best way to get away from the guards. It's a wonderfully made game, lovely graphics, and fantastic mechanics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyingSurf/recommended/242640/","UndyingSurf","UndyingSurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyingSurf/","25 products in account","Styx: Master of Shadows is old school stealth through and through. With impeccable level design, smooth controls, a dastardly yet likeable protagonist and a surprisingly enthralling storyline, it's a great game thats rock hard to play right but rewards greatly those who do. Its also marvellously fun to play.\n\nYou are the game's namesake, Styx, a little goblin who's been caught trying to access an important magical power source, the 'Heart of the Tree'. You start the story being interrogated by the Humans and, through flashbacks, are able to tell them how you managed to make it so far undetected. The story sounds like a simple heist and uncovering-of-a-consiparacy tale though it twists and turns in ways that are surprisingly effective at throwing off any pre-conceptions.\n\nThe gameplay is very Thief-like, except its obviously third person rather than first. It lessens the immersion factor slightly but you'll not really notice, as you sneak around massive labyrinthine complexes completing primary and secondary objectives, stealing the many golden coins serving as the game's main collectible and overhearing the relentlessly braindead gabble from guards and workmen. Occasionally, you may overhear of people talking of hidden stashes which you can locate and raid, often by following the person who exposed their little secret.\n\nAs you navigate the often lofty environments, there are many opportunities to find tucked away passages helping you bypass particularly busy sections that are hard to cross undetected. Compared to Dishonored, a game with a similar amount of complexity in its level design, these are not frequently found and most of the time, you'll have to sneak across the more dangerous sections using just your wits and your limited arsenal of equipment (and have a finger over F5).\n\nYour equipment comprises of physical items such as throwing knives - perfect for distant kills and dislodging chandeliers to cause distractions or to kill the game's more resilient enemies - and magic. Magic (known as 'amber' in game) allows you to turn invisible, see things in a orange highlight and create clones. These little fellas can help you traverse areas Styx is unable to go and serve as great little distraction toys. Guards can be lured from their patrols by a clone, leaving you to sneak on by, or you can use them to mask your escape if they become alerted by turning them into smoke bombs.\n\nThe game has a degree of combat should you get caught, though it's not exactly an ideal scenario. Basically, it puts you in a position where you are locked into a duel with another, often much stronger, individual. Time it right with the left mouse button and you'll parry. Do this several more times and you'll have the option to kill them. It takes practice getting it right but the worst thing is that you can't flee from it once it happens. You either have to get it right or get killed (the latter often being the best choice, assuming you've been saving plenty - it IS a stealth game after all!)\n\nCombat isn't the best option of covering your tracks once spotted. The system is more trouble than its worth, bringing nearly all the enemies in your vicinity running to end your sorry little life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyingSurf/recommended/242640/","UndyingSurf","UndyingSurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyingSurf/","25 products in account","Styx: Master of Shadows is old school stealth through and through. With impeccable level design, smooth controls, a dastardly yet likeable protagonist and a surprisingly enthralling storyline, it's a great game thats rock hard to play right but rewards greatly those who do. Its also marvellously fun to play.\n\nYou are the game's namesake, Styx, a little goblin who's been caught trying to access an important magical power source, the 'Heart of the Tree'. You start the story being interrogated by the Humans and, through flashbacks, are able to tell them how you managed to make it so far undetected. The story sounds like a simple heist and uncovering-of-a-consiparacy tale though it twists and turns in ways that are surprisingly effective at throwing off any pre-conceptions.\n\nThe gameplay is very Thief-like, except its obviously third person rather than first. It lessens the immersion factor slightly but you'll not really notice, as you sneak around massive labyrinthine complexes completing primary and secondary objectives, stealing the many golden coins serving as the game's main collectible and overhearing the relentlessly braindead gabble from guards and workmen. Occasionally, you may overhear of people talking of hidden stashes which you can locate and raid, often by following the person who exposed their little secret.\n\nAs you navigate the often lofty environments, there are many opportunities to find tucked away passages helping you bypass particularly busy sections that are hard to cross undetected. Compared to Dishonored, a game with a similar amount of complexity in its level design, these are not frequently found and most of the time, you'll have to sneak across the more dangerous sections using just your wits and your limited arsenal of equipment (and have a finger over F5).\n\nYour equipment comprises of physical items such as throwing knives - perfect for distant kills and dislodging chandeliers to cause distractions or to kill the game's more resilient enemies - and magic. Magic (known as 'amber' in game) allows you to turn invisible, see things in a orange highlight and create clones. These little fellas can help you traverse areas Styx is unable to go and serve as great little distraction toys. Guards can be lured from their patrols by a clone, leaving you to sneak on by, or you can use them to mask your escape if they become alerted by turning them into smoke bombs.\n\nThe game has a degree of combat should you get caught, though it's not exactly an ideal scenario. Basically, it puts you in a position where you are locked into a duel with another, often much stronger, individual. Time it right with the left mouse button and you'll parry. Do this several more times and you'll have the option to kill them. It takes practice getting it right but the worst thing is that you can't flee from it once it happens. You either have to get it right or get killed (the latter often being the best choice, assuming you've been saving plenty - it IS a stealth game after all!)\n\nCombat isn't the best option of covering your tracks once spotted. The system is more trouble than its worth, bringing nearly all the enemies in your vicinity running to end your sorry little life. If a body is found, the guards will be on high alert, with heightened senses and investigating susceptible hiding spots like chests, closets and underneath tables. Playing Styx well means saving often, planning your every movement across risky areas, staying in the shadows and, even within shadows, staying still when enemies move closer to you.

The graphics and visuals are great, the sounds and music very enjoyable, and the degree of different play styles, are well blended together.  Obviously stealth is the safer route, but doing it completly, takes a lot of obsevations and some skill in timing plus resource managing.    The dificulty of the game was challenging, but far from impossible.   There are skills that can be leveled up to improve how they work, along with skills that improve the use of items.    There is a 'safehouse' that you can practice in and keep things that were collected.   The story itself was kind of cheesy, but it had its fair share of twists and was enjoyable.    There were some issues early on in the game with people being 'stuck' at certain spots due to some bug, but I was lucky to not have such an issue.\n\n\nOverall, this is a great fantasty stealth game that can provide plenty of challenges, whether you are the rogue who sticks to the shadows, or the bold guy who goes in all stab stab stab stab.   Plenty of things to look for through out the game and each area, and IMO, its just an enjoyable game that a lot of people can pick up, and get into.    So, if you are on the fence of whether you should buy it or not, then for the price of $7.49, you ae getting a great deal.","September 5, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stop playing even though I whisper, WTF! Quite often trying to get the timing right or when my character gets stuck inside a dead npc  or something. If you like stealth games that allow you to actually be a bad ♥♥♥, this is a great game. My dude is bad ♥♥♥ when killing from cover or death from above. I hardly use magic at all.\n\nI really like the level design and the goblin graphic. I'm a huge goblin fan and I think they nailed the look and movement. The voice, well I doubt a goblin is 1950's gangster from philly. Overall the gameplay is really fun. I don't know if this will be a one time play through or not, but probably will.\n\nCons:\n*Combat system is rigid, as in sometimes you can do something and seemingly other times you can't. It's not reliable until you really learn exactly how to do certain things and under what circumstances. Some things like the special moves (pulling enemies down while I'm hanging) don't work at all for me.\n*AI is meh, ok. Nothing to write home about but it could be better.\n*Controls are limited\n*There are bugs like your character or NPC bodies getting stuck in the walls with bad clipping with ragdoll dynamics.\n\nUltimately, this game is 8 out of 10 in my opinion.

His hand to hand feebleness without stealth is GREAT. Stealth is in no way an 'option'. NPC reactions are pleasing too, a napping guard under torchlight will be awakened by sudden blackness of torch being put out (realistically) so, and unlike MGS and the undetectable creeping box in an empty room, they can pluck you right out of baskets, grates underfoot or reach under tables so hiding inches from wary guards feels tense and rewarding.\nClimbing needs holds to be there, edges you can walk off with no magic safety net, leaping over a wall to drop out of sight will frequently kill you if you jump blind and drop far at all. Some people spoiled by Creed/Persia/Batman/Mordor find that objectionable. There loss to be honest.

It reminds me of all those Tenchu games that I had a blast playing ages ago. Be aware this is a STEALTH game. You can mass murder everything, but if you have to fight two or more enemies at once you're almost certainly dead. Due to that simple fact the combat is almost non-existant, and that's a good thing.\n\nThe game should take about 20 or so hours, but as there are secondary missions plus several insignias to get for each level - no killing, ♥♥♥♥♥ing all items, etc. - and it's rather impossible to get everything in one run the incentive for replaying the levels is there.  The level design is very nice, with levels not covering huge ground, but spanning horizontally and vertically with many ways to get to mission targets.\n\nThe story is quite interesting, but the cutscenes are underwhelming, only static drawings with voiceovers.

I do my business blunt and direct. I never was much of a fan of stealth games and only started to pay attention to Styx: Master of Shadows because it has Goblins it in. Not as enemies, mind you, but as the playable protagonist. I never imagined i would enjoy this game as much as i did. To me, it is a rough diamond and a candidate for my personal list of best games of 2015.\n\nStyx is far from a perfect game. It has some serious problems. Like the poor face textures, mediocre dialogue animations or that everything is done with a combination with 2 or 3 buttons which can lead to more than one unexpected demise.\nBut overall, this game has a touch to it, i cant deny it. It felt like i was playing a stealth version of Overlord II in a lince free warhammer setting. You play a sociopathic midget on his greedy quest to steal a heavily protected treasure in an ancient stone tower build around a magic tree full of supremacist humans and drug addicted hivemind elves.\n\nThe graphical design is overall nice looking. I had the impression of a solid medieval castle in its prime. The guards gave a serious knightly impression, but were fleshed out enough to fit the fantasy setting. What i like best about them is, that they curse like you expect them to. This game has crude language and  drops a pleasant amount of f-bombs. I will never forget the guard screaming after me something about my rat ♥♥♥♥ing ancestors after i smashed 3 of his comrades under a giant lamp. Not to mention the rich and spacey prison which reminded me of the torture chambers of Diablo 2.\n\nThe sound of this game is pleasantly disturbing. You ger a serious feel for stalking murder in dark corners. To the point where this game could make your spine chill. No jump scares were to be found, but it had a touch of horror game to it.\nIf you like classic music and violins you will have a blast. Also, hearing sounds in this game is not only a utility, but a weaponized tool. You will need it. Has a taste of chess and puzzle solving to it. In the vertical sense. With more gore.\n\nStyx story writing and gameplay is nothing shy of a big circle jerk. In the most positive terms speaking. You start off having no idea how or why, have 2 or 3 mind ♥♥♥♥s, do a 360, get back from where you came and end where you started. Very existential and confusing. But I liked it a big deal. Your tools will help you though, and no matter how much you think you are competent, the various enemy types can rip you to smithereens in seconds if you have a slip or get unlucky. Not even with full skill trees. Precise control is mandatory and thankful to the exact physics engine, mostly granted.\n\nWithout a doubt the best Orc/Goblin focused game i played in a long and a high remark for the stealth genre overall. Not Important from Hatred could take lessons from the unarmed and armed combat abilities of this sadistic manslayer you play here. What i missed out though were woman. None were to be seen in this tower of sausage fest. Not even at the elfs. I would have enjoyed getting a stab at some elf ♥♥♥.\n\nExcellent game. Give it an 8/10. Worth its money and more. Played the shît out of it for a whole month in these large sprawling tower sections. This may be a game with a small name, but it has a big heart. Hope to see more from Cyanide with Styx and Arkail.

I have some advice.\nFirst, play the game on the hardest or second to hardest difficulty. It's an easy game, really. On Hard, (Easy-Normal-Hard-Goblin) it's challenging but still lots of fun. No stealth game is fun if it's easy. This is coming from someone who played and beat Alien: Isolation on the hardest difficulty the first time around.\nSecond, go to settings and make the brightness low. When I first opened and played a while it was one of those "Oh God, how does the guard not see me? It's so bright here." but once I turned the brightness down, everything made more sense. I guess it was just easier to believe.\nAnyway, my rating:\n8.5/10\nGraphics - Game has cool graphics, honestly. They aren't gorgeous, and the cutscenes are kind of lacking graphically, but the game looks good. 8/10\nGameplay - Most of the game is sneaking around and really bringing back old espionage memories. Don't expect a lot of killing, unless that's how you want to play. Controls are fine, movements, jumping, etc. 7/10\nStory - The story is just down right awesome. You play as a freaking Goblin who can turn invisible and stab people and has insane knife throwing abilities. Right? 10/10\nOpen world-ness - The levels in this game are massive. The ability and choice you have to take on a mission is incredible. Go crazy with it. 10/10","July 2, 2015","true","84.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this game; the story, the pace, and the varied choices on how objectives are completed made it the perfect type of game for me.  After I beat the game I went back to get all the achievements that I missed on the first, and then the second go arounds (complete the game without being detected, finish the game without killing anyone).  Playing the game to achieve those more difficult accomplishments kept the game fresh.  If you have a controller, I think it would be best played using that.\nI could go on and on about Styx, but I won't, except to say that the game still resonates with me even several months after completing it.

I do my business blunt and direct. I never was much of a fan of stealth games and only started to pay attention to Styx: Master of Shadows because it has Goblins it in. Not as enemies, mind you, but as the playable protagonist. I never imagined i would enjoy this game as much as i did. To me, it is a rough diamond and a candidate for my personal list of best games of 2015.\n\nStyx is far from a perfect game. It has some serious problems. Like the poor face textures, mediocre dialogue animations or that everything is done with a combination with 2 or 3 buttons which can lead to more than one unexpected demise.\nBut overall, this game has a touch to it, i cant deny it. It felt like i was playing a stealth version of Overlord II in a lince free warhammer setting. You play a sociopathic midget on his greedy quest to steal a heavily protected treasure in an ancient stone tower build around a magic tree full of supremacist humans and drug addicted hivemind elves.\n\nThe graphical design is overall nice looking. I had the impression of a solid medieval castle in its prime. The guards gave a serious knightly impression, but were fleshed out enough to fit the fantasy setting. What i like best about them is, that they curse like you expect them to. This game has crude language and  drops a pleasant amount of f-bombs. I will never forget the guard screaming after me something about my rat ♥♥♥♥ing ancestors after i smashed 3 of his comrades under a giant lamp. Not to mention the rich and spacey prison which reminded me of the torture chambers of Diablo 2.\n\nThe sound of this game is pleasantly disturbing. You ger a serious feel for stalking murder in dark corners. To the point where this game could make your spine chill. No jump scares were to be found, but it had a touch of horror game to it.\nIf you like classic music and violins you will have a blast. Also, hearing sounds in this game is not only a utility, but a weaponized tool. You will need it. Has a taste of chess and puzzle solving to it. In the vertical sense. With more gore.\n\nStyx story writing and gameplay is nothing shy of a big circle jerk. In the most positive terms speaking. You start off having no idea how or why, have 2 or 3 mind ♥♥♥♥s, do a 360, get back from where you came and end where you started. Very existential and confusing. But I liked it a big deal. Your tools will help you though, and no matter how much you think you are competent, the various enemy types can rip you to smithereens in seconds if you have a slip or get unlucky. Not even with full skill trees. Precise control is mandatory and thankful to the exact physics engine, mostly granted.\n\nWithout a doubt the best Orc/Goblin focused game i played in a long and a high remark for the stealth genre overall. Not Important from Hatred could take lessons from the unarmed and armed combat abilities of this sadistic manslayer you play here. What i missed out though were woman. None were to be seen in this tower of sausage fest. Not even at the elfs. I would have enjoyed getting a stab at some elf ♥♥♥.\n\nExcellent game. Give it an 8/10. Worth its money and more. Played the shît out of it for a whole month in these large sprawling tower sections. This may be a game with a small name, but it has a big heart. Hope to see more from Cyanide with Styx and Arkail.

His hand to hand feebleness without stealth is GREAT. Stealth is in no way an 'option'. NPC reactions are pleasing too, a napping guard under torchlight will be awakened by sudden blackness of torch being put out (realistically) so, and unlike MGS and the undetectable creeping box in an empty room, they can pluck you right out of baskets, grates underfoot or reach under tables so hiding inches from wary guards feels tense and rewarding.\nClimbing needs holds to be there, edges you can walk off with no magic safety net, leaping over a wall to drop out of sight will frequently kill you if you jump blind and drop far at all. Some people spoiled by Creed/Persia/Batman/Mordor find that objectionable. There loss to be honest.

WHAT DO YOU SMELL WITH YOUR ELVEN NOSE?!\n\nHaving now beaten the game I can easily say it was my favorite game of 2014. It's a stealth game built on a solid engine that doesn't solely rely on LOS to determine whether you're hidden or not like most stealth games now do. The game is a bit clunky on ledge detection and combat, at least for me, was basically suicide but it's fun stealth gameplay and emphesis on timing made hiding fun enough on it's own. The story is good and introduces a twist early in that completely changes the plot that I absolutely did not see coming. The skill progression system is a take-it-or-leave-it addition that I personally found mostly useless, but it doesn't get in the way of anything either. The game provides many moments of parkour gameplay and plenty of opportunities to kill people for the more violent player. Some levels are re-used, but they're big enough that that it didn't hurt anything, at least for me. An excellent game in the third-person stealth genre and a must-have for all fans of said genre. 10/10 no but seriously screw those elves.","January 11, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lurk in the shadows, climb in the rafters, and only approach enemies when there's no one to hear them scream. The combat is unweildy, awkward, and just plain bad - and that makes it amazing. If fighting were viable, or even enjoyable, it would ruin the game's incredible tension. And the tension in the game is incredible - so thick you could cut it with a nasty serrated dagger. The levels are immense and superbly designed, feeling wholly natural while offering a smorgasbord of finely-tuned stealth challenges. On top of that, there are so many routes through each environment that you can replay them time and again and still discover new things. The excellence of the design is further exemplified by later missions, which see you doing the same levels backwards (with new enemy patrols). Exfiltrating the same tightly-guarded spot you just worked so hard to get into has an entirely different feel to it, and makes the environments feel all the more real.\nFans of "Of Orcs and Men" know how good the story in that game was, and Styx delivers on the same level. At first it seems a little generic - bit of amnesia here, bit of "dark fantasy" language there - but when the pieces start to fall into place it reveals itself to be an intelligent and thought-provoking examination of a lot of heavy concepts.\nStyx: Master of Shadows is the best stealth game I've played in years, and I play a LOT of stealth games. If you're sick of the namby-pamby handholding that characterizes stuff like Assassin's Creed, this could easily be one of your new favourite games.","October 12, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A quick restart of the game should set your back to smooth 60 for a another hourish.","January 20","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You can either take a direct approach or a stealthier one depending on how well you explore the levels. Certain levels are linear while others are more open.\n\n+ The story is interesting and offers some nice twists and turns to keep things engaging.\n\n+ The AI finds a nice balance between realistic and fun. Rushing head first into any given room will usually result in death\n\n+ Completing main/side objectives as well as challenges rewards you with experience which can then be used to upgrade skills back at your hideout.\n\n+ Soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe art style both on an artistic and technical level is pretty lacking. I wanted more variety with the environments, it feels like a wasted opportunity given the setting.\n\n"Combat" in the game is about parrying enemy attacks until you can kill them. Essentially its 'press the attack button at the right moment" over and over again. Granted this IS a stealth game so combat is a second priority but it would be nice if something better was in place. Getting caught and having to engage with the enemies feels frustrating and boring.\n\nThe second half of the game recycles the same levels that you completed in the first half.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The game has a ton of glitches. At first I thought it was cute but the same problems kept persisting throughout the entire game. The biggest offender is enemy guards that walk into each other causing them to end up in weird places there not suppose to be.\n\n- Stealth games always have a difficult time with the final boss encounter and this game is no different. Given the build up of the story the final encounter is anticlimactic and frustrating.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nStealth is a genre that doesn't get much love from big publishers so its nice to see other smaller studios tackle the genre. This is a great stealth but obviously held back by its budget. If you love stealth games this is easily a must have game as it does so much right in regards to the gameplay mechanics.\n","May 23","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect but it s worth 30 $ but i bought it 5 $ when it is on discount.\n\nThere aren't many stealth games around these days and Dishonored is really good but Styx is similar. The gameplay mechanics work really well in this game and there are some that I haven't seen in any other stealth game, such as cloning yourself and booby trapping your clone in a chest or just use it as a distraction for guards. You can even become invisible for short time spans. These things cost you amber which is basically something like mana. You can replenish it with vials you can find during the missions or pickpocket from some of the guards. But those are rare, so don't worry, you can't just walk around the whole level invisibly.\n\nThe skill system is also a good thing. It motivated me to get all the insignias and do all the side objectives in the missions, since you get bonus skill points for doing so. With them you can unlock helpful skills such as aerial kills or the aforementioned booby trapping of your clone. You can go for stealthy skills if you like to sneak through the missions or, if you're more into clearing out whole areas, you can invest in more aggressive skills. Every type of player should be able to find some skills they think are cool.\n\nThere are also different types of enemies, such as your ordinary guard, crossbowmen, knights, which have plate armor and can only be killed through poisoning or dropping chandeliers on their head, and some more that I won't spoil now. Every enemy has its weak spots and is in his way fun to kill or sneak around.\n\nWhat I think is really outstanding in Styx is the environment. The level design is just awesome. There are many routes to your destination and you almost always have a choice of how to get there. In synergy with the mostly good graphics (at least good enough for me) and the great lighting effects it often led to me just stopping and looking at the beautiful environments. It's just eye candy to sneak around in the shadows avoiding the bright sun rays falling in a room through a window or climbing a vertical wall in the sunset.\n\nSadly the fun exploring the levels ends with the exact half of the game. After that you will be back tracked through many levels you have already seen. In most cases this isn't that bad, because there are other guards on other positions with other routes and the levels are still awesome with all the alternative routes. But I have to say that there were one or two areas that just didn't work properly backwards, which was sometimes a little annoying. Nevertheless the back tracking wasn't so bad, although I gladly would have payed 5 or 10 more bucks to just see some more of this really great level design.\n\nThe story line was okay for me. It had its suprises and pulled me through the missions and that's all I was expecting from it. The plot is told through voice acting and comic like cutscenes with mostly static pictures of which some were reused a little too often, but that's perfectly fine thinking of the price for the title. The voice acting was good and I personally liked the fact that although the story is set in a fantasy world, the characters swear a lot and talk more like you would expect from real world rogues. That added a special feeling to it and I liked it.\n\nOverall I loved this game and though it has its flaws the whole experience is just great, because every mechanic and every element come together to form a really fun time of stealth gameplay. And since it's worth even the full 30€ in my opinion (i got it 5 dolllars), I recommend this game to every gamer who enjoys stealth games.\n\n8.7 / 10","May 22","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't played a stealth game in a long time, now I remember why.  This game is pretty much pure stealth, if you get detected or enter combat you are almost guaranteed to get killed.  It is also obviously a port from console.  So if you don’t like stealth games, avoid at all costs.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics aren’t bad, really liked the art and design of the game.\nStory is good, really kept me going to find out what was next.\nLevels are well designed with lots of hidey holes and places to see.\nI felt I got my money’s worth, played only the story once through and it took me a bit of time so it wasn’t too short.\n\nCons:\n\nThe combat is just plain terrible, a parry system, you have to parry a certain number of times and then you get to kill.\nThe ending was atrocious, they forced you into combat which was the worst part of the game.\nI aint kidding, the very last level stunk up to high heaven.\nThe side missions could have used more of an indicator, I really hate trying to look up a walkthrough because these days everyone wants to be a youtube star and no one writes out walkthroughs.\n\nOverall not a bad game.  I enjoyed the story but was glad when I was done.  I started trying to be pure stealth and not kill anyone, but it got very frustrating and I ended up going for easy kills and hiding the bodies, made it much more enjoyable.  I really don’t feel like going back and trying to get all the achievements or any finishing the side quests.\nPick it up on sale if you enjoy stealth games, otherwise don’t.","April 15","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are spotted and a enemy gets close enough to you, you will enter a minigame in which you must time your attacks in synch with the bad guys attack. I would recommend playing on the hardest difficulty to avoid this minigame. If you are spotted on the hardest difficulty and they catch you,  you die instantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BearPunch/recommended/242640/","BearPunch","Bear Punch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BearPunch/","296 products in account",""Styx tells the story of a 200-year-old goblin whose goal in life is to visit the “World Tree” and to steal the “Heart of the Tree”. Well, that’s what the description wants you to believe at least, but in actuality Styx is about coming to terms with one’s own identity, with finding out what truly is the make-up of who an individual is. I know, surprisingly deep for what on the surface appears to be a stealth game about a foul-mouthed goblin, but here we are at the end of the week and here I am questioning my own psyche. So there’s that.\n\nReviewing this title in regards to the story is one of the more difficult things I’ve dealt with, as how do I convey the beauty of the story without spoiling the shift in dynamic that takes place during it? Sure, most people will see the game’s twist coming a mile away (or at least a few dozen feet) but what you may not see if the impact it has. The titular character Styx spends much of the game struggling with his identity, especially in regards to who is Styx. There’s looks at the fragile mindset of someone inundated with the thoughts of others, which questions the ideas of who truly controls the individual.\n\nIs it the person themselves, or is it the unseen forces around them? What is identity?\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows doesn’t answer these questions, as at its core it’s just a well-executed hardcore-styled stealth game, but the question is still posed.\n\nUltimately the story makes for an extraordinarily enjoyable experience, one that slowly builds across the games seven missions/acts.\n\nMaking Your Way in the World\nWhen playing Styx I found myself thinking back on the much maligned, at least by me, Dishonored. The least of the reasons that game came to mind being that Styx’s enemy NPCs bear a striking similarity to that title’s main character Corvo. What stood out most for me was the open-ended nature of each level within a mission. Now, most people would probably liken this to the Thief series, of which Styx shares many similarities, but it was in Dishonored that I found a kindred spirit, one that actually redeemed the latter in part for me.\n\nEach mission (or act) is divided up into 3-4 levels, all of which present a more-or-less simple main goal to accomplish; usually the goal being a variation on getting to the exit of that area. In addition to the main goals, the player is presented with an assortment of side goals. These run the gamut from assassinating a special target, to stealing a visually inconspicuous item in the world, to creating a massive distraction to aid in an escape. There’s also 10 coins hidden in each level, plus a relic that can be found in each mission of the game. None of these goals are necessary to complete, and in fact they tend to take you extremely out-of-the-way of your main quest in each level, but what they do create is a better understanding on the world you’re inhabiting. In addition, they net you more skill points that you can assign back at your hideout between missions, which is well worth the additional time they take to complete.\n\nSpeaking of skills, Styx is quite the versatile little goblin, one who at his base level of skills can complete most any mission with proper planning. With the skill system being used to its maximum ability, that’s where the true skill lies. Between each mission the player can take any skill points earned and use them to purchase up to 4 new abilities per area of expertise. There’s also a final area of expertise that requires mastery of two of the previous sections, which is something I wish I realized prior to the final act of the game. The beauty of this system is that at any time you can forget one skill and learn another one, which came quite in handy when I realized my summoned minion just wasn’t fond of setting a proper trap. The best aspect of this system as well is that if you play a mission and realize that having a stronger smoke bomb would’ve allowed you to do something more quickly, you can learn said skill and then replay that mission.\n\nReplaying missions is likely the only way you’ll be able to master each part of the game, as every mission has certain “Insignia” goals which are hidden until completion. These goals consist of finishing a mission without being detected, not killing any humans or elves (good luck on the latter), not using any items, and finishing each mission in a certain time limit. To put that last requirement in perspective, if you finish each mission in the required time limit on one try you will have a played time in-game of under 5 hours. I on the other hand finished with nearly 18 hours of playtime to my name.\n\nWhy is that you may be asking? Well the answer is simple: I died…a lot. Like, holy ♥♥♥♥ did I die a lot."\n\n\nThe rest of my review (yes, there's more) can be found at the below link.\nhttp://constantlycalibrating.com/StyxReview","October 11, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You know that i love stealth games. Hard Stealth games. Stealth games that dont give you a checkpoint after every doorway you pass through. thhe kind of stealth game where you are forced to think otherwise you're screwed. The kind of stealth game that is going down the crapper since gamers are getting pandered to like spoiled kids.\n\nYeah well this game throws you to the ground and stomps on your fingers if you arent careful. You NEED to think in this game and you NEED to execute your moves carefully otherwise the guards are gonna see you and you're gonna be running for your life with a bad score and a bunch of arrows, throwingknives and stabwounds up your ♥♥♥ and thats something that i've missed since Splinter Cell: Double Agent came out. There arent any decent pure stealth games anymore and perhaps thats just how i feel about it but lets think about it for a sec. Conviction sucked the bolts out of a submarine. The Thief series took a nosedive after the golden age and the less said about Hitman Absolution the better.\n\nAll of those games where giants when it came to the stealth genre and all fell. HARD. When TF2 pulls of stealth better than most recent supposed stealth games there's something wrong.\n\nI Hate how you can get away with almost no consequences in these later games. In Splinter Cell you can jump out of a window and BOOM you're gone or even worse utilize the games instakill button that kills everyone in the room. Yeah, Stealthy right? Same thing in Hitman (I seriously hate the instakill button) and in thief all you had to do was run around the corner or use the hookthing so the guards can reach you.  All of these games gave in to the little kid going "This is too hard". Well kid sit down and play and you might learn a thing or two about solving problems.\n\nThats the main reason why you should play this game.

That difficulty range is weird though in that there are things that you get killed by and say "Oh, I screwed that up", while there are other times when the game seems "unfair" and you're just constantly getting rocked at the same moment over and over again.  That unfairness also comes with the fact that load points can be quite ridiculous, where you're basically having to go through 10-20 minutes of content.  This really falls into place in the later levels, where most of everything one shots you.  While the game frustrated me way too much during these moments, I also learned from my failures.  I'm not an experienced stealth gamer (only really played Dishonored and Metal Gear Solid, but those could be played as more action oriented), so as I go through trial and error, I get use to what's going on.  It still gets me because I'm impatient, but the game tried to teach me that and punished me if I didn't listen.  I like that.  Maybe not all the time, but I do appreciate the fact that the game just doesn't hold my hand.  Combat isn't the easiest in the game against multiple targets, so stealth is what you'll be doing most of the game.  I played on controller, but glad to see that both controller and mouse/keyboard has options to change keys (although it's only two types for controller and all it changes is where Roll or Crouch are placed).\n\nBesides the mechanics, the physical appearance of the game is great, even if the graphics kind of tank with bugs, glitches, and off-synced voice acting.  The idea that Styx is a Goblin assassin is such a cool concept for a protagonist and the story behind him is actually quite enjoyable.  The cinematics are portrayed in still animated scenes and I wasn't too keen on them at first, but I started to dig them.  By the last cinematic, I finally learned to enjoy the art and the beautiful colors they use, especially in the last cinematic.  Music seems off in places, as in it plays a lot later in the game but not so much in the early parts of the game.\n\nOverall, I don't give games a number rating because it doesn't necessarily match my view and opinion, so I'll leave it as this game will be not the best, but still quite an enjoyable game for those who love stealth.  If you can't get pass the stealth part, this game may not be for you but pick it up if you're willing to learn.  It'll help you understand some concepts used in a lot of stealth games.","October 19, 2014","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BanzaiBasher/recommended/242640/","BanzaiBasher","Banzai Basher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BanzaiBasher/","928 products in account","I wasn't really expecting much out of this game, but in the end it really surprised me with a fun, albeit hard, stealth experience. There isn't anything super original in terms of the stealth gameplay, but it's got a fun storyline that follows Styx, the worlds first goblin, in his quest to steal the heart of the worlds tree. Most of the voice acting for the NPC's isn't the best, using generic English accents and only a few lines of dialogue each, however, the voice actor for Styx is pretty good and does well with delivering Styx's sarcasm and cynicism while still sounding like the gruff old goblin that he is. The game also sports a simple yet effective upgrade system for your 3 skills: clones, invisibility and amber vision (similar to Assassins Creeds eagle vision). When going through levels there are main objectives, side objectives and insignia objectives. The first 2 are self explanatory, but the insignia objectives are where the game adds some replay value. Each level has 4 objectives that will get you bonus upgrade points: doing it without alerts, within a certain time limit, stealing all the coins and without killing anyone. This means you can go through the level and explore everywhere and find all the coins, and do it another time as fast as possible, or even try to do it fast, with no kills and no alerts. You DO NOT have to do all of them in one go, in fact it would be pretty much impossible. Once you've done the objective for that level once, you can replay it again (as many times as you want) to get the others.\n\nCONS: The biggest and most glaring problem for me is the ledge grabbing. Where as many games will have a button to drop to a ledge, the only way to reliably drop to a ledge in this game is to slowly walk to the edge while crouched. This becomes a problem when you're trying to escape from guards as many times you will want to run towards the edge and turn around to grab it, but end up falling to your death instead\nAnother problem with ledges is when jumping up from either the ground or from a lower point on a wall to the uppermost point, Styx will often automatically pull himself up instead of continuing to hang from the ledge. This leads to many times where I want to jump up to a ledge and hang there until a guard passes, then pull myself up, but instead I immediately pull myself up and alert the guard instead\nThe combat system I'm half and half on, but I'll explain the part that irritates me about the combat system here. When going into a duel (a guard spots you and gets close enough) the game locks you into a fight with the guard. This means that when fighting multiple enemies, the others will still shoot at you and kill you while dealing with the guard you are stuck fighting. It is possible to escape the duel, but only after getting a sufficient distance away from the guard. In order to alleviate this problem, there should be a button to break out of a duel immediately, instead of clumsily trying to break out of the sequence.PROS: While that part of the combat system annoys me, I will give it credit for being there more as a fail-safe seeing as the game is stealth based, as opposed to Assassins Creed where you can win a 1v20 fight in the middle of the street without a problem. If you get spotted by a guard you have the opportunity to dispatch them then hide before backup arrives.\nShadows. This aspect of the game makes it stand out from many other stealth games, as shadows in this game DO NOT render you completely invisible. They are their as a means of cover, and makes it harder to spot you at a distance, but if a guard gets to close and spots you, he will be alerted, or at least begin noticing you.\nStyx himself. The character of Styx is interesting, he has a sort of roguish charm about him, as he is incredibly sarcastic. As mentioned before the voice acting is pretty darn good for him and I've come to really like the character and the lore that surrounds him.\nLast but not least, the levels. Oh my God the LEVELS. They are incredibly expansive, giving you multiple ways to reach an objective, for pretty much every objective, not just 2 but maybe even 3 or 4 or 5 ways. The quickest way may be wrought with danger, but if you keep your eyes out you may find a shortcut around the danger, or you can try to sneak your way through the most direct route, or maybe instead of sneaking, why not drop that chandelier above the guards? And while the others come to investigate, quietly make your way by them. The levels also have a lot of verticality, meaning you can climb to higher areas above the enemies, or even sneak your way below in some sewer tunnel you found. The levels are anything but linear, and allow for you to discover and explore the tower you are in.\nAll in all a fantastic stealth game, lots of stealth, and you get punished if you get impatient or make a wrong move, just the way a stealth game should be. I don't like number based systems of rating since there are to many aspects to fit into one number, but I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves a solid stealth game or even RPG as the story is also pretty awesome even if it does seem cliche at the beginning ;) ( play it and you'll know what I mean). Slight ledge issues and combat aside, this game blew my mind seeing as I bought this without expecting much.","September 6, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each charpter is divided into 4 levels that function as sanfboxes you can freely navigate.Since i was trying to playthrough without being detected I didn't have parry timing down at first for these encounters, even though they are fairly easy, making these encounters a little furstrating. Some levels feel massive with many paths and optional objects, others are more closed in. The open nature of levels makes the spaces feel more real as you are not sneaking down a linear path from point A to point B, but rather navigating a castle however you please.\n\nThe game does have you replay each level, but with different entry and exit points. Additionaly, some areas/paths change and enemy placement is completely different. I find it still feels fresh. As stated earlier, levels are large and have multiple paths. Combined with the changed enemy placement and your natural development as a player (better understanding abilities and movement through the enviorment) revisting each area feels total different.\n\nAt first i felt the ability trees were rather combat focused and some branches useless, but I was just not understanding how to use my abilities. Now that I have most things unlocked ill probably chip away at 100%ing  Not sure why people complain about character movement/platforming in this game, maybe something got patched? You can play slow and methodically, exploring for alternative routes and learning guard patterns, or blitz through areas relying on your wits and abilities to keep you alive and unseen.\n\nThis game is a great deal in terms of content vs price given the quality of the gameplay. Its easily 15+ hours for a normal play through. Going non lethal pure sleath will likely take more.  While character models aren't the best, many of the enviorments look fantastic. Voice acting is not the best and lip sync in cutscenes is aweful, but the story is still interesting enough to keep me from skipping them (still, the switch from in engine cutscenes to comic book style still panels is greatly appreciated when it does take place). Given this game is not a AAA game and is not an expensive game I don't see any of the above issues being a problem\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it to people who like sleath games, but people who want to fight when detected will be disapointed since this is a steath game, not an action game or shooter with steath elements (go play shadow of mordor). LIkely my favorite steath game since dishonored... though I can't say ive play a huge number of steath games since most things mix steath with other gameplay elements.\n","December 16, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd much rather play in a giant sandbox where I can go anywhere I want in the world. I don't necessarily mean 'above ground' - simply that I would have preferred to play Styx wiht the entirety of Akenash open to me at all times, rather than being limited to whatever 'level' I am currently playing.\n\nBetter AI. There's really no jump in difficulty in any of the enemies until you get to the final level and face a handful of elve (and honestly, aside from not being able to kill them, the only difficulty is in getting past them undetected). The game needs more complex behavior by the enemies - being able to take cover, seek help/backup, better abilities, etc. They really are quite dumb, and become almost tediously predictable a few levels in. The difficulty in the game only arises from the manner in which these enemies are placed, and the game becomes more about discerning the geometry of how detection works. Detection itself could be enhanced and more nuanced.\n\nThe story started off great, but felt like it got more and more rushed, almost as if the writers were suffering from fatigue, as you get to the end, and became incongruous/confusing in parts. I think this is likely due to the low budget, so I am somewhat forgiving of it - gamplay matters to me much more in a game like this, and this game has superb gameplay.\n\nA greater variety and diversity of enemies would have been cool. The humans, dumb AI aside, were fairly diverse - there  are a number of different enemies with slightly different abilities, although it always boils down to getting caught or not. I would have liked to see a little more diversity in abilities among the humans (the frost casting knights are a good example - need more along those lines), and an overall larger bestiary. Giant spiders, baby dragons, and other nasties would have been cool to add variety to the game. The elf 'damned' (spirits) were my least favorite enemy in the game.\n\nStill, for it's flaws, it's an incredibly value at $30 (and sometimes on sale). It took me roughly 70 hours to play, and I restarted around the third level to play it on the hardest difficulty. Definitely a good value, and I hope to see a sequel, with more polish this time.\n\nEdit: I'm super stoked to learn that there's going to be a sequel in 2016!!! So happy about this, can't wait to see what they add.","May 12, 2015","true","67.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A few "undocumented features" (ie. bugs) where jumping from one platform to another will totally ignore the landing and you'll fall, taking unnessary damage, and also another where you're trying to creep to a ledge and drop to hang on the side and instead you plumet to your death.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/242640/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3257 products in account","Styx: Master of Shadows is a stealth game with bits of action and is described to have “RPG” elements. The game takes place in a fantasy setting set in the same universe as Of Orcs and Men. This game I believe to be the prequel to Of Orcs and Men.  Styx takes place in the Tower of Akenash. The main goal. To reach the world tree.  Seems pretty straight forward. Especially for a Goblin like creature who can stealth, scale walls, and puke up clones.\n\nThe game play itself  is very much all about playing stealthy. If you get caught there seems to be very few options you have at the start of the game but that opens up a bit through out the game as you unlock new abilities and spent skill points.  The stealth for the most part works pretty well. You can be spotted by sight or sound so it is important to not walk into buckets or furniture because you can knock them over and that makes sound. You can also walk on certain kind of surfaces that create noise. There are even lighting effects in the game that can get you caught from people seeing your shadow or just brightening and area up so they can see you. You have the options of putting out torches with your hands or using consumable balls of sand to throw at the fire from a distance. There is strategy to be had when using them as you can often use the sand on a torch to cause a distraction. You can also kill someone and use their corpse as a distraction. The stealth mechanics of the game rival that of Thief and Hitman. Hiding in closets to setup ambushes or just hiding. You can even hide the corpses of your enemies in them as well.  The stealth mechanics are some of the best of any recent stealth game available on PC.\n\nThat is where the game shines. However the combat of the game if you can call it that is just flat out horrendous. It is mostly time based parrying. Different enemies require different amounts of parry before you get the option to kill them. Almost QTE based. I often found my camera locked into confrontation and it usually led me to be killed which was extremely annoying. Again the main goal being stealth in the game. You can stealth kill people, and there are different ways of doing it but the straight head to head combat is so bad it should just be avoided at all costs. I can say I give the game props for not having INSTANT fail mechanics when being spotted but sometimes it felt like it was instant fail because of how bad the actual combat is. Getting stuck in a locked camera when fighting. Having to parry. You parry and then get whacked on by other guys while animating. It really felt like the game was broken in that aspect. Clearly your meant to not get caught.\n\nThe level design is pretty grand. Large open levels to roam around in and use as your playground. It adds variety in play. Your not stuck using this one path which I suppose can add to replay value. Either way it adds options and strategy to your game play.  In most cases there are many ways to reach your goals. That is something we all want when we play a game and not just another hallway simulator.\n\nThe game has some decent voice work and the sound work is pretty crisp.. The graphics aren’t and I say this loosely “next gen material” but they are still pretty good. There isn’t much to praise nor is there much to talk about in regards to these. They are what they are. They work. They don’t  add nor subtract from the game itself.\n\nThe story of the game is very cryptic. It’s almost a narrative but not really at the same time. Styx is being held captive and telling this story of his plan and what he was thinking. Then you see it happen / play it out. Ultimately catching up to time for the plan to come together…. We all love it when a plan comes together. It isn’t the best writing in the world but it isn’t the worst. It is nice to not always have a linear story and it often felt out of place. Then you get to that point in the story and your like…. Oohhhhhhhh!!!  Overall it was a solid story.\n\nStyx feels more like a Thief sequel than the recent Reboot of the Thief series.  I believe that is what they were going for. The game claims to have role playing game elements. If playing a role and having skill points is role playing game elements then sure. Aside from that. Not really.  I would have loved for this game to have been an action game but it really isn’t.  I would have loved for this game to be more like Of Orcs and Men (which by the way is fantastic.) It wasn’t. It never claimed to be so I can’t hold that against them. I do hope they continue to make games in this universe and I sincerely hope they release a sequel to Of Orcs and Men in the future. Every new game the studio makes gets better and better. Learning and evolving. That is an important aspect in the gaming industry and I commend our boys over at Cyanide for that.  They are also updating the game and fixing the game based on community feedback which again is very important at this age of the industry.\n\nIn all the game isn’t ground breaking. It is listed as an action game and while I get Stealth isn’t a “legit” genre I just have all kinds of issues calling it an action game because of how bad the action itself is. I really found myself getting stuck up on that. It really brings the rest of the game down. The stealth bits of the game are fantastic but … The acti…er… Lack of is just NOT GOOD. For that we give this game….\n\nA Drastik Measure 7.2/10   (6.0 and Higher = Reccommend)\n\nWe do think this game deserves a go. The stealth alone is really good and needs to be experienced. The price is pretty decent for only being $29.99 at launch. I would say wait for a sale but definitely pick it up and support them eventually.\n\nhttp://thedrastikmeasure.com/2014/10/20/styx-master-of-shadows-pc-review/","October 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

I say that only a bit seriously because even though I really did like playing this game, its many bugs and glitches sort of got to me over my playthrough. Even though I do say that about the game, I still really did love Styx: Master of Shadows, and for it's $30.00 price point it is definitely a game worth your while.\n\nThe level design in this game is absoutely gorgeous, I loved looking at al the environments and realizing how much detail they actually put into it (and even if you have a lower end PC it will still look pretty good). Even though this amazed me, I was quite disappointed that after the halfway point through the game there is almost no new levels except for extended areas of previous levels.\n\nAs for the AI, I found it kind of spotty. Sometimes they noticed you from halfway across the map while other times they were blind when you were five feet away. They also would sometimes teleport into the next room when they were on alert, and I think some real cleaning up could be done in this aspect.\n\nAs for the different features such as the skills and items, I really liked them. They didn't make the game "easier" persay, but really seemed to add more depth, strategy, and different thinking into levels as enemies became more unforgiving. As mentioned before, the enemies do actually get tougher, and when you can't kill enemies by conventional means you can really start to get creative.\n\nOne aspect of this game that I thought made it so great compared to other stealth titles I've played is that it really rewards patience and strategy. Every kill in this game is so satisfying because it is so easy to get caught if you don't know what you are doing and dive straight into the situation.\n\nI think the way I played the game was also beneficial to my 100% completion of it. If you are doing a 100% completion on the first run I would definitely say to look for all collectables and relics on the first time around. This not only makes it aa stress free experience, but lets you learn the maps a great deal. After you finish a mission that way go for all the other insignias in a second run.\n\nI won't get too much into the story, but I thought it was pretty decent. Better than quite a few games I've played recently. Really my only qualm was the final "boss" battle, which could've been done a lot better in my opinion, but otherwise pretty solid.\n\nIn conclusion I think that Styx: Master of Shadows is a great game, except for a few fundamental problems. I didn't like the reuse of levels and the buggy AI, but this was heavily countered by the rewarding gameplay and the beauty of the game. I think that if they had more new areas and cleaned up some of the mechanics this game would be one of my favorite games, and my favorite stealth game by far to say the least. Overall I give this game a 7/10, because even though it could've been better, it was still a very enjoyable experience.","November 7, 2014","true","52.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

A real diamond in the rough.  You can play it as you like, head on or in the shadows.  There are real challenges here that are satisfying when you reach the goal.\n\nA nice little story line but that is always secondary to me.  It's really just an excuse to tie a bunch of levels together.  And the levesl aren't small.  There are plenty of ways to get where you want to be.  The extra challenges make you explore more to get what you want.\n\nThis is a must for stealth fans, especially those that were dissapointed by the latest Thief.  The combat isn't great, but if you are in combat then you've done something wrong.  Sorry but it's true.  Search around some more and you wil find the path you need. And they are not obvious.\n\nOverall a great little game with a fun ugly little green hero.

A simple explanation would be Dishonored in third person, but you're a goblin thief. Except it's much more than that.\n\nThe gameplay focuses heavily on stealth elements, and the climbing is reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. The character (Styx) can create a clone to provide distractions so you can get away safely, or you can simply become invisible to get away from a group of guards, because unlike in Assassin's Creed, Styx can't handle a full batallion of guards or so and get away completely unscathed. As such, it tells you that you need to be undetected as much as possible, though you can handle the occasional single guard or two (After reloading your save a few times, of course.). It uses the Unreal Engine, so the graphics are pretty stellar, and I've yet to find any SD textures.\n\nI preordered the game, and it was completely worth it. I haven't had this much fun in a stealth game since I played through Dishonored, and Dishonored was amazing. The voice acting is good, and the voices fit the characters well. Though, in the game engine cutscenes the lip syncing isn't that great, but it's ignorable, and besides, the rest of the game makes you forget the lip syncing issues.","October 11, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will have to sneak in the shadows and avoid the temptation to kill everyone in order to play this game. This is the games games biggest strength though. The focus on pure stealth gameplay has allowed the developers to really focus on making the stealth gameplay varied moment to moment. The game has a large variety of enemy types (for example: guards that can see you but then also bugs that have really good hearing) and the way the enemy types "play" together make for some tense situations that force you to change up your strategy. Sometimes you will have to be slow and methodical, other times fast and risky, maybe even have to kill a dude. While the whole game is stealth, it's stealth in different ways.\n\nBut variety doesn't play out in every aspect of the game. You will revisit many of the same locations. While this may be a problem with some people, I actually wasn't to bothered by it. The areas are very well designed with tons of vertical movement and plenty of nooks and crannys to explore.There are so many different ways you will have to sneak around the environment that the levels do play differently. Overall, the level design trumps the repetition in my opinion.\n\nThe story is no slouch either. the protagonist is fun to watch. He is as crude as a middle schooler and a tad mean spirited. Not a shining beacon of morality like many protagonists and that makes the story better. He is only concerned with himself and you think that would be annoying, but it's not. Overall I would say the story, while not presented in the best way (cutscenes are a series of ok paintings and dialouge) it is an enjoyable ride.\n\nNow the game has a few flaws. The controls are not the tightest, the textures are pretty bad, and the checkpoints are brutal (you're going to be spamming the save function to get around this). But overall I enjoyed this game and I think those who really like stealth games will too. Worth the buy.\n\n","October 18, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The stealth mechanics are not too shabby, but it's missing kill animation variety and some stealth move polishing IMO. It gets repetitive to say the least. If you get spotted, you prolly gonna die, which isn't  a bad thing since you are supposed to sneek around, silly. However, the mechanics of the toe to toe combat did not score any points with me, nor did the graphics in some parts, it was as if they just didn't really care about how some of the characters looked.\n\nOne big complement to the game however, is that it was designed with seemingly endless options for going about your stealthy business: nooks, crannies, ledges, hiding places, scalable walls, tunnles... quite impressive really. This added alot to the fun factor IMO.\n\nSo, if you havent played any of the ground breaking stealth games of this generation, I would say go ahead and pick this one up. It's fairly simple, has a good story, enough elements of good stealth play and cheesy humor to keep a younger, or perhaps more novice/naive gamer interested (just to clarify that I'm not a hater, I love cheese).\n\nOn the other hand:\nIf you have been keeping up with the latest and greatest of the stealth genra it's kinda like playing skyrim and then taking the first Two Worlds for a spin. Ya it's cool, kinda, ok not really. All I'm saying is that you may have a hard time turning to poorly prepared, chewy grissley carne asada after devouring a delicious FILET MIGNON! At least during the same day.\n\nOh, and if your very young, don't play this game cus, *stammering* cus the bad goblin says bad, bad words!

The stealth mechanics are not too shabby, but it's missing kill animation variety and some stealth move polishing IMO. It gets repetitive to say the least. If you get spotted, you prolly gonna die, which isn't  a bad thing since you are supposed to sneek around, silly. However, the mechanics of the toe to toe combat did not score any points with me, nor did the graphics in some parts, it was as if they just didn't really care about how some of the characters looked.\n\nOne big complement to the game however, is that it was designed with seemingly endless options for going about your stealthy business: nooks, crannies, ledges, hiding places, scalable walls, tunnles... quite impressive really. This added alot to the fun factor IMO.\n\nSo, if you havent played any of the ground breaking stealth games of this generation, I would say go ahead and pick this one up. It's fairly simple, has a good story, enough elements of good stealth play and cheesy humor to keep a younger, or perhaps more novice/naive gamer interested (just to clarify that I'm not a hater, I love cheese).\n\nOn the other hand:\nIf you have been keeping up with the latest and greatest of the stealth genra it's kinda like playing skyrim and then taking the first Two Worlds for a spin. Ya it's cool, kinda, ok not really. All I'm saying is that you may have a hard time turning to poorly prepared, chewy grissley carne asada after devouring a delicious FILET MIGNON! At least during the same day.\n\nOh, and if your very young, don't play this game cus, *stammering* cus the bad goblin says bad, bad words!

Graphics are pretty good and the story is great, but other aspecets are spotty. The combat system is unique in a way that you cannot kill the enemy without parrying one of their attacks to render then off guard which is pretty cool in my opinion. The parkour and general movement seem to leave something to be desired. The overall movement of your character is basically trying to play the ice level on mario, in other words your character handles like a stick of butter. I also find that when jumping down from ledges you grab onto things near you even if you had no intention of doing so.

This is the developers first type of game like this and they did a great job with scenery and character design. So I really am looking forward to the developers next few games. So even though this review sounds like I'm giving a thumbs down, I'm not. I'm just telling the developers what they should improve on, because this game isn't bad.)\n\nHonestly, this game isn't horrible. It's just your basic stealth game. Combat isn't fun and feels unfinished. The stealth is the same everytime. Sneak up behind someone, kill them, hide behind a corner, etc. The stealth kills aren't fun like in hitman. This game you just stab someone and move on. No different ways in killing someone, you can muffle someone or just stab them..which gets very repetitive. The scenery in the game is beautiful and the character design is interesting. There's pros to this game and there's cons. Even though this game has nice scenery and interesting character design, the game lacks an interesting story. But in my opinion, for this type of game, that doesn't matter. Hitman for example has a pretty cliche' story (Hitman Absolution atleast), but is still a very fun game. Executing enemies in Hitman is very enjoyable. Well in Styx, executing enemies just gets boring, like I've said before, this game is just stab or muffle someone and move on. I really did try to enjoy this game because I saw all of the great reviews, but I really just couldn't get into this game. But, I can see why some people would enjoy this game. Also let me just say, this is the developers first time making a game like this. And honestly this game isn't bad, just repetitive. So I honestly can't wait to see how the developers will improve on their next few games.\n\nWhat you just read sounds like a bad review. But it's not. This review says not recommended, but that does not mean this game is bad. I just didn't really get into the stealth/combat, plus this is just some things the developers can improve on.\n\n6/10","December 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

But in the mean time enemies are becoming harder, their path have changed and most of all, the midgame twist makes the story very interesting.

Almost immediately, I was beset with a bug where I created a clone, destroyed it  and then couldn't move again.  Considering how long this game has been out, I think this is unforgivable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/242640/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Whew, so this game was kind of a struggle to the finish for me. I did beat it though.\n\nStyx: Master of shadows has you playing a goblin in a stealth action setting similar to thief except minus the stealing things part and plus a lot to murdering everything. The storyline is interesting and the devs do a good job with pushing the narriative along which is mainly what got me through the whole game. Also the MC has a very tongue-in-cheek sarcastic view of the world and the dialogue/monologue has it's own brand of dark humor.\n\nThe stealth element of the game is absolutely central to the gameplay to the point where if you are discovered your chance of survival is very low especially if it's by two or more enemies. Normally in most stealth games this is not much of a problem because enemies are spaced out and have non-overlapping patrols, but in this game you will find areas to be VERY crowded, making traditional duck and weave navigation somewhat problematic. One of the mechanics, cloning (in which you make a duplicate of yourself with limited abilities) assists with this somewhat and even offers the chance when upgraded to set lethal traps for enemies. However, I found myself using it most of the time just to alert guards and get them to chase it so that I could pass areas in a reasonable amount of time. Most of the other abilities are somewhat useless. Invisibility costs A LOT of amber to use and only lasts a short while, and the combat skills are really only useful in 1v1 situations and don't help against hardened enemies like the knights or elves. So basically, you either pull entire rooms using your clone (easy & fast) or try and systematically eliminate targets until the way is clear (very very slow/difficult). Overall though, the crowdedness makes it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to stealth missions.\n\nSpeaking of the enemies, the AI is very quirky and patrols seem very easy to glitch. Sometimes a path that an enemy takes 3 times in a row suddenly differs on the 4th for no apparent reason. I would think this is a feature except it also does things like teleport around during alerts and some enemies will even get stuck in corners or between objects indefinitely (for no reason!).\n\nThe levels in this game are pretty huge, which seems like a truly impressive feat at first until you realize you spend the second half of the game backtracking all the way through them which I found to be kind of boring and a bit lazy design-wise. That being said, the overall design is nice and I would enjoy them more if it weren't for the last beef I have with this game: the controls.\n\nControlling your character in this game can be a literal nightmare if you decide to go running around in high places. Targeted jumps to wall sconces work maybe 80% of the time and if you don't have your camera and directional tilted the exact way you will miss by a fair margin. Performing safe falls (e.g. lowering yourself until you are hanging by your hands and then dropping) is almost entirely guesswork and you may find yourself accidentally climbing all the way back up, potentially exposing yourself to danger. Also the corner turning is very awkward and the corner kill feature isn't very obvious as to what distance you can do it at (more guesswork). Simply put, the controls for this game, while adequate, can be frustrating as hell in tense situations where every second matters.\n\nAnyways, I _would_ recommend this game to someone if the devs were to fix the majority of my abovementioned gripes. Maybe even a fan-made patch could do it. In its current state though, I would recommend giving it a pass unless you are a die-hard fan of stealth games.","July 13, 2015","false","22.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

First Styx was awesome with some cons; there is no drop option while standing on the edge of something. The game gives you 2 option, you can go without kill by sneaking or you can kill. Same options as Thief games have, killing is not neccessary to complete.\n\nLevels of Styx are all same. Same tricky secret passages, jumping challanges, sneakings however with more enemy while you continue the game. More more enemies, and more tough ones. I don't have problem with difficulty but, I need to be sneaky and move fast around corners right? - NOPE - Because every tricky part has roaches, roaches can here every step unless you walk very slow. So, I need to walk slower than a snail against more enemies with using same methods over and over and over.\n\nAbilities are kind a good, but not usefull enough. I opened corner kill and aerial kill for sneaky kills, however 20 roaches can hear me killing and climb 4 floors to find me to jump on. However, giant roaches+men+elves+orcs are all big family and they just want to ♥♥♥♥ you up, they never attack each other. While these ♥♥♥♥ faces kill you together, abilities gives you 1 extra throwing knife or 1 extra potion, really?\n\nI am really bored for now, maybe an another month I will finish this game. Because it became a maze runner, not a stealth game and I don't think I can complete the game without alerting something. Laslty, posioning food/water idea is awesome. This game fcked up my mind, I loved it and hated it same time.","January 3","false","14.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Requiesta de Silencia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncrownedPrince91/","242 products in account","Check out my fully detailed review here.[uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]\n\nThe entire game is riddled with problems.\n\nFirst, elves. These are enemies you can only kill with throwing knives or aerial attacks as they detect you based on distance rather than on anything you've learned to avoid up to that point. They appear at the very end of the game meaning you have no controlled environment to learn how to kill them, and aerial attacks are locked behind a skill. So one of your only two methods of dealing with them is locked away for... reasons?\n\nSecond, every enemy in the game. The AI is just terrible. There are times when I placed a clone in a chest and whistled from the other side of the room. Where does the enemy look for the source of the noise? Well obviously the chest! The chest 10 meters away from the whistling. Because logic. And that's when they're not walking into each other, messing up their patrol routes and making it impossible to sneak past them without invisibility or slaughter.\n\nThird, the controls. Everything in this game is extremely finnicky. Some of the jumps you have to make are obstructed by objects over your head that you can't avoid. You just have to hope that Styx understands from your instructions to avoid smashing his head into the chandlier. Sometimes he will, sometimes he'll fall to the ground and get tramped by guards. It's also up to luck whether or not you'll pull off things like aerial assaults or covered kills in certain areas.\n\nFourth, there are very few autosave points per level. And considering how finnicky a lot of the controls and jumps can be in this game that means you're going to die and go right back to the start of the level a lot. It's a little sad when Half Life Source has better autosave than a game released in this modern age.\n\nFinally, the final boss is disappointingly pathetic. As in the only way they could think of to ramp up the difficulty was to make the final boss near impossible without a full bar of amber plus several amber potions. Yes, it's that type of boss. Not a boss that tests everything we've learned and used up to that point but a boss that ramps up the difficulty by being a specific type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t while you play the adventure game logic of figuring out how the developers wanted you to beat this guy. It's frustrating to the point that I'm almost certain most of the reviewers giving this a high score never actually played the game to completion before giving it their glowing recommendation. It's worth docking 2-3 points off any score for.\n\nInstead of a score I'll just say this. Styx: Master of Shadows is worth around $15.00 USD. There's enough to like about the game to enjoy it if you get it at that price but not anything close to the base price.","February 15","false","18.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But it's marred by a thousand small issues that make it a pain to play.  It sucks but these issues make the game more bothersome than its worth, at least to me.  For example, there are times when you are met with a challenge, and something glitches so that you can't do what you want.  Some of the hideouts in the game are inaccessible because of poor hitbox placement.  It kills me when I see small bugs like that ruining my gameplay experience.  Another issue that irks me is sometimes an enemy will stumble upon a fallen comrade and slip into a nonstop loop of calling for help.  It's funny the first few times but it did start to bother me after a while.\n\nI've had issues where I kill an enemy in just the right spot for me to do it stealthily, then when the kill is done, the guy's body glitches and flings itself a few feet forward, warning all the people in the room of my presence and ruining my careful plots.  In a stealth game, I love trying to plan my route and carefully kill targets, but glitches like this destroy the experience for me.  I don't know whether this game was rushed at the end of development or if the devs just didn't care to clean up the bugs.  Either way, it's *just* enough of a problem that I'm going to stop playing.\n\nIf you can deal with issues like these, please play this game.  It's a wonderful experience.

It's definitely a challenge -- Thief-style map (i.e. has no "you are here" marker), lots of objects to accidentally knock over, limited inventory and highly-sensitive guard AI. The highlight of the game for me is that there are tons of ways to make your way from Point A to Point B in this game; There doesn't seem to be a "golden path", or even "alternative paths" -- you feel as if you're forging your own path every time. On a related note, the levels are enormous, and the level design is fantastic (in my opinion). Environment/world design is interesting and pleasing to the eye as well.\n\nThere are a few significant flaws, which might be a dealbreaker for some: dialogue and storyline are lackluster, graphics are nothing to write home about (Unreal 3), combat is clunky (but do you really want to be getting into combat?), NPC AI is kind of dumb most of the time (but predictable, at least -- also, I saw in the credits that they only had one poor soul working on AI... that sucks!), and Assassin's Creed-esque ledge-grabbing doesn't always work the way you want it to. Also, I had the same complaint about Dishonored, but the "stats" screen that shows number of kills, number of people alerted, etc., only comes up at very end of each multi-part level. That can be really painful when you're trying achieve a "no alert, no kill" run.\n\nDespite the game's flaws, Styx: Master of Shadows is exactly what the doctor ordered, and has some serious replayability value.

Styx: Master of Shadows is an enjoyable stealth game for the price.  What I like about it is the sense of it being different: you are a goblin in a world of men; not a second class or even a third class citizen: you are a monster.  And yet Styx, the protagonist, is not the evil creature that goblins are so often portrayed as in common fantasy...he is an anti-hero, but not vile.\n\nI liked the style of the game: the castle settings are very intricate: it's a maze of tunnels, stairways, balconies, ledges, etc...if you like climbing and skulking and choosing the best path, you will enjoy this game.\nI found the stealth mechanic to be fairly balanced...you have to be careful: they will see you if you are too close, even if it is in the shadows, so you reallly have to time your movements...and if you kick over a bucket, you will arouse suspicion and the guards will quickly investigate.\n\nIf you are looking for Assassin's Creed combat, you will not find it here, in the least...combat is about timing your parries to block strikes from the guards; if you do it poorly, the hits will take a massive chunk of heath out.  If you do it well, and block two parries, this will "unbalance" the guard and your next move will be a simple kill move (at least in the beginning levels).\n\nTwo words: avoid combat.  You will live longer.\nKills, if you have to, are  made from behind...remember, you are  strong, but you are a goblin the size of a five year old or   something similar, in a world of heavily armored and armed guards.\n\nWhat I don't like is the vagueness of the plot: Styx needs to steal the Heart of the Tree, and I really don't know why yet...\nAlso, the ledge detection takes some getting used to, but I think that I'm getting the hang of it after dying cheaply from casual leaps to what should have been safety, but turned out to be plunges into the abyss...\n\nSound effects are detailed and good; you need to be able to hear what is going on to know what to avoid.\n\nMusic is atmospheric and well suited to the game.\n\nI recommend this game, especially for the price.","October 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The pacing of each place did not allow the constant use of the cliche "wait in the shadows", which has plagued enough stealth games to cause many players to just camp in a spot for minutes on end. No, you had to time your movements and actions and you definitely would be punished for being spotted. Even more so if you try to stay!\n\nThere were some odd tidbits that has annoyed me: sometimes Styx would climb up the flame pyres next to him when I wanted to fall to the floor below, but these were so few and far between that the whole experience can be considered enjoyable!\n\nAnd don't just assume that it's the game mechanics you're buying into.

It's definitely a challenge -- Thief-style map (i.e. has no "you are here" marker), lots of objects to accidentally knock over, limited inventory and highly-sensitive guard AI. The highlight of the game for me is that there are tons of ways to make your way from Point A to Point B in this game; There doesn't seem to be a "golden path", or even "alternative paths" -- you feel as if you're forging your own path every time. On a related note, the levels are enormous, and the level design is fantastic (in my opinion). Environment/world design is interesting and pleasing to the eye as well.\n\nThere are a few significant flaws, which might be a dealbreaker for some: dialogue and storyline are lackluster, graphics are nothing to write home about (Unreal 3), combat is clunky (but do you really want to be getting into combat?), NPC AI is kind of dumb most of the time (but predictable, at least -- also, I saw in the credits that they only had one poor soul working on AI... that sucks!), and Assassin's Creed-esque ledge-grabbing doesn't always work the way you want it to. Also, I had the same complaint about Dishonored, but the "stats" screen that shows number of kills, number of people alerted, etc., only comes up at very end of each multi-part level. That can be really painful when you're trying achieve a "no alert, no kill" run.\n\nDespite the game's flaws, Styx: Master of Shadows is exactly what the doctor ordered, and has some serious replayability value. Definitely worth the price.","October 11, 2014","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Styx: Master of Shadows is an enjoyable stealth game for the price.  What I like about it is the sense of it being different: you are a goblin in a world of men; not a second class or even a third class citizen: you are a monster.  And yet Styx, the protagonist, is not the evil creature that goblins are so often portrayed as in common fantasy...he is an anti-hero, but not vile.\n\nI liked the style of the game: the castle settings are very intricate: it's a maze of tunnels, stairways, balconies, ledges, etc...if you like climbing and skulking and choosing the best path, you will enjoy this game.\nI found the stealth mechanic to be fairly balanced...you have to be careful: they will see you if you are too close, even if it is in the shadows, so you reallly have to time your movements...and if you kick over a bucket, you will arouse suspicion and the guards will quickly investigate.\n\nIf you are looking for Assassin's Creed combat, you will not find it here, in the least...combat is about timing your parries to block strikes from the guards; if you do it poorly, the hits will take a massive chunk of heath out.  If you do it well, and block two parries, this will "unbalance" the guard and your next move will be a simple kill move (at least in the beginning levels).\n\nTwo words: avoid combat.  You will live longer.\nKills, if you have to, are  made from behind...remember, you are  strong, but you are a goblin the size of a five year old or   something similar, in a world of heavily armored and armed guards.\n\nWhat I don't like is the vagueness of the plot: Styx needs to steal the Heart of the Tree, and I really don't know why yet...\nAlso, the ledge detection takes some getting used to, but I think that I'm getting the hang of it after dying cheaply from casual leaps to what should have been safety, but turned out to be plunges into the abyss...\n\nSound effects are detailed and good; you need to be able to hear what is going on to know what to avoid.\n\nMusic is atmospheric and well suited to the game.\n\nI recommend this game, especially for the price.","October 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Possibly the worst goblin and only goblin, Not only is he (possibly) the only goblin, but he like us were created without seeming purpose, and the search for said purpose is the main drive - and proper plot - of this story.\n\nWhile the gameplay mechanics reinforce the frailty of our shorter-than-short protagonist (antagonist?) is the main selling point, what really drives this game home, is the EXCELLENT writring by Cyanide, that has proven time and time again that they can make a true character driven game - aside from their yearly pro-cycling installment (which by the way, also is hallmark)\n\nYou are the assassin Styx, through and through, which is a rare thing to say these days.\n\nCyanide has come a long way since the '12 installment of Game of Thrones (which again, was a really good story for Fans of the series) and they show no sign of stopping.\n\nPersonally, I could do with more stories from the ultra-cynical-only-out-for-himself-trick-or-die-goblin Styx, and maybe if we're lucky. the Bloodjaw clan.\n\n\nMake no mistake however, these games are - unlike the Telltale Games variant which might be classified as interactive novels - full-blown video game (camera over) shoulder to shoulder, and I could not be happier about that fact.","July 1, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I havent played that much yet but enough to know i like it. Interesting maps with lots of options, and good gameplay. The only thing i dont like is the combat lock. I can understand they didnt want to make things to easy, but it feels like a very strange mechanic. Basically once discovered and engaged you cant run away, well as good as. Instead, you get to die. Its not a game killer, and is a very deliberate mechanic to force you to be careful. No run and 'gun' assassin's creed chicken running here. So for a game that kills you alot, random guard positioning would also have been nice to keep things fresh on that 3rd run through. Maybe next time.\n\nDispite this being a list of things i dont like, i do like this game overall and would recommend it to stealth fans.\n\nSolid buy if bought in a sale, now often being offered at 60% off. On the strength of this i will definately be buying Styx 2 if/when it comes out.","July 3, 2015","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm glad that Styx just sticks to good old stealth mechanics and it definitely reached it's only goal - to be a good stealth game.\n\nStyx brings very classic stealth mechanics with few inovations. You can perform several types of stealth kills, you can hide dead bodies into closets, chests, etc, if you see the guard pee-sing (anticensor :D ) from the edge of the rampart, you can actualy kick him down :)\nIn adition to conventional mechanics known from similar games, Styx comes with kinda RPG element - you can improve your skills, so you can kill your enemies by more effective ways.....or you can choose to be a merciful kind thief and let everyone live :)\n\nIf you like stealth games, and you loved games like Tenchu, MGS and Splinter Cell, Styx definitely worth a try :)","October 5, 2015","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is one of the most unique and excellently crafted fantasy universe and storyline I have ever experienced. It's advanced-medieval style, creature design, character clothing and inclusion of such elements as flying ships and vast bottomless pits is extremely comparable to the series of novels, "The Edge Chronicles", by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddel. Although intended for a younger audience similar to Harry Potter and Percy Jakcson, the series far surpasses them with its intriguing, mature, and sometimes macabre universe and story. Its dark, and masterfully crafted illustrations help propel the written text to higher planes of wonderous excellence It is most certainly a book series that would be better enjoyed by an adult audience. I can not say for certain if Styx is influenced by The Edge Chronicles , but the similarities are there. If you enjoyed either the game or the book series, I would most certainly recommend the other. Or, if youre simply interested in a fascinating fantasy game, I would recommend Styx: Master of Shadows.","September 14, 2015","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Still, I feel that's enough time to at least provide a little bit of feedback.\n\nI've read some of the negative reviews. Many of them state the biggest downfall of this game being it's controls. Clunky, non-responsive and generally lacking accuracy of intention, seem to be the most common complaints. Most of those reviews are a few months old, and I am aware the game has recently been updated/patched, so I don't know if that will account for my difference in opinion, as I did not play Styx prior to it being updated. However, I will give my input on the game in it's current state (as of 18DEC2014). Please note, I am playing my first play-through on "Goblin" difficulty (the highest difficulty level, unless there are unlockable difficulties... I don't know if that's the case.)\n\n(Read other reviews if you need a description of the world and style of Styx... I ran out of room, so cut that portion from my review.)\n\nGraphics - 7/10: The graphics in this game are pretty good. Not top notch for such a new title, but the game is definitely not an eyesore. The models are decent, if not spectacular, and Styx is very well designed. Most of the textures in the game are a tad sub-par (with the exception of Styx), but there could be any number of reason why the developers chose to use lower quality textures. Even so, they aren't bad, per-se, and all but the most hardcore graphics snobs won't take issue with the graphical quality of the game. I barely consider them to be any issue, whatsoever. All that said, the enviroment is beautifully rendered and fairly immense in scale.\n\nSound - 8/10: The sound effects, ambient sounds, and idle dialogue of the game really do justice to the title. They are immersive and believable. Some of the cutscene dialogue feels a little forced at times, but it's by no means bad. The musical scores are good. Opinions will vary, some think the music is fantastic! I think they are "good". They fit the feel of the game and don't distract or detract from anything, but I personally don't find myself wowed by them. Still, they are well done and I pay more attention to other features... I'm not really a sound snob.\n\nAnimations - 6/10: The animations in Styx, over all, are passable. That is to say, there are some fantastic animations, and some very lackluster ones. The developers obviously spent a LOT more time focusing on the gameplay animations specific to the Styx character, but some of the NPC animations, and most of the cutscene animations, in particular the cutscene WALKING animations, feel a bit slapped together and choppy. For a recently released, mainstream title, I would expect the animations to be a lot more smooth, especially in the cutscenes, where the developers had complete control. This is, in my opinion, the part of the game I find the most lackluster. However, having said all that, I still don't think the animations, over all, are bad... definitely not so bad as to ruin the game in any way.\n\nGameplay/Control - 8/10: The controls in Styx are very good! Mind you, I use a keyboard and mouse combination, so I can't speak for how the game plays with a controller. The controls feel very responsive, and Styx always moves in the way I intended. The bad: Even those adept at third-person stealth titles may feel there is a slight learning curve. The game controls in a manner I find reminiscent of a combination of Deus Ex and Prince of Persia. The combination is good, but it takes a bit of time to master the way this little goblin moves. Additionally, as others have mentioned, when performing the wall climbing movements, there doesn't seem to be any reliable way of moving in a downward direction. If you point Styx down, he looks down, as if ready to move downward, but pressing the jump key (which moves you from one handhold to the next) does not cause him to drop down, instead causing him to leap upward (at least, this has been my experience). Once you get used to it, it's not that big a deal, but it can be a bit frustrating on occassion. The good: With the exception of downward on the wall crawling movements, Styx moves where you point him. Focusing on the wall movement (which is the most important aspect for the developers to actually get right, control-wise), If you point Styx up, he will move up (when you press Jump). If you point Styx left or right, he will leap left or right, accordingly. If you want Styx to move to a handhold which is up and to a side, you need to press up and to the side (diagonally). If you don't, you only have yourself to blame when you miss the handhold. This is where the learning curve comes in, so if you have difficulties with games like this, take some time to practice in the early stages! The ground movements are as you would expect; typical WASD movement scheme. Space to Jump, C to crouch/sneak, Shift to reduce movement speed (walk when upright, sneak slowly when sneaking), E to interact with items. LMB is used for Parry/Kill in combat, and stealth kills when you're sneaky (as you should be). RMB puts Styx in "hide" mode when he's near obstacles and walls. The number keys (1-5, I think) are used for Styx's various magical powers, acquired throughout the game. A note on Styx's clone power: Pressing the 1 key summons a clone, pressing 2 dismisses the clone. Once you've summoned the clone, you must press the 1 key AGAIN to switch from controlling Styx to controlling the clone (or vice-versa). I missed this at first, and it took me several minutes to figure it out. Hahaha!\n\nImmersiveness - 9/10: For me, this is possibly the most important factor of a game. Do I lose myself in the game? The answer is almost a resounding YES!!! The only reason this is not a 10/10 is due to some of the clunky animations (particularly those in the cutscenes), which serve as a firm slap in the face, at times, bringing you back into the real world as you think "Really? You couldn't make that look a LITTLE more smooth and realistic?" But even the occassionally clumsy animations don't spoil the immersion all that much. After a while, you just get used to it. Still, I wish the developers had spent a bit more time smoothing out some of the animations, especially in those cutscenes.\n\nOver All - 8/10: Styx: Master of Shadows is a solid stealth/action title. It's fun. It's immersive. It's beautifully rendered. And the sounds is great. If you're looking for a quality stealth game, one that turns fantasy on its ear, putting you in the role of the "monster", I HIGHLY recommend this. By comparison, I would rate this game higher than Thief, slightly higher than Dishonored, and only slightly lower than Deus Ex.\n\nOther notes: 1. Expect a learning curve! The controls are good, but they are not easy. Once you get the hang of gameplay, with a little practice, the controls are actually quite smooth and responsive. 2. Styx is not a fighter! Do NOT go into this game thinking you can power your way through a scenario if you mess up. On lower difficulties, you may be able to fight off an enemy or two, but in "Goblin" if you get in a fight, you ARE going to die. 3. There is profanity and killing in this title. If profanity and/or killing offends you, or you are considering this title for a young child, do NOT purchase this game.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.

There are way too many guards in one tiny area, with almost no potions or vials of amber anywhere.

The detection system is rubbish, if seen even the slightest bit they will immediantly attack no matter what, each enemy has 10/10 with their throwing knife skills meaning you will almost certainly die, for an 'agile' goblin he can barely "run" faster than a humans walk, the enemys have a unlimited amount of throwing knives/bolts. All these factors combine to a very difficult game thats barely enjoyable and very OP'ed enemys. The graphics id say are still quite impressive aswell as the texturing, the faces are quite detailess and I have seen greater detailing in games 4-5 years older than this game which was a down side.

Lets start for what its good, Styx: Master of Shadows brings fantasy to a whole other level, the representation of the typical fantasy races are amazing and really original, you will like the main character, you will love the setting, the art direction and even the story is quite good with very good plot twists.\n\nHowever this game fails miserably on the gameplay part, its horrible you will die many times because you wanted to do this and instead you did that, climbing, hiding, escaping you name it, the combat is frustrating the game really punishes you, in an unfair way, for not being stealthy because like that you will enter combat mode. The combat system is really bad, when troops are alerted, you enter a combat mode even if you dont want to, if you are escaping but pass close to a guard you will enter combat mode, to get out you have to peary the attacks of the enemies so when finally killing an enemy the animation leaves you completely vulnerable getting yourself killed by other enemies. Plus these enemies dont miss any long rage shot.\n\nThe leveling was a very lazy way to make a game (and possible spoiler alert) after say half a game you will do the same levels backwards however they are very open and there are many ways to pass through them.\n\nin conclusion : Styx: Master of shadows is a solid 6/10 (because i really apreciate the positives)","September 7, 2015","false","17.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(although for as far as I played it, maybe it does force you to kill somebody, but it'd have to do with the story.\n\n\nThe only thing maybe bad about it is that it might get a little repetitive about 8 hours into the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfamousroo/recommended/242640/","theinfamousroo","TheInfamousRoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfamousroo/","82 products in account","So after completely playing through the game, I have to say I enjoyed this game. Now this game does have it's issues. The difficulty is a bit overkill at times, the animations can be a bit wonky, the environments lack diversity, certain enemies can be downright frustrating, and ultimately the cover mechanics are a little glitchy.  Yet, despite those clear issues, I never found myself hating this game, and I'll tell you why. Deep down it has a little bit of "Sly 2: Band of Thieves" in it.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with that, let me explain. Sly 2: Band of Thieves was a stealth game centered around an anthropomorthic raccoon thief and his exploits. Those who have played it tend to love the game despite its small little faults here and there. People including myself love it because the game is so charismatic and gets it characters so close to perfect, that they just feel unique.\n\nAnd I see a little of that in this game. The voice actor of Styx nails his lines (especially in cinematics), and I just found myself loving the character as a whole. His sarcastic, mocking nature just carries him. The plot as well is beautifully written and is subtle enough to know how to keep the player interested and still actually say something of meaning.\n\nAll in all, if you can get past the sometimes frustrating flaws, there are some really cool things underneath. Give it a go if you are interested, was definitely worth the money I spent on it.","December 17, 2015","true","31.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thane_Mantis/recommended/242640/","Thane_Mantis","Thane_Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thane_Mantis/","62 products in account","Positives:\n+This is a hardcore stealth game. Whilst combat is always a possibility, it can be difficult to playthrough, especially with some enemies such as Inquisitors that you'll meet later on in the game. Some enemies cannot even be killed with direct combat so you'll either need another way to take em out or you'll have too straight up avoid them in order to survive.\n\nThere's even one type of enemy called the Roabie which may be blind, but can instead detect you with its hearing, putting tons of emphasis on moving slowly, stealthily and quietly in order to avoid them. "These critters are a nightmare."\n\n+A good amount of playtime. If you like me are a bit of an acheivement hunter, you'll be playing this game alot, there are alot of acheivements and Insignia's to unlock as you go throughout the Tower of Akenash. However if you dislike things getting repetitive, you may not be as happy with this as most Insignia's are only earnable by replaying through levels. So yeah, this can be a good or bad point depending on your own opinion really.\n\n+Vast open world. Whilst this isn't a literal open world game like Assassins Creed perhaps, this game comes close to one in my book. The levels are very expansive and are often cut into 3 or 4 sections. Within these individual sections are also multiple paths and so on that can be taken in order to progress.\n\n+Well implemented RPG Mechanics. The game features a pretty fun set of skill tree's to unlock that can help make progression through the game easier and more fun. These include more ways to kill your enemies or the ability to carry more equipment, like Vials of Life and Amber.\n\n+Awesome abilities. You get 3 abilities to help you playthrough the game. Cloning, Eagle, sorry, I mean Amber Vision, and Invisibility. Cloning and Invisibility do more or less exactly what you'd expect them to do. Clone yourself to help perform certain tasks. (This ability will likely be the most relied on throughout the game, as its probably the most useful.) And invisibility to help you sneak past gaurds or escape combat. (Don't rely on this trick as it consumes a ton of Amber.\n\nMeanwhile, Amber vision is, if Im honest, kinda seems like an AC rip-off of Eagle Vision. Nothing against the game, but lets face it. Tracking your enemies and so on, even through walls with later upgrades? Yeah, it kinda seems like it draws alot of\ninspiration from AC's Eagle Vision.\n\n+Good humour. Styx can be a pretty funny character and occasionally makes some remarks that can offer a quick laugh here and there.\n\n+Controls. The controls work pretty well on a PC keyboard so you wouldn't need to worry about any potential difficulty with them whilst playing the game.\n\n\nNegatives:\n-Story. For the most part, the story is pretty decent. Your playing as Styx  technically your playing as a clone who thinks he's Styx  as he wanders around Akenash trying to steal the "Heart of the Tree" from the elves and humans that are sort of fighting over it.\n\nHowever, once you get about midway through the game  you encounter the real Styx whom you had been working towards freeing from the prisons. Thats cool an all, but this triggers a new conflict between the clone of Styx and the real version that just doesn't really make alot of sense.\n\nTo summarise, you free Styx from the prisons, and the goblin you've been playing as learns he was a clone, and all of a sudden he thinks the real Styx was manipulating him. And so the rest of the game consist of you doing basically the exact same sh*t as before you freed the original Styx, but this time with the ultimate goal of killing the original Styx. Whilst this plot twist itself was pretty cool I suppose, it still doesn't really make alot of sense to me.\n\n-The second half of the game. OK, once you gotten past the plot twist that I mentioned above and all that, you have to do a few more missions before you reach the end of the game. However, these next few missions are you basically doing the same stuff as before, in the same levels, but you do the levels themselves in f*cking reverse.\n\nThe only real differences are the mission goals themselves being slightly different and the fact there are more gaurds present. But ultimarely, this recyling of past levels feels a little lazy to be frank, and if you dislike things getting repetitive, this will probably not sit too well with you.\n\n-Lack of checkpoints. If you are the kinda person that doesn't do quicksaving and reloading, the lack of checkpoints could be a source of immense fustration.\n\n-The game isn't always clear about what you can do. There are two abilities in the game that, unless you check the keyboard control maps, you may never learn about. One is the ability to whistle/make a noise to attract nearby gaurds, and the other is the smoke bomb for the clone. The game does not tell you about these abilities anywhere except for the control mapping.\n\nI actually went through the game thinking that the smoke bomb was bugged and didn't work. I only found out on the Steam forums how you had to press the number 3 on your keyboard to expend a little more amber in order to use this ability. Yet the 1 and 2 keys for controlling your clones are shown on the screen and they show you what they do.\n\nI had a similar problem with the lure noise. I only found out originally by watching the gameplay trailer on Youtube that there was a lure noise. And then I again learned from the Steam forums that you need to hold X to use this ability. For me, this was a huge fustration. Learning about extra abilities halfway through the game is ridiculous.\n\n-Enemy AI. This is probably my biggest criticism for this game. The AI in this game is kinda rubbish to be honest. I've seen multiple times where I've put enemies on alert. When this happens, if they pass other gaurds, they'll tell them to "Stay alert, somethings lurking around here." Then they'll go back on patrol.\n\nBut, if they get in close proximity to other gaurds as their telling them to stay alert, they'll get stuck in an infinite loop of telling each other to stay alert. Another time I saw two gaurds trying to go through a narrow doorway. One was going one way, and the other was going the otherway. So they collided with each other and both slid left and right as they tried to bypass each other. Whilst they glitches can be funny, they can also just be kind of stupid as well.\n\nThere was also a time when I was in the 5th level of the game. I sent a clone to distract some gaurds and lure them as far as I possibly could away too give me time to get through the area. This worked out well enough, but once the clone died, the gaurds didn't return to their normaly positions, they just stood where they were rather than going back on patrol.\n\nOverall Opinion:\nThe game itself is pretty decent and can offer alot of playtime. Like I've discussed above, there are a few issues that hold the game back a bit, and can be a huge source of annoyance in some cases, such as the hidden abilities and the buggered up AI.\n\nBut, if you can get past that, and the story of the game being a tiny bit all over the place, then you should be in for a good time. With any luck, most if not all of these issues will be ironed out by the time the sequel gets released.\nOverall, 7/10 for this game. Definetly worth a try, but you may wanna wait for a sale.","February 3","true","89.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One that could have been a Great sneaker, but sadly falls short in a few areas.\n\nPick it up on sale though and it's well worth it.\n\nThe level designs are some of the best I've seen, they are very large (especially for the genre) and very 3D, many you simply cannot do if you think only in 2 dimensions.\n\nMany reviews point to the combat system as the main weakness.. but that is tosh... you are a goblin, small and not strong compared to humans, you are supposed to die fast if you are caught! This is not assasins creed where you can take on 20+ men and merrily slash you way through then "blend in" to the crowd to escape! You can maybe fight of 2 people and do a runner... maybe... but the point is to be a "master of shadows" and not get caught! If you are fighting you are playing wrong!\n\nThe 2 main issues are the AI and the characterr movement, the AI is flaky at best, I've "triggered alarms" in sections of the level I've not even been, watched in amusement guards who can't see me and can't hear me run round like I just ran up and slapped one of them! Then you realise that this means you don't get an acheivment for said level and that impacts on your skills and you get annoyed! The movement is like the first Assasins Creed, where sometimes you go for a jump that should be makeable, but somehow isn't, till you try it the tenth time and now you do it, by magic, that can be frustrating.\n\nAll in all though it is worth perserveing with as the story is good, and humour abounds. Could have done better sure, but a Good game nontheless","October 26, 2015","true","28.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There were several mechanics that I did not agree upon, especially those damn bugs!\n\nWhat I also wasn't too big of a fan was the reusing of levels. First 3 missions were about running the levels in one way, the next 3 were about running the previous levels in opposite direction and the last mission had 3 sections used one more time + the "final battle area."\n\nSpeaking of the "final battle" and the story in general, (SPOILER WARNING) what you'd expect is a intense direct fight between the protagonist and antagonist, but not here. Instead you will fight a total of 6 evil clones that die on one hit each, BUT can kill you in matter of seconds. When the credits started rolling, I was simply asking: "What? That's it. There were also some gaps in the story which I wanted to hear and explanation to, like how did our Styx end up in the cell in the first place? And how did the original Styx become a gobblin? We see a piece of his origin and what ended up happening to him but that's it.\n\nAs for graphics, music and all that stuff, graphics are nice, yes, but it felt like it was there to sugarcoat the unpolished edges of the game. As for the music, while it was athmosperic from time to time, I tended to repeat itself a bit too often, but was still OK.\n\nOther mechanics that I wasn't a fan of include:\n\n-Combat (IMPORTANT!)\nIt's been a while since I've seen a combat system this bad. On paper it may have seemed nice, but in practise it's\njust horrible. Instead of pressing a button to lock-on to an enemy when you want to fight back, you'll be forced to\nduel with the enemy that has spotted you gets too close. No rolls or jumps will prevent it, and then the combat is\nnothing but timing left clicks. What makes this system worse that if there's more than one enemy that has spotted\nyou, the enemies that are not in combat with you will spam Throwing Knifes, which you cannot dodge and then\nusually end up killing you in 3 - 4 hits. And that doesn't include the Crossbowmen, which include the type\nCrossbowmen that can one-hit you on Normal Difficulty. I know that this is meant to be a stealth game, but there\nshould have been at least a BIT more concideration to combat as well.\n\n- Bugs and humans are friends?\nThe first time i tried to get the bugs and humans fight eachother, I was simply shocked. In what world mutated\nbugs that are bigger than cats can be friends with humans? Many times I got screwed over by the bugs that were\nrushing in while a guard was already closing in on me, leaving me there to get destroyed.\n\n- Ability to see token through everything.\nBeing able to see all the collectable tokens with upgraded Amber Vision throws away the whole point of hidden\ncollectables.\n- Unpolished detection by humans.\nExample #1: a servant cleaning up a floor, face directly down. Try sneaking past =>\ninstant spot.\nExample #2: When hanging on to a ledge and a guard comes around a corner, he does not detect your hands,\neven if he gets close enough for you to grab him, but if you decide to drop down while he's facing the ledge\nyou're hanging on to, it's almost always an instant spot.\n- No recovering of using Throwing Knifes-\nAt least give us a chance to get them back.\n- Use of Amber (aka mana).\nUsing Amber Vision and Clone spent roughly 1/10 of the Amber you had, but using those\ntwo abilities gives the Amber back if you use them right. You'll also always regenerate enough Amber to use\nClones and Amber Vision. Last skill Invisibility requires 50% of maximum amount of\nAmber (2x Invisibility from full Amber), but later can be upgraded to give back half of the Amber back. What that\ndid was actually give you only 3 instead of 4 Invisibilities, because using Invisibility always requires to have at\nleast 50% of maximum Amber.\n- Being the slave of vials.\nDue to the way how much Amber is consumed, you will always be hogging for Amber vials,\njust to have enough to keep you going.\n\n- Overall lack of abilities and upgrades.\nWhat we got were 3 abilities (Clone, Amber Vision and Invisibility), a total of 28 various upgrades and 5 items (Vial\nof Health, Vial of Amber, Vial of Acid, Throwing Knifes and Sand Balls) to accompany them. I would have loved to\nsee more abilities in the game and better upgrades then increasing your maximum amount of different vials\n(individually) from 2 to 3 for example. Also, where's the second clone we saw in a trailer?\n\n- A short game with basically no replay value.\nIt took me 46 hours to complete the game 100%. That includes doing all the achievements, where one of them\nrequires you to unlock every single upgrade. To unlock all the upgrades in turn require you to complete every\nprimary and secondary mission along with challenges. But by the time you get them all, you've already most likely\nplayed all the levels multiple times and by then, you won't feel like playing those same missions anymore just for\nfun.\n\nOverall, while there were a few fun moments, I was still more frustrated than entertained. While the first impression was good, it soon became clear that this game sadly became more tedious than entertaining.\n\nSorry guys, but I'm going to have to say that I do not recommend this game.

That being said, it's almost impossible to do either of those things, and not because of a lack of skill, simply because the way the guards are set up, you sometimes can't get past them without killing them or going invisible.  And if you don't have the amber (mana), then you can't go invisible.  There's a point where you have to go into a little hole to get a cutscene, and there is a guy standing right by the hole, you can't sneak past him, you have to go invisible, and then once the cutscene is over, you have to sneak right past him again, and if you don't have amber, you're forced to kill him.  Not a great stealth game, maybe they'll get it right on the second time around.","July 26, 2015","false","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game does not do that and it is a terrible tragedy because I wanted so badly to love it. A game that focuses entirely on stealth? Yes please! The graphics were nice and the voice acting was good, but the plot was terribly cliche from the start. I have no idea if it gets better because as you may notice, I didn't even finish the whole tutorial on this game.\nIt was incredibly frustrating and clunky. Playing on keyboard and mouse, I set the camera sensitivity to high and still struggled to get the character to move in the directions I wanted. If I hugged the walls, the camera would derp through walls as I tried to look around me. I had to look up help just to learn how to parry because I died at least six times with no understanding of what I had done wrong. The combat mechanics are hideous and you can't back out of one-on-one combat. But the kicker was learning to take cover. I could see no pattern in the guards' movements no matter how hard I tried, and finally exited in frustration after my tenth death. The game and its plot had given me no reason to want to continue, no hint that there wouldn't be a reward of any kind around the next corner or two. Nothing more than a feeling that I was a rat running around in a maze where there was no cheese. My only consolation is that I purchased this on a sale and did not pay the full price.","May 15","false","0.9"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","28","58","5","0"

It is nice that Styx has large mission areas and lots of guards in them, so you have to be careful not to get caught. You have places to climb and places to hide like under the table or in a hole.\nIf you get spotted guards will look for you and alert other guards too. Also you might want to avoid knocking over any chairs or brooms, because they make noise and attract guards and bugs. Skills are nice and by unlocking them you can get your clone do more things or jump and kill a guard from above.\nGame has also has problems which including bugs (forgot the name of those enemies) that should react to sounds, but for some reason they don't attack the guards. They also are extremely hard to kill, single as far as i can tell there are few ways to do it. One is to use a throwing knife or be invisible and kill one from there, if they spot you getting away from them is really hard single you can't use games only fighting mechanic against them.\nThe guards themselves seem like almost blind and deaf, when killing someone with silent kill almost in plain sight they don't notice at all. Then again they also lose any brains they have if you suddently turn invisible and stay on that spot, they could at least try to hit that spot.\nSome achievements seem to be there just for the sake of them, like get a kill using the jump from above.\n\nSo i guess it is a ok game if you want a bit stealth action, but it could be so so much better.","March 15, 2015","false","8.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

As they walk past a chest, your trap is sprung and one of them is killed. Without hesitation, you throw a knife at the one remaining guard, killing him before he can raise an alarm. Everything is going according to plan, so you attempt to leap up off the balcony to another platform, but the stilted way in which you jump makes you fall short of your goal. You fall to the ground, alerting a couple of guards. You time your parries in an attempt to duel with one, but the other shoots you with a crossbow and you die instantly.\n\nSuch is the experience of playing Styx: Master of Shadows, a stealth game that occasionally hits the right notes before making you forget about them thanks to bad AI, sub-par combat, repetitious environments, and occasionally frustrating controls.","November 5, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It's not a bad game but there are too much design flaws that makes it dull and tedious after a while: I'm only 10 hours into it and I already want to rush it without caring about secondary objectives, not even talking about bonuses such as relics and gold coins.\n\nUpdate: I've finished the game after about 28 hours. It's worth one run for the story, a few secrets which are fun to find, but this is it: for sure I won't get back to it, too tedious. So my rating & review is unchanged except for the conclusion.\n\nThe main problem is that the shadow mechanics are broken: sometimes you sit in plain light and the guards won't notice you, sometimes you are in the shadows under cover and the guards will spot you. The designers added a shoulder tattoo that tells you when you are in the shadow, but this is not helping a lot since you have to walk into the zone to know for sure. I died an incredible amount of times because of this broken mechanism. This is really annoying as you are supposed to be a "Master of Shadows".\n\nThe second big problem is that the patrols are not so predictable: sometimes the guards will change their routine for no visible reason. It seems there are some scripting there. Also the designers introduced arbitrary difficulty by putting for instance 3 guards watching each other in a tiny room, which leaves you with very little options.\n\nThen there are all those - not so - little bugs: when you kill a guard, the body will fall in an unpredictable manner. It happened quite often that the guard bounced back 4 meters away, thus making noise and alerting all his friends. A lot of jumps will just lead you to a premature death:  the controls are quite clumsy (I'm playing with an XBox controller on PC) and it's hard to spot the paths on the walls.\n\nThere is also some silliness in the design:\nYou cannot create a clone nor use a potion when you are hiding under a table.\nThere are those beetles which can’t see but can hear you: however getting too close to them without making a noise will lead to your death. It seems they are not so blind after all.\nYou only have 2 ways to disable a guard: a quick and noisy kill, or a muffed kill which is supposed to be silent, but not so much: it’s still noisy and with the broken bodies physics the body may fall anywhere, triggering an alarm.\nYou have no way to knock down a guard in a non-lethal way\nThe canned dialogues of the guards are pretty quickly annoying, aka “I took an arrow in the knee” effect. I've discovered in the end game credits that all the guard voices are done by 2 voice actors: that doesn't help.\nOverall, this game is simply not fun to play passed the introduction because of the terrible gameplay induced by the awkward design choices and the bugs. Too bad because there was a lot of potential there.\nI was a bit too harsh when I wrote this review: the game is overall enjoyable, I had some good time with it, but you have to be prepared for some frustrating moments. The game is just not worth 30 euros.","September 6, 2015","false","28.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I loved the Thief series... I waited for the 4th Thief game to be released for years. I pre-ordered the 4th Thief game. I played it, but I never beat it. I waited a while for Styx to go on sale. I bought it during the Winter 2014 sale. I just beat it. I still haven't beat the 4th Thief game. Styx made me feel like I wish the 4th Thief game had made me feel. It made me feel like stealth really mattered. It made me feel like a small, weak badass that could kill anything from the shadows, but hardly anything in the open. It made me feel like a professional assassin, a professional infiltrator, a professional saboteur.\n\nSytx is nothing like the Thief series, except for the fact that it is a stealth game, but it is a much better stealth game, in my opinion. It is obvious that it was built on a smaller budget, as certain maps are re-used throughout the game, but being a stealthy goblin just makes so much sense in a stealth game. Getting inside the head of said goblin creates such a great storyline. I don't know what the sequel has in store for us, but I'm looking forward to it! This game is definitely worth checking out.

It turned out to be little more than a frustrating adventure.\n\nGiven that you're a goblin, you have special abilities you wouldn't otherwise have.   For example you can create a clone of yourself to wander around while you stay somewhere safe, or grant yourself brief invisibility, provided you have the amber (mana) to use it.  You're also agile enough to jump large distances and survive relatively long falls, provided you can master the game's often sloppy controls.  There are times where I wanted to mantle up a ledge but instead the game thought I wanted to climb a burning brazier where I promptly self-immolated and had to reload.\n\nLet's talk level design.  You'll explore your standard environements: castles, prisons, etc. and the game makes the most out of them by making you play through them (read: recycle) more than once.  No stealth game would be complete without guards and what they may lack in intelligence is made up for in quantity.  Missions have scores of guards and it might not be so bad if getting caught by them wasn't such a major penalty.  You do have a dagger to defend yourself with but it can only be used if the games lets you.  If you're caught by a guard, you're forced into a QTE where you have to parry the guard's attacks 1-3 times before you can deliver a killing blow.  That's all well and good if there's no one else around, which is rarely the case.  He'll summon his friends over while you're trying to fight him, all the while they're chucking throwing knives at you.  You soon learn that it's easier just to reload than go through that nonsense.\n\nIf you're caught by an armored knight well too bad, you get to do noithing but watch him grab you and smash your face in.  Reload.  Then there are the roabies, the insect-like things that roam some of the maps.  You're told they're blind but have excellent hearing and they are not joking.  You can kill them by sneaking up on them (good luck) and stabbing them (again if the game lets you).  If you alert one, they will attack you with laser-guided projectiles and the hatred of a thousand suns.  Oh and your dagger if now useless because you can no longer swing it to try and kill the damn things.  So I figure with their intense hatred of all things living, I could try and lure some guards and roabies to each other and have 'em duke it out.  Well apparently the two long ago signed a peace treaty and each happily ignores the other, meanwhile each goes to DEFCON 1 if they hear you fart 3 rooms away.  Lame.\n\nYou can only spend skill points and reload supplies in your hideout at the end of each chapter.  You can carry a whopping 2 health potions, 2 amber vials, 2 throwing knives and 5 balls of sand (for dousing torches from a distance), each is upgradable.  This means finding items in the field which are absurdly scarce.\n\nMaybe I'm just bad at it, but I found the whole game a frustrating and unfun experience.","November 3, 2015","false","31.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you couldn't guess from the name its a stealth game, it has levels which are huge open enviroments letting you take what ever path that pleases you. What makes the game unique in it's own way is that instead of playing some elf, human, or some other thing, you play as a goblin so his small body makes him harder to see and you can get yourself into some tight spots. Like in Dishonored you have some cool abilities that can make you spot out important parts of the enviroment or make a clone of yourself to make him go do stupid things. The game handles really well (so far) and is reminiscent of the old Theif games, where you really don't have to kill but you can just walk around like you own the place. I recommend this game if your looking for a excellent stealth game or your a huge fan of Dishonored and can't wait for the second. Even though I've hardly played the game I give it a solid 8/10.","December 24, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It turned out to be little more than a frustrating adventure.\n\nGiven that you're a goblin, you have special abilities you wouldn't otherwise have.   For example you can create a clone of yourself to wander around while you stay somewhere safe, or grant yourself brief invisibility, provided you have the amber (mana) to use it.  You're also agile enough to jump large distances and survive relatively long falls, provided you can master the game's often sloppy controls.  There are times where I wanted to mantle up a ledge but instead the game thought I wanted to climb a burning brazier where I promptly self-immolated and had to reload.\n\nLet's talk level design.  You'll explore your standard environements: castles, prisons, etc. and the game makes the most out of them by making you play through them (read: recycle) more than once.  No stealth game would be complete without guards and what they may lack in intelligence is made up for in quantity.  Missions have scores of guards and it might not be so bad if getting caught by them wasn't such a major penalty.  You do have a dagger to defend yourself with but it can only be used if the games lets you.  If you're caught by a guard, you're forced into a QTE where you have to parry the guard's attacks 1-3 times before you can deliver a killing blow.  That's all well and good if there's no one else around, which is rarely the case.  He'll summon his friends over while you're trying to fight him, all the while they're chucking throwing knives at you.  You soon learn that it's easier just to reload than go through that nonsense.\n\nIf you're caught by an armored knight well too bad, you get to do noithing but watch him grab you and smash your face in.  Reload.  Then there are the roabies, the insect-like things that roam some of the maps.  You're told they're blind but have excellent hearing and they are not joking.  You can kill them by sneaking up on them (good luck) and stabbing them (again if the game lets you).  If you alert one, they will attack you with laser-guided projectiles and the hatred of a thousand suns.  Oh and your dagger if now useless because you can no longer swing it to try and kill the damn things.  So I figure with their intense hatred of all things living, I could try and lure some guards and roabies to each other and have 'em duke it out.  Well apparently the two long ago signed a peace treaty and each happily ignores the other, meanwhile each goes to DEFCON 1 if they hear you fart 3 rooms away.  Lame.\n\nYou can only spend skill points and reload supplies in your hideout at the end of each chapter.  You can carry a whopping 2 health potions, 2 amber vials, 2 throwing knives and 5 balls of sand (for dousing torches from a distance), each is upgradable.  This means finding items in the field which are absurdly scarce.\n\nMaybe I'm just bad at it, but I found the whole game a frustrating and unfun experience.","November 3, 2015","false","31.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You fall to the ground, alerting a couple of guards. You time your parries in an attempt to duel with one, but the other shoots you with a crossbow and you die instantly.\n\nSuch is the experience of playing Styx: Master of Shadows, a stealth game that occasionally hits the right notes before making you forget about them thanks to bad AI, sub-par combat, repetitious environments, and occasionally frustrating controls.

He is one of a kind in this world, as many people have never seen his race before. He is also a thief with a deep connection to a tree filled with a magical substance named Amber. Styx is captured by the humans at the end of his journey and spills the beans as to why he came to find the World Tree. He recounts the beginning of the story with how he went from amnesiac to slick shadowy assassin.\n\nThe story follows our small assassin through his adventure to find this tree and drown out the voices in his head. He starts in a prison and sneaks his way through various locales to broaden the story. The only real problem with this is that you probably won’t give a damn. The point of the game is to find the World Tree and take possession of its innards. That’s about all there is to the story, go to a place, steal something, and return to the hideout. There is some deep lore in there about the elves and humans fighting over the Amber… but not many will care.\n\nThe main reason I say this is the way that the game is designed. Simply put, Styx: Master of Shadows is one of the most archaic stealth games I’ve played in years. In its defense it has a nice idea on its side to try to separate it from other games of the genre. Styx can use the amber to spit out a clone and use it to move about the area, or even grab ahold of enemies so he can kill them. He can also turn completely invisible, and use “Amber Vision” to highlight enemies and hidden platforms.\n\nBeyond those little tidbits of interest, everything that would already be available in games like Metal Gear, Shadows of Mordor, or Splinter Cell are hidden behind skillsets. For example, the simple act of pulling an enemy behind cover and killing them is something you have to put skill points into. The same goes for attacking enemies from the ceiling or from a ledge. The best you get for long stretches of gameplay is the ability to lean against walls.\n\nDesign wise, it’s obvious this is supposed to be a stealth title. If it isn’t supposed to be one, then someone should have told the combat system. Whenever Styx is detected by an enemy, he’ll have to get into a melee scrap like other heroes. His definition of combat is waiting for an enemy to strike and parrying it. It’s so dull of a system that you’ll probably immediately restart to avoid having to fight get into a melee battle.\n\nThe game works on an autosave system that basically chooses whichever checkpoints it sees fit. The only way to know if you’re going to actually reach a save point is after completing objectives. Styx can walk around earning trinkets and exploring different avenues for 10 to 20 minutes and not hit a save point. So if he’s clobbered by bad guys or makes one mistake, he’ll have to start the entire zone from the beginning.\n\nThat’s not saying that the stealth system doesn’t pass the “average” gameplay test. It actually passes with flying colors, but it never surpasses the average mark and often dips below it. This could be due to the lack of simple stealth mechanics introduced at the start of the game. Players will be unable to free themselves from the age of the title for the first couple of levels. Even silent kills require Styx to hold down a button for 3 seconds to eliminate them. Even worse, enemies can’t be picked up after the culmination of a silent kill. You have to way until they spill on the floor before picking them up and carrying them away.\n\nStyx is a pretty game on the outside. It features a heavily detailed world with an emphasis on Cloud City themed heights. The interiors are incredibly detailed and the level structures offer an open-ended structure to getting around. The animations are the dark side of the title, they are often stiff and for lack of a better word – Janky looking. Cutscenes reveal the animation woes every time Styx is talking to another person. They also spill over into the gameplay with stiff movement and takedown animations. The voice acting isn’t that good either. Most anyone that isn’t Styx would be serving the game better by shutting up.\n\nStyx is for a very particular crowd of gamers out there in the world. You have to have a mindset that you’re going to be playing a game similar to the old Thief games in 3rd person. Except that it won’t play as well as a 3rd person game should, and it also won’t capture the enclosed feeling of playing Thief. Geek Citadel gives Styx: Master of Shadows 2 stars out of five. There are much more appealing Stealth games out there like Splinter Cell, Metal Gear, and Dishonored. However, at the budget price of $29 I’ll let you be the judge of that.\n","October 7, 2014","true","12.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The secret locations and hideout seem to be inspired by those games.\n\nCons:\n1. Extremely large amount of bugs, from random graphical glitches to being seen by the AI through walls. I have seriously been pulled through walls by the AI along with other serious gameplay bugs.\n2. Gameplay is difficult for the sole purpose of being difficult. It's not challenging, just annoying as hell.\n3. Linear gameplay. You are forced to play the exact way the developers want you to. An example of this is one of the earlier levels where you can't be seen or have a body seen otherwise you have to start over.\n4. Extremely bad combat. More often than not it's literally impossible to fight people. It honestly makes Assassin's Creed's combat seem decent.\n5. Lack of non-lethal gameplay. The only way you can deal with an enemy is by killing them loudly or quietly.\n6. You're forced to search every inch of the map for random coins and if you don't get every single one, you don't get to have abilites that make the game less tedious.\n7. There's a limit of around two of each item that you can carry. Want to have more than 2 of a disposable weapon or health potion? Too bad.\n8. The darkness does not work at all. The enemies can easily see you which makes hiding in the dark quite useless. If you're hiding in the dark and just to happen to be in the 180 degree FOV of the AI, you're going to be instantly spotted and killed without warning.\n9. Those roaby bugs. In an extremely tedious stealth game where you have to kill everyone, the developers thought it would be best to include a completely random creature in the game to annoy players even more. Regardless of the fact that they don't fit anywhere at all in the main story.\n10.  The special vision. It's literally worse than any other magical vision in other games. It serves literally no purpose other than as an abitrary requirement to navigate through the poorly designed maps. Poor lighting with poor controls which need to be fixed with a "special ability" does not make a good game.\n11. The clone. It also serves no purpose other than to solve trivial problems created by the developers for the sole reason of giving the clone a use in the game.\n12. You can't look up or down. This isn't a joke, your body is blocking your view down and you can't move the camera up to see above you.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent stealth game instead, i suggest you try out Dishonored.","March 8, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

If used as a distraction the enemies will very quickly return to their posts not leaving a large enough gap for you to sneak by. If they are hit just once they will die. They are also slow and they cannot attack ( except with special "trap" upgrades and even then they are sittuational at best.)\n\nStyx is a very likeable character and I hope to see a better designed sequel in his future, but unfortunately for his debut appearance Styx's creators put him in the deep end of hardcore stealth gameplay by handicapping him with his abilities and giving his opponents a massive boost in offence with sheer numbers.\n\nI recommed only for willing supporters like myself, I do not regret my purchase.\nHowever if you are looking for a stealth/combat game I highly recommend Dishonoured, Hitman:Blood Money, and the old Thiefs 1-3.\n","September 13, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The concept ticked all the right boxes for me; stealth game, interesting protagonist, open level design. I wanted to, but I can't. The game is just too damn janky.\n\nThe cardinal rule in any stealth game is that the AI must be predictable. You must know immediately how they will react in certain situations. When you are spotted you must know how and why. Styx violates this numerous times to the point of frustration. It seems the lighting system doesn't work correctly, and so what can look like complete darkness is actually considered by the game as broad daylight. They partially get around this by giving Styx a tattoo that glows when in darkness. This doesn't help much though, because you don't know if an area is considered by the game as dark until you're standing there, and if it's considered light you'll probably be spotted.\n\nThe frustration is compounded by the awful combat system. When you are spotted the game basically becomes a QTE whereby you must parry the enemy attacks at the correct time. Failure to do so leads to you being hit. Parry enough attacks and the parry command changes to kill, allowing you to kill the enemy. There are several problems with this system:\n\n- It locks you in to combat and you can't leave until you kill the enemy or you die.\n- You can only fight 1 enemy at a time, but other enemies will attack you during the "fight". This means you might as well restart if an enemy spots you and alerts other people to your location.\n- It looks ridiculous as enemies all attack in the same pattern, taking 1 swing every second or so. There is no reason the enemies can't attack faster other than "this is a videogame".\n\n\nAdd that to the bad controls (the amount of times Styx refused to grab a ledge, falling to his doom, is too many to count), the mostly bad voice acting and dialogue (although I enjoyed Styx for the most part, he's very dry and sarcastic and it leads to some decent lines) and the uselessness of some of the unlockable abilities and I can only recommend Styx to the most hardcore of stealth fans. It depends on your tolerance level.\n\nCan you cope with the problems listed above? If you can you may find the excellent level design, interesting world and good protagonist is enough to hook you in. When the game is at its best, it works well. There's moments of brilliance just about frequent enough to make you realise that buried somewhere underneath all the jank is an excellent game begging to be freed. The satisfaction of gracefully(ish) hopping from ledge to ledge, swooping down to kill troublesome enemies before using your clone as a distraction to escape is brilliant, and I can certainly see this game becoming a bit of a cult favourite. Sadly these moments are just too fleeting, and the frustrating controls and awfully designed combat is too big a problem to overcome. In the end it's a swing and a miss, but I hope the developers learn from their mistakes and try again because the idea has too much potential to be squandered in this manner.","October 11, 2014","false","5.7"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","0"

There are times when it really shines when everything is working perfectly, but there were a lot more frustrating moments when the game mechanically just...didn't do what I know I should have been capable of. The checkpoint system was the thing that ruined the game the most for me. Someone in the forums DID let me know that I could quicksave, which keeps you from having to repeat 15 minute sections, but that feels more like I'm abusing a system instead of actually enjoying the game.\n\nTLDR; some people are going to love this, I understand, but I don't recommend picking this up. Now...if there's ever a Styx 2? Go for it! Or if this is on sale for around 10$ and you're looking for a stealth game. I'd still recommend Mark of the Ninja before this though :X.\n\n\n\nIt looks amazing, has excellent voice acting along with an interesting story, and the characters and npcs all seem alive and pretty interesting. The down side is when the mechanics in the game work, they're awesome, but it can be really frustrating when you're attempting to do something simple and it just...does not work. Which ends with you getting into combat, which is also incredibly unenjoyable and usually means you should just restart. But beware! When you die or decide to restart, the game checkpoints once every objective, so you might be repeating 10-15 minutes of gameplay just to progress to the next checkpoint. I'm going to finish this just to see how the story progresses, but I have a hard time recommending it against Thief and any of the Assassins Creed games unless you absolutely desire a new original stealth game to play.","December 10, 2014","false","10.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","5"

But the super vision only lasts a whole of two seconds at the start of the game, yet uses up little to no resources. So you have to stop every second to refresh it.\nSecond, you can climb up iron pegs on the wall to reach a ledge, yet when you reach the top, rather than auto grab a ledge and hang there, you pull yourself up to stand there, in full view of a stationary enemy. Enemies PULL you into combat with them, so there is no chance to actually run away, because you are apparently magnetized.\nThird, stealth kill is anything BUT stealthy, and you make a lot of noise in the process, alerting anyone nearby, even if they are asleep.\nFourth, you can turn around corners you press yourself against while on foot, but you can't climb around ledge corners. So to get to a better vantage point, you either pull yourself up in front of an enemy, which is a stupid idea, or press jump and hope you don't fall to your death, jump up in front of the enemy, or just grab onto the same damn ledge you jumped from.\nFifth, contextual actions use various different buttons, but important actions, like attacking an unaware enemy, CANNOT be done if that enemy is standing on a corpse, because the "attack" button, is also the "pick up corpse" button. So instead of attacking, you pick up the corpse and bump into an enemy that can attack you with impunity, and you can't to crap to until you put the body down and wait for the animation to magnetize you into the attack position animation... which, by the way, enemies continue to hit you and do damage as you are loaded into this attack stance camera angle.","May 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","0"

Interesting stealth mechanics and fun tricky ways to mess with your targets. If you end up playing it, make sure to play it on "goblin difficulty".\n\nRegretfully however, I can't suggest this game in general. My biggest problem with it is that even though the story isn't that bad, and the setting is unique, and the gameplay is fine, it completely breaks the atmosphere and immersion when it comes to character development. To earn more skill points to achieve more than the basic skills, or just one category of them, you have to replay missions in specific ways to earn points. I wish they had chosen a different approach for character development. A game so strongly concentrated around its story shouldn't break away from it by asking you to redo the same missions all over. Of course you can progress without that, but if so you will miss out on certain very fun skills in assassination tricks, which are so central in this game.\n\nThe other negative point is how the game looks. The screenshots and the welcoming menu screen look great, but the actualy gameplay is below average in lightning, detail, and generally the whole graphical aspect. It seems to me the game could do with a proper boost in contrast. There seems so much immersive and atmospheric potential gone, where shadows in which you hide (and where the enemy can't see you even though he is two meters away) are a dull grey affair.\n\nSo in my opinion the design choices for this game weren't so good, and your time and money would be better spent on games that are simply better. But if you are a stealth fan and the above points don't bother you, you will probably enjoy it quite much.","January 28, 2015","false","6.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","3"

Due to the many positive reviews I bought this game, but after a couple of hours I really struggle with getting enough motivation to play it til the end...\nThe ingame graphic is ok (not more), but especially the cut scenes (especially character movement, facial animations) are really bad. The main character is one-dimensional (at best) and I couldn't care less about him. It's true that the levels are large, but i.m.h.o. this is not a good thing as the gameplay is extremely repetitive and controlling the character is really bad in some situation so you fall to death just because the character didn't grap the ledge you were heading for. Which is especially annoying due to the rare auto save points.\nThe level design is not originally and many maps are are used more than once. Furthermore (almost) each level has four parts (even named 1..4 in the save game names), so you always know that there is nothing interesting happening until you finish the 4th part to get to the next (boring) cut scene.\nThe last (negative) point is the music and sounds. In some missions it is really annoying high frequency sounds all the time in the background which is really going on my nerves (and not in a good way).\nI would never buy this game again and can't recommend it to anyone who has at least some requirements regarding a at least sort of interesting story and diversified gameplay or even more than just quite ok graphics with even less quality cut scenes...","December 31, 2014","false","16.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

It feels dated and clunky. The combat system is a joke, it's basically QTE without any prompts. It consists of clicking 1-3 times at the exact right moment and hoping that you don't get struck while in the kill animation. Stealth kills involve holding your foe down. letting him squirm for an arbitrary amount of time before you decide to stab his face or break his neck. I understand wanting to make stealth kills take a little longer to be riskier, but why make me hold down a button and put a guy in an arm lock for 5 seconds? Why not just make the kill animation a longer than the "loud" kill?\n\nThe "parkour" was also very clumsy. You'll miss ledges you should be able to grab I had one where my hands went higher than the ledge but he wouldn't grab it), and as many people have pointed out, you can't turn corners while hanging on a ledge. There is also little incentive to not killing everyone in the area. There are "treasures" scattered about, and to find them you'll need to murder everyone in sight. This encourages exploration I guess, but with such a poor combat system and illogical (and time consuming) stealth-kill system, I really didn't want to explore and kill everyone.\n\nFinally, the story had potential. It looked like it would be dark and gritty, even creepy. I can handle slow exposition, but my problem here was that there were numerous failed attempts at humor in a game that should have been more serious. Or at least, actually funny. Styx just looked like a dummy, and I don't care to play a game as a dummy.\n\nIn the end, I got a refund.

I'm trying to escape some guards so I run to a ledge but if I want to drop and hang onto the ledge? I have to hold SHIFT which makes Styx crawl... and I get hit with ranged weapons when this happens sigh... but then if I want to jump to an anchor below me? I have to look down and press spacebar.. but say I'm panicking? I might press E... but E pushes you away from the wall and you fall to your death... sigh.\n\nIf you're hanging onto a ledge and want to shimmy around the corner? You can't.. seriously!? Price of Persia Sands of Time nailed that shimmy around the corner back in 2003! OVER TEN YEARS AGO! So how do you go around corners when you want to shimmy around? You climb up in front of the guards, hold SHIFT to crawl to the other corner and then walk off and Styx will turn around and grab it and you can continue your shimmy... but if the guard sees you? Guess what? He'll run over and pull you up and you're stuck in that damn parry-lock!!!\n\nThat parry-lock mode is driving me freaking insane!!! Better designed games like Assassin's Creed lets you escape combat with ease by just holding down the sprint button!! not this game... nah, this game makes you get locked into combat and you either have to lose most of your health trying to back out or actually do the parry three time to kill the guard whilst the other one attacks you... pretty much in this game? Avoid combat at all costs because Styx sucks at combat more than he sucks at maneuvering around the open world.\n\nNow that I've talked about the worst parts of the game... let's talk about the good...\n\nThe levels are nice and huge and the game looks great.\n\nThe AI can be pretty smart and can spot you in areas where the shadows aren't super dark (technically they should always be able to see you due to that glowing tattoo kind of like the night vision goggles in Splinter Cell but they don't because game play lol).\n\nThe music is also very nice with grim violins and other various mood setting music.\n\nBut in conclusion? I was hoping for another fun stealth game to tinker around with... but this game is damn clunky... not as clunky and mediocre as cyanide studios other game "Of Orcs and Men" but still damn clunky. Only get this game if it's on sale for a REALLY low price.

I want to like this game. I do. Stealth games are hard to make well and the idea of playing as a little gobbo is cool. I laid down 7 bucks during a sale for it and booted it up.\n\nGraphically it isn't bad. It's stylized like the Fable series in a way, but slightly less elegant; it has a more gritty look. I have a couple of frame drop issues (mainly when I look outside) but that is more than likely due to my laptop's strength. There are a few clipping problems, especially with the dagger when Styx is pressed against a wall and the camera can clip into the walls as well if you manuever it during Styx's wall-hugging. Lip syncing with Styx is on spot for the most point, but then the humans... well. Honestly it's bad. It isn't Godzilla dub-over bad, but it is definitely noticeable.\n\nThe game opens with a cut scene trying to immerse you in the world and it fails rather badly. They go on and on about this amber and the Heart of the Tree and how it's an infinite source of power but never mention for what. Magic, ostensibly? Or is it also used as currency? Styx is captured right away and interrogated... well. He isn't really pressed for info. He just spills the beans, really, which I found odd. He is speaking to some Lord that has barely any conext for you to care about and then you're thrust into a... memory? Or is he telling the story of how he got there? It's VERY unclear. Whatever, the game can still be great even if I don't like/care about the story.\n\nI hope you enjoy (poorly written and hammy) dialouge because Styx never EVER shuts his f****** mouth.  To make things worse, his voice actor is awful. This may just be me, but I honestly find his voice grating. He tries so hard to add depth and cynicsm to Styx by emphasizing his curses but it just gets obnoxious, like a middle schooler trying to be edgy. Not good. At all. And when I say he never shuts up, I mean it. The developers decided to shove EVERYTHING down your throat by having Styx say it to himself repeatedly and it really kills the immersion and any chance you have to like the character. Oh, and Styx also will never stop whining about his headache, either. We get it, game. His head hurts because of the tree or something; wee.\n\nThe controls aren't bad, though there is some weirdness with movement (I guess this has more to do with the character model floating over edges, I suppose). I finally get Styx's dagger, which apparently is super cool and foreign according to some guards, but it's seriously just a knife. That's it. So you get the knife and the game shows you how to silently kill. You sit there, holding down a button till you can muster the strength to kill him, fine. Standard stealth game fare. Then they thrust you into a combat situation... and this is where I felt like an idiot for buying this. It's a bunch of quick time events. It is beyond bad. It's stupid, it's tedious, it's slow and everytime you get into open combat you sigh out loud; not because you've been caught, but because the combat system is absolute garbage. If everything else with this game was golden and this combat system was still used I would pan the game just for that. It's seriously that bad.\n\nTHEN there is unlocking doors. Instead of having some sort of skill based mini-game or something more creative, the game has you stand there and hold a button while Styx shoves his finger in the lock and looks around like he's having a siezure. It's stupid, it's boring, and it adds nothing to the game. Take it out. Bad, developers. Bad. No treat for you.\n\nLastly, and this may be just me, the fall damage seems VERY liberal. I understand having fall damage in the game, it makes sense. But this acrobatic little gobbo would die if he fell off your back porch, it seems.\n\nOverall, Styx could've been cool. I'll finish it and pray to Posiedon it gets better, but there are SO many things fighting against it. I don't know if I can grit my teeth through anymore unlocking sequences or "combat" QTE's. If you still want to play the game I encourage you to wait for it to go on sale for less than 10 or 8 bucks.","September 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I really wish I could have liked this game, it makes me upset I could not like this game, but there you have it.\n\nStyx bring together probably one of the greatest true to life stealth systems I have ever seen for a game. The problem is it is very unforgiving to the point that the bugs in the systems that normally people would ignore glare too bright. A NPC saw you from across the room while you were in the shadows? That's a checkpoint restart. At the same time, most other games have the NPC litterally staring you down in a mildly lit room and can't see you. Styx: the master of shadows brings a realistic spotlight on every stealth system and makes me feel like a jackass.\n\nThe story is..... well.... it could have made it. The voice acting is feels like it was done by one person with a brooklin acsent. My O' right, chip off ye old block a'eh lads?! Wha..... you 'ear something?! Annoying to say the least. Probably my only true negitive about this game.\n\nThere is NO fighting in this game, don't pretend it does. If you get into combat you basically parry the one person to death. If there are two people you are fighting, you are dead. Your only choice is to run.\n\nLoads of fun for the right person. For me, it is just too unforgiving for my tastes.  I still hold it as the pinnicle of all stealth systems I have ever seen. That is, if they can work out the bugs in the system. If you are the kind of person who is a huge fan of stealth and REALLY wants a challenge, this is for you. Otherwise, the avarage joe (like me) just wants to have  some fun on his day off from work. And, would rather not spend it bug testing one of the best and unforgiving stealth systems on the market.","October 15, 2014","false","5.6"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","11","27","2","0"

The game world and npcs feel very inconsistant with some being highly detailed and others being very low quality. A bit surprised at the 85% recommended rate this has at the time of this writing. It feels cheap and incomplete at best. It only took just under 60 minutes of broken tutorial to come to the conclusion it is not worth playing any longer. Tutorial portions of games are the most polished and using those as an indicator for the rest of the game, I will stop there.","December 1, 2014","false","0.8"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","7","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/recommended/242640/","Zyrxil","Zyrxil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/","580 products in account","I really like stealth games. Thief, Splinter Cell, Hitman, Dishonored, I play them nonstop as soon as they are released. Although Styx is a game from a budget title studio, I had high expectations after hearing about how it was best played as a pure stealth game on the hardest difficulty. However, as you can guess from the thumbs down next to this review, I was deeply disappointed by it.\n\nStyx feels like a 'cargo-cult' game. The term refers to when a primitive society sees the prosperity of temporarily visiting missionaries or army groups, and imitates their physical actions to try to bring wealth, without actually understanding what the people they are imitating are doing. In the same vein, Styx is a game that seems to have been designed by checklist of popular stealth game features, without any understanding of how to unite the mechanics underneath together into good gameplay.\n\n\nClunky ControlsThe biggest problem everyone will complain about is how difficult it is to drop off a ledge. Walking off a ledge does not automatically cause your character to hang from it, unless you crouch-slow walk, a very slow process that is not reliable when you're trying to hide from a guard. The other big problem is that after jumping up to a ledge you can hang from will, your character will automatically pull himself up, an insanely idiotic design decision that means you simply can't jump to hang off a ledge a guard is near. Third major problem, when hanging from and shimmying along a ledge, your character cannot traverse corners. I thought this was a bug the first time I ran into this situation, but no, it's designed like that. You simply cannot shimmy along the outside of a balcony. This not only makes no sense, but it also makes shimmying much less useful of a movement tool, relegating it to basically a hiding manuever.\n\nBad Level DesignThe setting of the game (inside a tower suspended over an abyss) allowed the devs to create levels as literally a series interconnected floating rooms with very little logic to them. They could almost pass for a procedurally generated layout of random offices, laboratories, and storage areas. The devs don't actually -do- anything with the levels. There's nothing memorable, there are no calculated site lines, no rhyme or reason to the location of tiny tunnels only your character can travel or metal crosses on the walls your character can climb. One path is not more advantageous than any other path, or more profitable since there is no loot that you can steal for score as you might expect in a game about a goblin thief.\n\nLack of contentMost level zones (each 'whole' level is composed of 3 or 4 zones) can be completely fairly quickly, in under 10 minutes, if playing ghost style. The *only* thing that slows play down are the presence of 10 collectible coins in each zone. There is only *one* purpose to these coins- collecting every single one in every zone for a level awards some skill points at the very end of the level. If you fail to find any, it's the same as not collecting any at all. The coins are -not- cumulative currency; they aren't used in any logical way, such as reaching certain thresholds in the number of coins found across all levels awarding skill points. No, you either find absolutely all of them, or you simply ignore all of them, completely elimating any reason to explore, and cutting down on gameplay time by 80%.\n\nPoor Enemy Distribution and DesignThe levels are far too populated. The devs just figured "More guards=more difficulty". Not only is this not true, the enemy variety is severly lacking due to the dev's misunderstanding. With the exception of bowmen, the differences between the humanoid enemies that exist depend solely on their combat capabilities. Even bowmen don't behave any differently unless they already have been put into an alert state, in which case they are able to check vertically better than other enemy types. Humanoid enemies therefore become completely indistinguisable when playing in true stealth ghost style.\n\nMechanical InconsistencyThe only exception to  are mutated bugs that can detect you by sound, but have extremely sensitive hearing. These are not true enemies, but rather count as obstacles, as you are allowed to kill them while keeping the "Mercy" no-kill rating. One glaring problem is obvious after a while- the devs do not allow their systems to interact. Although the bugs tend to be placed in areas close to humanoid enemies, nothing NPCs do will attract their attention. No matter how loud NPCs may be, there simply is nothing in the game code that allows the bugs to attack NPCs. This complete separation of game systems removes so many tactical options from the player and is a glaring example of the bad design in the game.\n\nInconsistent DetectionThe player character can do vertical jumps of 15 feet or forward jumps of 10 feet (these by the way are non-negotiable distances. You cannot let go of jump early to jump smaller distances.) Sometimes these trigger NPC audio detection. Sometimes they don't. Styx can also walk off the second step of a staircase, dropping 1 foot onto the ground. This will sometimes trigger NPC audio detection, and sometimes it won't.","December 20, 2014","false","13.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","5","15","2","0"

To start, climbing down is next to impossible, and in a game where landing on the ground alerts everyone around you, well ♥♥♥♥ you. You can't move from a ledge on a wall to another ledge, even if it's on the same wall. If you are hanging from a rail and you need to round a corner, you're fat outta luck as that just doesn't work. You can only hang onto certain ledges and bits on the wall, neither of which are made very clear right at the start of the game.\n\nThe game itself is also really game-y. To do a stealth kill, you grab onto the guy, and then have to hold down the kill button arbitrairly long before your character just stabs the dude. "You want to get into the main hideout? Well you need a specific crowbar from a specific place to get in." The powers are introduced in a very "look, you have to use this now, see how cool this is!" kind of way. That's all I got to see, but it was pretty bad.\n\nI want to like this game, I really do.

Be drawn into the vague and unengaging tale of Styx, a vengeful goblin who is about as stealthy as a drunk water buffalo. Do the same thing over and over again: walk around in plain daylight without anyone seeing you, just because you're crouching. And even if guards see you, don't you fret: just hide in a conveniently located closet or chest that they for some reason never open for a few seconds and they forget all about you. Kill your enemies by stabbing them about a million times in the back even after they're dead, or do the slowest stealth takedown in video game history as the other guards turn around to see you murdering their friend. Be submersed in dull, lifeless and unvarying dialogue that is %90 made up of profanity, featuring the worst voice actors the developers could find. Embark on a perilous quest to reach a big golden tree in the middle of this underground city thing, in order to obtain the mystical Amber (which pretty much just makes him see through walls or turn invisible for a few seconds), even though it is found all along the way in vials.

The interface is streamlined and basic, and you can use the\nthird person camera view to see angles you normally wouldn't if it were in first\nperson.  The graphics are nice, but the story is subpar.  I found it hard to\nidentify with the main character, and the story offered didn't entice me to\nimmerse myself in gameplay.\n\nThere are four difficulty levels in the game, and while the\nenemies inflict more damage as the difficulty increases, the number of enemies\ndoes not increase or decrease per difficulty level.  This lack of time spent\nin rebalancing the difficulty levels can easily scare away those who are new\nto this type of game, or easily discouraging those who want to play the game\nat a more relaxed pace.\n\nOne frustrating point of this game is that there is no way to distract\nyour enemies, which should be core to a stealth style game.  A stealth game\nshould allow for you to pick up an object, such as a stone, and throw it to\ndivert the enemy so you can sneak around them.  They do offer a clone skill\nthat can be used to lure enemies, but not being able to use objects limits the\ncapabilty to confuse the enemies, and limits the game.\n\nThere are many small frustrations in this game, such as being able to\nsneak up behind an enemy leaning on a box, but having no capability to slit\ntheir throat while on the box, or not being able to stash more than one body\nin a chest that visually looks like it could easily fit three.  The title of\nthe game suggests that you are a master of shadows, which implies that you\nexcel at sneaking in shadows.  The enemy however, must all have night vision.\nas they can find you quite easily.\n\nThe level design at first seems amazing.  The amount of detail in the\nlevel design, and the options provided for how to get from point A to point B\nseems vast.  The levels are very large, but after playing for a while, I found\nthat the same 4 or 5 levels were just re-used.  On top of that, enemies that\nI killed the first time I played the levels miraculously  reappeared, having\nthe same conversations that they had before I had killed them the last time.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is lacking;  you are very limited in how you\ncan interact with your environment.  You are limited in how you can attack\nenemies.  You are limited in being able to sneak in shadows, and you are\nforced to play the game on the designers terms, instead of your own.  The game\nis hardcore not because of the challenging elements, but because of poor design.\nWhile this game may be challenging for seasoned stealth players, I cannot and\nwill not recommend this game to anyone who does not consider themselves experts\nin this style of play.\n\nThis is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a Blogger\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 14, 2014","false","22.5"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","3"

I can understand that I am a goblin I’ll die in a few hits but there are several things about combat that make this game artificially difficult.\nYou can only stealth kill enemies getting caught means that you have the camera turn towards the enemy that is swinging at you and instead of trying to run away you have to kill them using the awful counter system which is even more annoying with the force camera change disorientating you.\nAll in all this game was very disappointing with these alone enough for me to give up and not want to come back.  I like the character, the world, and story; but the gameplay itself is weak, archaic, and artificially inflated in difficulty that I’ll just watch this on YouTube from someone that can bear this for the story and see if that is any good.\n","October 16, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The combat is bad because you attack the people you're fighting by hitting there sword or watever when they swing it.  There is no rapid attacks to make it easy, oh no, no no no they decided for you to have to time it perfectly.  This basically makes it so you have to stay hidden at all time.  Not to mention when you die you start back where YOU last saved, there are no checkpoints wich is stupid because you'll die a lot because of the combat.  Not to mention there are gaurds EVERYWHERE!  Making you have to hide and wait.  There is so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ waiting in this game.  Waiting isn't too bad but they could've given you more time to make your move instead of waiting for a gaurd to pass by.  Also when you are attaking someone you CAN'T get away, you are locked in that fight till you or the guard dies.  And if you die then you start back at square one, unless you save.  By the way there is no quick save you have to open up a menu in order to save.\n\nDon't buy this game, buy something more with the money.

Simply put .. you cannot run away or break off from a fight. If you are spotted you have to fight which devolves down to a one button combat system. You have to time a counter and then kill back. Then you get missions where you auto fail if you are spotted and the respawn point is 6 or 7 rooms back. So you have to do them all over again. Even though you are a master of shadow you are practically blind in the shadows yourself. You have to keep using Amber vision ... and the guards walking around in full battle armor make so little sound you can barely here them over the ambient effects. In a pinch you can burn most of your amber pool to turn invisible for about 4 seconds to don't think you can get clear and hise until things calm down ... 4 seconds or so gets you almost no where. The game is visually beautiful but you dont really get to see it. It is mostly dark or washed out in bright orange for amber vision.  You should have had better dark vision and amber made things interactive glow. Would have made more sense. Also get used to guards patrolling around a table in the middle of the room for no good reason. If you want a game where you chain burn ambervision to try and see everyones walking path this is the game for you while carrying a nasty looking dagger you hardly use .. this is your game. Sadly .. this game is an EPIC fail. I hate to say this because the game looked so cool but this game completely lacks rational. I will break out and replay Assassin's Creed 1 and 2. That is interactive stealth done correct. This is not.","October 14, 2014","false","6.4"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","6"

I'm still missing "Mission 4" somehow, while I have completed 5 and 6.\n\n+ Excellent and rewarding stealth mechanics. Extremely difficult and compelling to get max points in the various missions.\n+ Runs really great on PC, after you remove the 62 fps cap. Had no performance issues what so ever.\n- Controls are a little clunky, with broken animations and issues grabbing onto ledges.\n- The detection system can be unforgiving at times, where guards can see you through corners and walls (most likely bug). Especially at Goblin difficulty.\n- The light / dark detection ratio is not always picking up dark areas too well.\n- The story was extremely boring with little to non-existing character depth nor development. This includes recycled 2D images as transitions, instead of cinematics or more interesting methods.\n- The game also utilizes backtracking of maps, so you have to play the same sceneries twice, with small changes added the second time. (Much like Batman Arkham City -> Batman Arkham Origins)\n- *SPOILER* The last - and only - boss fight in the game was horribly easy and out of place in a stealth game.\n\nOverall a pretty disapointing game with few a shining moments, you should only acquire this game if you don't enjoy other game genres but stealth.","October 16, 2014","false","16.2"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Some missions you can't get caught or you instantly lose. This is where the ragdoll physics can be a huge pain in the a**. For example, if you kill an enemy on a high platform, they may ragdoll and fall right down into enemy sight, resulting in an instant game over. Sh**ty game design at it's finest.\n\n#3 There are some scenarios where you can't avoid being caught (being caught in this game is almost a guarantee Game Over anyways because of how little health you have). If you want to stealth kill someone silently, it takes about 10 seconds, leaving you completely open.\n\n#4 The story would have been great if it was a, "How I done it" story, but instead it twists into something way more complicated than necessary and proceeds to pull the 2nd half of the game is the first half in reverse trick. I would have been much happier if the game had been half as long, no backtracking, with a less convoluted story like it seemed at first.\n\nAdmittedly, I liked this game at first, but by the end, I hated it and felt my time had been well and thoroughly wasted when the end credits finally rolled.

When poor controls and game mechanics prevent this altogether, it kinda blows the idea of a 'stealth game' out of the water.\n\nIt's not that the control scheme is horrible, but it's not the greatest.  'Press and Hold' seems to be motto of the game designers, and while it's not something that you want to have to do for a whole game, it's understandable in stealth scenarios where actions should take time to complete while under threat of being discovered.  It's also not just that the controls aren't explained to you, and going to the settings to find out how to play is easier than waiting for the game to explain to you how to play - this is easily overcome, and a minor shortcoming in the game.  Where that fails is the game does explain some controls to you, but most games that have as-you-go tutorials like this one actually tell you about all the controls.  It's possible that the rest are explained later on in the game, but that doesn't make too much sense.\n\nWhat makes the controls poor is the game mechanics - specifically edge detection.  You want to sneak up on someone and kill them silently.  What you occasionally end up doing is steathing up to them, then shuffling around trying to find where the game will actually let you interact with them, which can get you caught. Or, perhaps you've killed someone and they're on the ground, and you now need to pick them up. Well, you may have to move for no apparent reason in order to trigger the detection of the body to be able to pick it up - and I'm pretty sure that walking kicks the body which makes noise - making that stealth kill you just did very unstealthy and calling unwated attention.\n\nEven if you don't have to figure out where the magic spot is to interact, (it's mostly around corners and against cover, etc) sometimes the person you're attacking will suddenly, randomly, teleport a few feet in another direction - while you're attacking - which can put you right in the eyeline of another character, who is more than happy to blow your cover and call for backup.  Or, bodies that you've killed sometimes jump a couple feet, which can make them fall down and alert people below.  (this seemed to be about a 50/50 shot for one guy I was killing - he stood at the same spot in his patrol every time, but sometimes his body would fall, sometimes it wouldn't.)\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is sometimes called insanity - but when you're doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results, only to get different results, can drive you to insanity.\n\nThat can lead to frustration, as no matter how well you play the game's flaws can often make stealthing impossible.  There is, however, a F5/F9 quicksave/quickload function that I discovered by looking up the controls in the settings.  A frustrating stealth game, especially one that seems to randomly blow your cover, _greatly_ benefits from quicksave.   Sadly, herein lies the last problem I have with the game. (only because I'm done swearing at it for now)  Apparently the game save states aren't that great either.\n\nWhen you save and load a game, you generally expect things to be the way they were when you saved the game. What you don't expect is to be in a safe position, save your game, then load it only to find out that the guard that was down over by the door is now halfway to you, seeing the body and blowing stealth.  Especially since this game has no real combat system, and you want to avoid being discovered at all.  Instead what I had was three guards trying to kill me the moment I loaded my save.\n\nIt may be possible to get around the game's shortcomings, I don't know.  I just Alt-F4'd it when my savegame decided to throw out all my progress, and I may not try it again.","November 16, 2014","false","3.0"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

There is next to zero skill level throughout the game and I lost interest very soon.\n\nTo make matters worse the whole story line is completely non sensical and you are not at all invested in the plot, characters or setting. avoid completely and pick up a Thief game or even one of the older Splinter Cell titles, which play great.","October 11, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","7","31","0","0"

Why? Nobody knows. For some reasons, the game just refused to launch. All of my other games, Steam and non-Steam alike work. But Styx: Master of Shadows woudln't launch.\n\nSeveral people are/were in my case; some of them did manage to make the game launch by restoring their computer while some had their games working fine until they restored their computer.\n\nIn other words, you may or may not be able to run Styx according to a random factor, even if you have a gamer PC or not, a custom-built one or not and so on. It's pure randomness.\n\nAnd where are the devs? NOWHERE. They tried to fix this issue at first, and when they couldn't understand where the problem was coming from they just STOPPED answering our questions and pleas to know if they were working on a solution. They were (and still are) ignoring people whose money went into their game. And I find this UNACCEPTABLE. I myself had NONE answer from the Focus team and I tried to get some for ONE MONTH. I spent ONE MONTH returning each and every day on the forum to see if the devs finally said something. The only help I had (and most helpful too) was from fellow players who had this problem. And while it is great that some of them managed to fix their game, it's not the role of the customer to fix their game.\n\nNow, there are two types of Styx owners: the ones who still hope there will be a solution and the ones like myself who were fed up to be taken for fools and asked for a refund.\n\nIn a nutshell, don't buy this game. You may not be able to run it and if it's the case, you won't have any help from the devs.","November 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 14 of 53 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","14","53","0","0"

The lights and shadows are well done, and the scenery itself is very nice.  However, you will begin to notice that each area is basically the same thing over and over with slightly different variations and objects in different locations.  The maps are unremarkable and have various flaws that take away from the game itself.  I.e. - floating objects, visible overlays on occasion, etc.\n\nThe combat system is a joke.  If you get spotted by more than one guy - or if another guy happens to hear the encounter and comes in - you're almost sure to die.  You cannot move your camera during the fight, and only one control is available and it is only a timed button press.  While you are being attacked by the first guy, anyone else will throw things at you or shoot you with arrows or attack you from behind.  All of which are unavoidable.  Even if you somehow manage to kill the first one, if the second is close enough - you will be locked into the same mess with him instead. On a harder difficulty setting you cannot even take a single hit before death. And the checkpoints seem few and far between - sometimes you are in wait for an opportunity for a couple minutes or so and get through a sextion and in the next area get spotted - die - and get reverted all the way back to 20 minutes ago.  It's brutally annoying having to redo the same things over and over again when the dynamics and walking patterns of the AI never change.\n\nSpeaking of walking patterns - this games movement of guards is laughable.  For instance, you see a guard walking away from you - he is going to go to the right - however this is how it happens: he walks to the end of his forward route, stutters, (or hesitates depending on the animation for him) comes to a complete stop and turns 90 degrees (with choppy graphics no less - a leg that kicks to the right or an arm that jerks out in front of him for no reason) and jolts forward to continue his route.  The routes that they take DO NOT CHANGE.  Even if you make a noise - kill someone and leave their body strewn about for all to see - or throw something at them.  They do investigate the sounds origin or casually leave their friend lying in front of them while "checking out" what could have done it, but after all but a minute or two - they go right back to the exact same pre-determined route.\n\nIt seems as though your character is completely invisible sometimes.  Example, you could be on a ledge with an open column design directly behind you and a guard standing at what might as well be eye level and you will not be seen as long as you push the button to get into cover - even though you are quite literally looking them in the face, they will not see you.  Harder difficulties increase the guards "perception" but you can still walk up behind 2 guys that are standing next to each other and as long as they are not facing one another you can do a "silent kill" inches away from the other one. It's ridiculous.\n\nHonestly, i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.  I've seen early 2000's games with better walking animations and a stronger stealth system.  Yea, the graphics are a higher quality, however, i'd rather play a game with a better dynamic than a game that looks pretty.\n\nTo conclude, the game is choppy, unreasonable, and just not fun.  Spend your money elsewhere.","October 25, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 39 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","5","39","0","0"

The combat is probably the worst I've seen, if you get caught, you are locked in combat, by that i mean forced to fight, you don't have the option to try and run and escape their vision, and the combat system is parrying their attacks, which is set up quicktime like, but even that is clumsy and sometimes doesn't even work properly. You have a dagger, but the only time you can use it offensively is when you aren't detected, in open combat, its simply a counter weapon.

Sure, it's a download title so I think I might forgive it for that but some of the textures are out of line like the wall textures, thankfully that's not the biggest part of the game because it still looks good for a download title.

Sure sometimes you can get a hit in once in a while but damn you'd die more times than actually kill anyone..\n\n4/10\n\nStealth -\nNow the stealth is great because you have a large amount of abilities to use to aid you on your mission. Some include the ability to slightly kill someone, creep up from under secert tunnels and so on. You're also able to turn off lights to stay within the shadows which is great because that's basically what you'll be doing 24/7 in the game... which is actually good but can get annoying for people who just wanna kill.\n\n8.5/10\n\nAI -\nDumb.... so freaking dumb... you're able to get away from them by hiding in a pot or just clinging onto a ledge...

You have some cool abilities and a nicely done upgrade system which is rewarding and you are able to upgrade all the skills. There is also a skill set which you can unlock when certain skill sets have been maxed out.. Obviously as this is a stealth game you cannot take on hordes of enemies, you can take on 1 or maybe 2 but then you must run and hide.\nAs many people say, the texture qaulity isnt amazing but i dont see a problem with the graphics; I quite like them.\n\n-Climbing is a bit clunky at times aswell, but it still works fine. (I found out when climbing you need to hold the jump button, Space/A to keep hold of the ledge.)\n\n9/10\n\nEDIT:\n\nCompleted the game, the story was awesome, really well done.\nNow im oging back to get 100%, i really enjoy the timed challenge and collecitng all the tokens.\n\nDefinatly recommend this game, my favourite stealth game by far. It has its bugs but i love it <3.","December 30, 2014","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that this game was made in the current generation is a glimmer of hope that great stealth games can still be made.\n\nPerformance is perfectly optimized; nice graphics and low system requirements. Fluid controls. Huge levels. Long missions. Solid stealth system. A great story. A good price. And best of all, there is no DLC. It's as though this game has everything!\n\nCertainly, this is not a perfect game. The combat system for instance is terrible, which consists in engaging in a relatively difficult QTE-block/dodge duel of swords with one enemy all at the same time his fellow guards are shooting arrows and throwing stuff at you which you must also dodge. But given this is a pure stealth game I guess combat is irrelevant (the point is to be a ghost, if you're spotted you're done).\n\nThe game provides a lot of freedom to deal with enemies and complete objectives; gameplay elements such as using clones, smoke explosions, invisibility, poisoning food and drinks, and several takedown abilities makes it perfect for creativity and experimentation, and the huge level encourage exploration, and the discovery and execution of new tactics every time you play. There is an RPG feature which consists of experience points you gain by performing specific tasks. Unlocking skills and powers requires XP points, but you can only do it when you're not in a mission. In addition to checkpoints (auto saves) it also allows to quick save/load at your own discretion (something that is becoming rare in this consolized age).\n\nThe controls are so fluid that it fools you into thinking you can do anything, jump any distance or reach any ledge without effort. It takes some time and practice to master it. Knowing exactly when to jump, crouch, walk, slow down or sprint is key in this game. This is one of the things I love about it, the precision of your movements rely completely on you and only you, there is no "Press A to Parkour". Of course, since the game isn't perfect there are rare occasions when ledge detection doesn't work the way you'd expect, like some edges you can't grab on to, or others where you are "magnetically" attached to. Also, if you plug in a controller the character movement is still digital (you can only walk or run), which makes playing with an analog stick feel weird.\n\nThe stealth system is incredibly fine-tuned. One wrong move and you're done. Guards are definitely not shortsighted, and have a good hearing too. Dark areas DON'T mean you're safe, they only mean you're SLIGHTLY LESS LIKELY to be seen, as in, enemies will take a couple more seconds to realize you're there. Also, enemies ARE NOT fools: if you arise suspicion however slightly they will start checking corners, under tables, inside vases, etc.; stay in a single spot and you're done. And that is only regarding humans, I won't even mention the other enemies in the game for the sake of not spoiling the story. Ok, whatever, here goes a spoiler at your own risk: elves WILL SMELL YOU from a distance. There. You can quit stealth games now.\n\nYou're also required to be very careful where you step into, as sometimes there will be clutter laying around as if it were on purpose (of course it is! Broomsticks around corners, buckets in the frame of windows, obstructing chairs when under desks and tables) which make noises that won't be ignored. One negative point in my opinion is that the physics engine is exaggerated when it comes to clutter: no matter how slow you sneak, pass too close and even the slightest graze can send a wooden chair flying across the room alerting everyone in the area.\n\nAbout the length, it took me about 50 hours to finish the game and reach 100% completion in a single playthrough in normal difficulty. Doing other playthroughs with harder difficulties makes the game a whole different, as some tactics that worked before may not work this time, urging you to make different approaches. Another negative point I can think of is that increasing the difficulty only affects the sensitivity and strength of the enemies and not gameplay per se. It would have been nice if there were less resources, add more guards, tighten patrol patterns, add a time limit, etc. Although I believe you can achieve this by restricting yourself while playing (in my case, i'd sometimes play never using any powers at all, and/or if I screw up i'd restart the whole zone or the entire mission depending on my mood).\n\nThis game is the closest thing we have to true hardcore stealth in the current generation, and I recommend you play this even if you're not quite into stealth because it's a beautifully crafted product that can't be missed and one of the best games ever made in my opinion. If this doesn't make you truly appreciate stealth, nothing will.","January 15, 2015","true","92.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teggygah/recommended/242640/","teggygah","Teggy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teggygah/","1237 products in account","The big plus in this game is the level design. The levels are huge and vertical with tons of alternate and hidden paths. Also, what might sometimes seem to be a shortcut might have a challenge of its own, such as needing to tiptoe past some creatures. Overall, extremely impressive and fun to explore.\n\nHowever, the second half of the game is going back through the same 3 levels, just the opposite direction. While going forward through a level is not necessarily the same as going back due to places you came down but can no longer go up, and the levels are large, it's pretty obvious what's going on.\n\nThe big negative in the game is the controls. The issues with dropping to ledges could have easily been fixed with a drop-to-ledge button like every other game has. The jumping is super floaty, but I guess overall I didn't miss too many landings because of that. Not being able to shimmy around corners is just lazy.\n\nOutside of that I think everything comes down to taste. The game is a fantastical world and has invisibility and the ability to create clones to distract, but the stealth mechanics are actually highly realistic:\n- Being in the dark does not mean you are totally invisible like Splinter Cell or Thief.\n- Making the slightest sound can be heard by someone near enough. Even a muffled kill will be detected, or a short drop to the floor.\n- If you are in the light you can be seen by someone who is far away.\n- Bodies are easily found if not hidden or dissolved.\n- (not realistic, but something that makes it more difficult) In later levels the enemies can not only see you, they can smell you.\n\nHaving these features does not make the game inherently good or bad. But it can be good or bad for an individual, depending on what you like. For me, it turns out that cranking up the realism too much makes the game a bit less fun. Dealing with these features means either avoiding stylish stealth kills, one of the best parts of stealth games for me, or being really patient. And being really patient means waiting a long time in one spot for an opening, which can be kind of boring. Some of the optional objectives in each level to get max xp (and unlock all the abilities) is to collect all the coins and to get through without killing anyone. I can't imagine the amount of patience and save abuse one would probably have to go through to get all the coins in particular. But some people are into that, and that is probably a good judge for whether this game is for you or not.","January 19, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked games such as the original Thief series (which you should, because they're great) then this may be for you.  However, it can be frustrating!\n\nThe graphics in this game are great: impressive, grand and smooth.  The sound and music is good as well, as is the presentation in general.\n\nThe main character is charismatic and nimble (although it's occasionally irritating when ledges are involved), which is good because the guards in this game are pretty good at spotting you when you make too much noise or aren't in the shadows.  I found myself doing the good ol' quicksave-quickload dance too often for my liking.\n\nThe stealth options are satisfying, with skill trees to aid in this.  In later levels, I found the skill tree options to be essential for getting through some situations.  At a basic level, though, stealth-based options like the ability to extinguish torches from a distance are a nice touch.\n\nThere are combat-oriented skills but I've been stealthing/ghosting through levels, as is my wont, so can't really comment on that.\n\nAfter a strong first few levels, it becomes slightly repetitive (both in level design and actual gameplay).  The formula itself, though, is strong enough that it can get away with it for the most part.\n\nIf you're into hardcore stealth games then give this a go as it's imaginative, uncompromising and rewarding.  If you're looking for a generic platformer then other games may be more suitable.","December 3, 2014","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh, don't get me wrong, you can sneak up behind someone and kill them (unless they are a Knight or an Elf or one of those guys who can immobilise you from a distance….), but the only combat you have is a simplistic parry and riposte mechanism that frankly works so badly that I would imagine most players avoid it entirely.\n\nThere are multiple development trees that let you upgrade Stix's skills, and the most redundant of those would appear to be the combat tree, which eventually reduces the precision required on the timing of your parry. If you're never going to parry, why upgrade it, huh?\n\nWell, for a game that is predicated on stealth and the avoidance of confrontation, the ending of this game seems extremely ill advised since it is predicated upon that very skill. If you haven't upgraded your combat skill I'd estimate the chances of getting through to the end of the game are directly related to your ability to figure out the timing of the parry move, and since you probably arrived at this point without using it……… well, you get the point.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this game, because aside from the dumb ending the game is an absolute blast, and probably the best stealth game to date.\n\nAs a design decision, the inclusion of any form of face to face combat was a mistake. It would have been better to save those animations and routines for a nice crossbow, or the ability to drop bricks on people's heads. What were the developers thinking?

It looked like it had something from the first Assassins Creed but a darker atmosphere.\nI was really dissapointed. The game feels like the devs were really trying but the special something something that gives the atmosphere is missing.\nThe proportions and ingame atmosphere is everything else than epic, the graphics are alright but theres so much more they could have done, it just feels empty sneaking through the levels. There's a big lack of backgroundsounds, interaction with the world and no characters grow onto you because the conversations and stuff has been made kinda loveless and characters all look the same.\nThat would make it a mediocre game that could finish just for the sake of finishing but theres one really big flaw -\nThe AI. The enemies in this game are really primitive. For example: You can run at unarmed enemies which will cause them to look at you and scream shortly, when you're hidden again they will just continue cleaning the ground/looking at books or whatever like nothing ever happened. The armed enemies will follow you shortly or throw knifes at you when they can't reach you, but as soon as you're hidden they'll just  keep running their paths, maybe they have their swords drawn now and spot you 1/10 second quicker. The dumb AI also makes the clones useless for me, because if I want to distract enemies with them they'll just instantly return to their post after they killed the clone. They don't wonder where it came from, they are okay with the fact that it vaporizes in front of their eyes, nothing.\n\nBut its tons of things like this that make the game feel so empty. The "shiny mechanisms" of being able to clone yourself, having a special vision to highlight things or turning yourself invisible for a brief moment don't change anything about that, they have been done a thousand times before and probably a thousand times they were implemented better.\nThis game isn't bad, but its not good either. Its boring and whoever says its the "stealth game of the year" or gives it a rating beyond a 6/10 has never played classic stealth games like the old thief, splinter cell, hitman or deus ex series.\nThis isn't worth 30 Euros and I think it's bordering on impudence to charge this much money for it.\n\nIt's not even that I have a personal hatred against this game, I try to enjoy it really hard but I can't, which is almost sad. If the devs put a little bit more persistance (creating an AI for the sake of fun and challenge in game and not for the sake of having an AI) and creativity (it needs more than graphics and 20 levels out of the same map parts to make a game world feel alive) in the creation of this game it really could have been a big seller. But it isn't because the game doesn't "mesmerize" or "enthral" you, it doesn't fascinate you.\nThe trailer and pics, unfortunately, did fascinate me in the first place.","December 4, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reviewing this is quite hard, it's not the usual stealth game - a genre that I really enjoy. The first half of the game starts out promising, with a skill tree, small side missions in the decently sized levels and the ability to control a clone of yourself. The latter of the game however, is slightly less 'fun'- during the final few levels, the game goes from being an enjoyable stealth game to being...well, a big game of 'Hide and seek' - then it commences on to the final battle, which  if you haven't spec'ed into the right tree and gained the right skills you will find more than hard. With the irritating mechanic of only being able to spec into skills when at the Hideout - of which you only visit about 3 times(hardly enough to spec correctly). This game has a lot going for it in the first half of the game, though I feel as if the end of the game was a bit rushed and thus not much fun.\nAll in all, if the game is on discount I'd reccomend picking it up- there are at least a few hours of stealth action to be picked out.

Tech advanced greatly since the days we used to roam the backstreets as Corvo Attano, so Styx offers pretty much unparalleled verticality to it’s levels. They still have some issues and probably aren’t as thought-out as they were in Dishonored and Thief games, especially since some routes lead to dead ends and some paths aren’t as connected as they should be. But overall its still so much better than regular 2 height levels we get in most modern stealth and assasination games. Design, music and sound are all very nice and so are the graphics, surprisingly. You don’t tend to see this much polish in Cyanide. Other thing that is a bit rought, apart from some level design/controls wierdness is AI of the guards. It’s not that they’re completely stupid, their intelligence is just really hit or miss with both moments of complete brilliance and utter stupidity.\n\nIn the end...I so far scaled massive levels, created my clones from my puke, poisoned guards using my spit...I’d say 8/10","December 23, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_julio/recommended/242640/","el_julio","George Bashington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_julio/","174 products in account","Man this is quite a difficult and frustrating game. Few items, many enemies and above all, HUGE levels with many alternative ways.\n\nAll in all it's quite the good stuff if you like stealth games like the first two or three of the Splinter Cell series and, of course, the first two Thief games. But let's face it, there are annoying flaws that could have been fixed before releasing the game, without breaking its style or even without lowering its difficulty too much. It could have been a good alternative to Dishonored, which is one of my all-time favorite stealth-based games but unfortunately, it is not (at least not yet), due to these few reasons only.\n\nFirst of all, guards' vision seems to be random. Sometimes they will seem to see right through the back of their heads, and sometimes they won't notice you at all, even if you're almost facing them. They also have an incredibly accurate sight, which is a good thing that keeps the difficulty high, but which is also, sometimes, a real pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Globally, you will often wonder how on earth did this guy see you while that one ignored you completely. The system is too random to be trusted and makes the game frustrating, because you have to be extra cautious to wait for the right moment - and there is often only ONE good moment on a guard's routine - just to find out that while you were waiting for guard number one to be placed "correctly" for a silent kill, four guys that you could absolutely not see or hear appeared in the room and will kill you.\n\nThe MOST ANNOYING THING is the totally worthless jump / grab system: you will fall to your death quite often because the program does not properly recognize an object you can hold on to, and sometimes, you will be killed by guards because you accidentaly grabbed some piece of furniture, a mere one-foot above the ground. There is almost no awareness at all involved here, which is a real shame for a 2014 game, released after all the Tomb Raider series that does it more than fine, and after Assassin's Creed games that share the same problem.\n\nI have nearly broken my F5/F9 keys, since I have spent the last 13 hours saving and reloading like I don't remember having done it nearly as much since 1996. There is some kind of autosave but, unless you're totally masochist, you won't rely on it solely, and you will more than likely save after every single kill done right. And fail the next, and reload, and fail again, etc.\n\nLet's finish with the bad things. The graphics look really old. Most textures are really low-res and this absence of visual clarity is another thing that makes the game artificially difficult: sometimes, you will not find the alternative route just because you could not see it, as it is lost in some graphic soup of odd colours and bad-looking textures. It's a pity to find out that you could have easily spared two guys and grabbed some treasure, just after you tried and failed the other way like ten times in a row. Since, most of the times, the presence of many guards prevents you from correctly scouting your immediate surroundings, you will not be able to see that grate, that tunnel, that piece of furniture that could've provided some shelter, and so on. Only after having lost thirty minutes killing everybody one by one will you see that there was another way in.\n\nOf course, that will make you want to replay the levels, which is a good thing, for a bad reason. A good reason would have been: "because it was fun". Here, it will be more like: "because it was frustrating not to be able to finish the level properly at first try, even after I took all the sweet time I had".\n\nSo, one word: FRUSTRATING. There is too little fun in this game, as opposed to too many little frustrating issues. Let's hope that the devs will work on improving the jump / grab thing, at least.\n\nNow for the good things:\n\nThe devs made it nice to play a character with a very reduced set of abilities and a very small inventory. When it's fun, it really is. Some parts of levels are highly satisfying, while others will be your own little private hell. The "magic" involved does not feel like cheating at all, not like some powers in Dishonored, for example (the X-ray vision power, to be more specific): using it will be your last hope, sometimes, and you won't feel like breaking the game if you do it. The scenario is quite nice; even if it's not high-quality medieval-fantastic stuff, it's rather good and interesting. One last thing I enjoyed is the fact that you have to do some levels "both ways" (in and out) with more or less items to help you, more or less or different enemies, etc.\n\nAll in all, it could have been another Dishonored, with smaller, much more dense and open levels, but too many little things make it more frustrating than fun. Dishonored was just difficult enough but fun to play all along, while Styx only has some too short very good moments, opposed to screams of agony when all the odds are against you.\n\nA tiny little bit of work could make it near perfect, more "casual" (as in: easier to handle without really breaking its difficulty) and much more fun to play. I really hope the devs will fix the very few little flaws that make the result too difficult to handle. At this point, I still don't know if I really enjoy playing it or if it is only the challenge that keeps me coming back to it.\n\nAs a conclusion I recommend it anyway, like 60-65% positively, because it's not expensive, full of promises and it's worth a try at that price. I hope to see a Styx 2 anytime soon, with a better balance and with corrected features. In the meantime, I can't help but launch the first one again and again. I WILL beath that damn level without killing anyone, I swear it.","December 23, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for encouragement to buy this game, then stop right here and BUY IT. I'll wait.\n\nOK! Now that it's downloading, read on!\n\nYou will like this if you are a stealth fan. You will like it even more if you are a goblin fan! This game made me love the greenskins even more than I already did <3<3<3\n\nThe stealth elements are fun, which is good, because this is a stealth game and you gotta stealth through this. There is no option to get into a brawl with a dozen guards if you stealth-fail and a guard spots you and raises the alarm. There are multiple options to get around guards and situations, and if you're ballsy enough, you can do it no problem. As you go along and increase your stats, it gets easier, especially when you acquire the level on the stealth tree that allows you to be invisible indefinitely while remaining still.\n\nThe gameplay is all well and good, but I really enjoyed the STORY. Without spoiling anything, this just gets BETTER several times as ♥♥♥♥ goes down. There was one part in the game where I had to stop and take a breather because everything I thought I knew was just turned around. I had a feeling it was coming, but the way it was handled was SO MUCH BETTER than I could have hoped. The story goes on and it gets better until the end, whcih is very satisfying.\n\nNow, because this is stealth, you may expect to spend a lot of time pressed up against walls and peeking around corners, waiting to pick out the guard's patrol pattern and identify any exploitable spots. You will also be saving and re-loading often for when that bloody guard notices you creeping about and raises the alarm (thus, killing your chance of a perfect no-detection run). This translates into many, many hours spent staring at Styx in all his green glory hanging off ♥♥♥♥ and peeking around things. After hours of gameplay, a couple elements began to stick out. Not necessarily BOTHERING me, but... well, after 80+ hours, I began to notice:\n- character designs get repetitive (not a big complaint, but just very noticeable when average guard #324 looks just like the smugglers I dealt with, and that guard in the prison, and the three guards in the distillery, and that prisoner, etc.)\n- overheard guard comments/conversations get repetitive. Aside from some brilliantly unique dialogue I could eavesdrop on, including people puzzling over what kind of creature I am, as I went, I eventually heard some librarians discussing how to classify me, and one suggested I should be a goblin (AWESOME!), it got tiring to hear so many different guards talking about the same things. How many snuffboxes were lost in a game of cards??\n- killed bodies violently flop and fly about after I kill them but before I can pick them up. Unhelpful if I'm trying to do this lickety-split before his buddy sees me. Flopping out of my reach and into a live guard's line of sight is unhelpful, dead body.\n- dead bodies' interactions with solid objects is hit and miss. some bodies' heads disappeared into the walls they slumped against, other bodies fell through floors to land on the levels below (thus, hindering my attempts at a no-bodies discovered playthrough.\n\nThese are minor quibbles, which only really became big because I plugged so much of my life into playing this. Really, though, this game is super-satisfying and you just might enjoy it, too!","November 29, 2014","true","84.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best stealth game of the last years. If it had been released 3 years ago, it would've been a bestseller.\n\nPros:\n+ Good optimization, works at maximum settings in 1080p on a Core 2 + GF650Ti without flaws at  high frame rate.\n+ Level design. Although it's mostly "get from Point A to point B", there are always several ways to do it. The levels do not feel too linear. something between old Thief trilogy and Thief 2014, probably a level of Deux Ex revolution.\n+ Great main character. More charismatic that even Garreth. BTW, his prophanity is not safe for children.\n+ Stealth mechanics is simplier than in original Thief trilogy, but more fair and very satisfying.\n+ Side objectives and challenges for extra replayability.\n+ Skills are useful, but not a must.\n+ Fair acrobatics. Jump and fall wherever you like. Suck it, Thief 2014!\n+ Autosave plus manual saving system.\n+ Plays great with gamepad or keyboard+mouse.\n+ Several difficulty levels. Higher levels advised for experienced players as normal is just too easy.\n\nCons:\n- Graphic is several years old. Effects are low, but design is good.\n- Only one flaw in acrobatics: not always obvious which edges can be hanged from.\n- I had 1 crash in 10 hours. Not much, but crashes are possible.\n- Physics is limited. Not all objects are interactable. Ragdoll is OK though.\n- A mix of animated cutscenes and slideshows.\n\nSummary: Highly recommended to those, who like old-school stealth games and can live with several years old graphics. I don't see any good alternatives after original thief trilogy. It plays good, feels lighter and more positive and fun than Thief. About the same level of difficulty and strategy involved. The game somewhat suffers from limited fundings, but other than that it's a jewel in stealth genre.","December 10, 2014","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a handful of problems whch can be very annoying (repetitive enemy models / difficulty ledge hopping) but if you can look past these issues Styx is a wonderful game and worth the money.\n\nThe storyline behind styx can be at times, loose and cliche, but nearing the end it all seems to tighten and come together. without giving away the end; the game delivers a meloncholy conclusion that can be seen as both a victory and a defeat for the main character Rakash. There is a sense of hopelessness with the main character originally being the puppet master to eventually having all his strings cut and simply watching the world devolve around him. This sense of purpose is replaced with a new goal: revenge. Thats where things get a little cliche, but over all don't hammer too hard on that topic.\n\nGameplay is styx is both amazing and terrible. If you attempt to play the game where you engage in open combat with enemies you'll find it clunky and unfun. However, if you go the full stealth route and use methods like silent kills and falling chandeliers, you'll have a deep and rich challenge that both looks and feels intense and rewarding. That said, there are multiple ways to play and multiple paths through each level. This adds a lot to replayability, however there is one thing which keeps you from actually doing it: near halfway through the game you are sent on new missions through old levels going backwards. This means that in one play through you'll go through each level twice, which makes the idea of a second playthrough on a harder difficulty redundant and tiresome. There is also no "new game +" feature allowing you to keep your skills and move into a harder difficulty. This seemed like something that would be fairly obvious as when you finish the game you won't have all your skills maxed and there is a ton of room for new moves and playstyles. The game recommends you replay old levels to earn more XP for skills, but that doesn't have the same feel.\n\nOverall styx is worth the money and worth the playtime. I spent about 30 hours from start to finish and felt like i got to experience 90% of the game. Although it has many elements that make it possibly worth replaying again ... you more than likely won't.

However, it can be frustrating!\n\nThe graphics in this game are great: impressive, grand and smooth.  The sound and music is good as well, as is the presentation in general.\n\nThe main character is charismatic and nimble (although it's occasionally irritating when ledges are involved), which is good because the guards in this game are pretty good at spotting you when you make too much noise or aren't in the shadows.  I found myself doing the good ol' quicksave-quickload dance too often for my liking.\n\nThe stealth options are satisfying, with skill trees to aid in this.  In later levels, I found the skill tree options to be essential for getting through some situations.  At a basic level, though, stealth-based options like the ability to extinguish torches from a distance are a nice touch.\n\nThere are combat-oriented skills but I've been stealthing/ghosting through levels, as is my wont, so can't really comment on that.\n\nAfter a strong first few levels, it becomes slightly repetitive (both in level design and actual gameplay).  The formula itself, though, is strong enough that it can get away with it for the most part.\n\nIf you're into hardcore stealth games then give this a go as it's imaginative, uncompromising and rewarding.

Oh, don't get me wrong, you can sneak up behind someone and kill them (unless they are a Knight or an Elf or one of those guys who can immobilise you from a distance….), but the only combat you have is a simplistic parry and riposte mechanism that frankly works so badly that I would imagine most players avoid it entirely.\n\nThere are multiple development trees that let you upgrade Stix's skills, and the most redundant of those would appear to be the combat tree, which eventually reduces the precision required on the timing of your parry. If you're never going to parry, why upgrade it, huh?\n\nWell, for a game that is predicated on stealth and the avoidance of confrontation, the ending of this game seems extremely ill advised since it is predicated upon that very skill. If you haven't upgraded your combat skill I'd estimate the chances of getting through to the end of the game are directly related to your ability to figure out the timing of the parry move, and since you probably arrived at this point without using it……… well, you get the point.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this game, because aside from the dumb ending the game is an absolute blast, and probably the best stealth game to date.\n\nAs a design decision, the inclusion of any form of face to face combat was a mistake. It would have been better to save those animations and routines for a nice crossbow, or the ability to drop bricks on people's heads. What were the developers thinking? And making the ending about twitch timing just feels like a betrayal.\n\nBut hey, maybe I just played the game wrong!","November 21, 2014","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looked like it had something from the first Assassins Creed but a darker atmosphere.\nI was really dissapointed. The game feels like the devs were really trying but the special something something that gives the atmosphere is missing.\nThe proportions and ingame atmosphere is everything else than epic, the graphics are alright but theres so much more they could have done, it just feels empty sneaking through the levels. There's a big lack of backgroundsounds, interaction with the world and no characters grow onto you because the conversations and stuff has been made kinda loveless and characters all look the same.\nThat would make it a mediocre game that could finish just for the sake of finishing but theres one really big flaw -\nThe AI. The enemies in this game are really primitive. For example: You can run at unarmed enemies which will cause them to look at you and scream shortly, when you're hidden again they will just continue cleaning the ground/looking at books or whatever like nothing ever happened. The armed enemies will follow you shortly or throw knifes at you when they can't reach you, but as soon as you're hidden they'll just  keep running their paths, maybe they have their swords drawn now and spot you 1/10 second quicker. The dumb AI also makes the clones useless for me, because if I want to distract enemies with them they'll just instantly return to their post after they killed the clone. They don't wonder where it came from, they are okay with the fact that it vaporizes in front of their eyes, nothing.\n\nBut its tons of things like this that make the game feel so empty. The "shiny mechanisms" of being able to clone yourself, having a special vision to highlight things or turning yourself invisible for a brief moment don't change anything about that, they have been done a thousand times before and probably a thousand times they were implemented better.\nThis game isn't bad, but its not good either. Its boring and whoever says its the "stealth game of the year" or gives it a rating beyond a 6/10 has never played classic stealth games like the old thief, splinter cell, hitman or deus ex series.\nThis isn't worth 30 Euros and I think it's bordering on impudence to charge this much money for it.\n\nIt's not even that I have a personal hatred against this game, I try to enjoy it really hard but I can't, which is almost sad. If the devs put a little bit more persistance (creating an AI for the sake of fun and challenge in game and not for the sake of having an AI) and creativity (it needs more than graphics and 20 levels out of the same map parts to make a game world feel alive) in the creation of this game it really could have been a big seller. But it isn't because the game doesn't "mesmerize" or "enthral" you, it doesn't fascinate you.\nThe trailer and pics, unfortunately, did fascinate me in the first place.","December 4, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are expansive and involve a lot of verticality with plenty of room for exploration with secrets and collectibles to find.\nRefreshingly the hero is not another sam fisher or solid snake but a down and dirty goblin/orch, your small stature makes combat inadvisable but allows you to hide under tables and in small vents, and no stealth game is complete without standing right next to some thicko guard and sniggering at him as he loudly asks where the hell you went.\n\nThe two main faults of the game are the somewhat short and repetitive routes the guards take, nothing kills immersion like watching one guy sitting on a bench, walk 5m forward to lean on a balcony handrail and then walk back to sit on the same bench. The other fault of the game lies in that some levels while expansive are somewhat narrow, theres point a and point b and a limited amount of routes between sections.\n\nAll in all 9/10","December 6, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is always a different way in which you can pass by someone without him noticing you. Combat is very simple, only thing you have to do is press the left mouse button in the right time. I have played game on Goblin difficulty, which means that there is no combat (except with the clones), they just kill you when they find you (if you don't escape). Best achievement in this game is to get Shadow insignia in all lvl, and if you are playing at the Goblin difficulty it can get tricky.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me is the edge approach, you don't have a option to hand from the edge when you approach it from the top. You can jump and try to aim at the edge but that way you can be noticed. The best thing game developers can do is to make a movement in which you press "E" when you approach the edge and you start to hand from it. I can't think of a reason why they didn't put that option in.\n\nOne more thing, which is a bug or a glitch i guess, dead bodies (yours included) start shaking and passing through objects until they settle down to some place. It makes harder to hide some bodies.\n\nHaving said that, I found this game very entertaining and difficult and I think it's worth the money, you get a good amount of in game hours, especially if you want to get all the skills and collect all the coins.","December 7, 2014","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a handful of problems whch can be very annoying (repetitive enemy models / difficulty ledge hopping) but if you can look past these issues Styx is a wonderful game and worth the money.\n\nThe storyline behind styx can be at times, loose and cliche, but nearing the end it all seems to tighten and come together. without giving away the end; the game delivers a meloncholy conclusion that can be seen as both a victory and a defeat for the main character Rakash. There is a sense of hopelessness with the main character originally being the puppet master to eventually having all his strings cut and simply watching the world devolve around him. This sense of purpose is replaced with a new goal: revenge. Thats where things get a little cliche, but over all don't hammer too hard on that topic.\n\nGameplay is styx is both amazing and terrible. If you attempt to play the game where you engage in open combat with enemies you'll find it clunky and unfun. However, if you go the full stealth route and use methods like silent kills and falling chandeliers, you'll have a deep and rich challenge that both looks and feels intense and rewarding. That said, there are multiple ways to play and multiple paths through each level. This adds a lot to replayability, however there is one thing which keeps you from actually doing it: near halfway through the game you are sent on new missions through old levels going backwards. This means that in one play through you'll go through each level twice, which makes the idea of a second playthrough on a harder difficulty redundant and tiresome. There is also no "new game +" feature allowing you to keep your skills and move into a harder difficulty. This seemed like something that would be fairly obvious as when you finish the game you won't have all your skills maxed and there is a ton of room for new moves and playstyles. The game recommends you replay old levels to earn more XP for skills, but that doesn't have the same feel.\n\nOverall styx is worth the money and worth the playtime. I spent about 30 hours from start to finish and felt like i got to experience 90% of the game. Although it has many elements that make it possibly worth replaying again ... you more than likely won't. But then, maybe a good game only needs to be experienced once.","December 11, 2014","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the player needs to keep their wits about them and find more original and creative ways to dispose of foes, as some wear heavy armor that your dagger can't pierce and others will gladly down you with a few quick bolts from their crossbow as soon as they see you.\nAs for the lore of this fantasy realm, it is far more dark than your usual Tolkien-inspired orcs and elfs and I think to many that will come as a relief as it did to me. Granted, some of the humor feel gritty for gritty sake, but it does help to flesh out this world you'll infiltrate.\nGraphically, its not the most stunning, but it gets the job done and won't pull you from the immersion and draw of the game.\n\nIts pretty good; I'd say worth the price of admission if you're into that sort of thing.","December 12, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it's a fun stealth/action game that has very nicely set up its playstyle-reward system in a way that incentivizes playing through the few levels more than once without punishing you for having a favorite way of clearing a stage.\n\nI, for one, love trying for the non-lethal ghost runs, and there are bonus points for both facets of that style of play. However, I did enjoy going back through the levels (of which, sadly, there are really only two or three, with slight variations in where you can and need to go each time through) for the speed runs or collection-quest side objectives that gave me a chance to mess around with some of the game's lethal options or see just how many guards I could get on my tail without dying to a hail of throwing knives.\n\nThe enemy AI is a bit spotty, the beetle and Orc enemies are absolute pains in the ♥♥♥ at times, and more than once I screwed myself over when Styx auto-grabbed onto a ledge or climbed up an edge I'd wanted to hang off of. These are problems that generally don't /ruin/ the experience so much as discolor it slightly. If you're smart with your quick-saving - and don't mind the moderately long loading times that quick-loading can bring - they'll be little more than minor setbacks.\n\nFor comparisons, think of it like Assassin's Creed without a lot of its fluff, or like a very mobile, third-person Thief game.

The main character is fun, the story is interesting, the voice-work is not bad and the level design is pretty damn amazing to the point where you don't mind the backtracking since the objectives and enemy placements change each time.   The problem is the controls.  The looseness of the controls turns this from a small-developer sleeper hit to the "Bad Rats" of stealth games.  It's just so insanely frustrating to play for any length of time that I can't recommend it in good faith to anybody at any price.","January 3, 2015","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat sucks, I'll say that outright, and as mentioned in the cons above, it's difficult, and sometimes impossible, to escape once you're locked in. That said, given that there's three types of enemies that have instant kill attacks if they catch you, and one that may as well be instant, for how it stunlocks you, combat's clearly not the draw of the game. The levels are wide open, with many paths available to take, some more dangerous than others, but nothing impossible, and certainly not impossible to get the undetected or merciful achievements. Unlike in other stealth games, like Dishonored for instance, there's no penalty to killing everything that crosses your path, if you can manage it. It's more of a tradeoff. An easier level now, or an easier path, in exchange for not getting some skill points and an achievement at the end of the level.\n\nThey clearly spent their time considering the stealth aspects of the game, and it shows in how well it comes together. The enemy AI is brilliant. Not impossible to get by, but if you draw too much attention, they'll take their time searching, checking everywhere you could be hiding at ground level, or on ledges beneath them, going so far as to drag you out of hiding if they find you. If they give up on their search, which will take time, they'll still remain on alert, keeping a close eye on things, and going back to the search if given the slightest reason. They'll investigate suspicious sounds, but, until the second half of the game, will pass off death by chandelier or falling crate as accidents, and poisoning as illness. After the second half, it varies on what they'll do -in some places, I've found dropping a chandelier on someone puts everyone on high alert, and in others, they don't bat an eye. There is one spot, where you need to claim a weapon, and the nearby guard will go on alert the moment his patrol brings him to where he can see it's missing. That said, some areas are rather cheap, in that they'll place a guard in such a spot that you'll be required to go past them, in plain view, unless you kill them or use invisibility.\n\nIt does feel rather lazy that the second half of the game almost entirely consists of replaying past levels, starting on the other end of the map, with new guard placements and patrols, but it does at least offer a decent plot-relevent reason for doing so.\n\nAll in all, it's a solid game, and I highly recommend it. If you're a fan of the genre, you won't be disappointed.","December 24, 2014","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like a puzzle in and of itself trying to figure out how to use the environment and resources available to you in order to make it around enemies without detection. The combat in this game is not meant to be good combat. You're a small goblin whose specialty is hurling daggers, picking locks, and sneaking around. He is by no means a fighter and can only do so much, so anyone expecting a combat-oriented game is going to be in for a very rude awakening.\n\nMy major complaint however is the repetitiveness of the NPCs when they spot you. Every single time it's always, "A monster!" and "This one's mine!" There is extremely little variation and to be honest makes every screwup a grating exercise just because I want to avoid hearing those lines spoken. All the men in the game sound the same and spoken lines sound forced and emotionless and even downright silly in some cases.\n\nHowever overall I give this a recommendation to those who like these kinds of old-school stealth games. Don't expect it to be easy and don't expect much in the way of hand-holding. There's little fluff to it. You're given a goal or two in a mission and it's up to you to work out the puzzle from start to finish in the way you feel is best.","October 13, 2014","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does not have any real combat mechanics resulting in a Parry/Kill system when you are caught by guards. Getting seen and not escaping before the guard reaches you creates a 1v1 fight where Styx can dodge or parry attacks. Only after a few parries can you dispatch your foe. The game offers an "open world" feel by allowing you multiple pathways to achieve your goals.  There have been several times I cleared a room only to look around and see an easier path I could have taken. The game offers a bare bones upgrade system that give you a reason to explore each area as you look for "Insignia". These gold coins are strewn across each area and most can be located without too much searching.  The situations the game presents to the player seem to be well balanced and do require some thought without making you feel cheated. The real negative (and this is a big negative) is Styx's ability to traverse the enviroment. Invisible edges, ungrabbable ledges, iffy platforming all combine to cause more deaths then any enemy. Some extra attention by the developer could have smoothed these platforming issues and would have resulted is a lot less fustration. All in all I do recommend Styx: Master of Shadows to anyone that enjoys a stealth focused action game just be ready to miss a few jumps and fall to your death.","October 13, 2014","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed Thief 1,2 and Thief: Deadly Shadows, this is a game for you! It also bears similarities to the first three Splinter Cell games. I love it!\n\nThe levels are big and there are tons of areas to explore and discover. Stealth is hard, but very fun. Jumping to ledges is NOT broken if you take the time to read the tutorial texts and practice a bit. The game also just received a patch to improve ledge grab detection even further. The graphics aren't on the level of Far Cry 4, but not nearly as bad as some reviews might make you think. The positive thing is that the game runs smoothly on the highest settings. There is quicksave available anywhere and periodic autosaves.\n\nFor my first playthrough I'm doing a pacifist run while trying to get all collectibles and it took me (according to steam) 4,5 hours just to clear the tutorial and the first level (which is seperated into 3 parts). I enjoyed every minute of it and I think I will definitely get my money's worth out of this game.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone who enjoys real stealth games. Be warned though, this is not like Assassin's Creed or Shadow of Mordor. If you get spotted, your chances of surviving are VERY slim. Stealth is a MUST, not an option.\n\nPersonal recommendation: Play the game on the highest difficulty.

Named Styx. (Which is cool, how many games have starred a goblin exclusively?) The stealth gameplay is great. You have the usual array of stealth protagonist abilities like stealth kills and super-vision, but Styx also has a neat clone ability. he can literally spit up a small flexible companion to distract enemies or climb through grates and solve puzzles. Its a neat twist, which is really what I like about Styx. It does the standard, expected stealth stuff, and it does it well, but it adds a twist.\n\nCombat is done with timed parries, when an enemy opens up, a single attack is all that is needed for a kill. Its a good system that makes fighting a single guard to make your getaway a possibility, but quickly punishes you if you get cornered. I like the deadly, high risk feel to it.\n\nThe AI is done well, probably better than most stealth games. Maybe not quite as good as Ground Zeroes, but superior to dishonored and far superior to the new Thief. AI is a big factor in a stealth game, so getting it right is a major concern.\n\nThe graphics are decent but not great. There are seams and nothing really looks super sharp, but the actual designs are consistent and good. It is here I think it shows that Styx isn't a massively budgetted AAA title. The game in no way looks bad though, despite some rather implausible architecture.\n\nSound is done well. Nothing stands out as exemplary really, but its good. Styx's voice sounded weird for a goblin at first, but I grew accustomed quickly.\n\nI hope Styx does well, its good to have new blood in the stealth genre, and this is a solid, fun and unique entry.

I've been enjoying it a good amount, more than steam would imply (it says 5 hours but I've definitely played near double that). There was a couple issues at launch which they addressed immediately with a patch, and now they've patched again addressing the other common complaints (such as adding more custom bind options and adjusting ledge detection).\n\nI would definitely recommend playing this game on the hardest setting. Even "hard" is far too easy from what I've seen of it - select goblin and stay goblin! You'll be forced to actually be sneaky instead of just EZ-mode "press x to parry" nonsense, because on goblin mode everything just instantly rapes you if you're caught in a bad situation. It does mean you'll be using save points and redoing situations a lot, but not anymore than you should expect. It gives you enough tools that you'll find yourself being risky and get caught for it, but it's by no means unfair (or even difficult as long as you show some amount of patience).\n\nIt's well executed and succeeds at what it's trying to accomplish. Combine that with a developer who actually pays attention and patches known issues while responding to feedback and you have a game that I'm happy to support.","October 15, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stealth mechanics are unique: bumping into chairs, loose objects, and any other things that you might normally considered a decoration in a stealth is actually a way to be detected, or to lure foes, depending on if you have the skill, resources, and the chance to do it. Otherwise, it would be best to lie low away from where you just were or to just punch it and blitz away. Styx is a good assassination game, in the way that there's no punishment in killing enemies, (I.E. losing points, bad ending, etc.) instead, it's as if you have full freedom to dispose of anyone who gets in your way. The game is harder than Dishonored in the way that combat is not a viable option, so it results in fleeing, dying, or just reloading your last save to fix your mistake. This is a solid stealth game that has many pluses and few downsides, save for glitches with some of the dead bodies and hilariously bad voice-acting at times, but that could be a good thing too. If you're the meticulous planner or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that enjoys going head in and fully adapting to whatever happens, then you're sure to have fun with Styx: Master of Shadows, a good throw back to classic games of the stealth genre. 8.91/10\nHighly recommended for stealth fans and stalking assassins of the night.","October 7, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd give it 9/10, having finished what feels like about 40-50% of it.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, it does a lot of things right, stealthwise, and is pretty unforgiving in terms of getting caught.\n\nUnable to defend yourself except in the most basic, one-on-one manner, if you get caught your only recourse is to run--if you can.  You will get locked into direct combat with your nearest melee attacker if they get close enough, and it is very difficult to roll, duck, and dodge far enough away to escape.\n\nIn terms of detection, EVERYTHING in this game makes sound, and there are some critters that have hyper-sensitive hearing (though blind) that really change the way you have to approach stealth.  Worse, sometimes those critters are mixed in with normal, human enemies who AREN'T blind.\n\nYou can bump into chairs and other loose objects while hiding under a table, alerting nearby guards to something suspicious nearby.  If you keep it up or make a loud enough series of noises in succession, they may come dashing toward you and fully alert almost instantly.\n\nEnemies can also pull you out of hiding spots where in other games you'd be perfectly safe (even if the enemies saw you go in).  Not so in Styx; if a guard sees me duck into a chest to try and escape, he'll open the chest, drag me out, and throw me on the ground, engaging combat.\n\nThe game rewards you for completing main, secondary, and minor, tertiary goals by awarding skill points that you can spend (with a free respec system in place) on enhancing existing abilties or adding new ones, and the set of tools at your disposal are fairly interesting.\n\nThe most unique aspect of this game I've encountered is the "clone" ability, which lets you make a rather odd ghoul-like clone of yourself that can squeeze through some openings you can't, can ambush enemies from certain forms of hiding spots, and can grab onto an enemy to bind it for a short time while you run past or approach to kill it.\n\nIf your clone is "fully" detected, it still counts as being detected for purposes of a perfect stealth run, but you can use it to distract enemies and then destroy it (make it disappear) to give you time to sneak by. I lied.  Your clone can be totally, completely detected, and this does not affect your achievement/skillpoint runs for purposes of having been detected. :)\n\nOverall, this game far exceeded my best expectations, and it's only significant flaws are that the climbing/grappling/platforming system can be a liiiittle strange compared to conventional approaches, some of the jumps are a bit difficult (but still based on skill and timing), and the voice acting/storytelling are a little on the weak side.\n\nBut Styx is just FUN to play, and the option to replay a mission to mop up any goals you missed the previous time is a nice way to add replay value.  You do not have to complete ALL objectives in one run (or re-run), either.  You can carefully, slowly murder every guard in the place and gather every collectible one run, and do a sneaky, pacifist replay on a second, if you wish!\n\nTotally worth it, especially at its current 20% off sale price.","October 9, 2014","true","78.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does however have some short comings in it's initial release.\n\nFirst the controls, while in most cases they work fine and are quite responsive, in other cases it feels like things could have been added or tweaked. Some examples are a lack of a button for dropping from ledges, instead you have to walk off and quickly press towards the ledge, but not too quick or you just walk back on to it. Another problem here is that some ledges don't seem to allow you to grab on, so you fall to your death.\nParrying is another issue, even though I was on easy to just get a feel for the game play first, I find the parry mechanic to be brutal. It lacks any indication of when to parry, and each attack and enemy seems to have it's own timing to learn. There seems to be no slack in timing for lower difficulty levels.\nAnother thing that could be improved is the tutorial level. While I'm not a fan of too much hand holding even in tutorials, it feels like the tutorial stage is just as brutal as the rest of the game, and seems to leave a little too much guessing or trial/error to the player.\n[edit] One other issue I forgot about in this review was being locked in combat, not sure if there is a way to disengaged, as no onscreen help has made note of it, but I find it a bit jarring when this happens, and find it impossible to get away unless I kill the target.[/edit]\n\nIf like me, you can over look these early shortcomings, Styx is a fun game that will keep you on your toes, and on a look out for the many various routes one can take to achieve their goals.","October 7, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A grand hall might have 2 floors, but each floor is very tall with multiple levels of passages (smaller-step up platforms that you can go on or go under, High up ledges where the lights are for you to shimmy across, lots of things to climb on or crates hanging from cranes like platforms), then there might be ceiling beams or rafters above all that, it's very nicely done and takes advantage of your protagonists little, nimble frame. It makes the kind of 3rd person platformy nature of the jumping rewarding, as you might run and jump off a ledge toward a shortcut that you found by pretty unconventional paths.\n\nThe guard AI is pretty basic however, that outdated method of having them walk a looping patrol path and say the same thing at the same point of said path, which feels pretty janky when they're rendered to look and sound like humans with character, and so makes them come off as simple and robotic. If the game looked more like Sly Cooper or something, the simpler aesthetic might justify the simpler AI as they'd just feel more like "video game puzzles", but as it stands they just feel sort of dumb... Though higher difficulty settings can at least make them very perceptive, where even being hidden in shadow won't be enough to avoid detection if you're too close to them.\n\nOther than those two major pros/cons, there's lots of nice little things to be had... Jumping down from a high place (VERY high places in this case) and landing on a wooden floor will make a lot of noise, but aim for a stretch of carpet and you'll land softly and quietly... Rush along a corridor too carelessly and you might knock over a chair or broom and cause a racket, but immediately redeem yourself by slipping under a table or hole in the wall to hide.\n\nAll in all it's a competent stealth game, and the price on steam I think is around the $30NZD mark, so for stealth veterans I'd definitely recommend it, but it won't change the minds of non-fans of the genre.","October 8, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These are all nice, but about half the cutscenes are done in pseudo oil painting style with very little movement. Sometimes, it can be hard to work out whats happening in these scenes, which is a shame considering the writing to accompany them is quite good.\n\nMy only other real complaint is that the areas can end up feeling very similar.

But the player needs to keep their wits about them and find more original and creative ways to dispose of foes, as some wear heavy armor that your dagger can't pierce and others will gladly down you with a few quick bolts from their crossbow as soon as they see you.\nAs for the lore of this fantasy realm, it is far more dark than your usual Tolkien-inspired orcs and elfs and I think to many that will come as a relief as it did to me. Granted, some of the humor feel gritty for gritty sake, but it does help to flesh out this world you'll infiltrate.\nGraphically, its not the most stunning, but it gets the job done and won't pull you from the immersion and draw of the game.\n\nIts pretty good; I'd say worth the price of admission if you're into that sort of thing.","December 12, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teggygah/recommended/242640/","teggygah","Teggy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teggygah/","1237 products in account","The big plus in this game is the level design. The levels are huge and vertical with tons of alternate and hidden paths. Also, what might sometimes seem to be a shortcut might have a challenge of its own, such as needing to tiptoe past some creatures. Overall, extremely impressive and fun to explore.\n\nHowever, the second half of the game is going back through the same 3 levels, just the opposite direction. While going forward through a level is not necessarily the same as going back due to places you came down but can no longer go up, and the levels are large, it's pretty obvious what's going on.\n\nThe big negative in the game is the controls. The issues with dropping to ledges could have easily been fixed with a drop-to-ledge button like every other game has. The jumping is super floaty, but I guess overall I didn't miss too many landings because of that. Not being able to shimmy around corners is just lazy.\n\nOutside of that I think everything comes down to taste. The game is a fantastical world and has invisibility and the ability to create clones to distract, but the stealth mechanics are actually highly realistic:\n- Being in the dark does not mean you are totally invisible like Splinter Cell or Thief.\n- Making the slightest sound can be heard by someone near enough. Even a muffled kill will be detected, or a short drop to the floor.\n- If you are in the light you can be seen by someone who is far away.\n- Bodies are easily found if not hidden or dissolved.\n- (not realistic, but something that makes it more difficult) In later levels the enemies can not only see you, they can smell you.\n\nHaving these features does not make the game inherently good or bad. But it can be good or bad for an individual, depending on what you like. For me, it turns out that cranking up the realism too much makes the game a bit less fun. Dealing with these features means either avoiding stylish stealth kills, one of the best parts of stealth games for me, or being really patient. And being really patient means waiting a long time in one spot for an opening, which can be kind of boring. Some of the optional objectives in each level to get max xp (and unlock all the abilities) is to collect all the coins and to get through without killing anyone. I can't imagine the amount of patience and save abuse one would probably have to go through to get all the coins in particular. But some people are into that, and that is probably a good judge for whether this game is for you or not.","January 19, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the game was way too ambitous for it's own good. Too linear to be an RPG and too dull to be an action game. Decent to terrible voice ancting and storytelling. I played it almost to complition just because I wanted to know how Styx came to be, and that too was quite underwhelming.\n\nThat being sayed I picked up Styx MoS with rather low expectetions. Thank God I was 95% wrong.\n\nAltho nothing groundbreaking this is one of the best stealth titles that I played in a long while. Probably the most stealth oriented since thief (1-2-3, 4 was a joke).\n\nStyx is charismatic, his story is interesting and it will be even more enjoyable for those who never played of Orcs and Men. The enemy are not the smartest out there, but what they lack in AI they make up in variety and deadliness. On Goblin difficulty level they deliver almost always one hit kills, stay hidden!\n\nCrontrols are sharp and very responsive, they really do feel right. Camera control is, as always a problem, it always is in non first person games.\n\nThe rpgish skill system is interesting and usefull without ever making the game too easy.\n\nThe level design is just magnificent.

The levels are expansive and involve a lot of verticality with plenty of room for exploration with secrets and collectibles to find.\nRefreshingly the hero is not another sam fisher or solid snake but a down and dirty goblin/orch, your small stature makes combat inadvisable but allows you to hide under tables and in small vents, and no stealth game is complete without standing right next to some thicko guard and sniggering at him as he loudly asks where the hell you went.\n\nThe two main faults of the game are the somewhat short and repetitive routes the guards take, nothing kills immersion like watching one guy sitting on a bench, walk 5m forward to lean on a balcony handrail and then walk back to sit on the same bench.

There is always a different way in which you can pass by someone without him noticing you. Combat is very simple, only thing you have to do is press the left mouse button in the right time. I have played game on Goblin difficulty, which means that there is no combat (except with the clones), they just kill you when they find you (if you don't escape). Best achievement in this game is to get Shadow insignia in all lvl, and if you are playing at the Goblin difficulty it can get tricky.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me is the edge approach, you don't have a option to hand from the edge when you approach it from the top. You can jump and try to aim at the edge but that way you can be noticed. The best thing game developers can do is to make a movement in which you press "E" when you approach the edge and you start to hand from it. I can't think of a reason why they didn't put that option in.\n\nOne more thing, which is a bug or a glitch i guess, dead bodies (yours included) start shaking and passing through objects until they settle down to some place. It makes harder to hide some bodies.\n\nHaving said that, I found this game very entertaining and difficult and I think it's worth the money, you get a good amount of in game hours, especially if you want to get all the skills and collect all the coins.","December 7, 2014","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well the story is like the flashbacks that occur from Battlefield 3 caimpaign, the atmosphere feels like the original Thief games that were good (Deadly Shadows), and the addictivness? well I hated (and loved) to finish it. The game seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off not by its combat system or anything cheeky no it was caused by my ability of ♥♥♥♥ing it up. This game requires alertness and attention. No drifting off one wrong move and your caught by the gaurds. However the game itself did have a few quirks... for one entering the combat system was fun but when I felt like running instead of fighting the screen halted to turn around to run it focused on my attacker which I currenlty did not care about him. A small itch i kept fighting was the graphics (yes Im one of those people) on the screenshots they look "next gen" if us PC players really think of new games graphics as next gen compared to xbone 1s and such. But when playing the AA was awfully noticible, and you can't change it in menu settings (I have 1080p maxed out). It still looked not the greatest. but once the story sucks you in, you forget about the jaggies as it was outstanding! One more thing that bit me... recycled moves and maps, Ok so how the game works is you start at A and end at B when you reach the middle of the game it goes from B back to A back tracking all the maps you just played. The game was a great size being only 8gb but It lacked on that experience for me. Overall would I recommend this? Hell yea it was great, vulger, funny, addicting, and just above all else enjoyable...

I have played the original Thief 1/2  and the recent Thief + Dishonored.  The recent stealth games have all thrown alot of action / combat and mobs and situations where stealth do not work (making it very linear ). In Styx , not so.  I have found a ton of ways to get to my goal, and it is quite clear you are not supposed to be in combat,  combat is clearly an absolute last resort (and it is not fun at all, so if you get into combat, you will most likely hate it) , which again, is good. So this is not like Assassin's  Creed or Hitman where if you get discovered you go "oh well" and you just kill everyone in combat...\n\nSo in Styx the character is alot more acrobatic, which also means you will be climbing and jumping across ledges quite alot. This implies you generally have great ways to get past guards. So far i kinda like it. In Thief, your character is somewhat slow and not very climby, instead you had rope arrows and all kinds of gadgets. Styx is a bit more a of ninja , hopping, jumping , rolling and doing Assassin's Creed style take-downs (i.e. dropping from above for a kill)...he is also alot more murderous than Garrett , in fact there is not a "knock out" option in this game like in Thief.\n\nI think some might be concerned about the tombraider'ish ledge jumping, so far it has been fine since my character "sticks" to the ledges (like Assassin's Creed).\n\nIn short, great stealth game which focus on stealth and clearly wants you to avoid combat, but at the same time made your character quite the acrobat to move very fast . Every mission is an open zone with alot of options , i.e. to kill everyone or to sneak (or even ninja style, go over everyone) past everyone.\n\nThe AI is also VERY sensitive, they hear and see you quite easily (and predictably so) , even on normal difficulty (however there is at least a "huh? what is that?" phase if the guards did not quite see you) . This usually means all guards in area is instantly alerted.  So much like when i played Thief 1/2 , there is quite a bit of saving -> loading -> loading -> loading -> saving , going on (for me anyway, that's how i play) . At least the game allows you to save anywhere without limitations .","March 1, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for encouragement to buy this game, then stop right here and BUY IT. I'll wait.\n\nOK! Now that it's downloading, read on!\n\nYou will like this if you are a stealth fan. You will like it even more if you are a goblin fan! This game made me love the greenskins even more than I already did <3<3<3\n\nThe stealth elements are fun, which is good, because this is a stealth game and you gotta stealth through this. There is no option to get into a brawl with a dozen guards if you stealth-fail and a guard spots you and raises the alarm. There are multiple options to get around guards and situations, and if you're ballsy enough, you can do it no problem. As you go along and increase your stats, it gets easier, especially when you acquire the level on the stealth tree that allows you to be invisible indefinitely while remaining still.\n\nThe gameplay is all well and good, but I really enjoyed the STORY. Without spoiling anything, this just gets BETTER several times as ♥♥♥♥ goes down. There was one part in the game where I had to stop and take a breather because everything I thought I knew was just turned around. I had a feeling it was coming, but the way it was handled was SO MUCH BETTER than I could have hoped. The story goes on and it gets better until the end, whcih is very satisfying.\n\nNow, because this is stealth, you may expect to spend a lot of time pressed up against walls and peeking around corners, waiting to pick out the guard's patrol pattern and identify any exploitable spots. You will also be saving and re-loading often for when that bloody guard notices you creeping about and raises the alarm (thus, killing your chance of a perfect no-detection run). This translates into many, many hours spent staring at Styx in all his green glory hanging off ♥♥♥♥ and peeking around things. After hours of gameplay, a couple elements began to stick out. Not necessarily BOTHERING me, but... well, after 80+ hours, I began to notice:\n- character designs get repetitive (not a big complaint, but just very noticeable when average guard #324 looks just like the smugglers I dealt with, and that guard in the prison, and the three guards in the distillery, and that prisoner, etc.)\n- overheard guard comments/conversations get repetitive. Aside from some brilliantly unique dialogue I could eavesdrop on, including people puzzling over what kind of creature I am, as I went, I eventually heard some librarians discussing how to classify me, and one suggested I should be a goblin (AWESOME!), it got tiring to hear so many different guards talking about the same things. How many snuffboxes were lost in a game of cards??\n- killed bodies violently flop and fly about after I kill them but before I can pick them up. Unhelpful if I'm trying to do this lickety-split before his buddy sees me. Flopping out of my reach and into a live guard's line of sight is unhelpful, dead body.\n- dead bodies' interactions with solid objects is hit and miss. some bodies' heads disappeared into the walls they slumped against, other bodies fell through floors to land on the levels below (thus, hindering my attempts at a no-bodies discovered playthrough.\n\nThese are minor quibbles, which only really became big because I plugged so much of my life into playing this.

Sure they teach you the basics, but then they throw you out there to bumble through the levels on your own.  Combat is clunky and frustrating, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I should purposefully endeavor to avoid combat at all costs (like you would in classic Thief).  The levels are fairly large and interesting, with often multiple routes to claim some objectives.\n\nFor a stealth game, it feels like it lacks a certain bit of polish to some of the mechanics.  Jumping feels abit too floaty and you can get stuck sometimes if you're too close to a ledge you're trying to climb up on.\n\nOtherwise, it's not that bad, and I'm enjoying it the more I focus on what it is and not what I wished was different about it in comparison to Dishonored or Blacklist.","March 5, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainrhodes/recommended/242640/","captainrhodes","Captain Rhodes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainrhodes/","300 products in account","Best stealth game in ages. I'll just give you a checklist of quality, then some drawbacks:\n\n+ The story is really good, due in large part to an awesome main character.\n\n+ The main character, Styx, is not only not a thirty-somethng white guy, he's a 3 foot tall cyincal goblin with a big knife. How's that for breaking the mold?\n\n+ The environments are HUGE! In most stealth games this would spell disaster because it would mean an empty game world, but to match the level size enemy density has also been cranked up (sometimes close to 300 people in a level). This size provides much room for experimentation and avoids the problem most multiple-path stealth games run into, which is having the options too close together and thus more obvious.\n\n+ The side missions and collectibles were much needed in such a large game, and doing them rewards you with experience points to spend on new abilities as well as more character development for Styx.\n\n+The abilities available are all very well balanced. I chose to ignore some, like invisibility and "amber vision" because I thought they were cheap. Thing is, they're very limited and actually quite a relief to get to use in a particularly tricky spot, so don't worry about breaking the game.\n\n+The art design is very good. Similar to Dishonored, so if you like that art style you'll likely appreciate this. One major plus about the art style that isn't a matter of opinion is that it's not realistic, so in 10 years this game still look pretty good regardless of the tech behind the visuals.\n\n+The graphics I'd describe as "good enough". I think some people are just really picky; and considering how big the game is and how many AI characters are running around, they're quite good. They accomplish the desired atmosphere.\n\n+ The AI is pretty basic, but the essential points are hit. They can hear, they can see, the pathfinding works, etc. The best part of the AI, though, is the way enemies communicate with each other. If one guy hears something and he's got buddies nearby who did NOT hear he will tell them to follow him while he investigates; and in this game there's almost alway people nearby (again, hundreds of enemies per level). You have to be clever to break up a group.\n\n+ The length of the game varies depending on how thorough you are. No doubt this is true of most games, but in this case I'm talking a difference of at least 10 hours. I kind of rushed it and finished in 20 on "Hard". If you're a completionist or likely to replay using a different style (lethal, non-lethal, silent, etc...) you could very easily spend 50 hours.\n\n+The save system is the good ol' save anywhere, anytime save system a PC game deserves. If this wasn't a feature I don't know if I'd have had the patience to finish, but it is, so no worries.\n\n+ The challenge is (optionally) high, but it's usually your own fault if you fail at something.\n\n+ The controls are... perfect. I'm not excited about them, but they work flawlessly. Everything is responsive and simple, while maintaining enough complexity in player-to-game interaction to keep you fully immersed. Never had to look down and think of what button to press and I never had to fight the game to make it do what I wanted.\n\nNow for the bad news, of which is pretty inconsequential.\n\n- Dead bodies cannot be heaved over railing. This is just a minor irritation, but a recurring one, because the levels are so vertical in design. There are still plenty of ways to dispose of corpses.\n\n- The second half of the game uses levels from the first half in reverse. I didn't find this to be a huge problem, because I ended up not recognizing most of the terrain due to how big the levels are and actually having not fully explored the levels the first time.\n\n- The boss fight at the end is terrible. It's one of those boss fights that has little to nothing to do with what you've learned up to that point in the game. The good news is that it's short. The worse news is that it's really ♥♥♥♥ing hard if you didn't save any supplies for it. Just make sure you have some throwing knives and the worst you'll suffer from this battle is the emptiness of anti-climax. It's worth getting through, though, because there's a great ending to the story.\n\nThat's it. Fantastic game. Buy it. Cyanide Studio has given this one their all and earned a fan. I'm gonna go check out Styx's other game, the rpg Of Orcs and Men, now.","December 26, 2014","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The guards dialogue is also funny to listen to which i think is a nice touch when sneaking about. You have some cool abilities and a nicely done upgrade system which is rewarding and you are able to upgrade all the skills. There is also a skill set which you can unlock when certain skill sets have been maxed out.. Obviously as this is a stealth game you cannot take on hordes of enemies, you can take on 1 or maybe 2 but then you must run and hide.\nAs many people say, the texture qaulity isnt amazing but i dont see a problem with the graphics; I quite like them.\n\n-Climbing is a bit clunky at times aswell, but it still works fine. (I found out when climbing you need to hold the jump button, Space/A to keep hold of the ledge.)\n\n9/10\n\nEDIT:\n\nCompleted the game, the story was awesome, really well done.\nNow im oging back to get 100%, i really enjoy the timed challenge and collecitng all the tokens.\n\nDefinatly recommend this game, my favourite stealth game by far. It has its bugs but i love it <3.","December 30, 2014","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the game was way too ambitous for it's own good. Too linear to be an RPG and too dull to be an action game. Decent to terrible voice ancting and storytelling. I played it almost to complition just because I wanted to know how Styx came to be, and that too was quite underwhelming.\n\nThat being sayed I picked up Styx MoS with rather low expectetions. Thank God I was 95% wrong.\n\nAltho nothing groundbreaking this is one of the best stealth titles that I played in a long while. Probably the most stealth oriented since thief (1-2-3, 4 was a joke).\n\nStyx is charismatic, his story is interesting and it will be even more enjoyable for those who never played of Orcs and Men. The enemy are not the smartest out there, but what they lack in AI they make up in variety and deadliness. On Goblin difficulty level they deliver almost always one hit kills, stay hidden!\n\nCrontrols are sharp and very responsive, they really do feel right. Camera control is, as always a problem, it always is in non first person games.\n\nThe rpgish skill system is interesting and usefull without ever making the game too easy.\n\nThe level design is just magnificent. There are always at least 3 ways to get from point A to point B.\n\nThis game rewards patient, methodical, curious and creative players. It's just a joy.\n\nNo other game from this software house deserves your time and money more then this one. Just play it, you'll thank me later.","January 8, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple but complete mechanics. Great story and even better dialog. Stable, no crashes or tech problems what so ever(for me.) It may be short, I'm a little more than half through it and have 8.4 hours in (not that I nailed everything first try), but has a ton of replay value. It's not impossible to get every achievement either. Styx is a really cool character overall, and this little story is clever and has more to it than you'd expect.

Play it once casually for the story and amusement, and then you can always replay your missions in game to perfect your score and test your sneaking skills. I have spent half of my first playthrough collecting all the collectibles, avoiding detection, and so on, until I found myself wondering as to what the hell my role was in this world and story apart from collecting tokens. When I stopped worrying about the points and just played casually, it felt a lot more engaging.\n\nThe story itself is decent enough, although the gameplay is definitely superior. Basically you play the role of the goblin Styx.... wait do you?","November 18, 2015","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
