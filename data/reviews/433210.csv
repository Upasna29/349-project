AI. EVER. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652855773\n-grind based.\n-defeat\nsorry\n-NO WAY TO SKIP ENEMY TURNS! the boss of world 1 keeps killing me with boredom because I have to wait a full minute to see all his minions move. i can tolerate advance wars and fire emblem, so it's not the genre.\n-mobile control-esque buttons. sometimes they are required to use, sometimes they aren't.\n-Items have vanished from my inventory. i know i didn't sell them, they just dissappeared.\n-Items have de-equipped without me telling it to.\n-I have no clue how to sell stuff, as there is no easy sell menu.\n-Multiplayer makes zero sense and seems to be pure RNG.\n-you can quit multiplayer but it crashes the game.\n-only volume settings.\n\nPART III: all about magic!\n-Magic is super cryptic on what it does. you get a (sometimes) relevant image with no hint on how to use it.\n-If you gain ANY terrain walker magic, you can do the meteor glitch without meteor by standing on the terrain your walker corresponds to. you are invincible!\n-Meteor's rules are really strange. you can use it on any regular terrain, including ones you are standing on, but you CAN'T use it on bushes! what?\n-Boss is still too slow for me to want to fight, even with ridiculous stats via gear.\nEnough said for now.\n\nNEWEST PATCH 1.0.3: pathfinding feels even worse, making it hard to even use glitches! they claimed they fixed enemy movement, but it's still as slow as ever. at least achievements work. Yaaaay... also this is not "less complex". AND I STILL CAN'T SELL GEAR!\nAlso i got past boss 1 with extreme patience, and now i can't go back for the cheevo.\n\nYET ANOTHER EDIT: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660915379&tscn=1460050613\nthis speaks for itself.\n\nTOO MANY EDITS: As of 4/25/16, there has not been an update since march. considering the dev promised WEEKLY UPDATES in the announcements, and there certainly is more to fix, this is unacceptable.\n"Hi all!\nThis is our weekly update with fixes and improving.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miva2/recommended/433210/","miva2","miva2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miva2/","291 products in account","I wanted to like this game but it's just not a good game. I only played it for 15 minutes but it's enough. The idea is cool, the art looks good and the music sounds fun but the game just doesn't make much sense. I'm not even complaining about it being an obvious mobile port (It lacks a lot of things that should come standard on pc games. Like a button or toggle for fullscreen).\n\nThe game drops you in a match with only one vague picture as explanation. The level layout and enemies seem to be randomly generated in your disfavour. Enemies deal higher damage and have more movement. I beat the first level when it generated only 1 enemy instead of 3, taking all the health pickups for myself then resorting to a headbutting fest without any movement until one of us was down.\n\nI won a piece of equipment and some bananas but cant seem to be able to actually equip it yet. Maybe the slot is unlocked later, that wasn't clear.\n\nPerhaps I've been playing it wrong. I hope the game has more to offer. I'll come back to it sometime after it receives some updates. Can't recommend it at the moment, if ever. I went into it expecting a simple and casual tactical game with a heavy focus on positioning but it's not even that.\nNice idea but lacks in execution. I look forward to updates.","March 26","false","0.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

(Pointing to conspicuously large hole in his pants)\n\nYeah, that's pretty much how you're going to be feeling if you pay more than $0.25 for this piece of do doo.\n\nI started up the game, and went into the SETTINGS panel, oops, there are no settings to adjust just sound and music.  So I guess you'll be playing this in a microscopic window on your desktop.\n\nThen from the main menu, I made the mistake of clicking the button labeled "Multiplayer".  This caused the game to present me with a JPEG picture of a beach, and that's where it sat doing nothing, not even a pixel on the screen changing for 2 minutes until I CTRL+ALT+DELETE and killed it in the Windows Task Manager.\n\nUpon reloading I tried the single player campaign, and was greeted with a game interface which communicated virtually no objectives and did not explain how to interact with or play the game.  I tried clicking around to see if I could figure out what the inputs do, but each left or right click produced different results with no consistency.\n\nEventually I figured out how to control the Rhino.  That's when I realized that the levels in the game are not crafted to ensure a certain progression of difficulty going from "learning the ropes" and getting harder from there.  No, the game just throws randomly generated maps at you with a random number of enemies.  Good luck on your first map when 5 enemies who have the same attack power as you, all converge on you at once.\n\nI give this game 1 TRILLION head butts with a sharpened Rhinoceros horn Krazy Glued to my forehead.","March 31","false","0.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","5","13","3","0"
