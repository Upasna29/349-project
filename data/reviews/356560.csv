If this review peaks your interest, I would recommend buying the whole bundle as it is cheaper than buying each one individually. ~As a side note there are shounen ai endings for those interested. Only in ET Kurenai though...~\n\nI was surprised at how much I ended up liking game. I think a lot of that has to do as a Otome game addict I was getting a little burnt out on the mobile games. (When I say burnt out, I think I have played the main story line of more than 80 characters on mobile otome games.)East Tower Kurenai is the final installment the series. The order which the game is recommended is Akio, Takashi, Kuon then Kurenai. I would say don't play ET Kurenai first but it wouldn't be too bad if you at least play one of the other characters first to get an introduction to the story first. I would recommend this game even to just VN fans (not necessarily otome fans) because it explores interesting themes and has a great overarching plot.\n\nThe story is what got me hooked on this game, I love a different story than your more standard otome game as I feel that there is a good underlying story that nicely ties up at the end. I especially like how this game explores gender related sexuality in a very interesting way and ET Kurenai has the strongest of this theme out of all of the East Tower games. Gender fluidity is something much different to be explored in a VN/Otome game, especially for a Japanese market. Also I really liked how the whole past and ground work for the East Tower is finally revealed.\n\nThe voice acting is very nice for an indie game. I liked some of the unique voices in the game (Daiki specifically). I wouldn't say that there is any blaring miscasts in the voice acting. Of course this being an indie game, there aren't the big shot seiyuus (voice actors) to really make the voice acting really shine.\n\nThe art has for ET Kurenai has improved over the series of games. I was not big on the art style that ET has, but I grew attached to the characters anyway. I would say the thing that bothers me the most is the roundness of the faces, especially the young versions of the characters. I think of all the VN/Otome games ET has to take the cake on roundness of faces. Of course everyone has the same standing poses but I'm more referring to the CGs.  Even though there are a lot of slight variation changes for CGs to bring the count up over a hundred, there still is a lot of CGs for an indie game. In fact it has a lot more than a standard mobile otome game. The new backgrounds in ET Kurenai has improved as well from the starting BGs of the ET series (there aren't a whole bunch more). Also I like Kurenai's character design the best out of the guys in ET. Also I like the character designs for the new characters that enter only in Kurenai's story.","August 14, 2015","true","10.9"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

The story is so strange and unique, really play the other 3 parts before (Aiko, Takashi, Kuon) and play this all ways, all end (i think it be 8). Sometimes i wish me a bit more connection in the past between all characters (like Takashis part) but i am very fine with this game.\n\nI make it short this time. If you like Visual Novel and unique stories you be right here, if you dont like VN you are wrong here. I enjoy the hours and give the game 90 % for fans but only in reaction with the 3 parts before. So buy the Complete Edition and try to get a discount of 50 % or higher. Dont forget how many months (time) this 4 games eat even if you play them fast trough. I hope someone enjoy this game like me and i can bring together what should be together. Real gamers and a good story game from a very friendly developer. Thank you for reading. I hope i can/ could help someone to a buy that no one regrets.","January 5","true","6.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/356560/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Given the fact that East Tower: Akio, East Tower: Takashi, East Tower: Kuon and East Tower: Kurenai share the same universe, even if East Tower: Kurenai is way more complex than the mentionned title, a majority of this review will be identical to what I've written for the them.\n\nSakuya is a woman wishing to be a man since an incident in her childhood. She makes everything in her power to look like one. Her cousin Daiki works for Dreamworld and needs her help to try a new virtual attraction called West Tower, reserved for women. However, Sakuya managed to convince him to let her try the East Tower, reserved for men. She ends with four other testers, trapped in the virtual world, though she's happy to see that she's a man in it...\n\nThis is the same beginning in each Each Tower game. Once in the virtual world, Sakuya will team up with one of the guys. In the first of the series, she's Akio's partner, whose virtual form is a child, in the second, she's Takashi's, a boy admiring so much his sister that he took her appearance, in the third, she's Kuon's partner, who prefers to be a cool adult than a shy teen. East Tower is an attraction that will confront everyone to their own insecurities and fears.\n\nI will go straight the point: this is a visual novel, where you have choices to make. Each stage must be cleared to advance in the story, you don't have any skills or relationships to improve/destroy. However, choices are mattering: you can get a bad ending immediately where you have to begin the stage again (not the entire story), a best friend ending (by scoring A on each stage) and a romance ending (by clearing each stage with a S). If you follow the romance route, you'll end up with an extra chapter. However, some stages don't have a A rank, only a S one - in that case, for the best friend route, it's considered as if it was a A.\n\nChoices are generally made during the challenges proposed for the team. It's much rare to see them outside of them, before or after them. True, without skills or anything to worry, the game is easier than any other visuel novel I've already played (apart Shan Gui, which is more an interactive book), even the first Heileen was more complex and even Blue Rose was more complicated. I don't mind at all this lack of difficulty. However, in Kurenai, there are many endings and achievements, that strategic saves are required if you don't want to do a complete playthrough again. Indeed, for the romance route at least, you have 6 endings depending on your choices (aggressive and passive answers, choice of final gender and choice of Kurenai's fate): a harem aggressive/passive one, a male aggressive/passive one and a female aggressive/passive one. And depending on the animal you chose as best friend for the fox, you will pair Sakuya with Akio, Takashi or Kuon. Because, yeah, you'll be playing Sakuya and another character, if I may put that like that without revealing the whole truth about East Tower, the why it's existing and what's really happening. In that aspect, the game is more fitting into the visual novel world, where you have to do many playthroughs to achieve all endings (and unlock achievements on Steam).\n\nI find very interesting the fact that the guy will be your best friend at the end, as the bad ending isn't a "you're alone", "you're killed", etc.. However, should you choose to pursue him, it means that your character is also evolving and accepting herself more.\n\nLet's speak about Kurenai. He's mysterious and arrogant and ends up forced to partner with Sakuya (in the first three novels, he's always alone). His interrogations hint that he's not a participant or the hacker in question but another entity. Besides, some stuff happening in reality tend to show that he's not controlling himself. I didn't really like him because of his arrogant nature and even in the end, I couldn't warm up to him.\n\nAlso, the other character that appeared at the end of the last stage isn't really someone I managed to like too. Maybe because of the look or because I was so used to Sakuya's personality that it's not really matching what I've known.\n\nIndeed, the visual novel has voice acting... in Japanese. I don't understand a thing but as the subtitles are in English, I could follow the story. The only character not voiced is you. However, I find it really good. It's always fun to hear something in a foreign language, it's reminding me some good memories with some anime.\n\nAs for the style, it's really in a manga style, reminding me of The Rose of Versailles or anything directed to girls - because it's clearly stated in the official website that it's a visual novel for them (but everyone is welcome to play it). I loved it. I also loved the HUD, kinda hi-tech and with a good shade of green.\n\nThe music is very good too, very adapted to each scene. I really liked it. If there is anything I really liked in the whole series and in Kurenai, it's that OST.\n\nEast Tower: Kurenai is longer than the others and while it's still fun to play it, I must say that for me, it has lost of the charm that I've found with Akio and Takashi. The story became too complex and I understand the warning to play it in order (Akio, Takashi, Kuon and then Kurenai). When I see the price, I understand it as there is more content, however, some visual novels propose the same ammount of it and are cheaper. It's the conclusion of the story anyway. Besides, I do think that East Tower: Kurenai is still a good visual novel, so, yeah, this is a thumb up from me.","April 14","true","3.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

There you relive your past and university years. Including the ability to change your gender several times. As if it was not enough they also introduced passive / aggressive answers and lateron some nasty minigames which you luckily must beat just once. Looks like resist your emotion levelbar overtime with buttonclicks during you get scared by ghosts and stuff. After you finally managed to playthrough 4! times (1 Rank A and 3 Rank S) you must realize that there are still hidden CGs left where you didn't expect them. The only thing I remember: Once there was a fox talking to me.","January 5","false","4.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/356560/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","East Tower-Kurenai is the final installment of the East Tower series.  It's definitely worth saving this one for last so it's best to follow the recommended order of playing the East Tower series (Akio, Takashi, Kuon, Kurenai).  Kurenai has more content than the previous installments and is very spoiler heavy.\n\nIn terms of story, East Tower-Kurenai answers the questions that may have been left unaswered in the previous installments.  I won't go into details as to what happens in Kurenai although I can say that the participants (Akio, Takashi, Kuon) from the previous installments do have some sort of connection to East Tower, either in regards to its current state or to the people responsible for the creation of East Tower in the first place.  There are more paths in Kurenai so there's more replayability to be had.  Although the female MC seems to be the same as in the previous games, we find out that she is different in Kurenai (but again, that would be a huge spoiler to say anything more).\n\nThe art is good, just like in the previous games, as well as the music.  Kurenai had moments of comedy in it so it wasn't all seriousness and heavy drama throughout.  In regards to the writing, again, there were a few grammatical errors although they didn't appear to be as obvious this time.  I think that a better job was done on this aspect, as compared to the previous games.\n\nKurenai has a lot of achievements this time as well as way more CGs in the gallery to unlock so it definitely takes time to unlock everything.  Personally, I like it when I can take my time playing a game to get everything so that I can enjoy it that much more.  If you are a fan of VNs and liked the previous East Tower games, then I think Kurenai is worth buying.  If there are questions you had after playing the previous games, Kurenai will answer them.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Kurenai and the East Tower series and found it worthwhile to play through.","January 12","true","34.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majecian/recommended/356560/","majecian","Maje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majecian/","125 products in account","Finally played through the last one and now i can review them all together!\nI grew to absolutely love East Tower series. When i started out with Akio, i was pretty "okay sure" about it, not really negative, not really positive. It had its nice moments, it had its annoying moments, but mostly it felt casual. A game to play and never think about it again, i suppose.\nThen i played second game. And third. And fourth. And i changed my mind.\nEast Tower Takashi is much better than Akio, and i enjoyed it way more. It felt more natural and balanced drama-humour better than Akio, and i grew to love Takashi as a character. But still, the first two, they're only the beginning.\nI fell in love with East Tower during Kuon's story. In my opinion, it's much better written than the first two, and balances out everything surprisingly well, even though plot gets more complicated than in previous games. It completely sucked me in and made me enjoy every second i spent playing.\nAnd then, finally, Kurenai. Now that one is good. I shouldn't be surprised, since there are signs like, you know, order of routes or increasing price, and yet. I still can't believe how Kurenai managed to meet all my expectations and then exceed them.\nKurenai tells you everything you wanted to know and more. It uncovers the whole story, and doesn't leave anybody out. The amount of choices combinations is just stunning, and it took me about half of my play time to hunt everything down. Which is both a good and bad thing (i can now recite some choices order from memory after clicking them repeatedly a couple of times), depending if you like that kind of thing or not. The whole story is actually really interesting and even though some things are predictable i still found myself thinking "but... maybe it's actually not true?". East Tower manages to make you wonder and teases you all the time. I, for one, couldn't resists and beat both Kuon and Kurenai in one sitting.\nThe best thing in all of the routes is heroine. She isn't your typical shoujo/otoge heroine, oh no, she is a character in her own right and it's impossible to overlook her. I think i loved her the most in Kuon's route - her comments and thoughts were just so relatable! She's absolutely irreplacable and that is a thing many games with female protagonists fail to deliver well.\nThe other characters are just as good. I guess with Akio and Takashi you just don't spend as much time as you do with Kuon or Kurenai, so naturally they don't feel as developed and complex, but they have their good moments. Kuon is really interesting, and i personally like that sort of character with that sort of plot (avoiding spoilers is so hard!). Same goes for Kurenai, who managed to capture my heart almost instantly. Even the side characters are great and i liked them all.\nI know some people make fun of/dislike East Tower's graphics, but i genuinely like them. Although sometimes they look weird/anatomy is wrong, i absolutely love colouring, textures, and how diverse positions/expressions are. I think only in Akio i was frowning at art, but East Tower captures you with its plot and completely overshadows its graphics. It should also be noted that there's a lot of cgs, the winner being Kurenai (117 cgs, although a lot of them are different versions depicting one scene; still, that's impressive!).\nThe music is also really good, some of the tracks are still stuck in my mind. Music also completes the picture; when i turned it off for a while i felt like something was lacking and playing was less enjoyable.\nAll the voice actors are good, and i'm so glad we can enjoy japanese voice acting in these games! It feels so right.\nSo, to sum up my review: East Tower series is really good. I enjoyed every second while playing it and felt it was so worth my money. I recommend it to anyone, whether they like visual novels or not, because East Tower is a good, solid story, that definitely deserves more praise.\n","May 18","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The twist in this one is better than the one for Kuon. Kurenai is also the most interesting guy of the series as well, although by the end of it, I wanted to know how it would've ended up with the other guy that you interact with later. I do indeed like the person you can become at the end and I also like the fact that it changes depending on your choices throughout the game. Really, the variety of endings you can get compared to the other three games is great. Which isn't much of a comparison since the other three games really only had two endings. But the ending number here is numerous.\n\nThe eighteen dollar price tag for this one is a tad sketchy since the game isn't complete by itself. If it had included the other games of this series, then yes, it isn't a bad price. Do I recommend this? Yes! But try and get it as part of some deal or you would have a hard time feeling like it was worth it.","March 14","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly the eyes looked weird and creepy BUT it's a positive surprise in how story makes up for it compared to higher priced VN with excellent style which sadly only bore me to hell.
