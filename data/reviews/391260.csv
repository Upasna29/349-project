Essentially, if you love retro JRPGs, you'll enjoy this. Game play is standard turn-based, abilities are gained by exploration, there are TONS of items to pimp out your characters, and the ending is pretty solid. As far as negatives go, the writing is average, I'd say (the love story could have been fleshed out to great effect), and some of the puzzles seemed a tad glitchy. The labyrinths teeter on the line of challenging and rage-quit inducing, individual players may vary on how they feel about it. You don't get other playable characters until later in the game, though your main character is pretty beastly on his own.\n\nOn the whole, I really enjoyed this game; it reminded me in the best ways of the early Final Fantasy games, and I can't wait to play the sequel!","October 13, 2015","true","32.7"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","58","66","0","0"

Really nice, simple graphic design helps (I understand that this is a RPG Maker game) and a fantasy storyline that for reasons that I can't explain has just got me hooked. 360 controls work really well and save games are frequent so you never have to replay huge chunks of game when you die. The English is a little shaky here and there which is rather charming. Price is very generous so there is really no reason not to buy if you are a fan of the genre or want some fantasy story-based gaming.","August 16, 2015","true","23.6"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","43","56","2","0"

After quite an extensive run and being stuck at the moment ( and refusing any outside help). I thought it might eb a good idea to write a review of this game as a sort of catharsis after hat I went through.\n\nFirst thing first, if I had to describe Labyronia, I'll say that the game lives up to its namesake, because this is a god damn MAZE !!! No really, I've never felt that lost in a game, you'll spend hour trying to figure out the exit of an area with no reliable way to keep track on where you're going. You'll bash your head in frustration on your keyboard and pray David Bowie to get you out of here, but the only thing you'll get will be an ankward glare from your roommate. To make the matter worse, this game really likes backtracking ... and it'll make sure that you must return multiple time in the same location to get in a SPECIFIC area (odds are that you'll find it randomly most of the time).\n\nDevs say they took inspiration from pokemon for their game. That statement is quite true, type advantage is key for winning battles in this game. They even brought you memorable feature from Pokemon such as "the run in a cave without Flash with Zubats everywhere". Unfortunately, no escape rope or dig, which I think would have been great features in this game considering the lenght of certain dungeons without a shortcut to the exit when done ( from what I've seen you get a blimp later on in the game, but you'll have to get through 8 hours of walking to get that reward, and I hope you can actualy use it to fast travel the world map).\nAn other thing regarding the battle system and which pained me is that it seems that some fights are neraly impossible without a specific item or spell. And I'm not talking about quest item or plot spell ! No I'm taling about easely missable features that will bite you in the ♥♥♥ later if you don't have them for the battle. A sound exemple will be for the Chimera, if you go unprepared, you'll find that this fight is impossible no matter how much you try because of one ability that prevent your character from doing anything during the fight (you're bloody petrify). Of course there is only one way to go around that ability, but it's NOT in the dungeon ! No it's some special boots that make you immune to stunt and petrify ailments and are sold by only one merchant that happened to be on the other side from where you standing, and that you came by 2 hours ago !!! Needless to say, the reason if I'm currently stuck in the game is because I just happened to bump into another creature like that; and I can't defeat it because somehow I missed again the missable item that I need to beat it ( and it's not even a boss !! ) .\n\nOther than that, I'll say battle are pretty challenging and rewarding when you do have the key elements needed, ennemies actions are not randomize but follow a pattern of actions that they repeat over and over in the same order, alloing you to play around these actions to take minimal damages from punishing blow while destroying your opponent when his guard is open.\n\nNow regarding the story, so far there is not much exposition, which is a good thing ! The story is your to discover through books and dialogues which are quite extensive and well written ( despite some being forced and cringe worthy, trust me you'll understand me when you get to the desert level). Unfortunately I've failed so far to find the main character interesting ( granted I don't find him annoying and it's kind of reflreshing to have a mature man for a lead character), I feel like the dev were focusing to much on his backstory ( which is great)  to give him actual character traits, so far none that he'd displayed stroke me as memorable and some were kind of contradicting themselve ...\nI don't have much to say about the supportive cast considering I've not seen much of them for now, just that I recruited my first party member after 7 hours of gameplay which is kinda long, and it seems like you have to a GLORIOUS amount of backtracking in past areas if you want to unlock new power for them (and again there is no way to tell if any of them is going to prove MANDATORY in the future).\n\nNow despite, all the backlashes, I still don't hate this game, it's like dark souls playing with your nerves and pushing you to the limit of self-destruction. It's quite remarkable that I'm still able to enjoy a game that frustrating. To be honest, the game is quite well made for an RPG Maker game. Sure it doesn't go overboard and use it's own sprite our illustration (hell even that thumbnail for the game lokks like vergil from Dmc ) but it's still quite charming with the world their proposing.\n\nTo top it off, the game is not expensive at all, you'll have a run for your money so no reason for not buying it.","August 17, 2015","true","14.5"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","32","39","3","0"

The problem here is that the assets used are basically all the assets you see in every other RPG-Maker game. Plain, boring, overused and uninspired.\nStory: its thin as paper, unoriginal and boring. The stuff that was already boring 15 years ago. 4 Elements 4 Cristals Gods destroy earth blablabla *falls asleep*\nMusic: the music is propably the best part about this game, classic tones you expect from a RPG of this kind but still nice\nGameplay: classic retro JRPG is what you get, nothing not to like. Yet still its just the standart fighting system from the RPG-Maker, which you can find in thousands of other RPG-Maker Games.\n\nThis is what leads me to my conclusion, if you dont like classic JRPG's then dont buy this game, if you DO like classic JRPG'S still dont buy this game (not even for 29 cents) since there are RPG-Maker games out there that are tremendously better than this pile of below-mediocracy and are available FOR FREE.\nI would love to see the RPG-Maker-Community getting more attention, but not through meh games like this.\n(If you want to try a commercial one i advise you to look at To the Moon on Steam or just google one of the various Rpg-Maker-Sites for free ones)","October 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 63 of 96 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","63","96","7","4"

But you can expect some very imaginative storylines which can drive them to be good, regardless of the graphics or the program it was built upon. While this has a good storyline and some nice music, I don't really care for the battle system. Now mind you, I have nothing against RPGmaker games, I just tend to shy away from most of them. I guess it's a personal preference thing, but I've never really got into games like Final Fantasy and the Dragon Quest series, which is what this game is inspired by.\n\nSo basically, the 4 Gods of Labyronia created labyrinths with a magical pendant that caused a bunch of monsters to appear. Arres, who is a very talented mage, sets out to see why this was done and if he can put a stop to it. Along the way to save the "world" you will encounter all sorts of enemies that will try to stop you.( I got wrecked on the second fight cause I suck at this lol). When you die you will be returned to the main title screen where you'll have to start a new game or load from a previously saved game. In order to improve your skills and whatnot, you will have to find certain objects around the world (cues). This can be anything that looks out of the ordinary, a "weird looking stone for example" (Ibiz).\n\nWhy do I still recommend this game? Because I like the story, and I'm sure others will too. Besides, I really can't fault the game for it not being my style, nor can I fault it for not liking the battle system.","August 14, 2015","true","7.1"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","34","46","4","3"

This game was fantastic!!! The game introduces a "Cue" sytem which when examining objects will give you new spells and skills. The story had me pleasantly suprised. Not super on edge or anything but I still thought it was pretty good. Another thing I really enjoyed about this game was the soundtrack. Not sure how they did it but I thought it was really well done. If I had to make a complaint about the game it would be that A lot of the "cues" you find early on you can't use because you don't have the corresponding party member.

The combat, world, and addiction to levelling your character are all very solid. Reminding me of Mystic Quest(one of the old FF games, renamed for some reason... I think). So far I've yet to pick up any companions but there is space for two by the look of it, will be nice when I finally get one. Much of the combat and movement around the world feels refreshing fast compared to the old games of this type, falling somewhere in between those and Half minute Hero. Far less random encounters hindering your progress and far less long battles for little XP reward, all plus points in my view.\n\nThe controls are a little bit counter intuitive when played with an Xbox 360 pad, walking done via the left thumb stick and the menu's etc done via the D-Pad. You get used to this quickly and in some ways it actually adds to the retro feel but I would like the option of doing it all on one.\n\nThe enemies lack animation, though all magics and attacks have nice effects representing them, the werewolf warp effect being one to avoid if you have a problem with strobes. For £2 or less this is to be expected, asset creation is extremely time intensive and every frame of animation pretty much doubles the load, hopefully enough people will buy this to give them both the incentive and the capital to address this in future releases.\n\nAll in all Labyronia is well worth the asking price for anyone wanting a solid slice of retro style JRPG action!","August 17, 2015","true","25.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","2"

Nothing outstanding, but also nothing too annoying.\n\nPlayability: + The game has some traps laid out, but those actually make the game work perfect in all other areas. The traps are, spots were a low level character can get killed too easily... so take care, and play through the game. I encountered no bugs... some minor typos and a game that ran smoothly and without even once crashing - and I tried hard to get it crashing... No chance at this. You can't save everywhere in the game which actually isn't bad at all. And encounters are often visible on the maps (only not on the world map).\n\nGenre Values:\n\nStory: ++ You play Arres a Battlemage with no history at all, and as shrouded as your history is your future and your abilities. You start off trying to know more about your surroundings, and you learn about the monsters invading all the lands - and about the labyrinths which were created by the four elemental gods. The story is well executed, not too nosy and you choose the pace in which you will do your duties.\n\nLeveling: + You don't gain powers automatically by rising up a level or by just grinding enough monsters to gather EP's you have to search and look for your powers and it is easy to lose track of powers or even imagine what powers there are in the game for you. This is good, since some spells open up new tactics and new possibilities to get your foes more readily vanquished.\n\nImmersion: + Though the game has simple graphics, you can lose yourself in the game. I started to play it and suddenly five hours were gone - most of this effect is derived from the nice story of the game. You just want to know what is your next step, where to go next - why are the people of one city so damn aloof, while in another town you are taken in with a lot of respect. The story uncovers over time your own story, and this makes the game a nice experience. Even grinding is by far not as enervating as you might expect.\n\nOverall Rating: 5 + Alone on this I can say that I was positively surprised by the game, first it's under one buck to buy the game. Depending on how forced you play it, you might solve the game in between 10 to 20 hours, a lot of tripple A games with a lot of fancy graphics but a bad storyline offer less to a much higher price, or spread their contents over several editions of the game. The game isn't the invention of the tyre, but it is decent, nice to play and offering some neat entertainment.\n\nValue for Money: High at 0,99 The game offers at least 10 hours of game time, a good story and stable gameplay, all this for a really low price.\n\nRecommended, especially for JRPG Fans and RPG Fans in general.\nAs I said, the gamedeveloper didn't invent the tyre new, but he tried to deliver a game that runs without killing your time in waste. The only thing that troubled me was the story between Arres and Ann... Huh? You wan't to know? Buy the game... NOW... You'll see it's fun, especially to read the awkward situation between the Hero and his Heroine... maybe a bit cheesy... but still fun. ***Remark: No cheese was harmed during writing this Review***","May 11","true","39.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","3"

Most of the flaws I hit in my short attempt to play were all minor things... but there's just so many small things that they added up.\n\n-Remapping the controls is confusing. There's no actual "Options" menu on the main screen (which is baffling to me), so you need to know to hit F1 to remap. And once you do get into it, you find that the keyboard has multiple keys mapped to the same letter, all which seem to be based off the old Sega Genesis Turbo controllers.\n\n-Using a controller (at least a X-box one) is awkward. You use the control stick to move, but you can't use it to select options in menus, so you have to constantly swap between D-pad and the stick. Button options also felt odd, and took a couple remapping attempts to feel comfortable for me.\n\n-The game starts with a scroll of text that's basically: Monsters wrecked the world. Humanity wussed out. Mages fought and lost. And then you find yourself playing as some guy who wakes up and decides he's going to solve the problem 50-years after it started. But you have no idea who he is, other than he "knows magic". And by "knows magic" I mean he has a heal and that's it. But they give the impression shortly in that you're supposed to be some super well known battle-mage.\n\n-Monsters go from being your difficulty level (40ish dmg a hit) to well outside your ability (300+ dmg a hit) with no real signal. You'll walk half a screen away from a easy battle to find yourself getting bashed in the face and hoping to get away.\n\n-Edit-\nGave it a bit more time (3 hours) hoping something would change. All it's done is let me find more flaws and lessen my opinion even more.\n\n-Area maps are, for lack of a better word, round. What I mean by this is you walk into a forest and there is a sign there to tell you it's the entrance. Great! You then decide to go left... and left some more. You end up back at the entrance. Same with if you head up, down, right, doesnt matter. If you head in 1 direction, you wrap around and end up back where you started. And given that theres no map key, you find exploring becomes more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ than the adventure it should be. It's also completely illogical.\n\n-Mob/debuff balance doesnt exist. There are debuff combos that will lock you out of the ability to act and, if RNG is against you, you can go from 100% to dead without being able to attack. And not even against overly strong monsters either. It happened to me against mobs that I had killed in 2 swings in the encounter right before.\n\n-The "key items" have no story presence. The goal of the game as far as I can tell at this point, seems to be based around collecting 4 elemental cores. So you would think these cores are hugely important to the world, right? Wrong. The first core has a Guard blocking you way that wont move until you do a quest for the town's leader. You finish the quest and get a letter giving you permission to go anywhere in the city. You use it to pry the god damn gem from the monument in the center of town and walk away without anyone caring (except 1 random NPC who seems VERY nervous about what he saw). And it isnt even like a "Hey you helped our leader, take this very important gem as our thank you!". You do the quest for the leader and they tell you to get the hell away from them and not come back.\n\n-3 hours into the game... still no party members. Not even temporary ones.\n\n-3 hours into the game... still no backstory on the hero. No plot points, no foreshadowing, nothing.\n\n-3 hours into the game... still no STORYLINE. At all. There's no explaination (aside from a 2 second "Guess I'll save the world since no one else can" at the VERY start) on why you're doing what you're doing, or why no one else is fighting. No explaination on why if the world is filled with this powerful destruction causing monsters that theres little villages everywhere without walls or soldiers or graveyards.\n\nAfter spending 3 hours I've gone from thinking this game was at best a 2/10 to not even being worth the $2 I spent on it during a sale. I've gone from hoping the company continues making games (because I really like the genre) but focus more on story, to hoping they never attempt another RPG again.\n\nIn short, not only can I not recommend the game, I strongly advise people to stay away from it even if they offer if for 90% off. Hell I wouldn't even suggest people get it if it becomes free, because it's not worth the memory even if you have 4TB of free space left.","August 16, 2015","false","4.2"," 60 of 94 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","60","94","2","2"

The main complaints that I have so far are that quite a few of the puzzles are inscrutible, and it's never very clear exactly where you're supposed to be going or what you're supposed to be doing at any given time. All you can find out is where you SHOULDN'T be, which is usually discovered by getting killed by a monster in 2 hits. Quite a few of the midgame maps are HUGE, and you can easily get completely lost.\n\nThe story is also likely to be a bit hit or miss with some people. Most of it is uncovering the background, both for the world, and your character, and the plot bits tend to be pretty far apart.. And the majority of text was clearly written by someone who is not a native English speaker. It sort of bounces between extremely simple English, simple English with words used wrong, and bizarrely stilted, awkward writing. Things like "Do not forget these words when the urge to start moving is awakened in you." and "North from here, a land of water reigns.

For me this is a hard game to review as i must confess classical JRPG games with all their clichés dont have a chance in my eyes with their worn out mechanics and this game comes close to this category. So is it different enough? Yes, so it seems after some hours of gameplay.\n\nThe most defining feature of the game is the Map of the world that is literaly a labyrinth. Lots of back tracking and figuring out routes.  Combat is hard and there is lots of it once you start to explore the world map and lots of grinding for experience. Game has a tendency to show you that you just took a wrong turn by sending unbeatable monsters in your way.  Many monsters will hit you with status attacks and kill you. It also goes the other way around and this makes combat one of the better designed feature in the game. Abilities are learned with 'cues' that are scattered around the map. Books can be found during the travels that explain the story. Pretty straightforward actually.\n\nI am really on the fence with this game. It is a new kind of blast from the past with a hardcore heart built on a old game engine.\n\nBuyer beware. Look closely to what you are about to buy before getting this. There is nothing casual about this title so prepare for a tough adventure where no one holds your hand and tells what to do.\n","August 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

As the main protagonist, your main objective is to retrieve the pendant of Labyronia in order to save and reunite the realm of Labyronia. The game gives a very nostalgic vibe to avid RPG gamers especially to those who have played the classic Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series. The game features the traditional turn-based battle system and also the classic on-field puzzles that you need to finish in order to progress the main story. The game also features a mix of different monster encounter designs throughout the game. You encounter actual monsters roaming on the dungeon maps while you also encounter random monster battles on the world map.\n\nLabyronia RPG is a decent and good RPG game but the only problem I see is the merciless AI of the monsters. There will be times that you'll encounter and battle a set of monsters that will take you down with a series of attacks without giving you a chance to at least make a move. I don't know if the developers did it on purpose but there will be times that it can be a bit frustrating to players especially in cases when you're trying to strengthen your character and you accidentally bump into that annoying set of monsters.\n\nStill, I recommend this game to big fans of classic Adventure RPG games. The game would even be worth more if you can get it during a sale although it's already cheap.\n\nPersonal Rating:Gameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nStory/Plot: 7/10\nMusic: 8/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","August 28, 2015","true","4.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/391260/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nLabyronia RPG was developed by Labyrinthine and released in 2015. As it's name suggests: Labyronia is an RPG. being an RPG there are many common themes that you experience in this genre of games: Emphasis on story, monster grinding, and gear juggling.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You play as Arres, a particularly gifted Mage and student of Ibiz, you start your quest in an isolated shanty, and very little explanation on what to do. Like many classic RPG's you don't start out knowing what your goal is, you need to systematically talk to everyone and eventually come across the objective.\nSure, the “About this game” text give some incite into what the objective is, but when you actually start playing you need to stumble and explore your way to each area. The only way I figured out where to go next, is if one place 1-shots me, then I guess that's not the next area to go. (rocket science... i know)\nAn update... of sorts...\nAbout 10 hours into the game suddenly interesting things started to happen and I started to become invested in the story, consider this an "updated" section of the guide; I became quite interested in Arres, and the enemies he encountered. It turns out there is more to the story then I had realized!\n\nGameplay: Labyronia RPG boasts on 6 key features:\n1) “non-linear progression”\nWell in a literal sense there is some sense of exploration, but as I said earlier, it was pretty clear to me when I was in the wrong area: I would be defeated in 1 hit.\n\n2) “Cue system to encourage exploration”\nNot really, if you play RPG's you speak to everyone anyway, and anytime you see some strange structure you're going to check it out in case it progresses the story. I would disagree with this point, the Cue system could be replaced with any reward.\n\n3) “Strategic Boss battles, and smooth combat system”\nI would disagree with this feature, while the combat is very minimalist, there are some key points that you need to learn about within the game, specifically: different armor increases different stats, sometimes you need to equip a higher magic defense item, over a better general-defense-item.\n(Call me an idiot, but in almost every other game ever made, the more green numbers the better the armor is... not the armor that spikes one stat.)\n\n4) “Random Battles are only on the world map”\nThank god, more RPG's need to do this. The down side is that you need to leave and reenter area's to grind, but I'm not complaining! I'd rather have the chance to sneak by an encounter.\n\n5) “Clean, colorful visuals”\nWell that's a fair description... but I'm not the kind of person who cares about graphics, I could play a game which only has text... if it was well written I could enjoy it too.\n\n6) “Experience the emotional storyline and challenge the four elemental gods”\nWell, I haven't felt emotionally moved by these characters because you don't really learn more about Arres, he's almost a silent protagonist... he does occasionally speak when progressing in the story, but at least half way through the game I don't really have a sentimental connection to this world, or the story.\nupdate after 10 hours:\nIt gets better! but you gotta keep going for it to get interesting...\n\nAchievements: Labyronia RPG has six achievements, the easiest to earn are the first three. The first achievement (Welcome to the world!) you earn just by starting the game. The second (Unknown Explorer) is earned if you stumble into the forest early... which you probably will, you'll do it sooner or later. The third achievement you'll earn by wandering around and speaking to everyone in the game, you'll eventually come across a random bar and see a poor fellow in the corner by himself. The last three achievements are unlocked much later in the game.\n\nPrice: Labyronia RPG is priced at $2.99, while I won't say 'this game is the most fun RPG I've ever played', it passes my price-value-system, for every dollar spent I want to spend at least an hour playing the game.\n\nConclusion: To recap: The story was so-so, not very memorable. The gameplay is on par for most RPG's, but not very engaging. The achievements aren't over done, but do require beating the game. The Price is very fair for the game released.\nI can recommend this game to anyone who wants to play an RPG which is easier on your computer graphic's card and CPU, doesn't mind experience grinding, looking for some challenge and learning new-ish mechanics.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update November 15, 2015:\nFor some strange reason I could post "test", but not my whole review, so I just posted test and pasted my review in its place.","December 22, 2015","true","27.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I know that I don't have very many hours, but I still tell that there is a lot of game in store for me.\n\nVery cheap for what it is worth. This game is masterpiece and I think that the developers should bump up the price.  I got it for around $2 on sale, and it is at least $5 - $10.\n\nCons:\n\nSome parts are slow and take a lot of patience.

Upon first glance, it appears to be a basic RPG where you have the opportunity to explore areas, engage in battles, etc., and although this game does have those elements, there are other elements that make it unique from other such similar games.\n\nBasically, you start off with your one main party member (Arres) who doesn't appear to have much of a history.  All he knows is that he has a mission to complete although he doesn't know the reason (which, of course, is later revealed as you progress).  As you get to explore new areas, you'll find out that the way to learn new magic skills is unique.  In most RPGs, you learn new skills by simply leveling up.  However, in Labyronia, you learn new skills through cues.  Basically, these are items that you have to touch as you explore new areas and certain cues can only be used for certain party members.\n\nAs in most RPGs, you have the chance to earn money by defeating monsters and that money can be used to buy better weapons and equipment.  Also, there are two additional party members that can be recruited although that happens quite late in the game.  I did find that aspect to be a little annoying although considering the storyline, I can understand now why that had to happen.\n\nA very noticeable element of this game is the implementation of labyrinths (or very complicated mazes).  They make the game challenging and although I would consider myself to be pretty adept when it comes to playing RPGs, the labyrinths were quite confusing so I had difficulty at times figuring out which way to go.  However, as I have completed the game, I was able to figure them out eventually.\n\nThere is a lot to explore and figure out in Labyronia aside from simply following the main quest.  I took the time to explore the optional elements such as the fire labyrinth, which wasn't required to complete the game but doing so gave me additional useful items.  It's definitely worth it to take the time to explore as many areas as possible, to get the most out of this game.\n\nFor the price, Labyronia is definitely worth adding to your Steam library, especially if you're a fan of RPGs and you want a challenge.  Also, this game cannot be completed quickly so it's worth taking a look.  ^^","September 5, 2015","true","21.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The story is reminiscent of when we had to defeat elemental lords of water, fire, earth and air to beat the earlier Final Fantasy games, although it is a bit simpler than any of the classic RPGs.  That's okay, though, if you're just playing this game to kill some time.  It does a good job of that - expect to spend at least 20 hours in finishing this game.\n\nGame progression can also be pretty non-linear, meaning I had to figure out how I would like to proceed - and there were enough options to make the game more interesting than most of your cookie-cutter RPGs out there.  It was easy to miss something important and a lot of backtracking might have to be made.  If you're very thorough with exploring, it will pay off, though.  And if you miss something, you might come back much stronger, making backtracking that much easier to do.  I was especially satisfied with how I came back to one particular area - the Deep Grotto - and was able to handily beat a mob that I couldn't the first time I went through it.\n\nThe story itself is linear, though - your actions won't change how the game ultimately plays out.  The puzzles are somewhat challenging but not overly frustrating if you have a good memory and pay attention to what you're doing.  There are some key items you absolutely need to make any progress at all, however.  The pickaxe is especially important and you will always have occasion to look for a way to use it.  The labyrinths are only frustrating if you keep forgetting the way to go.  The enemies have vulnerabilities you have to learn how to exploit.  You also have to learn new abilities from finding "cues" which can be anything from a statue to an animal, as well, so keeping an eye out for anything unusual is important.  Learning what gear can be best for specific battles is also useful in many different situations.\n\nDialogue was pretty well done, although I had to chuckle at some of the text in the books that you read in the game - one called a historical decision "ret..arded" for example, not exactly what you'd expect in the lore of a fantasy game.  A blossoming romance in the game also felt unnecessarily forced.  Forming an actual party actually doesn't happen until much later in the game which I felt like was something that could have been done sooner.  That being said, the game is very fun to play for old school RPGers and I recommend it if you like that type of game.","August 20, 2015","true","26.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

An ambitious setting, solid combat, and unique mechanics kept me playing even when the puzzles had me flustered.\n\nYou can tell the creators spent a lot of time dreaming up the world of Labyronia, with a history of war, magic, gods, and monsters to discover as you play. Some details seem superfluous, while you may want to keep others in mind if you want to progress. Talk to every NPC, read every book, and examine everything that looks even slightly out of place. You'll find that rewards await the diligent investigator in the form of quest items, spells and abilities, and treasure.\n\nThe combat is simple enough, with most enemies sporting elemental weaknesses that you find by setting them on fire and such. There is a difficulty curve that can be quite steep if you don't take some time to grind a level here and there. The acquisition of the second and third party members is relatively close together fairly late in the game, which trivialized several battles but made up for it near the end of the game, when combining abilities is almost essential to prevail.\n\nCues are in-game locations and objects that serve as skill books, with each cue teaching a spell or ability to a certain party member. Keep each cue you find in mind, as you may not be able to use it the first time you run across it. Some are for abilities you might never use, but others are pretty much required to beat the game. With a wealth of items and several tiers of gear, you'll upgrade at a nice pace. Since the best gear is found in the world and money isn't really ever an issue past the beginning, it's easy enough to dilute the difficulty by buying stacks of health potions and revives and whittling away at stronger enemies while chugging healing drinks.\n\nThe puzzles ranged in difficulty from "that was a puzzle?" to "there is no way this is a puzzle, the game must be broken," and I had to look up the solution once or twice because I'm bad and I should feel bad. But you shouldn't feel bad if you have to. As you may have guessed from the name, there are several labyrinths involved in this game. Another, less obvious theme is that of fractals. These two concepts serve as the foundation for the design and aesthetic of the world, for better or worse. You'll wind your way through a labyrinth, spot that chest sitting just out of reach on another spur of land, and wonder where you had to turn three intersections back to get to it. Likewise, you'll wonder what lay in the center of this strange pattern of terrain and go back and forth to find an entrance and wriggle your way through, usually to a prize.\n\nA few of my gripes were that some areas were just too big, with a lot of empty space you have to run through, usually while you're backtracking from a dead end. All of the quest items are only used once to get past a specific obstacle, which was a bummer for me at first. After getting these shoes that let me walk on lily pads, you think I would be able to walk across all the lily pads, and not just the one floating in front of the door of a shrine I need to burglarize. Many puzzles could have easiliy incorporated elements that would put these items to use so that when you find one it doesn't just get used once and lay forgotten in the key items tab of your inventory. Even some of the usable items were literally useless, except to provide flavor. I thought that maybe this drakna cigar or whatever might have a use somewhere down the line, perhaps to trade with an NPC, but apparently it's just for when the hero gets to jonesing for a smoke. Sure, it probably restores some (of what replaces) mana, but I never noticed. It's the same sort of thing with several other items. At the end of the day, all you need are the potions that fullly restore health, the ones for mana, and the revive items once you get party members.\n\nLabyronia is a great game, especially considering the price. If you can get it on sale, even better. It's several hours of puzzling, fighting, and storytelling on par with a more expensive game, with just a few drawbacks to test your patience.","August 28, 2015","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The music is really catchy in some areas in the game and makes the experience pleasant throughout. The art direction in the battle scenes is excellent. The dialogue is well thought out and often entertaining - I liked that the world of Labyronia was very consistent and had a history behind it which reflected the locales you explored. There are also lots of things to read which added more context to the world without being superfluous - I just couldn't help myself by reading all of the books in the environment.\n\nThe battles are strategic and generally quite balanced throughout the game. I really only had to grind at the very start of the game to build up my character, afterwhich the battles scaled very smoothly and were still challenging. The game rewards thorough exploration, most of your magic skills are obtained by exploring areas and finding cues which are contained in distinguished objects and monsters. Much of the puzzles and game progression is driven by your ability to connect various clues in the environments and dialogues - I rarely found myself in a quandary about what to do next.\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8.5/10.\n\nAlso, I beat Bastion before I started this game, and I would easily choose Labyronia over Bastion anyday. Bastion was good, but not nearly as strategic and open as Labyronia.","October 17, 2015","true","13.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I reccomend fighting random monsters around Jenise until you're level 12 then go to the deep grotto past Ferdel Forest and farm were wolves, when you get the baloon go south of the desert to a dirt island, the monsters there give you 15k exp per kill.\n\n-The love story just happens - He meets the girl and is like all of a sudden "I wanna hold you in my arms, I love you" with no real conversation besides complimenting each others eyes.\n\nNow the Pros\n\n-Nostalgic Feel - it has the clasic rpg feel and it brings back memories from the days of playing Final Fantasy\n\n-Rewarding for your hard work - The harder you work to complete this game, the more cues, levels and gear you get, the better you feel afterwards when you can kill mobs that you couldn't before with ease.\n\n-Good Story - Even though the story takes a long time to develop, it is a good story.\n\n-Good Gameplay - Its got the classic rpg gameplay, the gameplay that made RPG games the games they are now.\n\nI reccomend this game to any of you RPG enthusiasts or RPGMAKER fans.","November 11, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I waited for a sale and bought them both. These are the best 24 cents I've ever spent for a game (48 for the 2 of them). I got "Legend of Mysteria RPG" in a bundle for maybe 10-15 cents. Now, just because they are cheap doesn't mean they are bad. Personally I had a great time playing them. I will focus on reviewing my experience in "Labyronia RPG".\nIt's an RPG game (obviously) so that's a plus (for me at least). You fight monsters and bosses, get gold, eat food to regenerate hp or use spells to do that, gain xp, buy a lot of things, explore the map, collect key items, level up, collect cues to learn new spells. I love all of that!\nI've followed two guides to complete the game. Yes, I died a lot of times and spent time wandering but my point is that it's not a short game.\nThe music is good (not irritating). At different areas it changes. I enjoyed one particular track and the rest were ok.\nThere are many characters, few of which are the main ones. Most of the game you will fight monsters with a single character. At about mid game one more character joins you and then another. The more, the merrier, right?\nIt turns out that "Legend of Mysteria RPG" is connected to "Labyronia RPG". I mean, in the latter I've been to a place that I'd already visited in the former. However there were still a lot of new areas to explore and that's always been fun. Speaking of which, the map is huge. There are a lot of places to visit and it takes time to do so (I am not complaining). When you are at end game it's a lot easier to travel.\nThe only drawback is that the game crashed twice. But I played it for 15 and a half hours so I can't complain. You have 16 save slots so save often.\nThere are achievements, all of which can be unlocked (I did that) and there are also trading cards (I don't care about them).\nSo for this price it's a must-buy. It's ridiculously cheap if you ask me. I've played tons of games which were more expensive and I didn't enjoy some of them as much as I enjoyed "Labyronia RPG". Can't wait to play the sequel. Great game for a great price. The "Add to Cart" button is waiting for you to click it.

Yes, I know that the art style mimics that of old SNES RPGs but that is no excuse for looking absolutely janky when in fullscreen. Following up the poor initial presentation was a story that was... cheesy? I find it difficult to accurately describe it. There are Gods who have a super power ancient artifact, non-gods are at war with them, non-gods lose and the world is fractured into X number of factions/regions, etc. It’s not quite “cookie-cutter” but very generic for these types of games.\n\nSpeaking of broad stereotyping of RPG maker games, the opening scene-as if following the cliche template bullet for bullet-begins with you waking up in your bedroom. At least others give some quasi-convincing exposition for why you of all the inhabitants of the world are going to begin a journey to defeat the prior specified evil. Labyronia opens with “Time to fight this evil, which I am qualified to do because I have magic and skills. Let me get my sword out of the chest.” I don’t think a game has ever motivated me less.\n\nSo what was my gameplay experience like? I wandered around the room and clicked on things (like you do) bringing me to the first straw: the default key binding for interacting with anything is O (B for 360 pads). Yes this is a almost pointless gripe, but I was curled up and comfy in bed with no desire to get up to the keyboard to remap it. I sucked it up and headed out side, using the button ubiquitously responsible for cancel/escape to talk to people. In the process I managed to open my inventory, a critical RPG feature which I have no idea how to access since the only button pressed thus far has been O/B. This led to the acquisition of straw number two. I got out of bed determined to figure out all the buttons once and for all via the F1 menu. This was the most horrendous mapping interface I have ever seen; gamepad buttons were mapped to random letters with no explanation as to what they actually did. I couldn’t be bothered to decrypt this menu so I returned to the game for the final straw. I COULD NOT leave the inventory screen. For those who are thinking “Oh, you just don’t have the button mapped to the controller correctly”, you’re right. Do you know where else it wasn’t mapped? ANYWHERE. I pushed every-and I do mean every- button on the keyboard and mouse and nothing did more than give me a rude buzzer.\n\nRPG Maker shovel-ware is a dime a dozen (often literally) and unless you offer something mindblowing out of the gate, any small flaw or defect can become a dealbreaker. I have a key for Labyronia RPG 2 which is next on my roster; here’s hoping they have polished it up considerably.","September 6, 2015","false","12.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

What this means is that when an enemy inevitably hits you with Sleep or Paralysis, it will probably end in a game over. This is one of the few games where those status effects seem to last a decent amount of time, and with no one else around to heal you there is nothing you can do.\n\nIt was a very cheap game but I certainly do not have the patience to brute force my way through because one area decided to have an enemy who could afflict the aforementioned status effects turn after turn.","January 4","false","3.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

It's not great. It's not bad. It's just decent.\n\nPlaying through this game, I noticed a few plot holes here and there. They weren't story-breaking, but they were apparent enough to bring me out of the experience of playing the game.\n\nThe story is alright, but sometimes it felt like it wasn't explained well enough. Or, at other times, it was explained too much. This left me confused every now and again. I figured I would keep playing and it would make sense later (which most of it did), but it still brought me out of the experience of playing the game.\n\nThe grammar of this game is a bit rough. I'm no English major (or a hardcore grammar policeman), but I even noticed some issues.\n\nI ended up using the walkthrough on the Community Hub to figure out most of this game. I felt like I was stumbling my way through the entire thing.\n\n\nDespite all these issues, I liked the game. The story is fun enough too.

Labrynth.\nThat one key word: Labrynth, already tells you what you're in for.\nThis is a labrynth styled game.\nIf you're not into games where you spent a lot of your time traversing the land and the areas going in circles, then this game is not for you. This game isn't for you either, if you're expecting to be guided. This is a very lightly guided game, you're in charge of where to go for the most part, but you'll find that there are areas for higher levels and areas for lower levels.\nOtherwise, if you're into that kind of stuff, then this game is for you.\nI enjoyed the grinding aspect, because I didn't know what level I had to be to really be prepared to kill ♥♥♥♥.. I ended up grinding up to level 15 within the first 4 hours of gameplay. A few of the areas are really frustrating..namely the snow area. Too much white. Outside of that, this wasn't half bad for the purchase. But I'd definitely recommend getting this game when it's on sale.\nThe dialogue in this game is meh, but it's decent enough.\nOverall for the price of 50 cents for this game and it's sequel.. I'd give it a 7/10.","January 12","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkMessiah/recommended/391260/","TheDarkMessiah","Virëssë Fëanturi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkMessiah/","205 products in account","FIRST, while the game is inspired by FF and CT, by no means is it the same as them. Labyronia brings to the table a unique fighting fantasy game which is both challenging and exciting.\n\nI made the mistake of thinkining that this was one of those games which you could finish in a single sitting.. THE JOKE WAS ON ME. You cannot finish this game in a single sitting and you WILL BE FRUSTRATED at several intersections while you try to figure out where to go and what to do (although that shouldn't take you very long).\n\nANYWAY, there is much that I say about this game, lets begin:\n\nThe game in itself has a wonderful storyline with a fantastic way of slowly revealing bits of information to keep the player engaged. If you're into mysteries, this game will keep you on the edge of your seat, determined to find out just why the hell you're doing what you are. DID I MENTION THAT THERE ARE FLASHBACKS? FLASHBACKS!\n\nWhile the game doesn't feature the baddies health or level meters, the game does give you a fair amount of warning if a creature is too powerful for you to handle at that moment and lets you decently level up as you progress through the game. I doubt you'll need to grind through this game (unless you've been skimping out on all those encounters!). Also, the game warns you when you have to fight bosses and there's usually always a save point somewhere nearby that you can use. Its safe to say that if you spot a save point, you're probably going to need it so make sure to save up.\n\nSpeaking of which, the battle style is incredibly simple. You don't have a 'battle meter' in the game so your turns are mostly based on your Agility levels. YEAH, GO BACK TO THOSE GAMES WHERE YOU HAD TO PREP YOUR CHARACTERS STAT POINTS.\n\nThe game isn't as open world as it may seem at first, there are fixed boundries that loop as you pass through, AND THERE ARE NO GUIDE MAPS OR SIGNIFICANT MARKED LOCATIONS, which makes areas really seem as a Labyrinth. However, it doesn't take very long (unless you have the memory of a goldfish like I do) to figure out the layout of the area once you're in there (except for that Desert of Illusions. WHAT A ♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nITEMS. While you may think that the game lacks items and armory, I found whatever available to be sufficient for the gameplay. Also, in Labyronia, don't sell all the weapons and armour just because you think you're not going to need them, some of those items have special properties which you're going to seriously need later on.. UNLESS YOU GRINDED TO A SUPER HIGH LEVEL.\n\nThere is still so much more I could say about this game, BUT I WON'T. I don't want to ruin the excitement and fun out of the game so just purchase is and play it. Its worth a lot more than the price you're paying for it.","August 17, 2015","true","14.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","5"

Sure its not uniqe, epic or something but it feels a bit like Zelda Majoras Mask in 2 D get 4 Crystals to find the truth. It has many items and skills to find and they are well hidden and make fun to find every puzzle/ piece. The story is fine mysterious, the fights are tough, sometimes to tough and you get frustated to get back again the whole way without saving and most time you feel lost, no maps, no or less helps, that is for some gamers to stop the game unfinished. Graphic is fine and play length for me too, even sometimes it could more details. The secret fake walls and all the secret stuff (like strong bonus enemys if you get all cues). Sometimes are places like air laby where you get really annoying on some place but this are only a few to test your reaction/ timing and play will. To find your way, all weapons, cues and get level 40 (i would love a bit more areas and levels or some god weapons for 99.999 Gold and even super secret super boss Enemys) its fine. All small critic. Save often and take care of your next steps it could be your last ;) but in all th over 15 hours was great and so i give 8,9 Points. I hope you enjoy it and dont give up till the end :) It was Trading Cards and Steam Achievements (could be some more ;) ), so enjoy them. I start now Labyronia 2 and hope it has the same fantastic quality like part 1.

The world is small, but because of how its structured (around labyrinths!), navigating it can be puzzling, but usually in enjoyable ways. The characters aren't particularly impressive, but as this is the first game in a series, it can be expected that they will be further developed in later games. The exploration (which is almost always rewarded with rare treasures) and the lore (books to read are scattered throughout) are, in my opinion, the strengths of Labyronia. The combat isn't particularly impressive, but there are certain fights that will require strategy, usually in the form of utilizing a specific "cue," the game's version of spells/arts.\n\nCriticisms include the aforementioned lackluster character design/development, a few glitches (specific interactions with a few choice NPCs that essentially freeze the game), and the confusion that comes from navigating a few of the game's looping areas (namely Alathar and the Desert of Illusions).\n\nEagerly anticipating the sequel, should it be released on Steam.","August 22, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I enjoy going on rpgmaker.net and seeing the things that some people can make. A lot of people stereotype RPG Maker games to be low effort when there's just as many games that have care put into them, with original graphics and everything.\n\nBut this game - and all other games by the creator - symbolizes that stereotype.\n\nLabryonia just seems to use the default assets provided by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine along with some resources that seem to be pulled from resource packs. The only original things seem to be those book pages you find lying around every now and then, but even then they all just seem like text pasted onto a page template. As for the story, it's pretty much humdrum elemental stuff. If you're in for an incredibly basic JRPG experience, sure, it's fine, but as some games like To the Moon demonstrates, RPG Maker could be used to tell incredible stories, and sadly Labryonia is as bland as it is uninspired.\n\nMy play time looks short, yes, but the beginning parts of the game looks like an omen of mediocrity to come. Allow me to rant. The first, real dungeon of the game is the Water Labyrinth. The first dungeon of a game should be easy and interesting (though not overly interesting - the real fascinating stuff should be saved for toward the end), but this dungeon is neither. It's like the Hell Maze from Yume Nikki except somehow worse, and it's real easy to get lost an/or hit dead-ends. The whole dungeon is blue. It's an eyesore. There is little varience in dungeon design as well, save for the occasional red crystal. See, you're supposed to find all these red crystals to open the door to the boss... but of course these crystals are hidden all throughout the dungeon so you'll be stuck with the tedious and eye-killing task of walking around the badly designed dungeon. There are two reprieves though, I'll have to admit. Thankfully encounters in dungeons are on-screen and not random encounters; if they were, I would have dropped the game right then and there. Secondly, there is an item that gives you regenerating AP (the game's version of MP), so you'll be able to heal off any damage you take. If you're sincerely playing this game, I recommend picking this up. Meanwhile, the actual boss fight is manageable - if extremely tedious like everything else.\n\nNow that is not a good way to start a game off. Games should ease you into the experience, not bore or frustrate you into senselessness, but Labryonia did just that. I'm honestly shocked that this game has such a good rating on Steam. If rpgmaker.net had more users and momentum, I'm sure that the game would have gotten completely savaged like most other low-effort works. In all honesty, the only reason why I picked this and the second game up is because it was dirt cheap and I'm a sucker for easy Steam cards.\n\nDo you want a good RPG Maker game? This is not one. I recommend going on RPG Maker sites and poking around for anything good. I personally recommend Grist of Flies and HOME if you're looking for anything recent-ish. Want to throw your money at an RPG Maker game? Why not give Lisa: The Painful RPG and To the Moon a go instead of this?\n\nBut then again, this game is dirt cheap, so why not?\n\n(If there is one thing to praise about this game though, I like the idea of gaining skills from certain sources. If this was a good game this would push the player to explore, providing incentive beyond a chest full of gold or items. Too bad this isn't a good game.)","November 3, 2015","false","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found myself staring at the screen for a bit after the 'intro' is done. Who the hell am i playing as? Who the hell is his mentor? Why the hell is he writing a diary at that age? Why is he our chosen hero? The first town i got to also doesn't explains anything. The town is literally just there to be 'your first town you visited after you left your home'.\n\nAnd the biggest downer, the most sinful of all, is the characters. I mean i don't mind playing as an old guy, but do you seriously have to put a guy in a promotional images, and NOT having him in the game? Like, at all?\n\nI was seriously hoping that the main character would be the guy from the promotional image, and instead, i got an old man that looks NOTHING like the guy in the picture. I was actually thinking that the old man is sort of like the 'prologue' character, which provides backstory, which then later gets replaced by the other guy.\n\nYeah, i'm only 10 minutes in, and i'm biased towards the things other people said about the characters, but really though? RPG's main selling point is the diversity of the characters, and there's like, 8 hours until my first party member? Yeah no.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game if you're in for the characters and character development","November 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I enjoy going on rpgmaker.net and seeing the things that some people can make. A lot of people stereotype RPG Maker games to be low effort when there's just as many games that have care put into them, with original graphics and everything.\n\nBut this game - and all other games by the creator - symbolizes that stereotype.\n\nLabryonia just seems to use the default assets provided by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine along with some resources that seem to be pulled from resource packs. The only original things seem to be those book pages you find lying around every now and then, but even then they all just seem like text pasted onto a page template. As for the story, it's pretty much humdrum elemental stuff. If you're in for an incredibly basic JRPG experience, sure, it's fine, but as some games like To the Moon demonstrates, RPG Maker could be used to tell incredible stories, and sadly Labryonia is as bland as it is uninspired.\n\nMy play time looks short, yes, but the beginning parts of the game looks like an omen of mediocrity to come. Allow me to rant. The first, real dungeon of the game is the Water Labyrinth. The first dungeon of a game should be easy and interesting (though not overly interesting - the real fascinating stuff should be saved for toward the end), but this dungeon is neither. It's like the Hell Maze from Yume Nikki except somehow worse, and it's real easy to get lost an/or hit dead-ends. The whole dungeon is blue. It's an eyesore. There is little varience in dungeon design as well, save for the occasional red crystal. See, you're supposed to find all these red crystals to open the door to the boss... but of course these crystals are hidden all throughout the dungeon so you'll be stuck with the tedious and eye-killing task of walking around the badly designed dungeon. There are two reprieves though, I'll have to admit. Thankfully encounters in dungeons are on-screen and not random encounters; if they were, I would have dropped the game right then and there. Secondly, there is an item that gives you regenerating AP (the game's version of MP), so you'll be able to heal off any damage you take. If you're sincerely playing this game, I recommend picking this up. Meanwhile, the actual boss fight is manageable - if extremely tedious like everything else.\n\nNow that is not a good way to start a game off. Games should ease you into the experience, not bore or frustrate you into senselessness, but Labryonia did just that. I'm honestly shocked that this game has such a good rating on Steam. If rpgmaker.net had more users and momentum, I'm sure that the game would have gotten completely savaged like most other low-effort works. In all honesty, the only reason why I picked this and the second game up is because it was dirt cheap and I'm a sucker for easy Steam cards.\n\nDo you want a good RPG Maker game? This is not one. I recommend going on RPG Maker sites and poking around for anything good. I personally recommend Grist of Flies and HOME if you're looking for anything recent-ish. Want to throw your money at an RPG Maker game? Why not give Lisa: The Painful RPG and To the Moon a go instead of this?\n\nBut then again, this game is dirt cheap, so why not?\n\n(If there is one thing to praise about this game though, I like the idea of gaining skills from certain sources. If this was a good game this would push the player to explore, providing incentive beyond a chest full of gold or items. Too bad this isn't a good game.)","November 3, 2015","false","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found myself staring at the screen for a bit after the 'intro' is done. Who the hell am i playing as? Who the hell is his mentor? Why the hell is he writing a diary at that age? Why is he our chosen hero? The first town i got to also doesn't explains anything. The town is literally just there to be 'your first town you visited after you left your home'.\n\nAnd the biggest downer, the most sinful of all, is the characters. I mean i don't mind playing as an old guy, but do you seriously have to put a guy in a promotional images, and NOT having him in the game? Like, at all?\n\nI was seriously hoping that the main character would be the guy from the promotional image, and instead, i got an old man that looks NOTHING like the guy in the picture. I was actually thinking that the old man is sort of like the 'prologue' character, which provides backstory, which then later gets replaced by the other guy.\n\nYeah, i'm only 10 minutes in, and i'm biased towards the things other people said about the characters, but really though? RPG's main selling point is the diversity of the characters, and there's like, 8 hours until my first party member? Yeah no.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game if you're in for the characters and character development","November 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHank/recommended/391260/","SourHank","doctorhankmd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SourHank/","102 products in account","So like others before have stated, I wanted to like this game. I really did, but there were far too many cons in just over an hour of playtime that gradually depleted that hope until all I was left with was a game over screen screen prompting me to return to the source and try my luck again, which unfortunately, you will be needing a lot of if you attempt to play this game.\n\nFirst I will start with the pros that I found.\n\n+ The sounds and music are very well done, and are reminiscent to Secret of Mana in regards to music quality and Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest in regards to the sound effects, especially your sword attack.\n+ When you talk to some NPCs they show a small character profile of them which is very well drawn.\n+ The first and only village I visited, which while small, was well drawn out and I liked seeing some of the animations, including the flowers blowing in the wind, and the birds and butterflies moving around. It definitely added a bit of charm to the otherwise static world.\n\nNow I have to move on to the cons and before anybody chooses to downvote my review, please take into account that this is my opinion.\n\n- When I booted up the game it started off in a small (Minesweeper) size window that was hard to see, so I found the option to move it into fullscreen which upgraded the screen size about 1/3 more which wasn't much better but it at least made it viewable. Unfortunately, while playing, the screen constantly flickered and glitched while I moved slowly, I might add around the overworld, which after a few minutes began to hurt my eyes. There is an option in the settings where you can decrease the flickering, but after clicking it, it didn't do much to help.\n- My character moves as slow as a snail in the overworld map to the point where I would pray that I wouldn't encounter an enemy while I could see the lone village at the edge of my screen. Although, his pace quickly changes in specific area screens with the click of the Shift button making it more bearable, but still making me dread trudging once again around the overworld.\n- The first battle I had after leaving my house was with a Python enemy, and so I thought I got this, but was sorely mistaken after getting knocked out from three hits without even the knowledge of knowing how much damage I inflicted on it. No enemy health bars makes the battles annoying to the point where I had to keep track of how much health each of the six enemy types I encountered had in my head and relied once again on luck to strike back with the correct amount of damage in the fewest amount of turns.\n- No item drops, only gold which becomes pointless after a short while due to no variance in weapons, armor or items available in the first town. How can the Wool Robe be worth more MDG (Whatever that is) that the Leather Tunic and the tunic only increases your defense by 2 points? Really? How does that make sense?\n- I must have crossed the first bridge at least thirty times farming for experience, which you will need to do right off the bat, trust me, and no matter how fast I was, or well versed with my timing, could not sneak up on the lone enemy! Almost every RPG, especially 90's era RPGs have allowed the character/ player to sneak up and get a surprise attack, why is that not an option now?\n- Some of the design choices that were made baffle me, like for instance, on the first bridge, there are holes in it which reveal water beneath that is a solid blue color, like something straight out of MS Paint, but the wood paneling of the bridge is very well textured and designed. That is odd but whatever, eventually get to the Northern Bridge seperating you from the Ice World and the water surrounding the bridge is textured and even animated. Why the difference? It doesn't make any bit of sense.\n- What you need to be doing and where you need to go are muddled and ultimately left out for you to figure out on your own. Tried heading into the Elven forest but got sniped by the first enemy I encountered, which was an Elven Archer. Okay, let's try the Ice World, but alas, can't break rocks yet and got attacked by a gang of six ice bats all doing 30+ damage each turn which will dwindle your health pretty quickly even after reaching level 5, so I had to flee. Let's try going left towards Jenise which I figured out was the name of a city and not a woman after talking to a bald NPC in the "Cold Shoulder" Pub. Good luck trying to make it to the cave that you are supposed to travel through to the city before an Orc destroys you with their critical hits that come into play 1/2 the time. This leads me to believe that I better start grinding away or dash my chances of progressing in the game, which annoyed me further. I understand the need to grind in an RPG but make it not only fun but rewarding for the player. Take Earthbound for instance, you can beat the game at the minimum level of 40 which is nice while I could barely take down the first few enemies in this game at level 5.\n- The battles are completely based on luck and the games mercy at giving you a good roll of the die. This is the same for a plethora of RPGs but in this game, you merely have to spam the z button and pray that you survive, whereas in other games you can have a bit of strategy.\n\nI can go on and on and really nitpick the crap out of this but alas, I choose to forego returning to the source and ending my experience with a few closing comments.\n\nI read a review that stated this game felt like it was made in RPG Maker and I can agree wholeheartedly with that statement. Nothing felt finished, and the things that worked were overshadowed completely by the list of things that didn't. This game, is to be put bluntly, lazy and nothing more than a ploy at getting a few dollars here and there from people before getting dismissed to the bowels of Steams library. No wonder the developer is offering $300 to the first person to finish the game and send them a screenshot. It is mindnumbingly tedious and quite an endeavor to brave the rest of the game for a few hundred dollars.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would not recommend this game for anyone looking to have a good time. Avoid this and go play a better game like Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Secret of Mana, etc.\n\n2/10","August 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","25","52","0","1"

I've done this a few dozen times and still die instantly in the third area while using the magic that the enemy is weak against, I just have to do it another 100 times, spening hours and hours on this boring ♥♥♥♥ to be powerful enough like I did in the first area so I could survive the second. Its not even worth continuing to play it, theres just too many better games in my queue some of which were also <$1.\n\nNot to mention free downloads of emulated old Gameboy games are about the same graphics and layout quality with the same style of gameplay but far better difficulty balance so its not so boring to play. Like with Pokemon RGB/Yellow you could actually beat the game with just your starter by defeating every enemy that you bump into naturaly and every trainer/gym leader with him and not do any training, or even do some training with multiple pokemon to work out strategies and its not as boring because you have mini goals (new moves, evolutions) where as in this game you get nothing from leveling except automatic health and power increase, doesn't even have the most basic of rpg strategy elements: stat/skill points to apply. Instead you gain skills by clicking on stuff in nature...\n\nIn say LoZ OoA/OoS for Gameboy you don't even have to deal with this stupid grinding ♥♥♥♥ because it doesn't have player levels its just based on your own skill as a player, but this game is like the opposite of that they have only very rudimentary strategy like use fire spell to damage willowosips or do more damage to elves, wind spell to do more damage to mosquitos in the first area. But by the time you are able to tolerate the second area you have all of the best equip from the town (except the lucky charm, which I have now and it does nothing) and can kill those mosqitos with one physical attack anyway. This game is maybe a 2/5, because the grinding is ridiculously long and boring.","May 28","false","3.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","14"

I booted the game up and was greeted by a super tiny window and title screen.  I decided to jump right into it anyway, and after a short intro screen the game introduced me to the Options menu.\n\nGreat, I thought.  I can finally get the game to run in full screen. Well, the Fullscreen option did not work without a ton of screen flickering which made my eyes hurt.  Luckily I saw an option in the menu to reduce screen flickering, so I figured I'd try that one.  Nope, the option to reduce screen flickering did not help alleviate this problem.\n\nSo then I decided, I'd turn down the resolution on my monitor, and give it another shot in a slightly less super tiny window.  I did a little bit of exploring, checking out the first nearby town and talking to some of the people.  After a couple of random battles, and visiting a shop I decided I wanted to adjust my control options.\n\nAdjusting the control options isn't a straightforward task.  It allows you to re-map your controller to different keyboard letters in the game, but doesn't actually say what each button does.  I figured I'd just re-map the buttons a little bit and I'd have it set up to a somewhat tolerable level to continue to check out the game some more.  Unfortunately after I re-mapped the buttons, the game bugged out and was unplayable.\n\nAfter booting the game back up another time, and confirming that my previous control settings were saved, I decided to plunge in one more time.  The first thing I noticed was that the changes I made in the controls screen didn't actually make any difference in the game, my controller still did the same things.  So, again I continued to play the game further constantly telling myself I'd just have to get used to the controls because I really wanted to check out this game!\n\nAfter wandering around for another 10 minutes and finding the first place I was supposed to go, I died valiantly in battle due to pressing the wrong button.  Then I decided that I was not interested in this game any more. As for the rest of the game I haven't played enough of it to review.\n\n","August 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 25 of 62 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","25","62","4","3"

As an RPG fan, there is little not to like in this title. There is world-adventuring, dungeon-crawling and puzzle-solving. There are small villages and larger towns, each with their own style and feel. There is lore to the game, revealed in books and scraps of paper throughout the game. Hidden in caves and dungeons all over the map are rare items and secrets, and players should take note of anything unusual they see to come back to.\n\nA fundamental aspect of the combat are Auras, derived from Cues found around the game world. An example of this might be an angry chef, who gives you the Cue for a flame attack. These Cues are scattered all over the place and serve as a fun and lasting impetus for players to really explore every nook and cranny of the world.\n\nThe story is sparse and anodyne at first - stay with it. It really picks up, especially towards the end. I feel like the developers really caught the atmosphere of world-changing events well. The climactic boss battle felt grounded in the game world's events - not only difficult, but meaningful. It felt as if the outcome mattered, and the sense of reward when beating something which makes you feel that way is exactly what I play videogames for.\n\nThe music was great, even the omnipresent world music I never tired of. The enemies are varied and interesting, a far cry from the re-coloured skins of Final Fantasy eg., and helped give the dungeons they inhabit their own distinct atmospheres.\n\nMy only negatives with this game were as follows: the lack of direction - often I was very unsure where I was going and what to, and I could see how this might put a more casual gamer off; the confusing maps (looking at you, frozen field, forest and desert) that take far longer to traverse than should be necessary, and SPOILER  the baffling decision to only unlock your second and third party members in the last fifth of the game. Why?!  And then MEGA SPOILER  to lose the third member before the final boss battle! So you take pains to prepare, building a balanced team, only to lose a member for the duration of the fight. I laughed when it happened, it was so unexpected and silly.\n\nSome players may also have trouble with the game's difficulty, particularly at the start. All I can say is to stick with it. Longtime RPGers should have no problem, and more casual gamers will certainly find that grinding for a level or two or finding a new Cue will make once-impossible foes much more beatable.\n\nIf you take the time to look past the admittedly minor problems, you will be rewarded with an entertaining, nostalgic game based around a solid combat mechanic and set in a colourful, vibrant world. I finished the game in one 12 hour playthrough and there is still more to do. For its price, Labyronia RPG is a steal and I would highly recommend you buy it.","September 1, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The usual types of monsters, the usual elemental magic, a combat system that reminds me most of all of Pokemon. If there is anything distinctive, it's in the endless mazes and labyrinths. I obviously expected labyrinths from a game called "Labyronia", but they are everywhere; even the world map is full of labyrinths you must traverse simply to get between towns, and even after you've traveled many times there usually aren't shortcuts so you end up grinding through the same monsters over and over again just to travel between towns.\n\nIt's also very difficult to figure out what's going on; the game seems to be itself designed as a labyrinth, because it has strange, cryptic clues in odd places and no quest or journal system to keep track of what you've done or what you're supposed to be doing next. Occasionally you need to do things that are a bit counter-intuitive, like walk through a particular section of wall which is slightly different from the rest. There seems to be a system to include other party members, but I got what seems to be about a quarter through the game without being able to recruit any, thus making all my revival items useless.","November 22, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't alt-tab properly. You can't even get to your mixer if you want to dial game's boring repetative music a bit.  The graphics are as stock as you can imagine, i haven't found one fresh idea all the time i played. The difficulty is ridiculously spastic - you go aound killing everything you see, next thing you know you get beaten with no ability to do something. You simply do not want to waste time with this game.\nMy advice would be buying some other, good rpg here on steam, even if it would cost you a few coppers more.","December 14, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you can see I decided to give thumps up in the end, mostly because it's only 2,99€ (and because of the easy achievements ;) ). As a warning in advance: don't buy this game unless you are hardcore RPG gamer and don't bother JRPG stuff like grinding. Otherwise you won't enjoy it.\n\nAfter that's said let's talk about the game:\n\nThe story takes place in Labyronia: a world filled with natural labyrinths (of course) which have been created by the four elemental gods in order to punish the humans and their rebellious wizards. And along with the labyrinths, monsters appeard throughout the lands. Yeah, this doesn't sound THAT bad. Now, 50 years after the creation of the labyrinths our main character Arres wakes up one morning and decides to finally save the world by obtaining the 4 elemental crystals and kick the gods' asses. This is were the game starts..\n\nDon't get me wrong. The story is indeed a big cliche and there are lots and lots of other issues, like when you have no exact idea what you have to do most of the time. Also the battle system seems like a let down AT FIRST. Thats just because almost every enemy can inflict fatal debuffs on you. For instance "grounded" or "stunned". While one of these debuffs is active you can't do anything until it wears off and in most causes you get killed without even landing a single hit on the enemy. What makes it worse is that you have no companions until very late in the game. Because of this you'll get killed over and over again at the beginning. But if you finally gathered some equipment that prevents certain debuffs or learned some new spells which inflict debuffs on the enemy, you can take control in most battles. This is when this game gets fun.\n\nI also like that in order to get new spells you don't have to lvl up or buy spell books at a magic store. You just have to find and interact with unique objects called "cues". This means you have to do a lot of exploring to get stronger.\n\nThe dialogues are very nicely written. Nothing to complain about here. But this won't change the fact that *little spoiler* the mushy "love story" between our "hero" Arres and his companion Ann ("love at first sight" you know it..) seems extremely unreal and goofy. It made me choke. No kidding. It made me choke so hard. *little spoiler ends*\n\nThe graphics, music and sounds are just RPG Maker originals. They don't look/sound bad but a bit of variety would have been appreciated..\n\nOverall it's a solid RPG Maker game. It entertains you for a few hours for little money. I kinda enjoyed it despite it's issues.","November 1, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But no, not a single hint about where you are meant to start. The storyline is quite well written but the leveling system is quite unfair. There are some monsters near your house that can one-hit you. I found that a little unfair since these powerful monsters are spawning next to your house. This game is great and really fun once you get into it and are at a pretty good level. But I found it quite annoying that you have to grind so much to just get to certain areas without dying. Although the leveling system in this game is quite harsh the storyline and characters are qutie well done. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPG\'s and has a lot of patience (grinding and leveling up).
