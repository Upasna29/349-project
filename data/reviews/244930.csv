No, it didn't quite ' Cripple ' me, it more left me unable to ever truly put stress on my knee again. For those who ski and snowboard, you know the ability to do so is paramount to actually staying on the damn things.\n\nI found this game just today, watching funny little youtube videos, coming across a bunch of guys messing around with it. While it illicited some laughs, I was interested. ' What is this game? And why the hell has it been under my radar this whole time? '.\n\nAfter about a half an hour of playing it, I can say it's decent. It's free. The ragdoll physics give me a laugh or two, and the first person doing a 720 left me breathless.\n\nThank you for giving me my hobby back, at least in this form.","February 3","true","3.6"," 240 of 249 people (96%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","96","240","249","29","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThED4G/recommended/244930/","ThED4G","TheDaG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThED4G/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI got this game after binge watching snowboarding films ( Its January and no hills in Scotland have any snow, I need my fix... ) and deciding to check steam for SSX, NO SSX on steam but it does have this early access game. To say the least I was intrigued. Before I go any further theres a couple of questions you will need to ask yourself\n\nDo you love snowsports?\nDid you love SSX 3 and SSX  ( the newer 1 )? with its freeroamy goodness\nDo you want to experience what pulling a 1080 feels like in first person?\nCan you afford to go snowboarding in other countries? ( I can't :(\n\nIF you answered yes to any of the first 3 questions and no to the last one then this game is for you. IF you answered yes to the last question then what are you doing on your PC? book that holiday to Tignes, Mayrhofen or where ever and do it for real. Read on for a more descript review\n\n\nStill reading? Good now lets break this down\n\nGraphics - The graphics are great, I mean its a freeskiing/snowboarding game so theres no explosions or anything fancy just fantastic looking mountains and pistes. The snows nice with persistent trails from your previous runs and the characters look well textured which is just as well cause you need to show off that fancy piece of kit you just plowed your hard earned credits into.\n\nGameplay - The game is split into offline and online and in either of them you can choose to do events or freeroam. The events cover pretty much every category of skiing and snowboarding with time trial, freestyle etc... and the freeroam... well lets just say your plonked onto whichever part of the mountain you want and you go from there. At the time of review there is 1 mountain and several big air parks, don't let that put you off, the Mountain is huge ( of course it is, its a mountain ) The skiing itself seems fine but can be a little funny at times with some quirky bugs. I started a run and my character was stuck in the Jesus pose until I respawned or the fact that if you crash your body ragdolises as if you were made out of rubber.  I need to mention as well this game plays like a simulation so theres no insane tricks that make your ski's pop off and fly around your head before magically reattaching..... looking at you SSX\n\nMusic - The music is good, it could be better with some extra tunes and maybe some from that previous SSX game but the music they do have is chosen well for the snowscene. It would be good to see the total tracks or be able to skip them as a couple of times during freeroam its played the first track and then stopped. If anyone has been on a mountain without any music they know what thats like. Theres always steam music tho i suppose\n\nCustomization - The customization in this game is snow joke ( I had to ) This is where the game really shines, at the time of this review I am eagerly awaiting the release of the snowboarding part of the game however from looking through the items just for skiing theres is a HUGE amount to pick from. You kit your character out from head to toe literally, Chose hats,helmets,goggles,jackets,trousers,boots,skis,poles face masks & even bindings. Each of these categories have recent kit from most of the popular brands such as K2, Scott & Head to name just a few.\n\nMultiplayer - I actually haven't played much of multiplayer, my first attempt was met with huge lag. Second attempt and I saw 1 other person on the mountain which i followed in the hopes of showing my mad skills to. got ahead of him and prepared to hit a kicker unfortuntately I ended up hitting him and we both bailed. Which would of been fine but for some reason in multiplayer you can only restart at the top of the mountain and not where you bailed. Needless to say he bailed from the game. The developers are aware of the connection issues and are trying to improve it so hopefully it will be sorted soon as this is an integral part of the game, Imagine you and a couple of buddies on the side of the hill with a kicker taking turns at hitting it. For me that sounds perfect\n\nTo sum things up this game has huge potential, they are adding in snowboarding soon and If they add in the same amount of gear for snowboarding as they have for skiing I will be a very very happy person. As with any early access game theres still a long way to go. However again I highly recommend this game for any fan of snowsports or the SSX games.\n\nSome things i would like to see in the released game.\n\nAbility to get off skis/board and wander around + the ability to spawn in objects & move them ( such as ramps, tables etc ) for limited amounts of time to make your own jibs etc kinda like what SKATE had\n\nIf you use a chair lift can we maybe be able to sit and watch from it as we go back up ( with the ability to skip ) sounds boring but its actually quite entertaining seeing whats going on from them especially when people bail :p\n\nSnowmobiles, currently used much like the chair lifts when you interact they take you to certain spawns instead maybe when we use them we could actually drive them to where ever. Would open the game up alot more.\n\nWeather and snow conditions - Everyone loves a bluebird day however in Scotland getting a bluebird day is a rare thing and i presume its the same for places everywhere else? Stoked had a fantastic weather system with storms that altered the snow conditions. It would be great to see the same thing done here\n\nMountains - More mountains... can never have enough mountains","January 5","true","9.8"," 239 of 257 people (93%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","93","239","257","59","19"

It's ridiculous. Espescially seeing all the complaints about things like speed and physics when in reality this game has WAY more realistic speed and physics than any other snow games out there like SSX Shaun White Snowboarding etc. All those games have horrible physics and DO NOT replicate real life snow sports what so ever. The funny thing is I have snowboarded all my life and didn't even care much for skiing, so I was dissappointed that snowboarding isn't in the game yet, but I went ahead and purchased anyways because I couldn't wait any longer since there are no other games out there like this one. Long story short this game actually made me like skiing for the first time ever in the 18 years of my life of being a snowboarder. I've also been waiting for a game like this forever literally. NO COMPANY has ever made a snow sports game so realistic. I needed a game like this so badly and it's finally here. So here's my review:\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Very realistic physics. (Speed going uphill is a little bit off when tucking since you barely slow down but is not a problem because it allows you to find more lines. Going downhill is perfect. Please do not change it devs, do not listen to idiots.)\n\n- All tricks are realistic as well. (You can finally cork your spins. Never have I ever played a snow game that I could actually pull a double cork 10 that looks exactly like it's done in real life. In Shaun White Snowboarding the closest thing to a cork is a rodeo...no corking was implemented in that game... like wtf.)\n\n- Real life brand clothing and gear replicas. (Armada, Head, etc.)\n\n- Real life event replicas. (Nine Knights, Jon Olsson Invitational, etc.)\n\n- Real Life sponsers. (Red Bull, Monster, etc.)\n\n- Vast mountains to explore, and I mean it. The current mountain Sialia actually takes about 10 minutes real life time to get from top to the bottom at full speed making it very realistic. Also this mountain is ski - able in all directions, North, East, West, and South. Each direction has different types of terrain, including a terrain park, my favorite, that takes about 4 minutes to get down.\n\n-Lots of cool different lines you can take. The whole mountain has lines hidden away for you to find. Above I mentioned the terrain park which has multiple different directions you can take that lead you into different parts of the terrain park and back into the same parts if you wish. The choice is yours as there are so many variations to this terrain park it's truly endless fun.\n\n-Legit first person view (It literally looks like real life in first person view when you're corking a spin.)\n\n-Free 2 play coming soon. (People complaining about microtransactions yet the whole base game is free. The only thing you get if you buy into the microtransations is cosmetics and vanity. You don't gain any advantages to your character in terms of speed, power, or skills. NO PAY2WIN here. The skill is in the players hands.\n\n-Devs are super friendly and helpful and respond very fast to any problems or bug reports. (I submitted a bug report and got a response within the first day and then I responded again because I didn't give accurate information and they responded within minutes.) Most importantly they actually listen to their community.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Few bugs. (Sometimes your character bails even though he landed perfectly, which happens very rarely like 2 times in a 4 hour session. Not a big deal) (Skiing switch in first person is a little buggy since the shoulder gets in the way when tucking. Not a big deal.) Sometimes when you spawn on a drop point you get stuck until you respawn again. (Not a big deal.) (Games crashes in multiplayer sometimes as well as desyncs, which kind of pisses me off but I sent in a ticket and  devs noted these crashes and are working on fixing them, also new servers are coming very soon.)\n\n-Price of gear is just a little bit expensive but I have no problems with this at all since there is no advantage to owning this stuff. The game is free on January 27th and I will buy some just to support the devs. Obviously they can't just work for free.\n\n-Not enough advertising. I really want to see this game succeed but I only heard about this in December, yet it's appearently been out for 3 years now. I had to search deep to find this it was literally like digging for gold and hitting the jackpot. I was stuck with all these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for 3 years when I could have been playing this.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you are like me and are looking for a snow sports game that actually replicates real life skiing and snowboarding, then this is the game you're looking for. This is the game you have been waiting your whole life to play, but couldn't because it was buried in a search engine full of bullsh*t. Do yourself the favour and don't waste cash on all these mainstream AAA garbage games made in China. You'll just come right back here realizing how much of an idiot you were to even bother looking at them.\n\nHope you guys find my review useful. Thanks.\n","January 19","true","103.0"," 186 of 214 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","186","214","13","16"

The game is in alpha, there is no sound, yet I still enjoyed every second skiing down the mountain. If you like skiing you will love this even in its unfinished state. It can only go up from here.\n\nEdit: So I'm going to add a little more to this review because apparently people are actually reading it.\n\nHere's what you can complain about: Lack of sound and snow effects.\n\nSound's no big deal, just play some of your own music in the background for now. It's the effects that really throw everything off. Your character is basically just on the mountain, as of right now there's no interaction between the skis and the mountain; no tracks, no little specks of snow going everywhere as you might expect from skis in snow. But I'm sure that's in the works, and honestly once the sound and those little effcts are in the game is more than recommendable if you enjoy the winter sports.\n\nThere's a little bit of a learning curve but I'd venture a guess and say it's easier to learn to play this game than actually ski.\n\nEarlier today they put out a big update and really cleaned up a lot of the UI. The menu isn't all over the place and flicking out of view and they have the basic framework down for the multiplayer. It's looks really promising.\n\nNow of course there's bugs here and there, the previous update completely broke the options menu but I have yet to encounter any crashing while actually playing the game itself which is something.\n\nAs I'm writing this there are no negative reviews so that should tell you that yes, if you're unsure whether or not  to buy it and it seems interesting, but you're afraid it won't turn out great down the road; I'd recommend it even in it's current state.","November 25, 2013","true","7.1"," 152 of 190 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","152","190","0","0"

This game use to be good, when it first came out on early access. I even paid for the founders pack. the physics, speed, and style of this game are not there anymore.

Now? No.\n\nThe latest update - the "Beta" update on March 10th completely changed the game from something good with lots of potential to.. something that feels less like a game and more like a cash grab. They've added microtransactions for any sort of cosmetic item. Anything that one could originally use on their character for free in the Alpha has been put behind a paywall. As of now, you can only get these items through purchasing a "credit pack" and getting them that way.\n\nThe developer says that they will eventually add ways to earn these items in the game, but to release a major "update" with the microtransactions in-game for people like myself who already spent money on said game is a red flag. I know that the developers need to make a living and game development isn't cheap. On their forums, a developer has said that it was economically unwise for them to charge $15 or so for the base game and have everyone unlock the gear from the start - thus the microtransactions. However, I fail to see why exactly this business model has been adapted - it would have been much easier to just increase the price of the game accordingly - instead of adding a microtransaction system.\n\nAgain, I realize that the developers need to make a profit. That's fine - but the current business model is not the best way to go, and if a drastic, negative change took place from Alpha to Beta, it makes me skeptical about what the future holds. Only time will tell. However, as of now, the game does not appear to be something worth investing in.","March 19, 2015","false","6.6"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","95","128","3","2"

I also have to add that the biggest part of the fun (with the launch version) was to explore the mountain with the "cheating mode" that was a mode you activated while pressing F1 and could drop your character anywhere you wanted on the mountain.

Most of the negetivity is due to either:\n\n1. They found out they have to pay real money to customize their skiers looks\n\n2. The latest update has a few glitches that need to be ironed out.\n\nHowever, consider that:\n\nA. The game will EVENTUALLY be free to play, and they will fund the game on in game purchases. It currently is not because the game is still in early access. You are paying extra money to access the game early .. NOT TO BUY THE GAME. You might think that is stingey, but this is an independantly developed game by a company with LIMITED RESOURCES .. they need your money to make the game!\n\nB. Early Access = glitches .. welcome to the world of modern game development.\n\nIf you can get past those 2 points and have more patience than a 5 year old whiner, then this game is the BEST Skiing game ever made, and IMO the BEST Winter sports game ever made.\n\nThe major selling point is that the game takes a more grounded "less arcadey" approach, while the physics are still a little loose to allow you to pull off some silly jumps, it mostly gets there and it does it well. You can explore a full mountain with little to no restrictions, which includes a resort complete with lifts (which will be rideable eventually) and an entire back country area. There are a plethora of ways down the mountain, and nothing limits you in any direction.\n\nThis is the Skiing game I have been wishing for since I was 5, and I fully recommend it.","March 27, 2015","true","103.0"," 62 of 88 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","62","88","3","0"

I'll update this review once I've had a chance to try it out. Until then, take this with a pinch of salt]\n\nI do recommend this game, but it's a grudging recommendation...\n\nThe good:\n\n* The scenery is stunning\n* Going off-piste is fantastic\n* It has bags of potential\n* Pretty damned good simulation (especially since the latest update, still a few glitches but generally OK)\n* Excellent music\n* Great fun to relax and unwind with (I prefer free roam to doing events)\n* Lots of features being added / improved\n* Dev team seem committed and I see no signs of vapourware\n* I haven't personally had any performance issues (although I've seen post from some who have)\n* Rift support!\n\nThe bad:\n* Microtransactions (At least they're currently cosmetic only)\n* If you want to get to the good spawn points, you have to grind XP\n* Features keep being removed\n* Updates are a little slow and there's no target 1.0 date\n* Controls could do with a tweak (especially moving the camera in 3rd person)\n* Grinding XP (worth mentioning again, especially when wiping out costs unbanked XP)\n\nPerhaps I was spoiled by playing very early versions of this game, but I loved if because it left me alone on a mountain to explore and go where I wanted. Now, however, if you want to try the best bits of the mountain, you need to grind XP which is still insanely slow in Free Roam mode.\n\nI may be wrong but I get the impression that once the game is Free2Play, the devs are worried people won't hang around long enough to spend money. Unfortunately, it's turned a fun, relaxing game into yet another slog.\n\nI do still recommend it, just.

The other reviewers seem to be angered by the microtransactions, however, these transactions are only cosmetic for the players character model/skier. So no, there are no BS microtransactions that give another player benefits over others.

Recommended for anyone looking fora quality skiing experience on PC.\n\nFULL REVIEW\nSNOW boots you to the main menu where you'll find freestyle skiing, and a store to customize your character. You also find some upcoming features, like Competitive Events. The store is filled with lots of good looking gear, and hopefully much more will come. When you hit Freestyle, you are able to select from a Mountain, the Tutorial, and an olympic themed course. The tutorial I found to be quite confusing, but most of the game is quite simple once you get the basic controls. The mountain is beautifully designed, with great views and jump points. It also has hidden easter eggs like the Yeti and Castle. The olympic course looks pretty good, and can be alot of fun to pull off tricks. Speaking of tricks, air stunts in this game flow well, and there are a great number of them. One problem with this game is sound has yet to be an implemented feature. I'd also like to mention the console's cheat commands, allowing you to slow gravity can be very fun. In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good skiing game on steam.","July 15, 2014","true","4.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Runs absolutely terribly and they ruined the entire gameplay because now you have to unlock the areas, after playing it for roughly 1 hour or less trying to find out how to unlock the areas, I just couldn't. I don't know how.\n\nThrough out the playthrough I've found waaay too many bugs (Understandable for a EA game) with both gameplay and controls. With the 360 (And XBone) Controller, it would either not work half way through the game (And I'd have to restart) or it would just crash the minute I used my controller. Keyboard and Mouse controls were fairly decent, didn't notice much of a problem other than a imput delay but it was "Alright".\n\nHere's my opinion about microtransactions, there should be a way to earn credits instead of having to buy these credits.\nThis would really dim down the whole micro-transaction part, or maybe add a way to earn these clothings that you can buy with these credits\n\nMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 3/10\nMy overall rating with my microtransactions review: 2/10\n\nWhen new updates are released, I'll change my review depending on the updates.The updates have rolled in and I just installed the game after not playing it for... a couple months maybe?\nLet's ignore microtransactions completely, because the game it's self is actually pretty fun (now atleast), I'm still using the same build since I wrote the quoted review and the performance is flawless on the max settings. (Average of 120 - 200 FPS, frames do drop below 100 for me when I'm in forest-like areas.) Now, about the whole speed loss n' such after the engine change, yeah, I'm noticing that's kinda gone, but after the latest updates, it looks like they brought it back.\n\nI'm actually in love with this, mainly the multiplayer though, it's so damn fun playing with your friends in this game, honestly. I'd say pick up this game for you and a friend it you wanted to have fun, playing solo is still fun but sorta bland.\nThe ragdoll physics are abit wonky but are actually pretty funny, assuming that's not intentional, I hope it stays like this, I love it. Skiing physics in general, I'd say they're solid, a few "Hard to control" things here and there, but overall works fine.\n\nNow, I'll get onto the bad of this game. The UI really needs some tweeking and reworking, in it's current state, it works with SOME flaws, the UI in general is somewhat barely useable by mouse, but fine with keyboard and controller, hoping that this is not meant to be played with just a controller (Despite me using a controller mainly). The arrows to select between settings is rather annoying to click on the mouse, but perfectly fine for a controller.\n\nSwitching settings is tedious as hell, I was trying to change my graphics settings and the screen the game was on, but the settings would either 1) change to what it was on before, 2) go back to defaults or 3) just go to some random setting I didn't select. YET AGAIN, this is another mouse & keyboard problem for me, using the controller for the settings, then applying them and they're set to what I chose, which is making me feel this game is very... "Controller-required" if that makes sense, mainly for the UI.\n\nAs much as I said "Let's ignore microtransactions", I want to bring it up just this once;\nYeah, sure there's microtransactions, but that doesn't mean dislike the game, all the items are cosmetic, they do not provide and sort of "Boost" of some kind, not saying I'll give them money for this type of system. But looking at the leveling system, it seems they give you items AKA unlocking parts of the map and the cosmetics, which I really like about a game filled with microtransactions. I will point out that you can unlock other areas of the map by skiing around or in them, which is a huge plus for unlocking areas. But this also means you are limited to certain areas for some time, getting around isn't entirely that hard though.\n\nMy overall rating without my microtransactions review: 7.5/10\nMy overall rating with my microtransactions review: 7.5/10","December 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

You can change the way your character looks and reshape the mountain to your every wish. Scroll to the bottom if you just want to read the general review :) Time for the review:\n\nGraphics:\nThis is an early access game, remember that. This game still has amazing graphics and lighting in every aspect. The game graphics are amazing. The low graphics settings ups the performance a lot but still looks very nice, and dont even get me started on how great the "very high" setting looks.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are pretty straight forward, just takes a look at the player guide to figure everything out, but becomes very simple after you get the hang of it.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game runs out really smoothly, with glitches here and there, but just remember to keep in mind that this is in PRE-ALPHA state, meaning that the game's core mechanics and gameplay are still in development. The game still has very realistic physics and skiing experience.\n\nPerformance:\nSNOW has very good perormance most of the time. The only problem you might have is that when you load a mountain when you are on a different one the game occasionally crashes (at least for me).\n\nSound:\nYes, it has been added. a lot of the other reviews are a little outdated. The sound is SO realistic for an early-access game. It sounds just like it would on the mountain.\n\nGame Size:\nThis game a healthy amount of varied features that help counter-balance the glitches in this game\n\nMultiplayer:\nSNOW has a multiplayer feature but you usually end up in lobbies with little to no people inside. Once the game goes F2P then it will likely get a lot better. This is at least how it ends up for me, but maybe not for others.\n\nMountain design:\nSNOW's mountains are very well made and have lots of ridable features. The features in the Lo2 park have full jumping/grinding capability, and the backcountry, like the observatory or summit have many obstacles such as boulders and rocks.\n\nOVERALL:\nI recommend this game to any gamers who love to play freestyle sports video games, open world games, or just love playing glitchy games for the fun of it(they'll get fixed soon, please dont fix the funny ones :3). If you don't like games that are very glitchy then i would wait until the game reaches beta. Same goes for people who dont want to pay for the game. I had a really fun time playing this and it probably wont go out of early access for a while anyways, so...................................... 9.5/10 would review again :3","December 29, 2014","true","4.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","23","30","4","0"

You gotta love every detail in this game's graphics. The panorama is actually so beautiful that it makes you loose your focus on riding itself! But then comes the downer side, riding feels great and all, very realistic, until you hit a rail or fall down and glitch your body half way through to the Matrix. I think there should be a button for sliding like in Tony Hawk for example, otherwise the rider looks just plain bored, standing all straight and stuff. Or, there actually is a button for this but I didn't find it because there is no way to check out or adjust the controls! That is kinda unacceptable, but I do understand this is a pre-alpha and I'm not gonna judge it so harshly until the whole thing's out. I can't wait to review this later when they put snowboards in it.

Not like me nvidea 600 series :S because the time of that series is really over, but its possible to play if u have other good stuff in your PC, like me 1st series of i7.\nEnough about the PC, the person model it self is a little bit stiff, but otherwise it would eat more ressources, so i take that because the scape is more important!\n\nGameplay:\nAwesome, first you will feel back in SSX with the keysettings on controller (if you played), but with improvements, because you can decide where you Grap your Ski's (ski only, Snowboard & Snowmobile will income). Playing with Keyboard feels rediciulous, but also possible and i used it enough to say that's ok (since yesterday 30.03.16) you are also able to make new keybindings :D\nGaming Modes you have are: Soloplay (with Awesome Features), Multiplayer (for the fun and showtime with friends).\nIn the Soloplay you have Events to get first cosmetic stuff, challenges (witch i could play till yet) but its like a check list of tricks u have to do and of cause u have the freeroom where u can check out the whole mountain. The Multiplayer has No Drone, No own Respawn Point, but its for cruising with friends.\n\nSo for your decision, if you like to explore Mountain's in Winter and do some Tricks, take that Simulator, because it looks like u driveing a skiing pro, never saw some compareable, exceptable is SSX for Playstation, but the difference between those two are the focuse of the Gamedeveloper, Snow is more the Simulator witch is Focused "Ride the mountain on your Own" and make it beautiful with nice Jumps. And on other Hand SSX is just more like Tony Hawk, Arcade highscoring.\nFor over 10 Years i was Every Year in Austria, Skiing / Snowboarding and for me its an Awesome game for relaxing but at the same discover new areas and try Awesome Jumps from rediculous Drops.\n\nThank you for reading my first Review\nPlz give me some Feedback,\ncritics also welcome :D","March 31","true","23.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","17","21","6","0"

Then came the infamous "cash shop" update, that also changed the existing physics to something horrendous. The controls got slippery and manouvering in the game world got tedious. And, ofcourse, the prices. Coins were way to expensive for the amount of goodies you were able to get. Right now you get 1000 coins for 10$. A full set of new equipment will net you around 1,2-1,5k. That makes 15$. Don't get me wrong, that's a lot of cash for some digital clothes. Especially for an early acces game that might never be finished...\nOn the other hand, other developers sell cosmetic goodies for up to 30$ (you know who i'm looking at here...) and people buy it.\nSo i think supporting the only company that seems to have atleast some interest in a skiing- and later on snowboarding game, no matter how long the developement will go on, is a good thing.\nAnd let's be honest... The game, at its core, is enjoyable and fun to play.

Excellent graphics, lots of maps which are very large, especially the Mountain which has more than 10 spawn points all in different areas, with each one having so much to explore than the others. You can be a pumkin head with epic shoes doing a backflip just to land it perfectly and - just in time - take a screenshot. The optimization might not be the best, so I just put it onto medium-ish settings. And I'm telling you that if I can run Titanfall on medium, I should be able to run this on high! Wait... look at that snow, all these textures! It's so good looking! Nevermind then, if you take a closer look SNOW is very strong in the category of Graphics.\n\nGraphics\nIt's a beautiful game, very impressive for a game which costs this little. You might say to yourself "Heh, that's nothing. Have you Seen GTA V?" and to that I said that I have seen it and played both games, SNOW and GTA V. GTA V is a costly game which is a finished release with some updates. SNOW is a cheaper game in earlier developement with way more snow. It's just very nice to see that you can change time ingame. I love to set it to sunrise. All those pinkish colors on the snow, those brighter shadows. It looks almost like a film or as if I'm an actual Skieer with a camera strapped to a flying bot following me. An easy 9/10.\n\nSounds\nThe sounds remind me of the Skate series. Skate is about skating, SNOW is about skiing. Both have magnificent sounds about their genres. The snow sounds realistic as if I'm cutting it up, which I sort of am in the game. The music is excellent, just, one of the best soundtracks, Burnout Paradise in front of SNOW by only a few points. The sounds are very high quality. A simple 8/10 for sounds.\n\nPayment\nYou can pay for cosmetic items. since I have recieved the Starter Edition from the kind developers, I do not know if you start with any ingame credits.  Anyway, there's definitely quite a bit over 100 items in total that you can purchase. The average itme is around 50-70 credits. Some items cost a bit more (up to 200 from what I have seen). So you could buy a lot, trust me on this. I got an epic Pumkin Hat for very cheap. It looks awesome. You can get more credits by using real-life money.\nPros vs Cons\n\nPros:\nExcellent graphics\nCheap for such a good game\nItem pricing is low enough to buy a ton for little\nUpdates are not too rare\nSounds are very impressive\n\nCons:\nNot the best optimization\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The features in the  new L02 park are fixed to work most of the time.  Grinding and jumping from rail to rail looks incredibly smooth.  Spinning off of rails and boxes is a lot of fun.  The big airs aren't super massive to where it's unbelievable anymore, but the realistic approach works so well for this type of game.\n\nThe rest of the mountain has improved much, although, I wish there was still a castle.  Maybe there is?  Maybe I haven't found it yet?   Another great feature of this game:  replayability.  I have spent hours taking alternative routes and  hitting yet another crazy line.  The mountain is huge and every nook and cranny is worth exploring.\n\nOverall, I believe this game is an incredible purchase $15.  With the fact that it will also be coming out for PS4, this game will make drastic improvements and additions within the next year (maybe months if we are lucky) including multiplayer, more mountains, new items, and snowboarding.  The ultimate ski sim.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is likes realstic sims or skiing/snowboarding.\n","October 10, 2014","true","104.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Analog sticks are absolutely essential, the M/K controls are complete sewage, but you could probably guess that.\nApart from that, the game is a really fun, fast-paced, and generally intuitive skiing sim. Combos require enough skill in timing to be genuinely satisfying to pull off, the maps are absolutely gorgeous (CryEngine ain't no slouch in the visual department) and there are very few other games that so accurately recreate the feeling of flying through a forest at breakneck pace. It makes the moments of triumph all the more fun to achieve when they're punctuated by your character inevitably crashing into a tree and his ragdoll shooting into space.\nOn that note, the game can get frustrating at times. The camera is angled slightly downward by default, and the way the maps are laid out makes it very difficult to actually see past bigger inclines. That means that if you're going for the biggest jumps (and why would you not be?) you're taking massive leaps of faith every time, and it's almost impossible to predict whether your angle is going to send you into a fluffy patch of snow for a perfect landing or into a rock so your character can make another trip into space. Meanwhile, the combo system gives out points for tricks and penalizes mistakes, but the amount it penalizes doesn't seem to have any correlation to the severity of the mistake you made. At one junction, I had just pulled off a cork 1440, earning 80 points in the process, and had landed right next to a row of trees, so I had to do a little weaving to avoid a crash. I didn't quite get out of the way of a slight incline in the ground, though, and my character tripped up on it, so I rewinded about 20 feet to turn a little harder left and avoid it, for which the game penalized me 120 points. So my net profit for one of the biggest jumps and longest combos I pulled off in the game was -40 points. I don't know how it calculates those penalties, but that formula needs an overhaul before this game finishes its Early Access run.\nTokens are ridiculously hard to earn without microtransactions, but that much was predictable just from the fact that the game has microtransactions at all. Of course they're difficult to earn without paying, that's the whole point. But what bewilders me about the microtransactions is that the only things currently available in the store are a paltry handful of challenges and cosmetic bonuses, neither of which really seem enticing when the game already comes with six maps and a bunch of unlockables. Mind you, only one of the maps that comes with the base game (Sialia) is actually an open world for exploration and the rest are just challenge runs with one or two jumps in their entirety. It's not like I expected Skyrim for the asking price, but when the game sells itself as an open-world skiing experience I would like a change of scenery every now and again. I was never a fan of jump events even back when I was on a ski team in real life, and exploring giant mountains at high speed has always been my favorite part of the sport. It's not a deal-breaker, because Sialia is a pretty good map with a lot of places to explore, but I'd definitely like the game more if it had more open areas like that. Moreover, it wouldn't make the store itself feel completely vestigial.\nSo in short, it's a little bit buggy and a little bit of a cash grab, but I can't really begrudge it because the core experience is still rock-solid as far as skiing games go. Definitely feels like an Early Access title, but it's at least got me interested enough to hold out until the full release. Make of that what you will.","February 18","true","28.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

And the potential for SNOW is immense.\n\nWhile most winter sports games are about racing or chaining together ludicrous jumps, SNOW is a more level-headed approach focused on the actual riding. Not that it doesn't feature its own share of ridiculousness: Surviving a drop from 30 meters with both your legs intact is just another day at the office. And due to the game's open approach, it's up to the player whether he does alpine skiing or just ♥♥♥♥♥ around at the half-pipe.\n\nDespite the game being in a very early stage, it already captures the sense of freedom and speed more than adequately. It's a blast just shooting downhill and dodging obstacles or finding new routes during freeriding, all while relaxing electronica is playing in the background. SNOW treats winter sports with respect and transports much of the fascination to the player.\n\nIt's needless to say that there's not much content at the moment and the little there is still requires a lot of work. Right now, a purchase would be less about your own pleasure and more about supporting the devs.\n\nWith that being said, the core of SNOW is rock-solid, which is why I believe the game deserves support. Even in its current state, SNOW offers a glimpse of greatness and I wish the team the best of luck for this project.","January 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

Unfortunately, Poppermost Productions does not seem to be a company that's able to pull this feat off.\n\nSNOW, before the most recent update (~01/04/2016) was an unpleasant but playable game. The currently only option to go is skiing - which was fairly enjoyable (albeit fairly repetitive) on the game's large mountain range. You can respawn in a manner of unlockable locations or on other players on the server which works most of the time (but can be frustrating when someone respawns on you and you lose your bearings :/)\n\nAfter this update, the playability has gone and now it's a buggy mess. If you can make it into a multiplayer game without crashing and needing to restart your PC, you're faced with countless bugs - from falling through the world to being completely overwhelmed by truly horrific hit detection and scoring.\n\nThe game is unbelievebly unstable - both in the menus that overlap and cause the game to crash and the game's reluctancy to safely Alt+Tab in and out of the game. This can kind of be explained by its 'Early Access' disclaimer, but the game has been out since 2013. SNOW feels like a severely unfinished 'My First Game' that has overrun on its budget both on time and money - as, of course, there's a fully functional store where you can buy in-game licensed products such as skis, gloves, and jackets.\n\nTL;DR: SNOW could be a great game, but its seemingly random untested patches, poorly written features and quick gameplay burnout cycle are a fatal concoction that's destined to fail.","April 2","false","9.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","4"

The visuals are nice to look at, the skiing with others can be fun, and the game-world will keep you busy for hours exploring.\n\nAs of writing this, the restrictions for this free-to-play is primarily cosmetic related, and nothing that stops you from playing really. The prices for cosmetic items aren’t unreasonable – maybe 10-15 pounds to outfit your entire outfit with whatever you want, sort of the price of a typical game. There is no pay-to-win items, as it’s simply cosmetics, and no consumables, so really once you’ve got your looks sorted, that’s likely all you’ll want to spend. Not that you really need to spend any money at all to simply play the game.\n\nSo if you want to go skiing, or maybe just want to see some snow, then SNOW delivers, with no cost involved at simply trying it for yourself.","April 24","true","23.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

With every minor update my FPS increases by 10-15, the UI (whilst still buggy) is now 'functional', and the graphical tweaks here and there have really made a difference - this game does genuinely look 'good', not spectacular, but a decent 'good' rating. The controls keep on being tweaked too; I can now compitently get down the Sialia course without having to respawn a billion times and even throw in some 'gnarly' tricks here and there. :D\n\nThat being said, the game still lacks motive. What am I supposed to be doing? You get to the bottom of each course and nothing happens. No leaderboard announcement, no objectives to meet - gravity pulls you to the bottom of the course... and that's pretty much it. There is an arbitary score counter, but it doesn't mean anything.\n\nI want the 'Closed Beta' to be big. I want a lot of people to come and play this game because it has impressed me, it's come a long way, and it deserves a bit of recognition. There's nothing else like this game on Steam.\n\nI REALLY WANT TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME, POPPERMOST; I HONESTLY, HONESTLY DO.\n\n....but I can't - £10.99 for this game is crazy. I picked it up two years ago when it was in early Alpha for about £3 (because why not?) £10.99 for Early Access to an F2P game is insane, especially when all you get is some exclusive clothes. If people are playing this game because all they want to do is play 'dress up' with a wireframe, then good for them, but it's getting to the stage where I'd like to see more in the form of 'an actual game' from SNOW and I hope the Beta will show me this.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*UPDATE 25/09/14* The 'M4' patch for this game makes it playable (lol). It's still got a long way to go, mind you. The big addition in this patch is 'sound'. Fitting drum & bass beats over the crisp sloshing and scraping of snow; it's damn good, actually.\n\nThe new map they added is completely unoptimised, so I got a steady FPS of 4 out of it, but this is an alpha, so it's to be expected.\n\nThe no. 1 addition for me in this patch is that it proves that there is progression in this game. I'm not readly to 'recommend' it just yet - it is still alpha, but I am hopefull for the next patch. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 10 months.\n\n*UPDATE 14/09/14* This game is still completely unplayable. The commands work half of the time, the procedually generated map is not 'procedually generated'; it's just completely random. There is still no sound in it (as in, the game is completely silent - even the UI), and the UI is buggy as hell.\n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW*\n\n'Currently in development' is a complete understatement. This game is the reason why the 'Early Access' scheme should have some kind've assurance that the game is even playable.\n\nThis game is not playable.\n\nCome back in a year's time, don't waste your money.","December 29, 2013","false","2.2"," 61 of 111 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","61","111","0","11"

Although the concept is awesome, and I'm really excited to play this when it's finished however - this is not a playable game just yet. Lots of bugs, lots of errors, lots of crashes.\n\nBide your time for a little longer and buy this when it becomes 100% ready to play. I see great things for this game in the future, but no, not right now.\n\n********\nUPDATE: 1 YEAR LATER (April 2015)\n\nI bit the bullet and tried playing this game again, and I must say it has improved massively since a year ago as I actually managed to ski down a slope. Some progress at last! However, it still lacks a certain oooomph. You have to pay for extras, which is absolutely ludicrous. I feel like they could have done a lot more to the game in the whole year that I have been waiting to play again. In my opinion, it's STILL not ready to be released as a full game, as it just feels unfinished to me.

That is, once you actually figure it out. The controls on the menu doesn't work for me, so I had to look them up online. WHAT GAME DOES THAT?! The game is still very buggy, with the constant skis fading through snow and your character flying after crashing(which I think is cool). Not to mention the issue where full screen will constantly mess with you if you go back to desktop, or the field of view doing the same thing between drop points. I don't care about the micro transactions. If you actually play the game for that long where you want to buy them, you may need to reconsider your life, but hey, that's all you. I personally enjoy the game for the bugs it has, as it makes the game a little enjoyable, and I love skiing and stuff, so I find this game cool. Not to mention the soundtrack, which pulls the player into the game to a great extent. However, I feel that you take too long to speed up and stuff like that. I want to be at breakfast speeds, pulling off huge, gigantic combos, not rapidly crashing, breaking my combo, which should be fixed, as many angles which look natural and ready to fly off of don't work. There also should be more mountains. I like the idea of one, huge, custom mountain, but the other tracks also need some love. I am amazed by this game, but for the average gamer, I do NOT RECCOMEND this title.\nEDIT: A major update has occured, making the game run smoother (at least for me) and added 2 new mountains. This brings up a few more issues I have with the game, or at least these areas. These areas are way too bland. There is no character or style to these new "mountains". It looks like a white floor with mountainy walls. Unlike the big, hulking mountain, which is named whatever, that one has all of these areas that at least feel a little bit special. I actually feel like I'm on a mountain. Another big issue, or suggestion I have is to add snowboards to the game. This would basically just be a cosmetic change, but it would make sense since the game is called SNOW and not SKI. Still wouldn't reccomend.","March 21, 2015","false","6.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","3"

The comments since the update have strongly put me off playing the game again.\n\nIt's a shame that this is advertised as a Free-to-Play with customization, because by the looks of it, all the customization is paid now. I probably won't be playing this again unless I see a change in optimism from people who have played the game more recently.\n\nThe game, not being released to the public for free yet, still has time to change. My advice to the devs would be to listen to the feedback being posted here, and my advice to the players would eb to make sure the devs hear your voice, because this will be vital to both your experience playing, and the developers success.","March 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","0"

And on the main non-exisiting mountain (Sialia) you have some real life spots like Chad's Gap (on which Tanner Hall 'broke' both his ankles).\nIt has a leveling system with which you can get rewards, think of events, items and credits (ingame currency)\nIf you are a skiër (or boarder, snowboards will be there in the future) you will probably really like this game.\nGood graphics\nA lot of character customization (which unfortunatly costs credits which you can buy or get by leveling)\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun (with friends)\nClothing and gear form existing brands like Faction, Head, Red Bull, Scott, Line etc.\nI flollowed SNOW since december 2013 and it has made improvements over the time, there were not that much updates but when they pushed out one, it was a big one.

I have a pc capable of running this game at 60ish fps on ultra settings so that isnt the problem, but since the last update, even on lowest settings, it is impossible to ride down a mountain without crashing into a tree or a arock because they now just randomly pop up 10m infront of you without a warning. This is really annoying because there is nothing you can do about it.\n\nFurthermore loading times have increased a lot. They have at least trippled.\n\nAnd another thing i cant stand at all are microtransactions.

The mechanics and the tricks feel decently saticfying, and the secondary focus on exploration gives an interesting side objective, because the locale for SNOW is actually quite pretty.\n\nThough, it's pretty open-ended, and there isn't much you can do at the time besides explore the mountain and practice new tricks, which has kept me interested thus far.\n\nBut on the other hand, There is an inane number of glitches, from being frozen in air on spawn, sometimes falling through the map, and, most notably, those friggin` ragdolls, are probably what earned this game a mixed review.\n\nI understand that the devs are trying to work around the core aspects of the game mechanics before improving the look of the game, and that's understandable.\n\nGive this game a shot, I think it has some potential, but it was released a little early for its own good.","January 1","true","47.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Like pushing up on the analog intending to do a frontflip results in a backflip which is confusing, and should be addressed. There aren't any rail sounds either with the snowboard. Both skiing and snowboarding have issues with uncontrollable choppiness when somehow "stuck" moving through the ground (hard to explain but you know what I'm talking about). Can't believe the snowmobile wasn't provided for free to those of us who actually paid for the game before it was made free to play. Other then that its a great game with lots of different terrain and the graphics are great.\n\nOh yeah, and adding support for Oculus Rift CV1 and Vive would be amazing.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I am limited to placing 2 drop points and this is extremely frustrating since you can't select which one to override with a new drop point, as it will always override the older one. We should have unlimited number of drop points, as well as the option to select and delete them. Also with the new update I can't land the fun and unrealistically massive jumps even when lined up properly with the ground.","May 24","true","26.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

I originally bought it in the early alpha stage, and their were many problems. The game was somewhat unplayable at times. Menus were terrible and hard to navigate, and their was only one mountain. Their was also no clear indecation how to play the game. The controls are slightly strange so if it wasn't for some steam guides i would have no idea what I was doing. That all changed when the beta came out. The menus are beutiful and easy to navigate, and the game is way more playable. Their is just one problem, the inclusion of micro-transactions. In the Alpha all the asthetic gear was free, now you have to buy them. I understand that they are aming for this to be a f2p game, but they should of added the micro-transactions when the full game was released. They didn't even give the people who payed the $10 price tag any credits to buy gear. That aside, this game is VERY FUN. Their is nothing like jumping off a giant cliff doing a 360 truck driver and crashing head first into the beautiful world. The visuals are amazing, so if you can get over the minor flaws, pick this game up now.","April 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Its gameplay has always been very good and I have had a lot of fun over the years. But the fact that items (mostly skies and jackets) are so expensive made me a little disapointed.\n\nI think that the event system could be further exploited by adding prises for getting a medal. For example, if you put the prices of the skies and other items up to a realistic price(mabey their actual retail price) you could give a few bucks for each medal earned. That way there would be a chance to obtain items whitout buying credits by being a good player and not just a rich dude. This would probably solve a bit of the crisis you have on your hands.\n\nAlso, i think that the level system you were talking about is interesting you should mabey ask the community for their favorite items and put those ones in the level system.","March 14, 2015","true","76.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Just running it feels like I'm using the slowest, jerkiest FPS ever invented. Nevermind getting actual gameplay accomplished, I simply can't get to it regardless of how low I place quality settings threshholds. Admittedly I *do* use a non-gaming dedicated system, but I *can* play a ton of games with even huger processing demands than this thing with no issues whatsoever. Mind you, all of these performance issues were forgivable given that I did buy in with the knowledge it was a work in progress, and I even touted that as such to friends who normally steer clear of anything that could even remotely sports-related. However, what put me off completely was that it's obviously a failing project and becoming nothing more than an overrated skiing version of Farmville with cr(app)y in-game purchases. No thanks, guys. I don't care if you are indie developers, if you can't make a decent game I'm going with a big cash-cow company that can.

Just be aware that things will be different than from the time of this post (3/10/15)\n\nSNOW is a game I've been keeping an eye on from time to time. As the only (and last) winter sports F2P game, it's a niche game that has a ton of potential. It plays slightly less realistic than Amped but not over-the-top as SSX/Amped, it requires a lot of time to get used to it's controls and physics.\n\nPros: A massive mountain with unique spots to go to, instantaneous loading to spots and restarts, really nice soundtrack and graphics.\n\nCons: Grinding is still a bit wonky and physics can be inconsistant at times, not too much events to do at the moment, multiplayer requires port-forwarding or use of third-party programs like Hamachi.\n\nThis game so far is a very enjoyable experience and seems to get better after every update.

And you go really slow if the hill isn't rediculously steep. But hey, it's (somewhat) the game I literally ALWAYS wanted when i was younger. Open world, snowy, and... well... open world. Honestly, I would probably play this game more if it included snowboards, but it's still fun. Did i mention that the textures will make you cringe? they aren't necessarily bad, its just that they are so flat. Apart from dat stuff, it's somewhat fun.

It was a promising early release, but this most recent update has ruined my hope for this game. I paid 15.99 for this game when I originally purchased it. Back then, all customization was free and a fun aspect of the game. Now the customization is riddled with micro transactions and I'm being told that the game I paid $16 for is soon to be released for free (and is also cheaper now then when I purchased it).\n\nAll in all it truly is a great game with a TON of potential. But the developers going money hungry is causing a turn for the worst, and I am no longer optimistic of the future of this game.

It is a freeroaming game all about skiing. You can tricks jump half way down mountains. you can do relaxeing skiing down smooth slopes, or do some hardcore skiing down extreme, rocky grades. The game works very smoothly, the players movements arn't jerky, it actually looks like how a real skiier would look. hopefully in the future players will be able to create there own maps for this. If I were to compare this game to any other, it would be like Skate 3, but skiing.

As you might suspect clothing and equipment is hard to comeby, and you can obtain alot by paying for geting ingame credits, should you do that? Well thats up to you.\n\nYou can obtain exacly 625 credits after reaching max level (which is lv.60)\nIf you're patient enough, you can spend few hours doing spins on ice jumping in place like derp, and you can hit lv 40-45 easely later on its harder obviously, but i think lv.60 requires around 400-500k points total. But if you want buy some clothes, well thats one way to do it fastest f2p way. (for some reason achivment for reaching lv60 didint kick in on my steam profile yet, hope it will later.)\n\nThe controls can be bit wonky, and tutorial where you need to do advenced grab 720* spin is pain, found my friends have huge problem with that part, i did it just becouse i was lucky after many tries, so i suggest skip tutorial and check controls to learn keys.\n\nDidint had anny issues playing game in single player mode, however it has to be said that multiplayer got own problems.\nWe tried with friends get to same server, and with limit to 12 ppl per server it can take while. And if we finaly menage to get into same server, we all get crashes at same time at some point after playing 20-30 min, so i assume the problem is with servers itself.  I think easy solution for that might be to be able host own private sessions, and i hope developers add such option in future.\n\nWe had good laughts after dying on spot, litelary dying and turning into gravestone and as fun as it is - its still glitchy to die on spot like that upon touching a stone gentle, or each other, definitly being able going through each other might be nice idea, also having ragdoll (Becouse in SP ragdoll works) would be more convinient, i hope this be changed in future too and its just temporary solution.\n\nBeside multiplayer crashes - for me - game works fine, friends also said its well optimized so might run on slower computers. It needs work, and i hope developers will work on it becouse potential for fun multiplayer game is there.","February 1","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

To start with the least annoying aspect of the game; there's no way to look at the controls. I realise this is early access, and I accept that, but it doesn't tell you what they are in the tutorial apart from "w to move forward". Really needs to either have a completed tutorial or an option to view the controls. Then we can move onto the complete lack of ingame music, and because of that, a buzzing sound is in its place. There are plenty more problems, including paying EXTRA to play with friends, and the achievement for finding Nouk not actually granting the achievement.

It's too weird in 1st person and very sensitive.\nHonestly, forget the tricks and just give us more STEEP.

A f2p mmo snow-sports game. My main interest was its odd combination of the genres along with a curiosity for how the f2p model would look. Obviously there would be cosmetics, but will there be passes to ski down certain mountains and enter tournaments? Most likely.\n\nIn its current state it feels very "in-developement" in lack of ways to describe it, which can make it feel empty at times, but I check in every now and then and its a slow but steady process of improvements. With that said, the game is solid enough to have fun with.","November 1, 2015","true","2.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

If you do not have an audio set up (ie. speakers or headphones), dont expect to run this game as it will crash when attempting to start it up. When navigating the menu, you will also find that clicking on certain options will crash your game aswell.\n\nJust as you think this game couldn't get any more awful as it progresses through its beta stage, you're way ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. This games optimization when it was first released on steam was prestine. First time I went to start it up, I could run on my settings maxed with a solid 60 frames; now, with an even better rig, this game stutters and hiccups every time I attempt to play and enjoy a 30 minute session.\n\nFor now, please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME.

Less said the better maybe. The idea behind the game, and the promise is there. However, this game is also a very good example of what's wrong with the gaming industry these days, and also how Early Access games can be so wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the whole notion of paying to test a game, is a weird one. Then paying to be able to test a future Free 2 Play game seems a bit out of order. People buying into this for 55 EUR, do need to love the game, to defend the use of money.\n\nSo, what about the actual game then, it does not have any sounds, what so ever, not placeholdersounds, not any background music, not a thing. There is a big lack of options, and while they might not want you to rebind the keys at the current moment, you should be able to look at the controls, to at least know what to click.\nThere is a tutorial in the game, that is somewhat small, and it does contain spelling mistakes - makes the game look unserious. But you won't be able to know everything to do by the tutorial.\nThere are no visual effects in the game, in the way of snow being kicked up, or traces of skis - the same skis that you find to be just as often under the snow, as up on the snow.\nThe game also have random errors, sometimes things work, sometimes they don't. This goes for the tutorial, the cabin, graphics settings.\n\nAll things are stuff that can be added before the release. However, there has not been an update in 2.5 months, and it seems more and more like a distant dream to see this game in it's full pride.\n\nThere is so much promise behind the idea - but there is no guarantee that anything will work out.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out (by the dev.response here), it does get updated more often - it just doesn't show on the store page or on the community page (high up), so you would need to check the discussions to find it.\nHowever, I will still say that this is a good example on why Early Access games are a bad thing. And that if you really want the game, wait for it to be F2P. It's not worth the price for it, at current time - sadly.\n\n-Myrvold","January 4, 2014","false","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","5"

My reason? Because SNOW markets itself as a ski MMO; the multiplayer was basically my main source of intrigue.\n\nUpon reading through the descriptions of different purchasable (packs before paying my £5.99), there was no material to suggest multiplayer wouldn't be available in the cheapest possible purchase. Imagine my disgust when the multiplayer option in-game demands more money in order to become available. What's more, there is no obvious forum where I could (if I had no self respect) through more money at SNOW to acquire multiplayer. Having quitted the game frustrated and confused, I notice that at the bottom of this page, under the "Planned Features" sub-heading, the developpers have placed 'multiplayer'; if this is their disclaimer that we are indeed paying money for a feature that isn't yet in game, then they need to do a bloody better job of getting the message across. Something like 'multiplayer not yet available' would be GREAT up at the top right where they promise us that SNOW is "alone or with friends".\n\nAnother disappointment was the promise of in-game challenges, both in multiplayer AND single-player. In fact, "Solo events and Challenges" is under the "Key Features" sub-heading, showing that it should be available already. So where are they? What challenges have been set? Even after a 1.5 hour sitting I found myself still floating around with no direction as the game doesn't appear to offer anything in-game or in the menu other than an "exclusive event" - which also demands more money.\n\nFinally, to top off my own personal experience: in the character customisation it appears to be impossible to see the player's head, which makes headgear and goggles impossible to customise, and other than the (god-awful-doesn't-even-deserve-the-name) tutorial, the only map available seems to be Sialia. Thinking this is a personal (inexplicable?) problem as other disappointed reviewers still seem to be able to get 3 maps...\n\nAll in all, SNOW had a great concept which I loved enough to dismiss the bad reviews, hoping that its coolness (*cough* MULTIPLAYER) would pay off for the lack of sound, or bad gameplay. What I didn't expect was to invest in a product which failed to deliver on aspects it Had promised, and leave me feeling cheated out of aspects it Appeared to have promised. Maybe it was down to bad marketing on Steam, but either way this "game" is not worth its selling price in its current state. Once they've fixed key issues, installed multiplayer, improved customisation (hey maybe even throw in a female skier/boarder?) then maybe it could be worth thinking about parting with £8.99. Right now, I'm frankly disgusted that I spent £5.99 on SNOW.","December 28, 2013","false","2.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

But anyway let's get on with it.\n\n-Does it play good ?SNOW is pretty much just an open world skiing simulator and just like skiing it takes a while to get into but when you do it is truly fun to just ski around exploring all of the map and finding little marks around it and an ocasional skiing pal.\n\n-Does it look good ?Yes SNOW looks amazing. It does an amazing job at using the cryengine to it's fullest. The game looks amazing and it runs incredible smoothly at it's maximum settings.\n\n-Does it sound good ?SNOW's sound track asside from the typical SFX is highly reliant on having you listen to several tracks while you play. I myself found the mix pretty decent and fitting to the action although I could clearly see this coming to personal taste.\n\n-What's the problem with it then ?There are no real problems technicly asside from the ocasional T pose ragdoll or slight collision bugs but these are really rare and tolerable I guess since it is a beta. The problem comes in the game's F2P system. It's a pure F2P system meaning you get all the game has to offer without having to pay anything (like dota2) wich means it's reliant on selling it's cosmetics and advertisement. This will really make or break the lifetime of this game and was my prime reason to write this review seeing as I would like to see this game go far and suceed.\n\n-Final Note and Score.SNOW is a game that should be experienced and I really recomend giving it a try when it's out. I'm sure the current issues will be sorted out with time and maybe some more things will get added to it like dismounting your skis so I can have incredible long snow walks or go uphill.\nSnow gets a solid 7/10.\nIt's good but it's only catering to a specific crowd so keep that in mid.","April 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toallthings/recommended/244930/","toallthings","Exzeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toallthings/","112 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(edited after recent updates and fixes)\n\n(THIS IS NOW FIXED) Like many others here in the discussions I can't complete the snowboard tutorial because the "Basic Grab" is failing to register a green tick even though you obviously grabbed the board and landed it. I did see a developer say that this would be fixed today when responding to someone else with this problem so I'm more than happy to try again later or tomorrow.\n\n(THIS IS NOW FIXED) I also can't complete the skiing tutorial, when you complete the 720 attempt and complete that section the game puts you at the beginning of the 720 tutorial again even though you did it and the game registered it with the green tick.\n\nAfter playing a little while longer it seems there are some problems with controller support. Controls will just stop working completely if I crash into something and then I can't exit unless I use the keyboard (also can't exit from the main menu with the controller, have to use the keyboard). Pausing the game while playing with the controller also doesn't work as the Pause screen strangely swipes from right to left on the screen with the assigned button so you have to use the keyboard ESC key to actually get the Pause screen. If I get to a point that I can end the session properly (default hold Y on the controller) the game will then stay on the "waiting for server" screen forever and then you have to alt-tab out of the game and close it manually. The "Exit To Desktop" option also causes the game to crash.\n\nChanging the time of day doesn't work either, hitting Right on the D pad causes the time of day to continually loop extremely quickly. It would be really nice if the time of day could be selected from the settings menu!\n\nMenus are very messy while in game, sometimes the pause screen randomly overlays while you're playing or doesn't appear when you want it to, and will overlay when you restart from a checkpoint - while your controls still function with the controller you have to hit ESC on the keyboard to remove the Pause Game overlay. The replay function is also very twitchy and often doesn't respond to commands at all.\n\nWhen the controls do work they seem sluggish and a bit clunky with the snowboarder. Over-rotation is a huge problem and there seems to be little you can do about it (if realism is the aim here then that's fine). It's also incredibly difficult to get any speed up unless you start on the edge of a cliff. Controls with the skier seem much more polished. (I did notice that snowboarding was a very recent addition so that would make sense).\n\nGrinding/sliding rails etc needs a lot of work, the "jump at the rail, turn and hope" approach is a bit messy, your rider/skiier's legs just stay straight the whole and in replays it doesn't look like they're sliding anything, just that the rail happens to be there while the rider is going through the air. I hope this is something that the devs are working on.\n\nIf there were some text/image/video-based tutorials in the menu of the home screen that would be fantastic because the play-through tutorials aren't all that thorough at the moment.\n\nso far it's a bit more frustrating than anything else. The snowboarding aspect of the game needs a lot more work, skiing is much more polished and a lot more fun so far.","May 25","false","24.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","3"

If you ski (or snowboard) yourself, you'll probably really like this game.\n\nFor SNOW, I can see massive potential. The tricks are all there. The physics are there. The ski equipment is real-world and varied. The environments (and graphics) are stunning for an indie game.\n\nI already Ski myself, so to see someone working on an outdoors winter sports game these days is a great thing to behold. Not to mention a Skiing game, for crying out loud. I haven't played a game with Skis since SSX: On Tour.\n\nThere are some negatives to this game as it's still an Early Access game.\n\nThere's NO audio. None. Zero.\nSo either play your own tunes for now (best option) or make your own sound-effects as you rip down the Mountain.\n\nThere's also currently no "true" Multiplayer at this time so we'll have to wait for that.\nYou can still join Multiplayer games but it will require some extra work on your part, and it's still rather buggy.\n\nSliding on the rails, and some jumping mechanics are bugged (Half-pipe is impossible as it stands, rails are rather slow and *sometimes* your player will stick to the ground if you jump at the crest of a hill etc)\n\nThese aren't game breakers for me since the general experience is ever-evolving and improving.\nOverall, I'm quite pleased with this game and the way the Devs have been constantly updating and listening to the fans.\n\nI feel comfortable recommending this game to people who are skiers/boarders themselves.\nPeople who are looking for either an arcade-like experience (think AMPED or SSX) or are looking for a totally complete game may be disapointed.","June 23, 2014","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No sound but it hardly subtracts from the fun you can have by skiing down mountains on and off piste. There are plenty of spawn points to choose from depending on what you feel like doing.You can just take a relaxing ski, perform tricks or just go super fast to then perform a huge air at the end.

When you get this game I would recommend you have an appreciation for the sports and kind of game at hand. What you get is a Free to Play open world Skiing game with abilities to customize your character and eventually you'll be able to build snow jumps on the side of a mountain! The Physics and Graphics are great and make for a great time spent with some random people or you can go on a solo exploration in free roam.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\nCustomizations are bought through Gold which you can either buy or earn while playing...you gain 25-35 every so often upon leveling up. I spent about $10 and could pretty much put a outfit together.\n\nThe team is currently working on the Snowboard/Snowmobile options.\n\nWith the realistic feel and the great graphics I wouldnt see any reason not to get this game at  the steep price of ZERO!\n","February 5","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have The open world aspect, and then with that is the winter sports aspectect. You'd think it would be awkward and just not work but in actuality it is the complete opposite.\n\nPlaying with my friends racing down the side of the mountain with great graphics (with much help of the Cryengine) and having a wonderful choice of music playing as we do is very fun. It also helps that since it is a open world game that it is absolutely MASSIVE and there is lots to explore. It is pretty cool to customize your own character with just about everything you can imagine with the biggest winter sports brand names.\n\nThe Hard part: Tricks. Yes you can do them but this isnt a arcade ski/snowboarding game where you press certain buttons and bam got a 1080. It takes planning and moving alot of things and making sure you're upright and propper to stick the land the trick(s) that you performed, but man is it worth it.\n\nYes, as of me writing this review it is in the dreaded early access, but I have to say, this is definately the most polished E.A. game ive played so far. Proppermost is a hell of a team and they seem to update and upgrade the game 3-4 times a week.

It's a bit more realistic than SSX (somewhat like Skate 3 vs Tony Hawk games) so don't expect an SSX clone.\n\nIn general lots of fun, open-world exploration, and stylish tricks for days.","December 27, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you get this game I would recommend you have an appreciation for the sports and kind of game at hand. What you get is a Free to Play open world Skiing game with abilities to customize your character and eventually you'll be able to build snow jumps on the side of a mountain! The Physics and Graphics are great and make for a great time spent with some random people or you can go on a solo exploration in free roam.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\nCustomizations are bought through Gold which you can either buy or earn while playing...you gain 25-35 every so often upon leveling up. I spent about $10 and could pretty much put a outfit together.\n\nThe team is currently working on the Snowboard/Snowmobile options.\n\nWith the realistic feel and the great graphics I wouldnt see any reason not to get this game at  the steep price of ZERO!\n","February 5","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedwemer/recommended/244930/","thedwemer","Markuzain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedwemer/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, this game is getting some backlash for microtransactions. Whatever, it's buying Cosmetics, and I don't see you screaming at Valve about keys and crates.\n\nNow this game has pros and cons like any other\n\nMultiplayer is currently disabled. It is April 15th 2015 at the time of this Review, so that might change by the time you read this. Much like everything else in this review.\n\nIt's ragdolls are pretty good, however sometimes you get stuck through nets or your head rolls around like an owl turning it at mach 2.\n\nThe Terrain is b-e-a-utiful. The snow isn't just some all white texture on the ground. It seems like it in the sunlight for the most part, but you see some shiny specks here and there, but when you remove sunlight, say you get under a tree , you see the discrepancies in the snow, which are done perfectly. You also leave a trail in the snow, and it looks like flattened down snow, not just parted snow. The lakes and rivers are all frozen over and you can ski on them, but if you fall from serious height onto it you eat it, so I'll allow it.\n\nOne thing this game gives you is some serious fall height. It's pretty fun, and I've seen some crazy drops in the X-Games and things like that, but I just don't know. Maybe someone with some actual skiing experience can elaborate on that one.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good. Im personally not a fan of that kind of music, but it's like a kind of trance music, I guess? It's really soothing, and fits the game perfectly, so you're immersed immediately, even if you don't like it.  It also tells you the song name when it changes.\n\nAll in all, I only have three issues with the game. The standing animation (When you aren't moving) is a bit, I don't know, stiff? It doesn't seem life-like. It seems a bit rushed, I mean, if I moved my body like that to stretch I think I'd pull something. Perhaps it should be a bit slower, smoother and more natural. It's unnatural.\n\nIssue Three is that when you go into an area, it says @ui_AreaName. Once that gets changed to just AreaName popping up on the screen it will blend perfectly.\n\nMy third issue is that the game doesn't save my sound settings. I turn the music off to talk to my friends or so I can listen to different music while I play, and every time I quit and come back, the music is back on. However, when I go into the settings, the slider is still set to off.\n\nNow for my wishes and wants, these are things the game lacks, but I don't really see them as issues. I can live without them.\n\nI wish it had some AI going around to fill the world a bit, and shops and such in the actual world to make use of the buildings you've made.\n\nI wouldn't mind some dismounted mode either, where you can just walk around. It can be a pain to try to find a spot you want to drop in from if you ski uphill from your starting point.\n\nI wish the ski lifts would actually let you hop on and ride them.\n\nOutside of that, this game is looking very good, and with more improvements you're looking at what could set some future standards.","April 15, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have The open world aspect, and then with that is the winter sports aspectect. You'd think it would be awkward and just not work but in actuality it is the complete opposite.\n\nPlaying with my friends racing down the side of the mountain with great graphics (with much help of the Cryengine) and having a wonderful choice of music playing as we do is very fun. It also helps that since it is a open world game that it is absolutely MASSIVE and there is lots to explore. It is pretty cool to customize your own character with just about everything you can imagine with the biggest winter sports brand names.\n\nThe Hard part: Tricks. Yes you can do them but this isnt a arcade ski/snowboarding game where you press certain buttons and bam got a 1080. It takes planning and moving alot of things and making sure you're upright and propper to stick the land the trick(s) that you performed, but man is it worth it.\n\nYes, as of me writing this review it is in the dreaded early access, but I have to say, this is definately the most polished E.A. game ive played so far. Proppermost is a hell of a team and they seem to update and upgrade the game 3-4 times a week. I am very happy with this game so far and can only see it getting better.\n\nTotally Recommended.","March 30, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It set my expectation so low and then immediately blew me away. The game itself has breathtaking graphics and the gameplay is the epitome of what a skiing game can be. Every element of this game is pleasing. Right down to the simplistic UI, amazing soundtrack, reliable multiplayer and only cosmetic micro transaction. Of course there are some hiccups here and there, with it being a early access game, but the developers seem to really care about their project. If you are even remotely interested in playing this masterpiece, try it! The download is relatively small and it isn't very difficult to run for most gaming systems.","January 30","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Cryengine does this game well. FPS drops occur occasionally, but overall it's not an issue.\n\nGameplay is meh. The one playable mountain as of right now looks nice, bit its hard to get down the different trails to explore the mountain more. Controls are very loose, making it hard to get where you want to be, be it jumping onto a rail or just going down a trail. Tricks are pretty basic, with some grabs and spins. Multiplayer and 'events' are being added later, and (hopefully) some of the falling through the map will stop.\n\nCustomizations is pretty good. There are a lot of options to customize your skiier, from hats and gloves to bindings and poles. You can sort by category of equipment or by brand, and a lot of major skiing companies have their equipment represented in the game.\n\nVerdict: Wait it out. If you want to support the devs, go right ahead. Just be warned that 1) This game is going to be free-to-play on release, and 2) This game is playable, but not for very long. The gameplay is fun as a time waster, but IMO not for its current pricetag","November 16, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Here's my issue: As far as I can tell you can only play as a white dude. Lots of character customization otherwise, but what's up with that? Pour all of this effort in to the game but you can only play as a guy, and a white guy at that? I mean come on now. Anyways, I'd say overall I recommend it so far based on my initial impression but yikes.","January 31","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My favorite and first game was SSX, and ever since then I have been interested in anything to do with winter sports. I knew anything the community would find and panic over was fixed in major bug fixes, which has currently reached M4. Poppermost Productions have listened to and cared about the community that makes their games.\n\nThe game itself whilst your body may turn into a mangled mutant at the current point in time is otherwise spectacularly beutiful.

I have played this game on and off for about more than a year. The environment design is nice, the character design is nice as well. The controls on an Xbox 360 controller are fluid and responsive. When I started playing this game, there was no sound at all. The music and sound effects that have been added are well done. There's a persistent leveling system; I think it's used for unlocking cosmetic items and extra spawn points on the main mountain, Sialia. It's a nice open world game with plenty of opportunity for exploration. The physics are not perfect. Sometimes I stumble on a tiny bump and break my face, and sometimes I fly off a cliff doing a ridiculous stunt and land on top of somebody's vehicle and somehow get points for a perfect landing. Multiplayer was recently added, but I have not tried it yet. Good, fun game. A nice ski sim...Just what I was expecting when I bought it. It's a nice change of pace from shooting dinosaurs. The development team is responsive and continuing to put out patches and work is coming along nicely toward the version 1.0 release.","December 14, 2015","true","18.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's still got many bugs, but as a free to play early access that only to be expected. There's a huge variety of maps, and the controls are relatively easy to get the hang of.\n\nHowever, the new update has caused my character to die whenever i get dropped off, meaning only snowboarding works as an option, which is very frustrating as skiing feels more fluid at the moment. Also, the charcter model has completely disappeared (if intentional this really detracts from the game), so my skier has is merely a floating hat and gloves, with no body.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes. its free, so why not? There are many bugs and it's certainly still in early stages, but there is huge potential here, and a finished product could be outstanding.","May 24","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The concept is smart, but it has been poorly executed with numerous technical glitches, difficult control scheme, and little overall gameplay guidence. Yes, I understand that it is a skiing game that doesent need a lot of guidence other than go down a mountain, but the lack thereof gives the game a very, VERY empty feeling. I am asking for a refund for this game, but since I got it over the 2 week limit (which I find a very discriminitory rule, especially for games that were gotten before the refund policy was enacted) its iffy. At this point, I find very little interest in the game, and hope that the game picks up and that I be proven wrong in future.","May 27","false","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","3"

Unique in it's genre. Graphics are beautiful. Played skiing only with xbox one controller. A few points to make this game even better:\n1. award points for great speed instead of stunts only.\n2. fix skiing tutorial: it's bugged in the part where you have to do a 720. Can't continue even if you complete the 720.\n3. make sure you can also break while cornering which you can also do in real life and make sure you can use the break to stand still instantly, also possible in real life.\n4. add ability to make own playlist of music.\n5. don't add ingame money which you need to buy with real money. Make us earn in game money by completing events.\n6. make a (time trial) event for every slope.\n7. make skiing over roads slow you down instead of just going the same speed as if it were snow.\n\nI hope this feedback helps!","May 25","true","7.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","5"

I had a couple of friends who told me that I shouldn't dive head first into an ever-progressing early access ski simulator. I believe that I have around 10+ hours already, which I know doesn't seem like a lot, but that's quite a few trips down the slopes in this beautiful game. I also tested some of the boundaries, and I was impressed that there are a plethora of ways to go down the mountain in every location.\n\nBrilliant game and I look forward to its future.","June 12, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

From being something where I was like ' This might be cool' to now, where I'm like 'This is so freaking cool'. I don't think words can do this game justice. As a snowboarder I am in love with mountains and the aspect of being able to ride across it, sadly I can't snowboard all the time. This game more/less makes up for that. With amazing graphics and beautiful sounds the team behind this has created what can only be described as a masterpeice.\n\n2014 :This is a real snowboarding/skiing free-roam game, worthy of the title SNOW. Graphically stunning visuals make it a must play. SNOW in my opinion is up there with 1080 degrees, for the environment that is there and the amount of customisation. The developers are also very public - anwsering questions and relaying news on the latest update.\n\nSNOW is shaping up to be a real 'must have' for skiiers or snowboarders. When the work has finally finished it will have the biggest mountain ever created to ski/board on, multiplayer, events, ski lifts, custom spawn points, replay system, halfpipe, trick parks, collectibles, and those are just the confirmed bits. All of it can be viewed here: http://snowthegame.com/2013/10/21/early-access-feedback/\n\nI really think this is worth getting - I've spent 78 hours ingame up to the 19th of May 2014, this is most likely going to increase by a long way over the upcoming years.\n\n10/10","October 10, 2013","true","123.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If you're a fan of the skate series you'll love this. This game balances realistic and super fictional skiing just right.  SNOW looks great visually, but I wish there were more snow particle effects. I have nothing bad to say about the controls, they're just fine the way they are. If you decide to try this game out remember it's still early access and there's still that has to be added to the game.\n\nI'll edit this review with some more information later.\n\nTo all the early access player complaining about the new update.\n\nYou payed for alpha acess and the alpha items, not for the rest of the clothing options. They made it pretty clear thats what you would receive , and you recieved it. Nothing more, nothing less. They do care about the people who funded their work, they gave us more than two weeks to play before anyone else could. We all knew it would be F2P and they'd have to make money somehow. And besides, all this 'Exclusive Content' is purely cosmetic, it doesn't affect gameplay at all. If you don't want to spend money buying the gear, wait untill they add their progress system. You'll be able to unlock stuff that way. They respond to A LOT of the questions and feedback given by the community, and take them into account.

I understand it's in an early alpha stage, but unless you buy the most expensive version you literally only get a few trails to ride on one section of the mountain.\n\nAdditionally, there's no way to rebind controls, the tutorial only explains how to move forward with KB+M controls, and overall the game feels lacking. I know more content will come, but it's laughable that they'd offer something with no sound this early for a fairly high price.\n\nFor the time being, I can't recommend this game. Maybe I'll edit it once more patches and updates come through, but for now it remains incredibly underdeveloped.","December 28, 2013","false","7.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's early access, so you know what to expect.\n\nSecond, this is going to be a F2P game, and although many people argue that paying now for a F2P game is not smart, I have to disagree there. With buying, you're making sure that it doesn't need to be milked out as much as Pay2Win games. And, developers need to eat as well.\n\nHaving said that, the game is actually quite enjoyable. I loved the first person camera mode, and I can only imagine how great it'll be when I buy an Oculus Rift (Which it supports).\nIn this state, all you can do is set up your graphics settings, and ski on this huge-♥♥♥ mountain. It is bigger than expected. If you buy any of the 2 tiers, you can access Multiplayer right away, if you choose for the cheapest tier, you'll have to wait a little longer. But looking on their websites, and the upcoming features, made me excited.

People that are talking crap about this game have no idea how much potential this game already has and beats any snwboarding/skiing game out there for any console. I don't even Ski and I love it already, once snowboarding is released I will be in heaven.\n\nI got the tester pack for $15 and it really isn't that much money to put out a game for a game that's in alpha. Also you have to keep in mind there is a small team of developers (who are also probably skiers and snowboarders) that need money to help further develop this game.\n\nThe ability to freeze the game and make your own screenshot's from your jumps/tricks is awesome. I cannot wait until the full potential of this game is released.\n\nI just have to point out all of the people that are so angry they paid $10 or $20 on a game thats in ALPHA that has a team of less than 10 developers. This isn't some big game company making another Call of Duty. They can't afford a team of 10-20+ QUALIFIED testers to come in and debug there game in a month+ and have it ready to go. An alpha will last for quite some time. Then there will be a BETA where there will STILL be bugs.\n\nWhat are you are paying for are is early access and bug testing. Everything that says that is currently available in the game (talking to those of you complaining about no sound when it was clearly stated there is NO SOUND yet) is clearly stated on here, if you can't read that and understand what ALPHA means, you're an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.","December 29, 2013","true","9.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

PC has never gotten a skiing/snowboarding game ever and this game is the perfect way to start.\n\nGraphics:\nAbsolutely beautiful. Best graphics I have seen in a very long time and it is also coded amazingly. I can run the game on Ultra at 60 fps and my computer really isn't that good.\n\nMovements:\nAs of right now, you can tell the movements they have now are place holders. The body is very stiff and moves more like a robot. You can tell by the movements that the game is still in early beta. Obviously the ragdoll is terrible, but none the less is really funny waatching your guy flop down the hill with a few broken bones and a twisted neck.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\nAdrian Blood.. What can I say? The music is amazing. It's the perfect feel of chill and EDM. If I was to go skiing one day, this will be the music I listen to. The sounds are high quality and match with the game very well.\n\nMaps:\nPerfectly designed. The most of the maps on the game are based off of real places.\n\nWhat I Would Like To See:\nSnowboards! We know they are coming and it will be awesome when they come.\nMap Creator! It would be awesome making your own tracks and having races on the tracks you make with your friends.\nCustom Graphics! Would be so cool to make your own clothing and make your own designs on the skis.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nHELL YEAH!\nIt's free to play! If you want to buy clothing and other in game stuff, better fork out some big bucks because the cheapest thing is $5 for 500 in game coins that can buy you a jacket, pants, gloves, and a mask. None the less, all the tracks are free and its free to play multiplayer.\n\nCons:\nSuper expensive and hard to earn coins.\n(I got for leveling up to level 5 10 coins. 10 coins can't buy me anything in the game. The cheapest thing in the game is 89 coins and its a damn party hat.)\n\nSummary:\nSuper fun! Great graphics! Great music! HUNDREDS of items to choose from!

To start, I think this game is a very good start to what could potentially turn into the best free game on steam.  I will now do a pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\n-graphics are very good for early stage\n-Rewind mechanic lets you fix mistakes easily if you want to hit that jump perfectly\n-though there are microtransactions, they are limited to asthetic only, and if this business model holds true I will be very happy\n-very interesting and fun map design (Main mountainous map)\n-Good frame rate/no frame dropping even at high speed (I am on an alienware 13 laptop)\n\n\nCons:\n-in air controls can sometime feel clunky\n-needs a camera control feature so you can look around the enivironment\n-skiier is sometimes stuck in revers, and is hard to turn around\n-multiplayer needs more way to interact with other players\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a skiing game than you should be extremely excited for this one to release in full.  It has the chance to become a fantastic game.  What the devs need to work on is the controls and multiplayer, but it is understandable that these wouldn't be perfect as the game is clearly still in early development.  I would highly recommend this game to most people, especially those in the Northeast, like me, who have had no snow and need their skiing itch to be statisfied.  So far this game has helped me to keep my mind off the dissapointing lack of snow this winter.","December 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of the most legit ski games I have played. I am a snowboarder in person, but that doesnt take anything away from my gameplay experience. One of the main reasons I love this game so much is how active the developers are. They dont F*ck around, they respond to the community, and they seem to add enough content with every update to keep me interested (unlike dayz).\n\nPros\nGreat physics (slightly glitchy at times, but its early access)\nMultiplayer\nBeautiful map\nAmazing jumps, and many many jumps you have yet to find\n\nCons\nThey have not added snowboarding :(\nThe game is called "SNOW" but it seems only ski based\nThe trails your skiis leave are a little bit glitchy\n\nOverall, great game and you should definately buy it to support the developers.\n","November 28, 2015","true","92.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is incredible, but noticably unfinished, but that's ok. This game, being in beta, obviously has a lot of quirks that need to be ironed out, yet in the state its in, is still an interesting and fun game. I'll try to update this review as I play some more, and as updates come in, but as a first impression, here's what I have:\n- The vastness of the mountain is incredible: So far I've been able to access one mountain with 4 "sides", with their own parks and trails. The size and structure of the mountain is very large, and if and when more are implemented, will give this game more than enough variety.\n- The character customization is really cool: You have a large selection of real life gear, from head to toe. Each piece costs credits, which you can buy with real money, but is really cool nonetheless. Having microtransactions for cosmetic items is a great way to generate revenue in a free to play game.\n- The tricks are cool, but there are quirks: I'm still learning how to maneuver well, but the tricks are generally well done. Airs are decently well timed, although you do pretty much land anything as long as you're not upside down. The rail slides are pretty broken to be honest, there's no real feedback that you've done a railslide, and hopping on to rails isn't exactly satisfying.\n\nOverall, the game is alot of fun in its current state and I'm super excited to see how it's going to look once all the quirks are ironed out.","December 19, 2015","true","61.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I haven't been playing for long. I just saw it for it's silly ragdolls. But as I played, I saw something more beautiful. As I sped down slopes and looked around at the landscape. I was left in shock to it's beauty. I eventually learnt how to pull of amazing flips and stunts! I would dash down hills, mountains, forests, cliff faces. And do some wacky things. This game feels awesome, everyone should give it a try.\n\nThough this game isn't perfect. Our lovely developers thought it would be a good idea to put a high price on cosmetics! I would like to customize my character to as an acurate version of me in my snow gear, as possible! But Because I don't want to blow off 20 dollars, No thankyou! It would be much better if we got credits as we leveled up! Or if every run we did, we would get points for it! I get you guys need money, but this isn't a good way to do it! Also, you guys have us to buy events... And the only reason anyone would buy an event is because the item you get for getting Gold on it. I'm pretty sure you can buy the same item for less... In most cases.\n\n\nThat was the only complaints I had. 'Tis a fun game. Try it some time!

PC has never gotten a skiing/snowboarding game ever and this game is the perfect way to start.\n\nGraphics:\nAbsolutely beautiful. Best graphics I have seen in a very long time and it is also coded amazingly. I can run the game on Ultra at 60 fps and my computer really isn't that good.\n\nMovements:\nAs of right now, you can tell the movements they have now are place holders. The body is very stiff and moves more like a robot. You can tell by the movements that the game is still in early beta. Obviously the ragdoll is terrible, but none the less is really funny waatching your guy flop down the hill with a few broken bones and a twisted neck.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\nAdrian Blood.. What can I say? The music is amazing. It's the perfect feel of chill and EDM. If I was to go skiing one day, this will be the music I listen to. The sounds are high quality and match with the game very well.\n\nMaps:\nPerfectly designed. The most of the maps on the game are based off of real places.\n\nWhat I Would Like To See:\nSnowboards! We know they are coming and it will be awesome when they come.\nMap Creator! It would be awesome making your own tracks and having races on the tracks you make with your friends.\nCustom Graphics! Would be so cool to make your own clothing and make your own designs on the skis.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nHELL YEAH!\nIt's free to play! If you want to buy clothing and other in game stuff, better fork out some big bucks because the cheapest thing is $5 for 500 in game coins that can buy you a jacket, pants, gloves, and a mask. None the less, all the tracks are free and its free to play multiplayer.\n\nCons:\nSuper expensive and hard to earn coins.\n(I got for leveling up to level 5 10 coins. 10 coins can't buy me anything in the game. The cheapest thing in the game is 89 coins and its a damn party hat.)\n\nSummary:\nSuper fun! Great graphics! Great music! HUNDREDS of items to choose from! Can't buy ♥♥♥♥!\n\nI RECOMMEND!","February 5","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Lulz @ skiholes who didnt like my review because of snowboard comments\n\n\n~OPEN BETA UPDATE~\n\nAfter a rough start the devs pumped out multiple hotfixes within a day and have the game up and running. definately worth checking out.\n\nalso remember to harass the devs to add snowboarding like they said they were going to.\n\n\n\n\n~WRITTEN DURING CLOSED BETA~\n\nIn a world where realistic extreme sports games are no more, especially on PC, SNOW is a light in the darkness. Thats not to say its without its problems though.\n\nPros\n-Physics. I've worked as a liftie in Vt and can say the feel of being on snow/rails/boxes is all solid and in line with really cruising down a mountain\n-Optional First Person Mode. Why havent more extreme sports games done first person? there arent words to describe hitting a double cork 1080 in first person.\n-Open Mountain. you literally have accesss to the ENTIRE mountain. want trails? they are there. want a park? there are a few. want backcountry, go nuts.\n-Ragdoll Bails. While these arent the most realistic animations in the world, they will leave you cringing and laughing after you smash a rock at speed\n\nCons\n-No Snowboarding. This is a big one for me. when this game was on kickstarter the devs were promising snowboarding was going to be added as soon as the basics of skiing were in. this has not happened and there has been no news to hint that it is still planned. it leaves the mountains feeling like those douchey ski only resorts. wheres the boarder love?\n-rough multiplayer. the devs announced that they will be upgrading thier servers when the game goes to open beta. this is very much needed as a random lag spike can kill an amazing run down the mountain or ruin a nice freeroam follow the leader session\n-microtransactions. there are a lot of them. essentially everything to customize your rider costs real money (not much compared to some other games though) there also appears to be some "events" that you buy into with real money (havent tried these so i cant speak to much on them)\n-wierd snow behavior. i know i know, its a beta. but sometimes snow will magically leave a trail in the air behind you when you jump, and it stays that way even on your next run down the mountain, this isnt a major issue but can cause issues lining up jumps and grinds in the parks.\n\nOverall: is SNOW worth it?\nif you have been craving some realistic extreme sports or if you are a mountain lifer then this game is definately for you. if you like exploring in a relaxing setting this game is probably for you. if you want somethinglike tony hawks pro skater on skis, you should stay far far away.","January 14","true","30.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I will just be saying how things are (for me and a lot of other people, not everyone).\n\nFirst off, SNOW is a lot of fun, singleplayer and (sometimes) multiplayer are great and the game has a lot of potential and it would be an amazing game if only...\n\nIt worked, which it kinda doesn't at the moment.\n\nThe game is constantly crashing (for me and a couple of others who tried out the game).\n\nMultiplayer is a mess.All the servers are mostly full because of the 12 players cap and they will always display that they have over 300+ ping when they actually don't. When hovering over someone's name in the spawnmenu the game will put a camera on them like you're spectating them. If you scroll through the players (unintetionally) the camera will glitch out and it might crash your game because the FPS drops to 0-2. Sometimes when you spawn, there will be random invisible walls right infront of you completely blocking your movement and it takes away all your points if you jump because of 'bad landing'. Sometimes the walls are placed a bit infront of you so after you gained some speed you instantly crash because of the god damn wall. Sometimes when other players spawn on you, it will make you crash instantly.\n\nThese are the multiplayer problems I'm having, some might have the same, some might not.\n\nSingleplayer/EventsSingleplayer is a lot better than multiplayer in terms of the game working, but it gets easily boring skiing around by yourself. So you either jump into Multiplayer, or you go do some Events! (Since leveling up gives you no credits at all and you can unlock a yellow outfit through the events that are free. Now I warn you, if you haven't played the game or Events, this will frustrate the living **** out of you. Some Events are fairly easy, and some will make you rip your hair out. I'm not going to get into a lot of detail about this, but it kinda sucks that the events don't give you credits so you can buy your own gear instead of a boring yellow outfit.\n\nWith all that said, the game is still worth downloading since it's free and it is fun, when it works.\n\nLike I said, I know this is a free to play beta and you can't expect too much from it just yet. I know the game will improve and I am definitely looking forwards to it.\nThat's all I'm going to write for now..","February 5","false","35.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I may only have .6 hours on record, but that's all I need to tell you this game is not worth it, at least not in its current state.

Just seriously, so many glitches I encounter, making me not getting to a save point, losing all of my points... This game isn't really something that you spend tons and tons of time on, as you will get frustrated from the glitches. Sometimes when I jump off, my character freezes and cannot do a command except for basic ones like, turning and really nothing else. This could actually be fixed by wiping out, but most of the time as I try, it doesn't happen. Only get this game if you have tolerance for its glitches. I can see that you might be saying; "IT WAS MADE IN OCT 2013!" Well, its 3 years from then, and they should've already fixed them. It is also really hard to level up in the game too, which makes buying new gear and making it easier, requiring for 10s of hours. Only get it if you like to just play around, not going for a highscore or something, as I know a glitch will mess you up. Also, I can see that they have been doing some fixes, but FOR ME it says the last update a month ago FOR ME. And they have pretty close updates too. So really, they probably don't know how to fix what is happening to me (and us) meaning they have a bad team. No offense. I have also heard that in MAY 2016 it still is in BETA after 3 years. I don't see any potential in the game, as other devs work harder than them, releasing the out-of-BETA version out in 3 months to 2 years MAX. Only buy this game if you just do it in your freetime, not to break your friend's highscore, as the glitches will mess you up.","May 9","false","3.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It is broken and unplayable. Yes, you can say the game is in it's early alpha stages and I should expect bugs and general annoying gameplay. But when the developers announced that the game would be ready by Febuary of this year back in October of last and it isn't, well that just shows how little care they have for the game.\n\nI bought into the this game as the original discription that was on Steam at the first release of this half arsed early access, was snowboarding. At first they never pointed out that the snowboarding would be implimented later on in the game's life. All that was stated in the original discription is that the game was in early alpha and that it had some issues.\n\nI am sick and tired of developers throwing their game onto Steam as an "early access". It is terrible marketing and has already made me want to not play the game when it is fully released. If that ever happens! I shall remind you, this game was supposed to release as a free to play in Feb. It is no April and the game is yet to be released.\n\nIf you are in need of money as a developer just to finish your game. Do not release it as an early access. Hype the game up, get better funding and make sure your target market knows about the game. I would have had no idea about this game as, from what I know, it has only been marketed on Steam.\n\nGet your ♥♥♥♥ together, developers! Stop releaseing paid, half arsed early access games with no guaranty that the game is even going to be release on time or even at all. I invested in this game because I thought at least one developer may get it right, but no. Just like the majority, they screw up and seem to have little to no care about the game itself and only the money.\n\nNow, after that rant, I can say some good things about this game. The graphics are beautiful. They really give the feeling of gliding through soft powder on a beautiful day. Or at least it does when it actually lets you spawn. The character customisation is actually good, with a wide range of branded products to chose from. Like K2 and Vokl. The mountain looks real and outstanding, especially in the highest settings. The game seems to run well with very little hiccups, even maxed out too.\n\nI honestly want to see this game succeed in a big way. But the way it is now and the way the developers failed to deliver a Febuary launch just take hope away. I am truly wanting a good snowboard/skiing sim to play as none that I have sunk any time or effort into have been rewarding. Games like Shaun White Snowboarding and Stoked are good but not outstanding. If the developers are able to pull all of this out of the bag, even with all the issues that it shouldn't have this far into the development of the game, I will recomend it. But right now, with all the issues and my personal hatred for early access game at this time, I can not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nI have hope for this game eventually turning out fantastic. But for now, it is slim. Every month I will pop back onto the game and give another test. And each time, I will edit this review.

The recently implemented new mechanics are not as good as they could be, but the developers already told us fixes are coming with the 0.5.1 patch.\nWell... After the closed beta update, 0.5.0, people are whining a lot about the new changes. Especially because they can't get their cosmetic items (for free!), which does absolutely nothing, besides making you look a little unique. You can still ride all the mountains, try out all the events, and you're certainly not limited by any micro-transactions gameplay-wise. You can use all the grabs, ride just as fast, and compete in just as many events as you want to - FOR FREE!\n\nThis is what I would like to see in EVERY Free-to-Play game. Where you ONLY have to (optionally) pay for cosmetic items. Here in SNOW, as it is in 0.5.0, you can't pay to get BETTER. You can only look slightly 'cooler'.\n\nOn a whole 'nother note, here's a few quotes by a few developers from Poppermost, the company who makes the game SNOW, regarding the new shop and the new mechanics:\n1. Asurao: "We have no plans to charge you for new levels/mountains. We want everyone to be able to ride together whether they've spent money or not. This is core to the game." and "There will be many ways to earn credits in the future".\n(>>Source<<)\n\n2. Rubadubdub!: "I can ensure you that there will be other ways of getting new gear in the future, so you'll still be able to get pretty good gear just like in TF2, CS: GO etc."\n(>>Source<<)\n\n3. Asurao: "As we continue working towards Open Beta (0.6.0) we will be adding player progression (a leveling system) so that you can earn items without having to buy them"\n>>Source<<\n\n4. Asurao: "I agree that the break-turn isn't working as intended and overall speed management feels very sporadic. We're looking into this and will make improvements in future updates."\n(>>Source<<)","March 13, 2015","true","62.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

They don't call it "early access game" for nothing. That means they are still in development of the product. Here I ski better than I do in real life! Pretty cool huh? But I have loads of fun  seeing how I can wipeout without hurting myself...hahaha.  But seriously, The graphics are solid, the gameplay is good as well, but could use some tweeking to improve controller responsiveness...there is a slight delay whenever I hit a button, on my logitech 310 controller. No big deal unless the issue is not addressed. I purchased access to this game a week ago, and I have had a blast. Again, my expectations are high, but not insanely high because this is not a final product. So far so good guys...keep up the good work.\n\nFor those pondering purchase of this game...if you like sports on PC this is a cool product to have in your library. Do not expect it to be up to 2K's NBA 2K15 quality. But for what it is work the price tag of $10 is a small price to pay for a game you will come back to time and time again to blow off some steam and have a lot of laughs.","March 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is full of backs starting from the menu and finishing inside the mountains. A lot of crashes for no actual reason. And another small problem is all these microtransactions. You cant buy even a new shirt without real money.\n\nBUT\n\nThis game has a great potential and can become a really successful game if the devs make it right. Graphics looks great , gameplay with some improvements can become even greater, maps are wonderful , music is cool (considering some1 is using it) and this minimalistic menu style is really cool.\n\nWhat needs to be done? I believe that devs must go from a free to play game with microtransactions to a priced game with no microtransactions. If they keep the game like that they have a 90% chance to fail hard. But if they fix the bugs(that they will fix , dont forget its early access) and make it a game you actually buy and then you are good to go then they will have a great success in my opinion.\n\nAfter all its a great idea so I will rate with 7.5/10.

I tried this game in early alpha and it wouldnt even launch, now it runs ok other than every other time I try to change mountain the game crashes. My advice? save your time on this one, it will only frustrate you.

It's a fun lil snowboarding game that almost reminds me of the SSX and Amped: Freestyle that I played back when I did the console thing. It's just there's a lotta bugs, the wipeouts are hilariouslyyyy bad (which might even convince some to play), the business model is a lil.... restrictive (though i understand they gotta make money to continue production). I'd honestly give this game a Thumbs Up if there wasn't a bug that happened to me every 20 minutes where my skiier would just freeze in animation and all my controls freeze up except steering so i look like a gmod prop hunt stiffy old man flying down a hill.

The mountain is beautiful and it is extremely apparent that the Devs are actually putting time and effort into this game. It has everything one could want from an open world skiing (and eventaully boarding) game.

Kind of annoying if I just want to restart my run.\n- I can't actually see my skier in the customization menu when I'm in it, so if I select something I have to actually hit the mountain to see what it looks like.\n- Collision models are a little off. The front half of the skis don't even seem to have a collision body, and just go right through rails.\n- Jumping feels sluggish, and I sometimes struggle to get enough air not to knuckle on the jumps.\n- The pushing animation is very jerky and abrupt. I'd like to see it so that holding W produces a nice, fluent, repeating pushing motion so you don't have to continually press W to gain speed.\n- I think the turn speed could be increased a little. Seems a little wide for my experience.\n- A help menu would be very beneficially, as I haven't fully figured out all the controls yet.\n\nI'm still in love with this game. I understand it's in early alpha and would be more than happy to contribute to the development process in any way possible. I hope the devs read this review, because they have my eternal thanks and respect.","January 5, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Spacebase DF-9 had great potential. The War Z could have had great potential. "Potential" in early access games is meaningless. And all the praise of this game is about its "great potential"\n2. the options menu is sub-par at best, and incompetent at worst. The natural selection for motion blur is "high", and when you set it to "off", it makes no damn difference what so ever. (I'd like to thank my headache to the devs)\n3. 3 maps, one of them a small freestyle slope that lasts less than 30 seconds, is not worth my time.\n4. This game has some of the weirdest graphical bugs, with random shadow blocks darting everywhere, when you look in reverse your ski poles seem to for some type of trans-dimensional-portal-mirror-thing, when you ski on ice even once you've jumped off the ice, you still throw up ice grinding effects\n5. all the recent positive reviews of the game I can find  are simple one-sentence affairs, saying stupid things such as "this game is amazing and now there is even sound." and "your gonna love it !\nFirst pirson requires some 1337 skills but is amazing fun once matered like a kinkykizz."\nThis sounds pretty dodgy to me, as if the dev is astroturfing their own reviews, and I don't trust it for a second.\n6. This game does not require "1337 skills" (who above the age of 12 even says that any more???). In fact its a fairly basic and forgiving simulator, that will snap you back on track even after some fairly major screw-ups.\n7. the preview photos you're seeing look very little like the actual game itself. If it did look like them, this might actually be a fun little "scenery with added skiing" simulator.\n\nConclusion: this is a sub-par skiing simulator,  with dodgy physics, standard graphics with stupid bugs, limited playability, and no real objective.\n\nThis game fails to satisfy on a number of levels, and being "early access" (whatever that bloody means any more) is no excuse.","February 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunatly this is a purchase I very much regret for now.\nWHile it looks and plays fine in 2D for an Alpha product, when you enable 3D via the Oculas Rift I found the game unplayable. This is the only time i've found the experience better in 2D than in 3D through the rift.\nGeneral complaints are:\nLow Framerate (Even when all settings are set to low)\nVery Flat "3D" objects. Such as Trees and background. (Looks like a flat picture as the background)\nDistancing issue with objects (The moon appears about 4 meters away from your head and closer than other objects)\nVery sparse amount of 3D objects so you get a very poor 3D feel.\nView disorientating. (If your character is infront of your view. Head tracking does not work correctly) When in "First Person" any character movement affects your view.\nOverall I would not recommend this game for use with the Oculas Rift as its a disappointing experience. If this changes, im happy to update this review.","February 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

However, at the time of writting the controls are not rebindable and I dont really know the controls. Regardless, this game has huge potential. The mountain is beautiful and it is extremely apparent that the Devs are actually putting time and effort into this game. It has everything one could want from an open world skiing (and eventaully boarding) game. You can smash some tricks in the terrain park, shred some knar in the various backcountries, and throw yourself off of giant dams after spending half an hour bunny hopping to the ledge on concrete.","March 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game ran great with maxed settings  on my overclocked r9 390 without any stuttering. I was met with my first bug in the tutorial when it asked me to preform a trick and no matter what i did it wouldnt register at all so i quit the tutorial with the basics in mind and set out the open mountains.... except i apperantly scrolled through the drop selection menu too fast and crashed my game so that my screen was covered in black nothingness so i had to reboot my pc. Once i rebooted and scrolled through the drops at a snails pace i got to skiing. It was great doing tricks, flying through the air like a spinning top, crashing and watching the halarious glitched out wipe outs untill after every rock and rewind my character would do weird things like get stuck in t-pose or go down the mountains unable to jump brake or move at some points. My final thoughts are if your just there for the scenery or want to spend real money on ingame skins or clothing and dont mind the sometimes gamebreaking glitches then this is the game for you. But if you want to ski arround without having to troubleshoot some weird bug every few minutes than i would reccomend you get Wii Ski Resort and play that because that is better than this hunk of yellow SNOW.","February 15","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

High quality textures and a very large draw distance.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys skiing. This game has a big learning curve but it's really fun and has a very high replay value. (It's really hard to land tricks perfectly) The tutorial is garbage, I didn't learn anything in it and I never passed the third part where you have to land a 720 spinning jump, I don't know the button combinations. The best way is to free-play on the mountain.\n\nThere are some bugs but they aren't game breaking. Sometimes I hit something and I crash and on the next run I hit the same object but it just affects my score instead of having me go back.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and is already expanse. I wish that the lifts were operational and you could ride them. I also wish that there was a map because I've gotten lost quite a few times.\n\nTL;DR = Don't buy unless you are a skiing enthusiast, just wait until it’s f2p\n","January 6","true","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It can be the PC version of a good open world winter action sport game. The music in the game is also decent, i found that to be one of the pros of the game. However that said, this game is just anoying in every turn. The controls are really bad. It feels unnatural and uncontrolleble, and i can't figure out why they made the controls so weird for PC. We got a mouse, it's not that difficult to make use of it in a better way than what they have. For a game that sells on good physics, it isn't that good. it's glitching and going crazy all the time. There are little to non ragdolls effects. I mean come on, the ragdoll effect is what makes a game like this really fun, and it's just not there. You feel really slow when trying to gain speed aswell. Often i found myself trying to get as much speed as possible, then realize i didn't get enough for a high jump. There are anoying menus all over the place that dosn't help you. It just takes up time and makes you wonder why they made it like that. If you fail a part of a quest, do they ask if you want to restart the part of the quest? Nope, they let you ride to the finish line knowing that you can't complete it all without restarting everything. I can also smell micro transaction a mile away in the finished product.\n\nAnd the game isn't stable, but hey. It's beta so that's expected.\nFor a free game in beta that got potentional, i would give it 5/10 for now. They need a lot of fixing to make this a good game in my opinion.","January 28","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's just nothing like plowing through some fresh powder or hitting a 540 Corkscrew in first person.\n\nOnly downside is you basically NEED some sort of controller to play it (mouse and keyboard ain't going to cut it) but they're pretty cheap and easy to find.","January 27","true","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I think with continued development of more mountains and more events it will be super solid. Its got good mechanics, easy to pick up but hard to master. Like all early access games it has its moments. Grinding right now is by far the most underwhelming thing in the game but the last few updates have been making it a lot better. Its no Tony Hawk "Press X to do tricks" its more like the Skate games where you actually had to do some prep work for your tricks, like aligning your trajectories and landing properly or death. Also, to go along with the Skate games the massive and brutal crashes make this game a total riot. Ragdolling down the mountain in this game is as funny as Goat Simulator but without the "why am I even playing this?" vibe. Hoping when all is said and done that snowboarding and snowmobiles are well executed and I would love to see a mountain editor.

The game ran great with maxed settings  on my overclocked r9 390 without any stuttering. I was met with my first bug in the tutorial when it asked me to preform a trick and no matter what i did it wouldnt register at all so i quit the tutorial with the basics in mind and set out the open mountains.... except i apperantly scrolled through the drop selection menu too fast and crashed my game so that my screen was covered in black nothingness so i had to reboot my pc. Once i rebooted and scrolled through the drops at a snails pace i got to skiing. It was great doing tricks, flying through the air like a spinning top, crashing and watching the halarious glitched out wipe outs untill after every rock and rewind my character would do weird things like get stuck in t-pose or go down the mountains unable to jump brake or move at some points. My final thoughts are if your just there for the scenery or want to spend real money on ingame skins or clothing and dont mind the sometimes gamebreaking glitches then this is the game for you. But if you want to ski arround without having to troubleshoot some weird bug every few minutes than i would reccomend you get Wii Ski Resort and play that because that is better than this hunk of yellow SNOW.","February 15","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But...\n\nSo far, this game still isn't at par with most simulator type skiing\snowboarding games that have already been on the market.  The character is stiff, weightless, and too obviously procedurally driven.  It looks and feels like you are controlling the skiis not the rider.  The controls are very binary when they should take advantage of modern analog controllers. For instance, regardless if you tap the steering controls or hold, the character drops right into the extremity of the turning poses.  Same for grabs and any other feedback coming from the character.\n\nThere is no sense of speed unless you are in the trees. The levels feel wide open, flat, and tricking opportunities are sparse. The jumps in the parks feel dauntingly huge and are seemingly too big for the lack of speed even at max speed.   The physics feel just as binary as the controls and don't work well with the level design metrics for the terrain or park obstacles.  Rails riding is quirky and the rider looks dorky. Halfpipe riding is frustrating and it's nearly impossible to get any speed\air.  The radgoll is just broken, and bailing in any game other than EA Skate isn't fun. It's punishing and wastes a players time.\n\nThe best parts of this game are the jump on the right thumbstick (thank you EA Skate) when it works and doesn't give you an awkward emote instead. As well, a huge plus is having the generous ability to customize the ingame camera.\n\nThis game has a long way to go before Beta.","September 14, 2015","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The skiing is really fun and visceral, and doing tricks for points is very fun albeit conventional. There is no pay to win garbage, everything in the game is available to you and the levelling system is generous. Microtransactions only give you a visual change and do not affect the gameplay. You can do tricks and explore snowy mountains and it's really fun to land risky moves and tricks which is pretty much what the game is about.\n\nIt feels a bit incomplete, but it's still in early access and it's free, so the fun trade-off is a no brainer. The controls are a bit wonky, but get easier as you go along. There is multiplayer and ♥♥♥♥ing around on black-diamond mountains is really fun.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a very minimal style with a calming soundtrack. It really does feel like it is the 'Forza' of skiing, as the visuals coupled with the white smooth aesthetic of the game really sort of melt together to create something fresh and interesting. The snow in the game actually has prints and you can make trails with your skiis which results in some funny little glitches (like scraping an entire mountain's worth of snow off while you descend sideways, like it's a butter knife).\n\nThe ragdoll weight needs some work, and the game is slightly demanding. However, the developers are very consistent with their updates and each time I find it smoother and better looking as I keep playing.

Even with a good pc that I have it still seemed underwater. Which leads me to the gameplay. Can I get some crack for my snowboarder? I feel like I could walk backwards in skiis faster than the speed you have on the slopes, you just don't get enough to build up for a jump. Approacing a ramp or rail the jump doesn't seem to work in relation to where your location is.  Looking for that burst to leap onto the rail it doesn't work. The tutorial is busted. I get to where you have to preform basic grabs and a 360. Everything works fine but checking off the basic grab results in reset after reset.

If you get used to the controls there is nothing that can stop you from stomping awesome tricks. The landscape looks awesome and is also very realistic. All in all I rate this game 95/100.

The skiing is really fun and visceral, and doing tricks for points is very fun albeit conventional. There is no pay to win garbage, everything in the game is available to you and the levelling system is generous. Microtransactions only give you a visual change and do not affect the gameplay. You can do tricks and explore snowy mountains and it's really fun to land risky moves and tricks which is pretty much what the game is about.\n\nIt feels a bit incomplete, but it's still in early access and it's free, so the fun trade-off is a no brainer. The controls are a bit wonky, but get easier as you go along. There is multiplayer and ♥♥♥♥ing around on black-diamond mountains is really fun.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a very minimal style with a calming soundtrack. It really does feel like it is the 'Forza' of skiing, as the visuals coupled with the white smooth aesthetic of the game really sort of melt together to create something fresh and interesting. The snow in the game actually has prints and you can make trails with your skiis which results in some funny little glitches (like scraping an entire mountain's worth of snow off while you descend sideways, like it's a butter knife).\n\nThe ragdoll weight needs some work, and the game is slightly demanding. However, the developers are very consistent with their updates and each time I find it smoother and better looking as I keep playing. Makes me want to go to the mountains again.","April 25","true","22.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This question will determine if this game is worth the money or not. If you want a in depth game with a ton of content that is streamlined and explained well then this isnt for you... at all. The game is tricky to understand and does not feel familar to skate or tony hawk fans. While the controls work well, they could have been much better. a recommondation would be to make it like skate's right analog stick for tricks and jumping while a boosts your speed. Lets talk about speed. Going fast and pulling off a tough trick is the best part about this game. However there are times when you only go about 50 kps and those parts are monotonous to say the best. The biggest problem is you cant even go faster in these parts, you are pretty much capped at 50. Anyways no sound also is a HUGE dissapointment. This game once sound is added will be very relaxing.
