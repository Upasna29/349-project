However, they simply do not work "out of the box." The launcher presents the player with a menu that allows him to select which game to play. Zero out of six of them will work. Zero. Having said that, I was able to figure out what was wrong and get the games to work on my own, bypassing the launcher, within five minutes. That is only because I have extensive experience with DOS. Most people have little to no experience with that antiquated beast and simply will not be able to figure out how to get the games working on their own, nor should they have to.\n\nIt is simply unacceptable for games that do not work to be sold as if they do work. It is quite literally five minutes worth of work for Activision or Valve to get these games working. It is not the responsibility of the buyer to fix the lazily misconfigured junk that is being sold here. If people pay money for a working game, that's exactly what they should receive.","March 2","false","1.5"," 282 of 292 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","282","292","4","7"

Try not to get frustrated when you (inevitably) die several times before you can move past an area; quite often the death scenes are just as entertaining as the puzzle itself!\n\nYou must resist the temptation to read any sort of walkthrough or watch any Let’s Play videos… at least until after you’ve beat the game. All of the fun of these games comes from the challenge of figuring out the puzzles. If you start reading hints online, you will inevitably spoil something for yourself, and once you know the solution there’s no going back.\n\nSo do yourself a favor: Make sure you save your game often, die in as many ways as possible, and enjoy the victory knowing that you conquered the challenge with only your own intellect!","November 30, 2013","true","5.6"," 130 of 146 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","130","146","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/10110/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Space Quest Collection on Steam is a digital rerelease of collection from 2006. It had 6 main Space Quest games in it, brutal comedy Sierra adventure games that have excellent humor but you probably should use walkthrough and many saves. Spans from 1986 to 1995, so you will see a bit of evolution here. But it's not complete compilation.\n\nIt doesn't have the original EGA version of the first Space Quest, only VGA remake version. And Space Quest 4 that is included here is a CD version. It also comes with shortened manual of SQ1 to SQ6 which is important as some of them have copy protection that requires reading manual. If forget that it doesn't include the second manual "Popular Janitronics" for SQ6 that contained important instructions for in-game puzzle. Just Google it out.\nIt was 2006 collection, so it doesn't come with any Space Quest extras, like game that includes every mini-game from the series. No development video. No other fun videos. No cheaply done CGI teaser of Space Quest 7, you will have to YouTube it all out. Oh, and search for Space Quest 3 Promo while at it, it's a good fun.\n\nInstead this collection's main catch was that it was supposed to work perfectly on Windows XP. By licensing DosBox. Which is outdated by now and not configured properly.\nMaybe I could write a lot on technical info of how bad this is, but you know what. Just check Steam Guides and find the one that links you to fan update for this DosBoxed collection. Even though you will not be able to launch games straight from your Steam, your life will be easier.\n\nAs for games themselves, those are mostly credited as being job of Two Guys from Andromeda from Sierra, will have you follow Roget Wilco, a janitor and idiot who is clearly not a responsible adult. And he has dumb luck. And series had one great humor to it, coming from announcer and death messages. Yep, lots of death scenes in this one. Not to mention that games were generally good for Sierra games, with nice world and nice puzzles here and there. But it's Sierra games which means that it aged. I mean, it's fun to have death scenes, but having dead ends because you forgot item around hour ago is a big no-no for me. So eh. I just used walkthrough in this one.\nStill more fun and safer than King Quest though. Hm, collection of that one went off Steam recently though. Anyway, off to drop quick comments on each game.\n\nSpace Quest 1 VGA:\nA pretty short adventure on very few locations with no ability to backtrack. In this one you will have to rescue Star Generator from hands of aliens race. Well, this one is VGA remake from Space Quest 4 era. Sierra tried to remake a few of first games of their Quest series. Yes, it has dead ends. At least it helps that you have icon interface instead of text parser. Remake even has cheat-device to make annoying gambling part impossible to lose. Yes, original included machine on which you had to gamble and try to get a certain amount of money.\nAnd hey, humor is there. And death messages humor. And somewhat gory deaths occasionally.\nDon't forget about copy protection in manual. And don't forget to pull catridge back after you use it in the middle of a game.\nAlso, it has strange bug with speed setting. It doesn't affect everything in the game. You have to crank it up to be able to overrun walking droid mine in desert area.\nOh, and there are 3-issue comics that were made by Malibu, I think. Can be worth to track those down. No, it's not in-game thing.\n\nSpace Quest 2:\nCame out in 1987, this one will show you the meaning of retro adventure, with parser command and walking with arrows. Actually, it will show you all the bad about them too. No regret of using walkthrough. It has dead ends, deaths, having to navigate through maze with pixel-accuaricy or die, having to guess with no big hints what to do, obscure puzzles, tedious walking, barely any characters, boring locations and huge maze where you can see small area around your character, oh my. Oh well, death messages are there. And you are now stopping a new villian, Sludge Vohaul. Stopping him from ending civilization by sending salemans. Yep, it got a bit less serious.\n\nSpace Quest 3:\nCame out in 1989, was one of the first games to use Sierra's new engine that at this state allowed dumb straight movement by mouse, had a lot of cool effects for EGA game and was one of the first games on PC to use soundcard, with nice music here and there. The thing about this one is that it feels a bit like developers were running out of inspirations and just decided to do straight jokes. I mean, you can read easily from manual that you are supposed to save two personas of two main developers from evil ScumSoft corporation. Well, less Space, more jokes.\nFrom one point it has some interesting setting and stuff, like getting chased by Arnoid. Or having to play horrible arcade game. But then you are also often left wandering around aimlessly at some point of a game.\nIt also has most gory deaths in series. I couldn't giggle at message because I was feeling too squishy.\nThat, and I would have never figured out to grab something that is few times bigger than main hero and isn't even visible in the current screen.\n\nSpace Quest 4:\nIt's time to be Time Ripper and kick butt of Sequel Police. Wait, you should be afraid of them actually. Anyway, this is beautiful VGA game now and has icon interface. Came out in 1991. Ask any fan, and they point at this part as their favourite. Though in this case, for every good thing, there is a bad thing somewhere else in the game. Still, most important thing, humor is at the peak there, alright. Actually, since it's CD version, you will be able to hear speech. And that announcer has one awesome announcer. Even "don't touch it!" will make you smile. Though they say that CD has slightly worse graphics than floppy, less animation, they say.\nSadly, it has painful parts. Not sure about dead ends now, there may be some. In one case, you are punished in the beggining at some point because you took one item some time ago. I know that announcer keeps warning how bad this item is, but we are potty-trained to grab everything. Also, Skate-O-Rama. Save tons of times and try to move in zero gravity in such way that police will miss you. Good luck.\n\nSpace Quest 5:\nA little more on parody of Star Trek, this one was given to Dynamix to make and release it in 1993. It was floppy only release, so no speeches this time. And oh my, this one steps up in adventure games design. I am still not sure about dead ends, but this one has interesting narrative, that will actually make you interested to go into various place and progress in the game all time, as you command fleet and stop mutation. Humor is still there, althrough not as extreme. That first puzzle feltd hiralious for me. Old comics style is awesome.\nJust don't forget to look into manual for coordinates.\nYou know, I actually could recommend it to modern gamer and almost regretted using walkthrough... Until I got to the maze part.\nDammit Wilco, you dummy-butt, you was so close at being best!\nOh well, you are just a janitor.\n\nSpace Quest 6:\nReleased in 1995, this one was done almost without original developers. Which means that a lot of puzzles had no needed hints and were obscure. That, and art style will turn off many people, looking like high-animated Microsoft Paint characters drawn on top of early CGI. And you would start in the dark ugly area with no directions and not much interesting parts. And try to solve obscure puzzle where you really should know what to do to begin with.\nEhh, it's not awesome. Get a bit better and a bit worse.\nActually, it has a glitch at tape worm screen near the end of game. Have to disable scrolling in options there. Vertical scrolling messes up.\nDon't forget to find "Popular Janitronics" manual for puzzle.\nIt also had demo version that has different plot. Can be worth to check out.\n\nAnyway, use walkthrough, but play these.","October 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","39","41","0","0"

While it's not consistent throughout the series (mostly SQ VI, which isn't bad, but isn't great, either), the highpoints are tremendous. My favorite is easily SQ IV, but SQ I-III are also fantastic with the same sort of humor (I haven't played SQ V enough to rule on it).\n\nIt's important to mention that this collection is missing the original version of Space Quest I, which is an EGA version with a parser instead of point & click. I personally missed it since I have nostalgic memories of playing it. It's also important to note that this collection has compatibility issues. There is a simple fix, though. Just search for "Space Quest Collection DOSBox Update (SQCollectionDBUpdate)", install it, and you'll be set.

For anyone who is curious about these games but has never played them I would warn you that they haven't aged too well in some aspects.   The copyright protection areas are likely to confuse players who are completely new to these games.  Also some of the maze areas are a total buzz kill.  It's been years since I've played these games and there were even a few areas in the game I had no idea I could traverse because of the way the art is displayed.  Space Quest 5 was particularly notorious in that aspect for me.

I just installed the game on my ASUS X53S i5-2430M, Win10PRO 64, 8GB RAM with GeForce GT 540M. After lunching the game, You will see a menu which allows You to choose one of the 6 games to start. I tried lunching everyone of them and everything works perfectly. No problems with graphics, sound or interface. No problem with Win10.\n\nI strongly recommend the whole Space Quest series for everyone!","April 23","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This neat little collection brings these classic EGA and VGA hits to Windows XP/7. The 6 games included follow the tales of Space Janitor, Roger Wilco, and his quest to (somehow) save the galaxy, single-handed! Presented in Graphical Text-based to Point-and-Click, these adventure games are sure to bring you some good fun (and some frustrating times figuring out puzzles.) Being a major fan of Sierra Adventure Games, I definitely recommend this. Also check out Kings Quest, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, and many more great hits from Sierra of old.","May 22, 2013","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a blast from the past, but they're still fun. The only downside is that, if you didn't grow up with them, you might find the early interfaces limiting. Also, if you know pretty much what you need to do, the games go by quickly. Don't look up walkthroughs. Play these games the way they were made to be played: with much frustration and many player deaths.

Pretty enjoyable classic comedy adventure games, totally worth the price.\n\nBeing pretty old, I wanted to post these tips on how to play these games with optimal graphics and particularly sound/music.\n1. If you plan to play the games in DOSBox, SierraHelp.com has a patch for the collection that sets up a newer copy of DOSBox than is included (highly recommended), adds configuration programs that are missing, tweaks configs for optimal graphics and sound, and adds shortcuts that launch the games in DOXBox.  Highly recommend only for SQ6 BECAUSE...\n2. Space Quests 1 - 5 are supported by ScummVM, and it's by far the easiest/best way to play them.  Saving and loading games come with screenshots and unlimited slots.  Speed bugs are fixed.  Runs efficiently and natively on a number of platforms.  Even adds mouse support to SQ2.  ScummVM will warn you if you patch the games as mentioned above; I had to revert the patch to get through SQ5.\n3. Graphics and sound effect settings are handled optimally by default with either of the above choices.\n4. Music gets a bit trickier to do "right".  General MIDI/SoundFont can be chosen to taste, but most games created at the time targetted two top-tier music modules: the Roland MT-32 and later the Roland SoundCanvas.\nA) SQ2 is the oldest, and supports PCjr/Tandy 3-tone sound in addition to PC speaker.  You can try both settings in ScummVM to hear the difference.  Default is the better Tandy mode.\nB) SQ1 remake, SQ3, and SQ4 were composed for the MT-32.  ScummVM comes with MT-32 emulator that is nearly spot -on.  You need to add a couple ROM files to your ScummVM to enable this, Google for details.  You'll see a "INSERT BUCKAZOID" message once you have it working.\nC) SQ5 and SQ6 were composed for SoundCanvas/General MIDI.  You can use FluidSynth in ScummVM with a SC SoundFont or one of your choice.  For DOSBox, you'll need to add a software MIDI driver to you system.  Virtual MIDI Synth is recommended, and their website is a good place to get SoundFont recommendations.\n\nA little bit of effort can give you the best experience playing these Sierra classics.","May 22","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.\n\nImagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!\n\nAs a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.\n\nFeel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.\n\nSo.

Unfortunately in doing so you pay for software that simply doesn't work without you updating and configuring DosBOX. The website "Sierrahelp" holds some patches you may want to install which aren't installed in the Steam version of 2016 even though they were released years ago; they also help with proper DosBOX setup, however you still may want to manually tweak the configuration files.\nBeware, parts 2 and 3 from this collection are not available in VGA and require keyboard controlling instead of mouse support which is a bit too "classic" for my taste. However, there is a fan-made VGA version of Space Quest 2 that is really well made and even has acceptable voice acting!\nTo beat Space Quest 6 without an online walkthrough you require some extra manual (used as a form of copy protection) that was forgotten to include in this collection! So, have fun spoiling parts of the game with a walkthrough!\n\nAll things considered the games are funny and worth playing even decades after their inception, but this collection is so badly executed it means you buy tedious work.","May 11","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
