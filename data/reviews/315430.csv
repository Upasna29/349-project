"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/315430/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Polarity is a first person logic puzzle game whose concept is vastly inspired by Portal. It has similar mechanics but at the same time it is full of originality. The companion cubes might not be as cute as in Portal, but they’re still present in this game and needed to complete the puzzles. An innovation consists in the ability of the player to switch between two polarities (red – blue) which allows him to run through gates or to jump on platforms, according to the selected polarity.\n\nThe single player part consists of 14 puzzles that are not too hard to solve, with difficulty increasing  each level though. However, even the most difficult levels can be solved in less than 5 minutes each. The 10 bonus levels are slightly more difficult to figure out, but they add new fun features to the game.\n\nThe coop mode, on the other hand, is quite challenging. The two players must cooperate to solve the puzzles that are much more complex than in single player mode. The levels are bigger, now consisting in multiple rooms. The path to the exit isn’t usually the same for the two players, but nevertheless, they need to work together to reach it. There are places in which timed jumps are needed while trying to grab certain objects at the same time, and these jumps are not easily performed with a controller as compared to a mouse and keyboard setup. Sadly, the game offers only local coop and not online multiplayer, so make sure to invite a friend that can be persuaded to work on those together with you, without him losing his patience. Or even better, maybe you can convince him/her to do those tricky jumps :)\n\nDon’t hesitate to buy it, especially discounted, since it is a very fun game!\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 136 of 144 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","136","144","7","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedReign/recommended/315430/","RedReign","Red Reign","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedReign/","118 products in account","QUICK NOTE: At the time I'm writing this, the game is on sale at $0.54 (95% off). At that price, I could recommend the game, sure. Unless you absolutely cannot get enough first person puzzle/platforming, I wouldn't get it otherwise, especially not at $10.99.\n---\n\nYou play as a hacker that is being paid (presumably) a large amount of money to hack into a level and steal data through some physical manifestation of your target's... network? Mainframe? God knows. The point is you have to go through 12 levels (followed by another 10 bonus levels), collecting 3 Data Fragments per level.\n\nThe main gimmick of the game is that you can switch your "Polarity" at will - between red and blue. While a certain color, you will collide with objects of the opposite color (such as lasers, which will kill you), but pass through objects of the same color. There are also cubes (pretty much tiny Companion Cubes) which behave in a similar fashion. The cubes will power things when plugged into a slot, very similar to how Companion Cubes could hold buttons down to keep platforms suspended, etc. in Portal. Add a couple generic objects, such as launch pads and moving platforms, and you pretty much have the entire game.\n\nThe game unabashedly takes a lot of inspiration from Portal: levels feel like sterile, self-contained test chambers, the only difference is that everything's dark grey instead of white, and you don't have a charming robot voice monologuing you or telling a story while you progress; the large and open, but still linear level design; and a general futuristic theme (though it's admittedly silly to mash both Portal and Polarity into such a vast genre and expect it to mean anything).\n\nYou don't need to collect the 3 Data Fragments to technically "beat" the level - rather, you can simply progress through the level and find the exit. This is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, Data Fragments are required to unlock the next levels. They are usually poorly hidden, if not put directly in plain sight, and by simply walking around the room you can easily tell how to get to the fragments. The worst the game will do is put them behind a small puzzle, or out of your immediate field of view when you enter a room. To put it into perspective, the only levels I needed to play more than once were the first and second levels, where I missed one fragment each, because it was placed slightly out of sight or in a corner that I had carelessly overlooked.\n\nIt doesn't feel good to collect data fragments because the level design is not challenging at all. The main "puzzle" in each level often requires next to no thinking. I beat all 22 single-player levels in about 50 minutes, and was fairly bored the entire way through. Sadly, this is why I can't say I recommend this title.\n\nIt's not that the art style is uninspired and simple - that doesn't necessarily make a game bad.\n\nIt's not that the music, and the general sound design for that matter, has a generic, forgettable 80s futuristic feel, which I'd normally think was quite humorous or charming - lots of devs these days just use stock royalty-free music and nobody seems to mind that too much. At least this has custom music (I think).\n\nIt's not that it's trying to copy Portal - I don't see a huge amount wrong with following the footsteps of a very successful puzzle game and trying to recreate that formula!\n\nIt's not even that the first person animations, head bobbing, and movement glitches make it painfully obvious this is a 3D Unity game. Or that my Logitech F310 - a fairly good controller when it comes to compatibility - would only work during the main menu and the two "cutscenes" that exist in singleplayer.\n\nThe problem is the frankly depressing lack of content, and, more importantly, the content that IS there is unchallenging, unengaging, and simply not fun. As a developer, I'd be disappointed if I spent a significant amount of time and effort building a game and only could be bothered to make a few mediocre-at-best levels that don't even show the potential of what few mechanics that DO exist. As a consumer, I'm very confused with how this game has so many positive reviews - must just be me being out of touch with the puzzle game community. Don't expect level design that lives up to Portal, or any other good puzzle game I can think of, really.\n\nTL;DR - Game's really dry on content, and what content DID manage to find its way in is insultingly easy and boring. I'd say it's worth neither your time nor your money. Get on a crazy 95% off sale, if at all.","January 1","false","1.7"," 88 of 106 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","88","106","8","2"

The constant stream of introductions to tools that are barely utilized keeps Polarity from ever managing to create puzzles that provide any sort of challenge.\n\nFrom the main campaign, to the coop levels, and even the bonus stages (which could have just as well been included with the other levels as they feel identical) every puzzle is agonizingly mundane and basic. Polarity mingles in tutorials from start to finish, as if testing my patience for repeating the same handful of puzzle types for hours on end, chuckling to itself at how cleverly it has hidden its simplicity by placing it within tediously large levels that have a habit of breaking halfway through and forcing you to restart.\n\nThe cooperative mode itself feels like almost a misnomer, allowing two players to go through levels together but rarely if ever requiring they work together, or even giving both players something to do. Often one of us would simply took over completing a puzzle while the other trailed behind waiting for their turn to help, with a few instances of actual cooperation being the sole highlight of the game.\n\nThere just doesn’t seem to be any point to Polarity. It exists for the sake of existing but in a post-Portal world and an increasingly crowded genre, it feels trite and uninspired. I could potentially see a lot of things from it being spun out into better games, but it’s hard to imagine that ever happening when what’s already here is so disinterested in moving forward.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 11, 2015","false","3.1"," 92 of 125 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","92","125","4","1"

But after playing it through it's mostly relaxing puzzle fun. Instead of using portals you carry and throw little cubes to switches. There are also switchable bouncers and moving platforms. But most important are the red and blue energy fields and your color change ability. We know this from "The Flip". Well, the puzzles get more complex and challenging on higher stages.\nFor example you must fall through 5 alternating colored laserfields. If you have the wrong color you die. In each level there are 3 hidden data pieces to collect. The Coop levels are no real internet coop (they are just local coop). But with an additional gamepad controller + keyboard they are quite doable on your own.

It consists of 37 levels, including co-op levels, which some of them can be challenging, but not to the point of frustration. You can also collect Data Fragments in each level, which are used to unlock more levels and add a little bit more fun to the game. The gameplay is very similar to Portal, but in a different way, and that's what makes this game unique. I find the graphics pretty good and I also love the music in this game! The ambience in the music fits perfectly inside of an obstacle course/ facility setting. This game also includes achievements and trading cards, which is also a plus.\n\nIn conclusion, Polarity is just a casual and pretty fun game for people to play if they're bored and have nothing to do.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nIf you're looking for a fun game to chill with, then Polarity is the game for you.\n9.5/10","August 23, 2015","true","11.9"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","34","41","5","3"

The hardest part is finding all the collectable "data" in the levels, and I'll admit I had quite a bit of fun looking for and getting to them all. The addition of a multiplayer mode was a HUGE plus, and was frankly a lot more fun than the standard game, in my opinion.\n\nThe viusuals get the job done, but they aren't anything to write home about. (Also, it didn't natively support my 1440 x 900 resolution, so that was kinda a bummer.)  Also, there are a good number of bugs that still need to be worked out, and frankly rip you out of the experience. holes in the ground that drop you down to infinity and don't respawn you unless you restart the level aren't fun, and I've accidentally fallen down more than one.\n\nIn summary, I'd say to pick this game up when it's on sale. I wouldn't spend the whole 5 bucks on it, but if it gets around a dollar it's definitely worth your time.\n","May 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Am I missing something? I have no idea how people can love it so much when it's literally brainless 'puzzle' solving. If you're gonna get this, then get it when it has a huge discount, like it did during the summer sale (it was 19 cents I think). The summer sale price should honestly be the base price of the game, like I said it's something that's supposed to be free, not 5 euros!\n\nAnyway.. I'll give the game itself a short review. The game just feels and looks cheap, the interface is cheap, the world is cheap, the physics are cheap, the movement is weird, the camera movement is also weird, there are only a few levels, the concept is OK, the music is OK and overall it's still not something that I would want to pay five euros for, I'm sorry that's just how I see it.

The levels are all very well made and will definitely require some thinking to complete them. Each level has 3 'data fragments' which are optional to collect to unlock certain bonus levels. These fragments are often very easy to obtain, but some of them are very well hidden.

Other annoying bugs include auto dropping cubes when coop partner dies, random rotation of camera when using gamepad (Xbox 360 controller in my case) while pressing nothing and no end game screen for coop campaign  (there is normal "Next" button which does nothing so you don't know if it's broken or what's happening)\nDifficulty - Sadly the difficulty is almost none, all "puzzles" are very straight forward requiring almost no thought. I'd definitely wouldn't call it "demanding all of your wits and reflexes" as devs do.\nCoop - It's advertised as multi-player game but it only contains local coop (which wasn't problem for me but it might be for others). Included coop campaign isn't really coop for most of the parts, there are few moments where two players must interact with each other to finish the level but otherwise it's mostly one doing all of the work while the other is waiting for partner to open the road for him (being a burden in short).\nLength - Both coop and single-player campaign takes only around an hour each.\n\nThis might sound like very negative review but in fact it really isn't. Thought there are issues with the game, they aren't game-braking. I still enjoyed playing coop with a friend and can only recommend it for this next-to-nothing price.

This review is assuming you are buying the game at the listed price of $10.99. I have also 100% the game and my time in game is probably about 1 hours of idling so it is a pritty short game.\nThis game clames a lot saying that it is the next portal ext. but it just is not. The main machanic of the game is to change your polarity between red and blue. You use this to pass through and stand on platforms and not get killed by lazers. That is about as indepth as this machanic gets. The other main machanic is using red or blue cubes that you move around that level to activate switchs that move objects in the level. The color of the cube has the same function of the polarity of the player you just cant change it at at anytime. In each level you must also collect 3 data fragments which are not that hidden.\n\nPros:\nThe 2 player part was not that bad\nIf you can get it on sale it is very cheep\nSome levels were interesting and make the player think\nAmbient music\nCons:\n$10.99 is way to much for a game that is aobut 2 non-interesting hours\nThe puzles are not very interesting and get borring after aobut 30 minutes\nOutdated visuals\nThe puzles dont build on eachother very well\nVery little story that should not even be there\nYou can glich through some objects and the void is sometimes visable\nNot hard to figure out the puzles\nLots of sniping cubes across the map and hopping you hit it\nThis game is not the next portal. It is a 6bear bones puzle game that is not worth the $10.99 price tag. I think a fair price for this game would be about $2.","May 22","false","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Buy on a sale!\nMore suitable for a younger audience, or simply to relax.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, but to be honest it didn't take long to get used to. Considering the game has a cyberspace theme, you wouldn't really expect top quality graphics (or at least I wouldn't, anyways...) So they certainly stood out enough to be easy on the eyes for the duration of the gameplay. I haven't tried Multiplayer so I don't actually know what the player model looks like, so in my ignorance i'll assume it has the same minimalistic appeal.\n\nThe audio for this game, I didn't really notice it. That isn't a bad thing - I knew when something happened, but it was more of a confirmation than actual sfx. It added to the feel of calm under pressure, and aided the relaxing puzzles through what could have been frustrating experiences if it wasn't for one problem...\n\n...It was too easy. I finished the game (all data fragments) and all the bonus mission in 92 minutes. It was enjoyable, so I would recommend at a low price, but it certainly wasn't something that I had to struggle to understand the solutions. It took a few attempts to actually do some of the solutions, granted. Some of that was because of a slight issue with physics/momentum that I wasn't expecting. If you are on a moving platform, you will continue to move in that direction as you jump off it. This means that instead of jumping towards what you are looking for you have to account for a slight air drift. Which, again, wasn't difficult to understand, just wasn't as expected initially.\n\nI don't know if this game was supposed to be for a younger audience, or if I am better at this game than others. Personally I felt like the bonus missions should have been part of the main missions, but if the game was meant to be a little easier I can understand why the difficulty would be at a mismatch in that situation. There were 22 levels (including bonus levels) for Singleplayer mode, and I assume 15 for multiplayer - given there are 3 fragments per level and 45 set to CoOp mode. All the same, I was sort of expecting more challenging puzzles, but I didn't dislike the experience up to the end goal.\n\nI doubt this game would get a great deal of re-runs. The base price is not worth the content in my opinion. That being said, I got this game around 90% off (maybe more) and I certainly think this game would be worth it at a discounted value. I have seen this game on sale many, many times. So long as it is half price or better, I would say go for it. As it stands, however, my view is that the game should be around four times longer, with much more challenging rooms in order to justify the retail value asked. Or maybe include a level editor and allow workshop support, but that is likely above the developer's skill level judging by the content provided. Again, not a bad thing, as I in no way disliked the levels that I played, I just don't think that there is  enough  content provided...\n\nPS - Technically, you can get this game at such a steep discount that you could sell the trading cards and make money, though if you are into that kind of thing you'd already know that without reading this review.","May 4","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally got the two player section done alone, but I'm not sure how you'd do it without a gamepad. There's also some kind of alarming screeching noise that happens at random, which I want to assume is supposed to be the players communicating, but more realistically it might just be an audio glitch.\n\nIf you're into Portal, maybe grab this while it's on sale or in a bundle, but there isn't enough content here to justify the full price.

This game feels great for what I purchased it at for $0.50.  Now seeing the price at $11, it feels very lack luster.\n4) Co-op is couch co-op, no online co-op.  Which was confusing when I saw "multi-player" which I assumed meant online play, there is none available, so it was really mistagged.\n5) There are a few levels in which it is required that you die to progress, this came to a shock for me the first time, every time after it became the solution to harder puzzles.\n\nFinal verdict, if you are purchasing this game while it is on sale below $11, then get it, its a good quick game to try and test your brain on, however if your not, consider waiting.","February 1","false","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I 100%ed (all collectibles and achievements) the whole singleplayer part of it in less than an hour and a half.\n○ It's also pretty buggy, I managed to clip out of the map through a wall once without actively trying to do so.\n○ The movement feels really tedious - you can get stuck on a 1 inch step and have to jump in order to traverse it. The collision detection of jumping platforms is a pain, too, among other things.\n○ Then there's the thing with some of the puzzles... You know, in a puzzle game I like the idea to be "spend some time figuring out what you have to do, then do it" whereas here it's often "see what you have to do right away, then spend 5 minutes trying to pull it off with the dodgy physics system and clunky movement".\n○ Some gameplay elements don't add anything to the challenge of the puzzle itself, they merely serve as a layer of hogwash that can foil your efforts at any point (I'm mostly talking about the moving lasers).\n○ A couple times I didn't get any hints on newly introduced mechanics (e.g. rotatable jump pads or cube colour changing portals) so I wondered what the hell I'm supposed to do with a blue cube and red socket.\n\nAll in all it's not an awful game but if I had paid the full price for it I'd feel robbed.

The graphics are nice but simple and movement in the game feels good, though some of the physics involved with moving platforms are odd. I had to get used to a moving platform acting like a catapult every time I jumped, but that just made the game that much more unique. I finished all the single player levels in a couple hours and I would really love to see more levels added or a way to make custom levels.

However, I do feel the game is a reasonable purchase, especially at a discount of -50% or more. Gameplay is simple and enjoyable, while the game has many rough edges and limited content.\n\nThe biggest issue I can see is that the game is a sloppy Unity project. The launcher has limited resolution options, and the Steam overlay would ghost on the black borders. Level assets have cracks and seams, buggy lighting, and a major lack in refinement. Some puzzles can be broken by tricks, especially in co-op. Turrets are not solid, and can be ran through. Cubes above a door can be grabbed before the door closes, trivializing later sections. Co-op can be fully completed as one person flipping between keyboard and controller. Later co-op puzzles seemed to have extra cube-locks with no function, with no lines to show what platform was affected. Polarity has the hallmarks of the first game from a company, flawed but passionate.\n\nI enjoyed the game enough to bother with co-op and put up with the sloppy level design to 100% the game. The current content is around 4 hours, with levels consistently taking 3-6 minutes to complete. I liked that timing and pacing, as I could play the game while waiting on friends or multiplayer queues. Puzzles were satisfying and reasonable, and only the cube transformation field (yellow particles) was confusing, with no introduction to even show it exists. The developers could make several improvements, but the game was quite enjoyable. The -96% sale was amazing, but I think the game is worth more than that. Polarity is a decent puzzle option to spend a little time thinking, but this gem is quite rough.","May 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER IN THE REVIEW)\n\nI don't know what I expected for four dollars (though I got it for 19 cents), but apparently this isn't it.\n\nGameplayIt felt way too short, but that was probably just because they kept repeating the same puzzles/parkour stunts over and over again, such as when you have to switch polarity in midair to stay on/avoid the platforms/lasers. There were about 5-7 actually unique puzzles.\nAlso, the mechanics weren't being used enough, such as the on/off switch and the rotation buttons. Even the polarity was mostly just used for either the midair-polarity-switch stunt or fields that blocked certain cubes.\nPlus, the data fragments were placed in awkward positions and it didn't feel like they had anything to do with the puzzle at hand. 3/10\n\nEnviromentThere's no real plot aside from being informed that you are hacking into some super important company (although it doesn't look like you're in cyberspace). We are never told what this company is, what they do, or why we need to hack into it.\nThe scenery never changes, either. We aren't showed where we are before we take up the offer, we aren't shown how we get transported into cyberspace, we aren't shown how we get beamed out once we finish the mission, and we aren't shown where we are when we get the massive supply of credits.\nAnd it's completely clean with no props or broken walls anywhere, despite the numerous video games that showed us that messier was better. Portal had the famous Rattmann dens, Portal 2 had the facility beat up and destroyed in many of the chambers, Gateways had the laboratories broken into by a messy criminal, etc. And just because it's in cyberspace doesn't mean you can't make some areas briefly be replaced with nonsense code before automatically repairing itslef or have the lights take a while to turn on.\nFinal note: There's just too much black and dark gray on the walls, floors and ceilings, especially in the later levels of the game and the bonus levels. Wouldn't hurt to make it half-light, half-dark like Portal. 2/10\n\nCo-opI do not have any friends who are willing to come over to my house just to play Portal 2 minus the portals. Either way, I don't think it would be that much of an improvement. 2/10\n\nThe store pagedoesn't contain that much content from the real, finished game. As a matter of fact, from the looks of it, the prototype was better than the real thing. It contains some final levels with a better balance of dark and light, and one level that was two from the finished product put together.\nThe description contains numerous flaws. "One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal." is a little bit too egotistical and not very true. "Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes." is hardly true at all. I finished all of the singleplayer levels with all of the fragments in around 114 minutes, and I only stumbled across 2 levels that required reflexes (along with the numerous midair-polarity-switch stunts) and they were pretty easy. "Full-featured local co-op campaign." I am not sure about. 2/10\n\nOverallThis game is hardly worthy of your money, even if it's only nineteen cents. 2/10","September 10, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

With a gaming mouse, I have to switch dpi whenever switching between 3D and menu. I am beginning to appreciate that my mouse has dedicated buttons for that. Set it to 400 dpi, Windows to 1/11, still too fast.\nSame with sound volume. Too low, and not adjustable.\nAutorun would be very helpful, too.\n\nDropped the cube on an arrow plate - couldn't pick it up again. A little bug I guess.\nOne time the cube moved to me in slowmotion when picked up.\nOne time I threw my cube against a wall and it vanished in it. Another little bug. (They're so cute. :3)\n\nOne level had a fail condition, requiring a restart. Not a big deal. Just seems like unintended design.\n\nRotation arrow buttons are the wrong way. The button showing clockwise rotation turns the whole room counter-clockwise. Bit confusing at first.\n\nProgressive complexity, without becoming actually more difficult. A generally easy-difficulty game for those who don't like their head to go up in smoke. Although it's also so non-exciting that it can become difficult to find motivation in the more complex levels.\nJumping is nicely controllable, even in mid-air. Since there are jump-timing puzzles, this is very good. A bit bothersome maybe that you get stuck at very low edges and need to jump there, but you can just adjust to that.\n\nMenu navigation is a bit tedious with no rollover and no good visual selection indication.\n\nBarefoot walking sounds, yet jumps and landings sound like shoes.\n\nThe 'story' is lackluster even for this game, especially because the 'ending' text abruptly goes out of character. They could just as well not have made a story at all if they don't put any passion into it.\n\nA game should be easy or short, but not both. This is  of acceptable length if you play all the content types. But cooperative mode I found bothersome, because player 2 can only be controlled with a game controller, and while I have that (otherwise not playable it seems), controlling your avatar using a game controller is a challenge in itself, especially if you're not used to it.\n\nSince I got this with heavy discount - 19 cents, I didn't consider it a bad investment. Especially since a foil card dropped, hah.","May 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it during a sale, when it was only 15p.

There are some really nice ideas and some great puzzles in this game. I would definitely recommend this for anybody, and it also doesn't put too much (if any) strain on your computer. It also features acheivements (almost everybody should unlock the first one) and trading cards.","May 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun and relaxing experience, however very short. The game doesn't cost much, so it's easy choice and you won't regret you spent your money on it.\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the co-op mode, in which two players can either play on two pads or one pad and keyboard, so if you don't own a pad you can't play the co-op.

Now, it's time for the real review.\n\nBasic Info:\nPolarity, greatly inspired by Portal, is a first-person puzzle platformer. You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. Either way, they're the same kind of puzzles.\n\nList of Basic Uses:\n-Cubes: Used to activate switches, platforms, laser walls, etc.\n\n-Polarity: You switch your Polarity (Your color, some say) to jump onto colored platforms, or to get through a laser gate without dying.\n\n-Gold Lasers, A.K.A. Color Changing Lasers: These are lasers that you can throw cubes into to change their color from either red to blue, or blue to red.\n\n-Data: These are collected to unlock more levels throughout the game and eventually unlock the bonus stages. There are three per level.\n\nOther Notes:\nThis game is completly Xbox 360 controller compatible without any configuration needed. There is also a split-screen multiplayer that has its own campaign.\n\nStory:\nHonestly, Polarity doesn't really have a story at all. However, you can peice together a basic story from what you're told.\nYou're a hacker trying to break into one of the greatest firewalls in the world, trying to collect data so you get your reward that was promised to you by an unknown person/thing - 10,000,000 Credits.\n\nGameplay:\nPolarity has you jumping from platform to platform, switching your Polarity (Or, some may call, your color) and carrying and throwing cubes everywhere. What I'm trying to say is that you may have to get through a  red  laser gate, so you have to switch your polarity (Which, by default at the begining of every level, is blue) to, obviously, red. That's different with platforms, however. With platforms, you must switch to the  opposite  color to get across, which leads to switching polarity in mid-air. What I'm trying to say is that your Polarity and ablility to work with cubes is all you need to beat the levels.\n\nPolarity has 14 levels in singleplayer that are not too tough at all, but can actually be a bit fustrating for reasons such as "Crap, put the cube in the wrong spot - Oh, there it goes. Bye cube. Just gotta run back to the other side of the map again to get a new one..." Most of the levels are short, but every now and then, you'll notice repeating concepts in the levels. For exaple, you may have just completed a level where you had to through cubes into switches and now, you're throwing cubes into color changing lasers and then putting them in switches. May not  sound  similar, but once you play, you'll know what I mean. That, however, is not too much of an issue.\n\nUpon getting every Data Crystal in the singleplayer campaign, you unlock the 10 bonus levels. These levels are just  barely  harder then the normal campaign, which is easy once you get the hang of how things work.\n\nDifficulty... That's an issue. This game isn't hard by all means. It's just fustrating. Like in my example above, you can easily throw your cube the wrong way or just barely miss the button for it and *POOF*! It's gone. You'll have to go back and get a new one. Anyways, back to difficulty - It's too easy, in my opinion, to be a puzzle game. WAY too easy. The Data Crystals aren't even cleverly hidden at all. You can easily get all of those. You'll also find yourself breezing through this game. For example, if you have even the slightest bit of knowledge as to what you're doing, you can get through levels in 1-2 minutes each. The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.\n\nAh, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not "I GIVE UP!" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.\n\nTo conclude this review, I give Polarity a 7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard.","June 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well those two had a baby, and Polarity is that beautiful child.\n\nIn case the trailer didn't give it away, this is a first-person puzzle game where you switch between "polarities" of red and blue to bypass obstacles. If you're the same color as some objects, you pass through. If you're the same color as a laser, it doesn't kill you. You take colored blocks and use them to activate switches and must gather three hidden data shards (glowing green ♥♥♥♥) each level in order to unlock the final one.\n\nI bought this at a ridiculous 96% off, thinking that if I played it for more than a minute I'd have gotten my money's worth. I've played for over an hour now and I'm done with only a small fraction of the content. Likely by the time I'm done with this, I'll have a solid four hours or so assuming I don't bully some people into playing the co-op stuff with me.\n\nThe best part is that outside of the first few levels, there's no handholding.

Wait till there is a sale and it drops down to 19 cents. I bought this for 12 cents after using the spare change in my steam wallet, and it was totally worth it then. Anyways, lets get started on the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics look really nice for a game I picked up for 12 cents.\n-Audio, while repetitive at a few moments during the hour and a half singleplayer campaign, was nice and provided a nice atmosphere for the whole digital hacking heist theme.\n\nNot necessarily pro or con:\n-Many reviews mention Portal as what they were thinking of while they were playing. While it had a unique gameplay idea of polarity switching, it really could've used that mechanic way more than the Portal-esque cube on button style gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-SO SHORT! Even with the bonus levels, it only took me about an hour and a half, which is why I recommend it only if it's on sale.\n-Not much of a con, but it was really easy the whole way through. Really could've used a difficulty spike at points.\n\nOverall a 8/10 for a game on sale for 20 cents,\n","July 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The horrible part is that, although it is advertised as multiplayer and local co-op, it is in fact only local co-op. This means that a part of the game was left untouched which is unsatisfying since I paid to enjoy the full game.

With a gaming mouse, I have to switch dpi whenever switching between 3D and menu. I am beginning to appreciate that my mouse has dedicated buttons for that. Set it to 400 dpi, Windows to 1/11, still too fast.\nSame with sound volume. Too low, and not adjustable.\nAutorun would be very helpful, too.\n\nDropped the cube on an arrow plate - couldn't pick it up again. A little bug I guess.\nOne time the cube moved to me in slowmotion when picked up.\nOne time I threw my cube against a wall and it vanished in it. Another little bug. (They're so cute. :3)\n\nOne level had a fail condition, requiring a restart. Not a big deal. Just seems like unintended design.\n\nRotation arrow buttons are the wrong way. The button showing clockwise rotation turns the whole room counter-clockwise. Bit confusing at first.\n\nProgressive complexity, without becoming actually more difficult. A generally easy-difficulty game for those who don't like their head to go up in smoke. Although it's also so non-exciting that it can become difficult to find motivation in the more complex levels.\nJumping is nicely controllable, even in mid-air. Since there are jump-timing puzzles, this is very good. A bit bothersome maybe that you get stuck at very low edges and need to jump there, but you can just adjust to that.\n\nMenu navigation is a bit tedious with no rollover and no good visual selection indication.\n\nBarefoot walking sounds, yet jumps and landings sound like shoes.\n\nThe 'story' is lackluster even for this game, especially because the 'ending' text abruptly goes out of character. They could just as well not have made a story at all if they don't put any passion into it.\n\nA game should be easy or short, but not both. This is  of acceptable length if you play all the content types. But cooperative mode I found bothersome, because player 2 can only be controlled with a game controller, and while I have that (otherwise not playable it seems), controlling your avatar using a game controller is a challenge in itself, especially if you're not used to it.\n\nSince I got this with heavy discount - 19 cents, I didn't consider it a bad investment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/315430/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nPolarity is like a simpler and shorter version of Portal, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game or a relentless copy of the game which obviously inspired it, as there are plenty of concepts and ideas that make this title stand on its own. To begin with, there are no actual portals, as the game relies on its blue-red polarity concept to solve puzzles, allowing you to change your polarity in order to pass obstacles and reach otherwise inaccessible areas. As that alone would become boring, companion cubes show up just at the right time to throw in the extra element that allows certain levels to present you with challenging puzzles, without over-complicating them to the point where you don't know what to do next. Cubes, just as yourself have polarities as well, however their polarity can only change in special areas, forcing you to use what you have at your disposal in order to solve puzzles, and since you can only summon a limited number of cubes, the solution will always pop up once you've exhausted all other options, making puzzles challenging, but not unsolvable. Unlike Portal, Polarity doesn't have a background story, and there is nothing to tie in one level to the next one, making your entire adventure feel without purpose, especially since the single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour.\nRating: 6.5\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is simplistic and accessible to anyone, as it only requires basic character and camera movements and control buttons for switching polarity and interacting with cubes and other objects, but aside from that logic is the only tool you need in Polarity. Puzzles are challenging, but they never get to the point where they become hard or unsolvable without consulting a guide, mostly because the game will be over before the level design reaches that point. There are a lot of interesting features packed in the final levels, and there was definitely room for a lot more afterwards, but unfortunately none of those features reached their full potential, as the level design remains basic, even when there are more elements involved, as the solution will always be obvious once you take a look around you. The polarity switch is the game's greatest strength as it creates opportunities for clever and unique puzzles, but once again this feature never goes beyond that basic gate, making it feel unused in most cases. There are some interesting puzzles to have fun with, but even so it shouldn't take you longer than four minutes to solve each one, as you will always find the solution to each one once you've failed on your first attempt and realize the answer is the other way around.\nRating: 6\n\nGraphics\nThe game looks okay for what it is, however even with the test chamber look inspired by Portal, there was room for a few details to differentiate one level from another, but in this case all the levels look similar and the only thing to set them apart one from another is the placement of the objects required to solve the puzzle. The visual effects are basic, and once again for what this game is, they do the job, even though in certain areas better effects would've made a difference in the sense of power the game tries to give you by interacting with its objects.\nRating: 5.5\n\nAudio\nThere are no voices in here since there is no background story, narration or characters, leaving the entire experience up to the level design and the puzzles, but the lack of such things only makes the game seem shorter than it already is. The sound effects are basic and repetitive, as you will still hear the same interaction sounds over and over again; the soundtrack is limited and even though it is in theme with what the game offers, you will eventually grow tired of hearing that same tune all the time.\nRating: 4\n\nExtras\nApart from the single player campaign, there is a Co-Op campaign which consists of a collection of levels designed for two players and a Bonus campaign which can be accessed once you've finished the main missions; all that added up and you've still got only 2-3 hours worth of content.\nRating: 6.5\n\nVerdict\nPolarity is a fun game to play if you fancy the genre, however don't expect this to have anything else to offer besides its gameplay concepts, and even with that in mind there is not much to play; after all, this is a 5€ title.\nRating: 5.7\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Polarity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=338","May 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never played games like Polarity before (though some people suggest it's very similar to Portal), and was amazed how easily I got myself immersed into exploring new levels. It's fun and relaxing experience, however very short. The game doesn't cost much, so it's easy choice and you won't regret you spent your money on it.\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the co-op mode, in which two players can either play on two pads or one pad and keyboard, so if you don't own a pad you can't play the co-op. Using the same keyboard by two players should be also allowed (with customizable controls).","May 5, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game have some great ideas for being  a simple puzzle game, but unfortunately, the game lacks for content.\nThe solo campaing it´s ridiculous easy, the data fragments are placed on the obvious spots that you guess normally, there  are like 5 or 6 musics on the entire game, the areas and background are really bland and dull, but, still being a solid puzzle game.\nYou should beat on the solo by 1 hour, and on the coop mode  probably 1 and half hours.\nI do recommend this game for supporting this small company, but i recommend to buy on discount.\nScore: 6.5/10","June 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not too terribly difficult; most levels only took me a few minutes. Good distraction for a couple hours; I picked it up as part of a four-game bundle for about a dollar, so in terms of money-per-unit-entertainment... I'd say it was worth it. (Had I spent its current "full price" this review would have a very different tone.)\n\nThe backstory is that you are, um, hacking some computer system or something? The backstory is completely irrelevant, and can safely be ignored.\n\nThe game has a bunch of interesting mechanics (a switchable "polarity" that lets you pass through walls or lasers; red and blue cubes for activating switches; jump pads of various sorts; etc)-- it's unfortunate that the game is so short, since it seems like there are some missed opportunities there.\n\nThe "co-op" mode is local split-screen only (not online, oddly). I was able to work through it (as one person) with a keyboard and a gamepad; there's little in the co-op campaign that requires active participation by both players simultaneously. That could have used a bit more work.","November 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't have an incredibly engaging story to it (in fact, save for a short text introduction at the beginning of the game, there's no story to it at all), but at the same time it doesn't really need one. The objective of each level is to use colored cubes to activate corresponding gates and switches to get to the end-level warp while collecting data fragments.\n\nHIGHS: --Gameplay is fun and engaging, albeit a bit bare-bones.\n--Bonus levels and Co-op campaign add much needed replay.\n--The music (or I should ambience) is soothing without becoming repetitive. Accompanied with the easy-on-the-eyes visuals, the game is actually quite calming (in the good way).\n\n\nLOWS: --The levels aren't incredibly challenging. They're enough to make you think, but none will really stump you or leave you stuck.\n--There's a couple important details the game neglects to inform you about. For example, later in the game you'll encounter yellow gates that, turns out, change the color of whatever cube passes through it. An attentive player would be bound to figure this out on their own eventually, but the more casual player may not be so quick to catch on (especially when the FIRST none-red/blue gate you encounter without being informed kills you).\n--The game is FAR too short, especially for the asking price of $10.99 (The single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour, even if you're not the greatest at puzzle games). The game could've, and SHOULD've, been much longer; especially with the multitude of potential puzzles the aforemention yellow gates can bring to the table.\n\n\nBUY or BYE: I say buy, especially if you're a big fan of the Portal series or puzzle games in general. Polaris is not worth the default $11. A good default price would be $5 (perhaps $9.99 at the most), but certainly not $11. HOWEVER, it IS a fun puzzle game that should be experienced, and for the current sales price of $0.54, you can't go wrong!","December 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagrax/recommended/315430/","shagrax","Jazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagrax/","543 products in account","This is basically a platformer game with a few puzzle elements. Polarity mechanics boils down to switching to correct polarity when jumping on colored platforms. Puzzles are trivial and most of the play time comes from traversing unnecessary long distances on foot while constantly holding your "run" key. On a few levels it's literally easier to kill yourself (to reset your position) instead of walking back and forth.\n\nThere is no narration or plot, aesthetically this game is meh, visually it's unpolished even, from time to time you'll see misaligned textures and z-fighting.\n\nSpeaking of play time, single player campaign (not counting bonus levels) takes around 30 minutes to beat, but then it asks you to replay it and 100% it to unlock a "Story 02", which is actually a "Thanks for playing" message written on a black screen.\n\nI guess I could recommend it if you get it very cheap, but this game also requires you to go through extra hoops to be playable on some configurations. If you're playing on a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, open your GPU drivers control panel and switch to 60Hz.\n\nApparently if your framrate is too high, game from time to time doens't register jumps and this game has a lot of platforming. You run towards next platform, you press the jump key, hear the jump sound but there is no jump, you just fall off the ledge. This is extremely frustrating. You can't set the refresh rate in game settings. Judging by the forums, someone tried to contact devs about that issue but it's still not fixed. I also hate the mouse acceleration that is there by default but I couldn't find any mouse settings apart from Y invert, which is probably there just for the controller.","January 10","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

In each level there are three data pieces located in hidden or hard-to-reach places that you must collect to finish the game. If you were a fan of the box-juggling of Portal, this game has plenty, as most levels requires you to carry, throw, and place boxes on buttons.\n\nIt's a fun little game whose biggest issue is the little. The game is fairly short, and I was able to beat the "story mode" in less than an hour, half of which was going back through the levels to collect all the "data" I missed due to tricky placement. New mechanics are barely added in this short amount of time, meaning each level feels roughly the same. The puzzles weren't challenging enough to help the length, and the story mode is barely a story. The game doesn't really use its core mechanic to its full potential, and it really seems like just a box-and-button puzzle game rather than something fresh and new. The aesthetic is nice.\n\nIf you do get this game, get it during one of its sale periods where it goes down to like 19 cents. I do recommend it because it is a nice puzzle game, but it's not all there.","June 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, it's time for the real review.\n\nBasic Info:\nPolarity, greatly inspired by Portal, is a first-person puzzle platformer. You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. Either way, they're the same kind of puzzles.\n\nList of Basic Uses:\n-Cubes: Used to activate switches, platforms, laser walls, etc.\n\n-Polarity: You switch your Polarity (Your color, some say) to jump onto colored platforms, or to get through a laser gate without dying.\n\n-Gold Lasers, A.K.A. Color Changing Lasers: These are lasers that you can throw cubes into to change their color from either red to blue, or blue to red.\n\n-Data: These are collected to unlock more levels throughout the game and eventually unlock the bonus stages. There are three per level.\n\nOther Notes:\nThis game is completly Xbox 360 controller compatible without any configuration needed. There is also a split-screen multiplayer that has its own campaign.\n\nStory:\nHonestly, Polarity doesn't really have a story at all. However, you can peice together a basic story from what you're told.\nYou're a hacker trying to break into one of the greatest firewalls in the world, trying to collect data so you get your reward that was promised to you by an unknown person/thing - 10,000,000 Credits.\n\nGameplay:\nPolarity has you jumping from platform to platform, switching your Polarity (Or, some may call, your color) and carrying and throwing cubes everywhere. What I'm trying to say is that you may have to get through a  red  laser gate, so you have to switch your polarity (Which, by default at the begining of every level, is blue) to, obviously, red. That's different with platforms, however. With platforms, you must switch to the  opposite  color to get across, which leads to switching polarity in mid-air. What I'm trying to say is that your Polarity and ablility to work with cubes is all you need to beat the levels.\n\nPolarity has 14 levels in singleplayer that are not too tough at all, but can actually be a bit fustrating for reasons such as "Crap, put the cube in the wrong spot - Oh, there it goes. Bye cube. Just gotta run back to the other side of the map again to get a new one..." Most of the levels are short, but every now and then, you'll notice repeating concepts in the levels. For exaple, you may have just completed a level where you had to through cubes into switches and now, you're throwing cubes into color changing lasers and then putting them in switches. May not  sound  similar, but once you play, you'll know what I mean. That, however, is not too much of an issue.\n\nUpon getting every Data Crystal in the singleplayer campaign, you unlock the 10 bonus levels. These levels are just  barely  harder then the normal campaign, which is easy once you get the hang of how things work.\n\nDifficulty... That's an issue. This game isn't hard by all means. It's just fustrating. Like in my example above, you can easily throw your cube the wrong way or just barely miss the button for it and *POOF*! It's gone. You'll have to go back and get a new one. Anyways, back to difficulty - It's too easy, in my opinion, to be a puzzle game. WAY too easy. The Data Crystals aren't even cleverly hidden at all. You can easily get all of those. You'll also find yourself breezing through this game. For example, if you have even the slightest bit of knowledge as to what you're doing, you can get through levels in 1-2 minutes each. The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.\n\nAh, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not "I GIVE UP!" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.\n\nTo conclude this review, I give Polarity a 7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard.","June 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't have an incredibly engaging story to it (in fact, save for a short text introduction at the beginning of the game, there's no story to it at all), but at the same time it doesn't really need one. The objective of each level is to use colored cubes to activate corresponding gates and switches to get to the end-level warp while collecting data fragments.\n\nHIGHS: --Gameplay is fun and engaging, albeit a bit bare-bones.\n--Bonus levels and Co-op campaign add much needed replay.\n--The music (or I should ambience) is soothing without becoming repetitive. Accompanied with the easy-on-the-eyes visuals, the game is actually quite calming (in the good way).\n\n\nLOWS: --The levels aren't incredibly challenging. They're enough to make you think, but none will really stump you or leave you stuck.\n--There's a couple important details the game neglects to inform you about. For example, later in the game you'll encounter yellow gates that, turns out, change the color of whatever cube passes through it. An attentive player would be bound to figure this out on their own eventually, but the more casual player may not be so quick to catch on (especially when the FIRST none-red/blue gate you encounter without being informed kills you).\n--The game is FAR too short, especially for the asking price of $10.99 (The single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour, even if you're not the greatest at puzzle games). The game could've, and SHOULD've, been much longer; especially with the multitude of potential puzzles the aforemention yellow gates can bring to the table.\n\n\nBUY or BYE: I say buy, especially if you're a big fan of the Portal series or puzzle games in general. Polaris is not worth the default $11. A good default price would be $5 (perhaps $9.99 at the most), but certainly not $11. HOWEVER, it IS a fun puzzle game that should be experienced, and for the current sales price of $0.54, you can't go wrong!","December 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Polarity mechanics boils down to switching to correct polarity when jumping on colored platforms. Puzzles are trivial and most of the play time comes from traversing unnecessary long distances on foot while constantly holding your "run" key. On a few levels it's literally easier to kill yourself (to reset your position) instead of walking back and forth.\n\nThere is no narration or plot, aesthetically this game is meh, visually it's unpolished even, from time to time you'll see misaligned textures and z-fighting.\n\nSpeaking of play time, single player campaign (not counting bonus levels) takes around 30 minutes to beat, but then it asks you to replay it and 100% it to unlock a "Story 02", which is actually a "Thanks for playing" message written on a black screen.\n\nI guess I could recommend it if you get it very cheap, but this game also requires you to go through extra hoops to be playable on some configurations. If you're playing on a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, open your GPU drivers control panel and switch to 60Hz.\n\nApparently if your framrate is too high, game from time to time doens't register jumps and this game has a lot of platforming. You run towards next platform, you press the jump key, hear the jump sound but there is no jump, you just fall off the ledge. This is extremely frustrating. You can't set the refresh rate in game settings. Judging by the forums, someone tried to contact devs about that issue but it's still not fixed. I also hate the mouse acceleration that is there by default but I couldn't find any mouse settings apart from Y invert, which is probably there just for the controller.","January 10","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Nevertheless, it is a small, modest game, but still a rather pleasing one. The game has decent graphics and smooth gameplay, although the motion blur was a tad disorienting, but that could be disabled. The instructions are simple, and the game is pretty straight forward. Moreover, the puzzles are insanely basic, they are too easy and lack anything remotely complex or challenging to them. The levels feel particularly identical and short. Furthermore, there's no real story, although that being said, a story isn't always necessary. One thing that really ticked me off was that the multiplayer that it supposedly has, is nonexistent, and you must have a controller along with a keyboard in order to play coop.\nTo sum up, the game is very short and lacks many characteristics that make a game good. Considering that the game is actually eleven dollars and not the 20 cents I paid for it, it definetly isn't worth the money. However, I do recognize that polarity has a very small development team and appreciate the game for what it is.","November 13, 2015","false","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know where to begin. It can be a fun timekiller for a little while, but it's never worth the full asking price of 9,99€. It's on sale right now for 0,99€, and I think that should be the normal price, because clearly there didn't go a lot of work into making the game.\n\nI guess the devs went for a clean and minimalist look, like Portal or Q.U.B.E, and I guess it's ok, but it looks rather dull and like something that everyone could piece together in some game construction kit within a couple of minutes.\n\nAll the puzzles are very easy, and not very well designed. If you have ever played user made puzzles for Portal 2, you probably know what I mean. They work, and you had to think a bit about how to solve it, but all in all they seem designed quite badly, compared to the dev-made puzzles. Alle the levels in this game feel the same.\nMost of them don't even use that Polarity concept all that much. It's more about taking a blue or red cube to a receptacle of the same colour and activate something that helps you through the level (platform, acceleration ramp, opening a gate etc.). Sometimes you have to throw the cubes at the receptacles, which works reasonably well.\n\nThe controls are fine, though the air controls seem a bit off.\n\nThe main reason why I think this is worth more like 1€ than 10€ is that the main game consists of 11 (extremely short and easy) levels. There are also 10 bonus levels and a coop campaign, but... come on, really? At about level 8 there suddenly is this new mechanic where you can change the colour of your cube by throwing it through a green force field. This mechanic isn't introduced in any way, and the only reason it's still quite easy to figure out by yourself is because the level design is so bleak that there aren't to much possibilities. It's like "ok, here's this red cube, there's a blue receptacle, and there is nothing else in this room except that green force field over there", so your options are so limited that you soon arrive at the correct solution.\n\nOh, what I didn't mention so far: you also have to collect 3 green glowing things (aka "Datasets") in every room for no apparent reason. Yes, the story tells you why, but they just feel like this arbitrary thing you also have to do that has nothing to do with solving the room's puzzles. Sometimes they're hidden, but that doesn't really work either, because of the empty level design. If you are at the end of the level and you're missing one of them, it's just like "well, then I'll have to go over there where it's probably hidden and where I didn't go before because I had absolutely no reason to".\n\nTL;DR: Puzzles too easy, just 11 levels in the main campaign, bad level design. It's like the easy first few puzzles of other puzzle games, in length as well as in difficulty.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this even at 0,99€ unless you also have someone to play the coop campaign with. I got mine for free, if you can get it free, go for it. It can be entertaining for a short while.","May 24","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can only imagine that's the reason for the cube reset button. More disturbingly, it's the most efficient way to place cubes on a receptacle. If randomly spamming cubes at different angles and hoping one gets caught by the receptacle is the best way of putting a cube on the receptacle, I don't see why I should invest any more of my time in this game.\n\nCertainly wouldn't recommend buying for anything more expensive than the 98% off sale price.\n(I also wouldn't recommend buying it for the sale price since it's such a terrible game, but you get card drops if you actually manage to start it up.)","May 22","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is in some ways comparable to portal, but without the portals. The main gameplay, at least, is similar to portal. You use cubes on pressure pads around each puzzle room, in an attempt to reach the exit. There is the added task of collecting data nodes, on the premise that you are a "hacker" stealing them from a vault. The story doesn't play too much into this except at the beginning and end of the game.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are fairly easy. There were a few that I had to think about solving, but most were solvable in less than 2 minutes. For reference: I was even able to complete the co-op levels as a single player, and the entire game to 100% [with all data nodes collected] within ~3 hours.\n\nThe music doesn't always play in this game, it fades in every now and then with a calming ambient piece. It is very nice, but I don't think there are many tracks that rotate. There isn't any voicing in this game, and beyond text that flashes on screen at the start of the game you are pretty much left to your own devices to figure things out. The graphics in this game are very nice. In some places the shadows look a bit odd, but mostly it looks nice. It has a sort of cell-shaded look, with textures that look fairly minimalistic.\n\nTo summarise this: Despite peoples insistence to compare this to portal, beyond some similar gameplay mechanics it isn't very similar at all. It isn't overly challenging, but if you want some simple first-person puzzles to wile away an afternoon, this is the game to go for.","May 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I wouldn't even classify them as puzzles as they don't really get you thinking.\n-Even though the main mechanic of the game is that you can change your polarity, you suprisngly don't use it that often.\nNot as often as you should. It felt like most of the puzzles used the cubes more than the core mechanic, and that got\nboring fast.\n-Cubes. The physics weren't the best and elevators were the worst. Rising platforms (Elevators) would have a circle pad\nin the middle to put a cube on to raise the platform. However if you fell off the platform you could not get the cube\noff, so you'd have to go back to the beginning and reset the cube back to it's orginal position, and like I said before\nsince the puzzles revolved around them you would have to do whole entire levels again just because you fell.\n-At first I thought the data crytals were supposed to be secret, optional objects you would find in levels. But the hiding\nplaces are so stupid. On one level there's a data crytal in a corner not being blocked by anything, just out in the open.\nAnother level has two of them next to each other. Because of how poorly they are hidden and that the last level requires\nyou to find all of them, I don't think they are optional.\n-The story doesn't make sense. You're a hacker hired by a hacking company. What does that have to do with puzzles?\nDoes the game take place in a computer? It doesn't explain.\n-At the beginning they explain some of the mechanics but later on whenever they introduce a new object they don't\nbother explaining what it does. So good luck trying to find out what to do with a green laser field or a circle ramp.\n-If you thought Portal 1 was short, wait till you play this. I beat all the levels and got all the data\ncrystals in less than 2 hours.\n\nAnd it's sad because the game had so much potenial. The graphics were nice and the polarity mechanic was promising.\nReally, all I have to say about this game is that it is lazy.

I bought it on sale intending to challenge it's self proclaimed brilliance as "The best puzzle game since Portal" After having completed the game I can say that while not as good as any of the Portal games Polarity's clever puzzles and addictive collectables kept my interest. It even has a local co-op mode with more puzzles which were fantastic. The only part of the game where I would say it lacked quality was the story in that it doesn't really exist and when it is there it seems kind of cheesy and out of place.

When I first saw this on Greenlight, I thought this could be the perfect alternative towards Portal & QUBE (because they don't work on my current laptop) but then I heard that this game was discounted at 96%! Hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but I ignored it. I read the description of Polarity, claiming that it's the most fun Puzzle game since Portal (I even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the dev(s) don't even know what Portal was). Gameplay was just too simple & it lasted only for an hour on my side, the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling, this game just wanted me to go to sleep. I also looked around the levels set up & I saw so many flaws that it looked like it was rushed from development just to gain revenue. The worst part about it is that it has no decent story, Portal's story was so fasinating that I want to find out more about its connections with Half-Life 2, Polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels don't look anything like a firewall. In conclusion, If you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price, Get something that was made perfectly & looks challenging (even if it has mixed ratings). All that it can be used now is to haul trading cards & allowing a short sleep mode onto yourself.","June 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Almost the entire time I was wondering when it would get harder. It never did. I never had to think too hard to solve the rooms, or look in obscure corners to get the data fragments. When I finished the game I was left feeling like it had never really gotten started.\n\nIf you’re after an easy, relaxing puzzler that won’t take all day or require a lot of thought, this is very much for you. I would suggest waiting for it to be on sale (I got it for $0.19, and I can’t express how glad I am I didn’t pay $5 for it).\n\nThe game itself looks decent enough. There are little issues here and there, like some minor Z-fighting in spots, and in one level there is a doorway you have to jump through because you get stuck on the lip of the floor otherwise. Nothing game breaking though.\n\nUnfortunately I don’t have any friends with this game, so I can’t say anything about the co-op side of it. Overall it’s an okay game, it’s just not one I’ll be recommending to people unless they want a really simple and short puzzler.","August 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So, adding a Multiplayer feature would be great instead of just having the tag...\n\nBut regardless of its flaws and after completing the game, I'd surely recommend it while hoping that the dev/devs will release some updates to both fix the issues mentioned above and to probably add more content to this nice game.\n","January 8","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Jumping simply doesn't work 80% of the time (you hear the jump noise but don't move), which is incredibly frustrating given this is a puzzle platformer. Gamepad sensitivity is also insanely high by default (although this can be turned down in the options thankfully - I had to set it to 0.1 to be usable). Gamepad button prompts are just missing entirely from some tutorial popups. The camera clips as you approach walls in co-op. If these bugs were addressed (and none of them seem like challenging issues) it would be a much more polished experience.

It's such a quintessentially human act to try to confine judgments or opinions to pure dichotomies.  Steam.  Anyway!\n\nI do think that Polarity - or Portal without Portals, if you like - has a good, if fairly derivative, concept.  Essentially, in lieu of having a portal gun, one can simply change their own polarity, which manifests in either being Red or Blue.  Like colours pass like barriers, and this mechanic (sadly under-used) also applies to the transportable blocks which act as energy keys to platforms, doors and so on.  The player is required to synergise aim, timing and puzzle-solving skills, but the levels never reach that beautiful climax of having length, difficulty and multi-modal challenge in one playable experience.  Things just don't scale up in an intuitive or exciting way; I don't think there are enough mechanics employed  throughout and I don't think the mechanics used have been pushed to their limits.  The relatively short length of the game also contributes to this prosaicness, I think.\n\nThe total lack of a plot hurts the game.  The data files that players can optionally collect as they journey through the database they're supposedly hacking could have been used to provide background -- why is this data important?  Who is hiring you and why?  Is what you're doing 'right', or does morality even matter in this situation?  Instead, we get a few throwaway lines about earning a bunch of credits and being hired by a company we know absolutely nothing about.   Another perhaps unexpected side-effect of the lack of plot is that, since quite a few levels look similar to each other, they don't really have enough of an identity in their own right.   When the mechanic is used as the Jewel in the Game Crown and it's great, a significant plot isn't necessarily that important... but it wasn't great here and the game really could have used at least more than it had.\n\nThe game works.  Movement isn't always smooth, and the camera was somewhat too sensitive in my opinion, but the puzzles all work as intended and they aren't chance-based.  This is good.  The blocks throw fairly well considering there's only one strength setting, although they don't interact at all well with walls and tend to clip poorly.  Having the choice to sprint is appreciated, and the mechanics are intuitive and make sense without needing much explanation -- over-explanation (or the need for it) is a flaw of quite a few modern games.  The graphics and sound are functional but don't excite in their own right.  I'll concede that the relative lack of interesting sound doesn't abjectly cripple the game, and I did enjoy the different coloured hues used in some rooms.  I just got a bit bored of seeing the same tiling in every room and think that even ambient music could have added contouring to the gamescape.\n\nI don't have a gamepad, so I effectively can't comment on the co-op mode.  I wish that the co-op section didn't have achievements, but that's another topic for another day.\n\nIn summary, I'd say that it's a good base idea, but it's lacking in finesse, inspiration and length.  When you're selling a game devoid of plot completely on the mechanic and the mechanic hasn't been used to its full potential, it comes off as underwhelming.

It isn't Portal and it didn't grab me, I'm afraid, but it is an acceptable functional, working game.","May 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It could be made into a great game like Portal and Talos Principle if it had a better story (instead of just about 5 lines of text telling you what the story is) and if it was better technically.\n\nIt is extremely buggy. You'll fall through walls, you'll have the cube you're carrying fall out of your hands for no reason. I played the coop mode with a friend and what he tells me was "it feels like a school project". And he's right, it doesn't feel like a finished product, it feels like some prototype from 2008. There are a lot of strange design choices, from the ugly menus, to some objects behaving really strangely (like the fact that in coop, at the end of every level there are two spots to exit the level, and it won't end the level until the first player is on the left spot and the second player on the right spot, switching spots won't work) (or the fact that you can walk through gun turrets instead of having to dodge their bullets).\n\nStill, if you like puzzlers, you could still like it (I liked it, even though I don't feel ok recommanding it since it doesn't feel like a finished product). I don't think it's worth the 10$ they are normally asking, but if you can get it on a sale like I did it could still be worth it, but be ready to have your patience tested, not so much by the puzzles as by the bugs. It took me 3 hours to get through all of it (single, coop, bonus levels), but it could have easily taken me one hour less if I hadn't had to deal with all the bugs and weird design mistakes.","December 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The music is underwhelming, and the graphics are entirely from 20+ years ago. The gist? You need to collect 3 hazy green cylinders (data), and touch the end column of the level.

Nope.. Though may be fun for a little bit. Also has co-op so you can enjoy a small game with a friend. Get it when it's cheap...

It could be made into a great game like Portal and Talos Principle if it had a better story (instead of just about 5 lines of text telling you what the story is) and if it was better technically.\n\nIt is extremely buggy. You'll fall through walls, you'll have the cube you're carrying fall out of your hands for no reason. I played the coop mode with a friend and what he tells me was "it feels like a school project". And he's right, it doesn't feel like a finished product, it feels like some prototype from 2008. There are a lot of strange design choices, from the ugly menus, to some objects behaving really strangely (like the fact that in coop, at the end of every level there are two spots to exit the level, and it won't end the level until the first player is on the left spot and the second player on the right spot, switching spots won't work) (or the fact that you can walk through gun turrets instead of having to dodge their bullets).\n\nStill, if you like puzzlers, you could still like it (I liked it, even though I don't feel ok recommanding it since it doesn't feel like a finished product). I don't think it's worth the 10$ they are normally asking, but if you can get it on a sale like I did it could still be worth it, but be ready to have your patience tested, not so much by the puzzles as by the bugs. It took me 3 hours to get through all of it (single, coop, bonus levels), but it could have easily taken me one hour less if I hadn't had to deal with all the bugs and weird design mistakes.","December 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I spent more time falling off the edge and getting back up to get where I was at. Eventually I got to a point where I needed to parkour my way to a switch. After the time I spent trying to make 3 jumps, do you honestly think I am going to try 8 jumps? 0.19 cents is a good price to GIFT this game to someone you know as a joke so that they play and rage about the broken game.

You can complete it in under 1 hour if you're fast enough. Co-op mode should be online but developer liked more the "Friend and Controller" idea. In whole game you can see XBOX buttons. You can bug at random small obstacles or random things. [And you need to jump then...] Also you can see textures overleaping into themselves.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n7/10 - "Short but fun.

You would be better off buying something like Portal. Polarity has a lack of content and looks terrible. The co-op is local and that's pretty dumb unless you are playing on a TV. The game was fun but only for a short time. It could easily be finished in a single playthrough. Also, the bonus levels are even easier than the base level which still lacks content. There is honestly no reason to but this game. It is short, way to easy, has a terrible UI, (looks like something the 90's) and it just gets more and more boring. If you want to buy this game, dont expect much. This is not what I thought it would be. Please save up money and buy a better game like Portal 2.

The gameplay itself is god-awful, with incredibly wonky physics that accomplish such things as nearly breaking your screen from a decent fall, or shifting cubes across the stage when it's impossible to do so (rotating a portion of the stage also rotates any cubes that come from it, even if it's not inside said rotated area). The UI is clunky, poorly designed (Can't go to options without quitting everything you're doing), and the game looks ugly overall.\n\nThe only redeeming factors I could think of would be its short length, which made it semi-bearable to finish, and its low price tag.","July 10, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've only played the single player mode, so all this is based only on that mode (no idea what co-op is like).\nThe game takes a few things from Portal and Antichamber as well.\n\nThe game mechanics, the launh pads, the blocks and the way blocks activate platforms is well known from Portal while the graphical style, the very simplistic, bold style with a thick black outline around certain objects looks pretty similar to Antichamber at times.\n\nI found the puzzles to be pretty easy to complete. Near the end the puzzles actually became more challenging, but yeah, that was at the end. Definitely not on the same difficulty level as Portal's chambers in my opinion.\n\nHaving said that if you find Portal too challenging then this game might just be for you. Bare in mind though that you're going to want to play this for the puzzles and not for the story as there isn't much to it. Also if you're thinking about buying Portal but you're uncertain as to whether or not you'll like that kind of game then you may want to get this first given that it's quite similar in terms of gameplay and (at the moment) dirt cheap.\n\nSummary: For 20 cents the game is more than worth it. It's not that difficult in my opinion and could definitely use some more levels and perhaps a bit less headbobbing, but still well worth it.","July 11, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has potential and some great ideas, but the game creators do not utilize these ideas to their fullest. The game introduces a new mechanic, and then when that mechanic is used to perform a basic task, onto the next mechanic we move. The whole game feels like a tutorial because only one level (one of the bonus levels) required the slightest bit of strategic thinking.

I found Polarity and bought it (with Soundtrack) for 24 Cents. I booted it up and saw a crappy interface. But as I started the game, I realized I found one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.\n\nDid you ever wonder what a futuristic puzzle game without a plot would be? I tell you what I'd be. It'd be POLARITY. But no plot is necessary for this awesome game. To be honest, there is a plot, given on Level 0. But be careful, You might miss it if you blink.\n\nI was very sceptical about the concept. It revolves around switching modes, so-called "Polarities". You have 2 Polarities availiable, RED and BLUE. And you can switch between them freely at any time. The first three Levels are Tutorial Levels introducing you to the concept of polarities and switching them. There are many new elements and mechanics I have never seen in any game before, like the Cubes. Like Polarities, there are two of them. Blue cubes activate blue switches and - you guessed it - red cubes activate red switches. It also introduces you to the concept of collecting Data Packs, which kind of work like Marios Star Coins.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get to every three Packs in each levels and finish the stage, of course. There are 14 Levels, 10 bonus levels and a challenging cooperative mode. The price of 10 Dollars is - sadly - too much for this game. I recommend it to anyone who can get it on Sale.\n\nMy final rating is a Tangram out of ten.\nLike Tangram, It seems clunky and edgy, but if you get the hang of it, it is a pleasant and fun experience. The Co-Op-Mode serves as a big challenge for anyone, who likes to puzzle with a friend.\n\nThere are small minor graphical glitches, but that may be because of the fact I play it on Maximum Quality.\n\nTL;DR: Good puzzler. Red and blue. Switches and cubes. Good game.","October 29, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a lot of fun with this game, actually. This game is just like portal, except the puzzles are harder (imo) and you don't have a gun that shoots portals. This game focuses mostly on cubes and puzzling. There is no antagonist and there is no protagonist, you're just simply hacking into a system of some sort. What I really loved about this game is how original it is. The only real inspiration found here is from Portal and that's about it. The rest of the game is COMPLETELY original. This game takes more of a fast and jumping around approach and forces you to react quickly, otherwise you may have to restart the level. This game has lots of pros, but some cons as well, but it's kind of expected. Overall, I had TONS of fun with this game, but some of the issues the game had were very frusterating and distracting. It made it harder to play and made my playthrough very tough.\n\nPros\n- Original game\n- Fast paced, in-your-face gameplay\n- No distracting elements (except for a bug I'm going to mention)\n- Thought provoking puzzles\n- Soothing and calm soundtrack (It really reminded me of Mirror's Edge for it's serene and mellow soundtrack)\n- Co-Op Campaign\n- Great visuals\n\nCons\n- Buggy\n- Experienced frame rate drops for a few seconds (c'mon, this game can be ran on a potato, it shouldn't have FR drops)\n- Feels like a game that failed Xbox's market\n- Unsupported resolutions (1440 x 900 and up isn't supported. I should know because that's my native resolution)\n\nOverall Rating/Conclusion\n7/10 - I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't buggy and supported better resolutions. Since my resolution (1440 x 900) wasn't supported, I was lowered to 1366 x 768 and experienced a problem with the Steam Overlay and FPS meter. If I used my Steam Overlay key (Shift + Tab) and closed it, the overlay would still be remenicent on the black lines where the game isn't shown (on the outskirts of the game) and same goes for the FPS meter and any notification I get (messages, friends coming online, friends going into game, etc). This bug really upped the "♥♥♥♥ meter" because it was VERY distracting and annoying. If these bugs and issues are fixed, I'd be GLAD to give it a higher rating because I think it deserves a higher one, it just can't be done unless these bugs are fixed.","May 9, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing too taxing on the brain, but attempting to find all of the data packs (there are three of them hidden in each level) can be a real challenge and the idea of polarity-switching is used to good effect. The similarities to Portal are well-known at this point; you find yourself in a sleek, enclosed environment and use your wits (and cubes) to reach the exit. If you enjoyed Portal, you'll enjoy this, but it would be doing the game a disservice to call it a Portal clone; it has its own ideas and systems that are well thought-out and smoothly executed throughout.\n\nThe game is void of any real plot or humour, but those things aren't needed here. It's a simple little game and quite a relaxing way to flex your puzzling muscles for an hour or two, without any extra baggage forcefully added on. I've not been able to enjoy the co-op campaign just yet, but if the singleplayer is anything to go by then it must be a lot of fun.

Levels offer unique and challenging puzzles that are very satisfying to solve.\n\nAs a side note, this game offers co-op mode. It would be great if this could be done online, as I can't play dualscreen with my friends over the internet.","May 10, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, it's very short. 5/10\n\nFull Review:\nThere isn't much to talk about this. The story is almost non-existent and is just a bunch (~20 + 10 extras) of really short levels (5min max if you want to get everything in each level). I'd say that the concept is kinda cool: instead of Portals, you have you manipulate your own "polarity", between red or blue if you don't want to die from lasers of that color, if you want to be above platforms of those colors and even transport cubes of those colors without desintegrating them.\n\nAs a puzzle game, I didn't find it hard, only slightly on very specific segments that you have to get some items to unlock the ending. It should be more as an introdutory puzzle game to kids ages 8 and lower rather than to teens and adults used to more complex games like The Talos Principle and PQ (the psp exclusive). If you fall on the latter category, this game should be just one or two hours long.\n\nOn the other hand, this game often comes *really* cheap, like dirt cheap (some 50 cents... no pun intended), so the price/game hours ratio isn't that bad. The experience itself is bug-free and the visual is simple and a little retro, so it's nice to relax if you want something for that. Visuals are quite simple as well, but don't strain the eyes.\n\nOverall, it is a fair game... I mean, fairly standard. Short, cheap, soothing, but nothing more. Well, it has multiplayer, but it's not that entertaining as other puzzle multiplayer games. So, just don't expect much.","November 28, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looks good doesn't it? Just wait. Once you get in you say to yourself, "Hey this looks like Portal!" and you'd be right, its a Portal rip off. Now I will give it credit, it isn't  half  bad like all the other Portal and Portal 2 rip offs out there. I honestly want to recommend it, I do! Its just... the design flaws are numerous. Just to state the worse one I've encountered, you have to restart the entire level if you just so happen to lose a single cube on the other side of something, anything! Nope, theres no way to get one back, no way to respawn one, worst of all.... Theres no checkpoints to combat this. In my opinion this game way made by a single person, in Unity, in a week. Funniest thing is, its price. $11 USD. Yes, 11 (thats ELEVEN) for this.\n\nAnd then you have people (like myself, I suppose.) comparing it to Portal and Portal 2. No, just no. This can't be, comparing something full of elegance, grace, and best of all, potatos packed with A.I, to this?! No, you're kidding ;_;! Please tell me everyones kidding. This game has no: story, dialouge, no backstory, no lore, no... nothing. But levels that look like they were made in Blender, or Unity. A menu that for some reason feels like it was copied and pasted from a flash game. Physics just don't feel right for something like this, I mean jumping off of a moving platform and flying 30 feet in the wrong direction, is just... not right for this type of game. So how do people think its ok to compare this to Portal?! [sl] Man, I must sound like a hypocrit.[/sl]\n\nFrom what I've read, the devs are inactive. Last update was months in the past! So, clearly theres no hope for a story, dialouge, or anything for that fact. So honestly, is this the biggest scam since Cube World, or what? I mean for $11 USD, thats all I think it is. But all in all, great game for 90%+ off :D!\n\nBut, thank God Valve gave us the chance to get refunds. >.>","November 9, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed the single player mode and bonus mode. I felt for a puzzle game it was extremely easy. The puzzles never really feel like puzzles, they don't require problem solving skills or thought, it's mostly trial and error or find the object and bring it here mixed with some minor platforming. It's also a very short game that had a lot of rough edges and minor bugs that held it back from being a better experience. There were a lot of interesting mechanics and ideas in this game but they aren't really used to a greater extent. They introduce new mechanics but never actually use them later in a compelling and challenging way. Because of that it comes off as a bit gimmicky. A bunch of interesting ideas never fully realized. Graphical issues were also a bit of an eyesore but overall the game looked okay.\n\nThis could be a great puzzle game if more time was put into it and it was polished up a bit. More puzzles and more thought put into their design would really improve the gameplay as well. Currently though, it's just an okay puzzle game for a cheap price. If you like puzzle games and cheap prices, than this is worth a decent hour of your time.","July 15, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole single-player campaign is done in 2-3 hours. Nice mechanic ideas, but they could be used more often and with a little bit more finesse. Here and there you can watch through walls or a bad spawn point lets you restart the whole level again. The game looks a little bit cheap, but it's price is cheap indeed and therefore worth it! Recommended for Portal likers and puzzle fans ready for an easy race.","September 16, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has great potential and I love the concept... it's very Portal inspired but has it's own neat set of mechanics. Sadly, they are very, very clunky. Game doesn't seem very polished, it seems a bit rushed to me. The controls are pretty screwed up and poorly designed. Overlal this game seems very rough around the edges. All it needs is some tweaking and it could be great! Until them I have to give it a thumbs down... I really do like this game, though. :/","July 24, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
