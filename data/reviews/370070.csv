This game reminds me so much of WarCraft II and playing it just confirms my first impression.\nWyrmsun has many similarities to WarCraft II both in its visual style and gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe game supports both single- and multiplayer games and the shines, like any other RTS, when played with or against other people. The single player mode is very similar to the scenario mode from WarCraft II where you face one or more AI opponents on a selection of different maps but there's a big difference between these two games. While you have access to every unit and building in the latter you have to complete Quests in order to gain technology points. Once you decided which technology you want to unlock you can use it during you're next quest to see if you made a good choice or if you have to reset your technology tree to approach the quest in a different way. Besides that Wyrmsun features a built-in editor so players can create own maps to their liking.\n\nAnd now we are coming to my personal favorite.\nThe Grand Strategy Game. It may sound like a different game but it's just the name of the second single player mode.\nYou may wonder why it is called like that. Well let me explain. This mode is divided into two parts. Unlike campaign mode you manage your production and research on a turn-based global map. If this sounds already good you will like the second part as well since the combat takes place on a terrain you are used to from other RTS games: maps in real time. Besides that there are also Quests for you to complete. Sounds good doesn't it?\nIt's just a different approach which I really happened to like.\n\nAlso there's another thing that separates Wyrmsun from your usual fantasy setting. The mythological creatures like the Dwarves don't exist in the same world as the Humans. The human campaign takes place on your favorite planet: Earth. While the Dwarves have their place on Nidavellir.\nSince they both dwell in different realms in the campaign mode and won't face each, they will either fight against or alongside the fantasy factions in custom games.\n\nFor the people that are also into the lore of Wyrmsun the game features an in-game encyclopedia.\nThis allows players to learn more about the units, building and other elements of the game and additional to that about the sources of inspiration whether historical or mythological.\n\nAnd the best part? Mods.\nWyrmsun is a game with high mod potential and features built in Steam Workshop integration.\nSo what does that mean for the game and the players? In the future there'll be, hopefully, custom made settings, units, buildings and more depending on the player base.\n\nSo what can I say about Wyrmsun?\nI really enjoyed Wyrmsun, especially the Grand Strategy Game. The game is very similar to Warcraft II but it would be foolish to assume that it's just a clone. It has it's own unique charm and it's well worth your time.","May 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","42","52","2","8"

This is an incredible game. Total ressurection of the retro Warcraft 2 style except much improved in many ways that really modernize it. This game supports shift+click to command a unit to do a sequence of tasks, it supports unlimited selecting of units, and it supports massive resolutions (and i dont mean stretching, it actually allows you to have more of the map on your screen which is SUPER cool). Love this game. Have yet to try the multiplayer but I imagine it's most excellent. Highly recommend downloading this if you like RTSs, oldschool Age of Empires or Warcraft, or you just want a fun strategy game for free.

I WATCHED the dev nit pick each bug from the forums and fix it within hours of finding them. He even took community ideas like making the gryphon rider a buildable unit and others!

In a game you will found a single player and multiplayer too.\n\nThe single player have the second one mode too, what named Grand Strategy Game. Here you should manage a production, research in the map and complete quests. This you are doing in turn based mode, but the battles here you should do in real time. This mix can be really enjoyable.\n\nAlso ingame you will found a well detailised encyclopedia when you will found all information about the units, buildings etc.\n\nThe game have a map editor, also another good feature of the game is a steam workshop, so players who really like it can create for this a lot of own content.\nIn a single player after that whey you are completed a actual quest you will earn a technology points, what you can spend after for unlocking some technology, after that in a next quest you are able to use it.\n\nThe game graphic completed in retro style and look very nice, sounds and music too very well.\n\n+steam workshop\n+trading cards\n+good music\n+nice retro style\n+nostalgic atmosphere\n\n-no steam achievements\n\nSo what i can say?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/370070/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Now here’s one for you Redditors out there. Andrettin has had a keen presence on Reddit with its subreddit (/r/Wyrmsun) and the developers continued discussions throughout a number of the gaming subreddits since well before its public release. I am a firm believer that community is vitally important. I believe that engaging with that community is one of the most vital things that a brand can do – whether that brand is a gaming company, developer, publisher, media site or even a humble blog with extras such as Steamified. You can transform the message that you are attempting to put out to the world from just a few words on a scattered mission statement to an active, vibrant and living culture. It certainly has a positive influence for Wyrmsun as players engage their thoughts and submit their bug reports in an open and friendly manner thus improving the game to a greater capacity than would otherwise be possible.\n\nWyrmsun is an old school real-time strategy adventure game. It takes me back to some of the most memorable games I played back in the early 1990’s. The title that specifically comes to mind is Westwood Studios Dune II. I’ve seen others compare it to the original Warcraft games and I can definitely see the similarities too. The game would certainly fit within that era of gaming and for the most part would be considered to have done very well in doing so. But therein lays a potential problem and raises the question as to whether or not it is too much of a throwback to be enjoyable to a modern gaming audience.\n\nI would imagine that the answer to that question would be mixed. There are some who love and appreciate retro gaming and there are others who just cannot abide by difficulty levels, the lack of instruction and really the way in which the game throws you in at the deep end and expects you to swim without floaties. There is little to no hand holding here and understandably that will push some of you away. I personally love these types of games to the point where once I’m engrossed it’s difficult to pull me back out.\n\nWyrmsun is a game that I would personally really like to see succeed. At the rate that Andrettin continues to work on the game – long after its official release and without it ever being considered an early access title – I believe that he will ultimately get the game where he wants it to be. The community is supportive and active because he has provided them a hands on approach. It’s a wise approach that other developers should follow.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 11","true","3.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

In terms of gameplay, Wyrmsum fixes what needed fixing and adds and improves on what already works in every way.\nWhat lets this game down I think is the art - not enough thought was put into it. Sure it looks fine for the most part, and never goes as low as terrible, but the tilesets are bland and merely utilitarian, and the units all look way too similar. Until you've played it for hours you can barely tell the differece between your peasants, warriors, archers etc even from their profile pics. Good luck telling them apart at a glance on the map. I feel it really needed a clear artistic and stylistic direction.\n\nIn warcraft II each tile felt like it was lovingly painted, not only to fit in with the overall style, but also to be unique and with its own fine details that gave maps character and made them interesting. Each unit, too, had its own instantly recognizable silhouette so that in the heat of battle you didn't find yourself at a complete loss as to who is who. It seems incredibly strange that the dev felt the need to make each individual guy have differently coloured hair and their own personal name, but put no effort to make the units actually stand out from one another.\n\nOther than that, I kinda like the sound effects - the sword noises sound like cutlerly being gently tapped against each other and its kinda cute. The encycopaedia is nice (if badly implemented. Talk about having a wall of text thrown at you), the world building is solid and the moddability is a plus. If you liked warcraft II you should like this game, especially if you can wait for some graphics mods or are artistic and want to attempt your own (*hint hint* Please someone make some new tilesets and unit graphics)","December 17, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

AI always knows where you're at, while the map is dark to you.\n\nSeems the AI has unlimited resources.....\n\nTried a custom game, was overrun in 10 minutes by two 20 plus armies on easy. Oddly I only selected one enemy. This tells me difficulty has no bearing on the game what so ever.\n\nTried the Grand Campaign, had no clue what to do, was overrun again on the first battle. How I got into that battle I have no idea.\n\nTried Quest. Well that's all it is, one Quest. You get a bunch of warriors, wander around the map until you find the camp, destroy it, and that's it. Takes you to a screen where you can either reset the tech tree or go to previous menu. Previous menu ends game.\n\nFrom what I saw, the maps are very small.\n\nUninstalled this garbage.","December 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","11","24","3","0"

You just have to keep trying to get the "right" generation, and or reduce the difficulty.\n\n6) The tilesets, other than the trees are really rather unatractive and gloomy. Regardless of where you are.\n\n7) The AI having unlimited resources, is very annoying especially on certain missions, on a number of missions i had to play for an additional 20 minutes just because of this. Also the unlimited resources forces you down, "the set conpletion path" meaning there is only one way to do each mission most of the time.\n\n8) The AI is not very smart, in fact its really rather dumb.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1) mhm... nope cant think of one.","September 23, 2015","false","11.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

Now, this isn't inherently bad, because that was a great game and a modern-day take on it would be refreshing and fun. This game also brings a Grand Strategy mode to the table, which could be an interesting addition to an engine and style that could implement it well.\n\nAs far as the traditional RTS side of things, this is not a modern-day take. This is basically a weird re-skin. Every detail of the interface is essentially the same, and that brings with it every bit of clunkiness that the original WCII interface had. There's no effort made here to streamline or improve, and because the developers failed to give this game the polish that its inspiration had, this ends up being a vastly inferior, near bootleg-tier clone.\n\nThis leads me to the Grand Strategy portion. I am honestly not sure of what I think of it, really. If you're good at Grand Strategy already, you might be able to get some mileage out of it, but as a beginner to the genre I found the barrier for entry cripplingly high, and the surprisingly exhaustive Encyclopedia function to be of little help despite how comprehensive it seems to be. All the Encyclopedia feature did for me was introduce me to concepts I didn't even think were in the game, and I left even more confused than I was before.\n\nI don't really like the fact that I can't recommend this game, but it comes off feeling like an unfinished product, like the team behind this game needed more time and better people to help it really come to life. As it is, it's bland, it's confusing, it's clunky, it's not great.","May 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","3"
