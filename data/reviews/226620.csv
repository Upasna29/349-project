With Desktop Dungeons, it's just too hard." — Kakie, Corsual Live Viewer\n\nI have a confession to make. I'm not proud of it, but I haven't finished Desktop Dungeons. I strive to complete all of the games I review prior to writing, but in this case the cross was too great to bear.\n\nMy failure came not through lack of trying — I tried for many, many hours — but from an overwhelming level of difficulty. Not the bad kind of difficulty, where cheap opponents consistently barrage you until you die hurling an overpriced controller against the nearest wall, but the good kind of difficulty, that will see you thinking — really thinking — about every move you make, every time you make it, lest your adventure come to a inconveniently early end.\n\nFortunately, I appreciate a challenge. Hell, I crave it. But in the end, it turned out that there was more to accomplish, collect and unlock in this roguelike dungeon crawler than I could ever hope to discover in just 2 weeks, and so, I began my review in advance.\n\nWITHOUT FURTHER ADO...\nI first saw Desktop Dungeons while watching MANvsGAME; Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope, who composed the soundtrack, were there alongside one of the core developers, Danny Day.\n\nThey discussed many of the basic game concepts; the randomly generated dungeons and roguelike nature, spell-casting warriors, the coming mobile release, the difference between a harpsichord and clavinet and the origins of Granny Kirkanowsky.\n\nListening in, amidst the constant laughter, I quickly learned that DD has something of a cult following that grew around an alpha build released to the public years back and available free today, which led to it winning the IGF Award Winning for Game Design. Immediately, I downloaded it to take a look.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\nThe alpha turned out to be a crude version of the one MAN was playing. It looked very different — the hand-drawn art wasn't present, instead offering a more traditional pixel art style, and the entire progression mechanic was missing, so choosing a dungeon was as simple as selecting a race, class and difficulty.\n\nThough I was watching MAN play a clearly superior version, I still felt entirely engaged playing the alpha due to the 'roguelike' nature of the gameplay. Every dungeon was different, and though my imminent demise was almost always a single click away, the ability to head straight back in, new knowledge in hand, to a completely new dungeon, maintained my interest throughout the entire night.\n\nThat's when I made my purchase, gained access to the browser-operated (sans-soundtrack) beta and began to compare.\n\nNEW IS ALWAYS BETTER\nAfter a brief serving of story and a short tutorial explaining the basics I was directed to my very own kingdom, a world map of sorts, comprised mostly of open space and human inhabited houses. After completing a dungeon, more buildings appeared.  An elven habitat, a mage tower, a church...\n\nI quickly realised that the original 'choose race, choose class, choose difficulty' menu featured in the alpha had been replaced here with progressive RPG elements via the kingdom, including a huge host of quests, and that unlike the alpha, races and classes here required an unlock before they could be used.\n\nThe game continued forward, revealing multiple new features. Gold could be collected from dungeons and kept afterward, and then used to purchase preparation items that could be used in future dungeon attempts, or saved to unlock new buildings in the kingdom.\n\nEventually, I was introduced to the tavern, which served as a hub allowing access to multiple dungeon types. It was here that the largest difference between the alpha and beta made their appearance — there's more than one dungeon type in the full version. A lot more.\n\nDON'T ♥♥♥♥ OFF THE DEITIES\nThat's when things started getting tough, and it was at about that time that the full Steam release arrived, this one complete with Granny K's masterpiece soundtrack.\n\nI was happy to learn that the progress I'd made in the beta was saved, and too, that even though I could now play the full release on Steam, I could continue to do so from my browser if I chose. Everything is saved online, so portable gaming is a legitimate option. A good thing, too, as Desktop Dungeons lends itself perfectly to quick gaming when you've only got 10 minutes to spare. Come on mobile version...\n\nWhere was I... oh, right. It's hard. Even the normal dungeons are hard. And the hard dungeons are a lot f@&ing harder. God only knows if there are even harder dungeons around the bend, but if there are, you'll likely need God's help to complete them. Well, at least one of the Gods, anyway.\n\nYes, yes... I know. Terrible segway, yada-yada. Gods are the key to victory in many of the dungeons, yet they're also a leading cause of death. The decision to adopt a deity is usually a hard one — on the one hand, they offer amazing buffs and bonuses that are generally the key to victory, on the other, they'll restrict you in various ways, punishing you severely for whatever they deem misconduct — though mastering their ways is essential.\n\nTHIS IS THE GAME THAT NEV-ER ENDS\nThat's where the other 'game mode' really helps: Puzzles. After unlocking the Explorer's Guild building in your kingdom you'll have access to a series of puzzles - dungeons that aren't generated randomly, but instead, have a single specific solution that you must discover in order to succeed.\n\nThey double as great ways to learn more information about the various items, weapons, spells, deities and conversion materials on offer, and though not everyone will need them, they're highly advised if you're having difficulty completing certain quests or dungeons.\n\nAnd that's everything I know. Almost. I know that of the nine classes I've unlocked there are another nine to go. I know that of the four races I've unlocked there are another... actually I don't know how many more there are. One, at least. I found him once — a Halfling trapped in a dungeon within a dungeon who nicked my last potion— but failed and haven't seen him since. That's a lot of the fun in Desktop Dungeons; every dungeon is different, and you never know what you're going to get. If you like The Binding of Isaac, or Spelunky, or more appropriately, Rogue Legacy, which offers a similar style of 'progressive roguelike' gameplay, then there's a great chance you'll love Desktop Dungeons, too. It's as hard as the others — perhaps even harder in its own way — but if you're not one to shy from a challenge then there's a lot to enjoy.","November 29, 2013","true","29.5"," 272 of 323 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","272","323","0","1"

Around noon on Friday they sat me down in front of a PC and had me try the game - apparently I did well (I looked at the goblin before attacking it and noticed it had first strike). After a merry but short romp through the introduction dungeon, which ended with a green blob of slime eating my poor adventurer, I went on to explore the rest of the Indie Megabooth. Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).\n\nThe game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.\nIt may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.\nAnd there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).\n\nBut how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the "character creation" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name], For Generic Adventuring, Race: Human, Class: Warrior, Equipment: starting adventurer's kit. Then you would play the dungeon with a simple lvl 1 human warrior.\nAs the game progresses you unlock more races, classes and can provide better starting equipment and other bonuses, making each run unique.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Your kingdom needs you! Oh, you need a permit? To: Unnamed Desktop Dungeon Kingdom, For: Kingdom Administration, Race: Human, Class: Gamer. There you go, your permit to play the game.\nAnd yes, the alpha version is available for free to try out :)","August 23, 2014","true","81.8"," 109 of 118 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","109","118","6","5"

A nearly perfectly executed puzzle game which captures in an abstract way the dungeon crawling roguelikes which have sprung up like kobolds in the indie market.  You can finish a dungeon in five minutes if you're the impatient sort or if like me you like to mull over optimal moves, a board might take  fifteen minutes or so.  There is a light and humorous background story to give the puzzles a campaign-like structure but War and Peace it ain't.  Which isn't a problem at all as this is the type of game which you'll load up when you have some random time to kill.  You will unlock various ways to customize each dungeon, such as starting equipment, races, classes, gods, etc.  The graphics are cute, the gameplay is tight, the music is not annoying.

I understand.\n\nDesktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that "bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level, & sometimes you don't find out until 10 minutes later.  One time my mouse was on the fritz & occassionally registered two clicks from one press.  It rendered this game unplayable.  However, overall it was a positive entertainment experience, in that I preferred it over staring at a wall.\n\nSo why is this review in the "not recommended" section?  I don't find the quality of entertainment worth the price tag.  There are plenty of other games out there that can offer a similar playstyle, are more immersive, have greater replayability, & cost a fraction of what I paid for Desktop Dungeons.  While this is a decently good game, it's not $15-good.  Its inflated cost is also reflected in its soundtrack- an arbitrary $10 for something that many games include for free.  Wait for a sale, preferably at least 30% off, hopefully more.","February 3, 2014","false","104.8"," 355 of 526 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","355","526","0","32"

By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.\n\nGame in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?\n\nThe only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.\n\nThe 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.\n\nBecause every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.\n\nSo, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.\n\nIf that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.  I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight.","November 27, 2013","false","9.8"," 111 of 151 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","111","151","0","8"

However if you're like me and enjoy more traditional rpgs then this game isn't for you. The graphics are standard roguelike graphics with chracter pieces not sprites added in. The music is very catchy and fun. This game can be like an extremely quick and complex version of D&D or an even more complex and long game similar to D&D. This game is well made while being easy on the surface it takes a bit to master it. If I were basing this review off of my experience alone I'd give it a 6/10 just because it isn't my kind of game.

It seemed fairly random, simple, and frustrating. About 10 or so hours in, I started to understand how the game actually works. Then, things started to click. The game ultimately, is a puzzle game, and a very unforgiving, but rewarding one. Utilize your blackspace effectively, monsters are a resource, leveling up is a resource not to be wasted.\n\nHaving to kill 1 Level 10 boss seemed daunting, but when you think you've finally learned how to do it, they then throw 2 Level 10 bosses at you! How the hell am I supposed to beat that? But guess what? I did it. I was thinking, sweet, I know how to play this game. Then, the next set of dungeons appear. Defeat 3 Level 10 bosses. No way, impossible. how the hell do you do that? An hour later, the first of those dungeons falls. The next thing I know, I have to kill 10 of these bosses? IMPOSSIBLE, and do it 3 times with 3 different classes?\n\nEvery time you think you've learned what to do, the game surprises and challenges you to do 1 better.

I played a ton of alpha, even after I had unlocked everything and finished all the levels.  It was a lot of fun, and I appreciated the minimalism of the game.  I paid for the advance copy something like three years ago, played the game, then stopped and sort of put it behind me for a while.\n\nThen, just a couple weeks ago, I saw that it was released on steam.  While I thought about looking up my copy of it, minutes later I received a message saying because I paid in advance I got a steam key!\n\nSo, I cracked it open.  And for a brief minute, I was shocked.  This isn't the blocky spreadsheet I remember!  Where did all these graphics come from?  Why are these characters saying things?  A town?  I miss my grid of things!\n\nOf course I got over that quick.  What I wasn't sure about is what changes there would be, and after playing about 10 hours of the game, I am excited to say that I think they've put an amount of polish on top that has made the game even more nuanced, more complex and overall, well, more.\n\nThe base aspects of the game are the same.  You are in a dungeon with monsters levels 1-10.  Killing them nets XP, but killing monsters of a higher level than you gets you exceptionally more experience.  And you will need to kill higher level monsters, because otherwise you are unlikely to level high enough to kill the boss.  Lucky for you, the monsters are pretty lacksadaisical and tend to just stand around in the same spot, and won't strike unless you strike first.\n\nIt also has a clever mechanic where revealing tiles in the dungeon is the prime method of regaining life and mana (aside from leveling, which refills all your life and mana). The monsters also refill their life, though, so you can't just take anything out by regaining your life over and over.\n\nIt sounds simple, but when you count class skills, items, gods and so many other factors, there is just so much to this game.  And the random generation of levels makes every game, even of just random games, a thrill and a different experience.  And I love the way they build level by level as you experience more and more - the learning curve here is a big improvement on the original which pretty much threw you right into the fray and you had to guess what would be hard or easy.  Frankly, that never bothered me because a game like this that lets you take your time, you learn in your own way, but I appreciate what they've done here.  It opens up pretty fast anyway, and I think your particular sense of play can lead you towards certain classes as the most fun or interesting.\n\nSo basically.  I'd recommend this.  A lot.","November 19, 2013","true","136.1"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","34","43","0","0"

You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer.\n\nGraphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click.\n\nEach of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set "theme" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though, it is very easy to learn how to play, but very difficult to master, you will die, ALOT in Desktop Dungeons, they even tell you that at the very beginning of the game; it is to be expected. It takes a lot of thought out planning and preparation to work your way through most of the dungeons even straight after the tutorial you are thrown straight in at the deep end.\n\nThe game length can vary, I have been playing for about five hours and I still haven’t managed to get past the fifth dungeon, there are tons of content available, class challenges, random dungeon runs, extra tutorial lessons for different spells and many more. I have seen some people with over a hundred hours put into Desktop Dungeon. One of the extra plus points I've found is that a potato can run this game, meaning you can stick it on any machine, maybe even your work machine, and load it up on breaks to sneak in fifteen minutes here and there; as it's not resourcefully demanding.\n\nDesktop Dungeons is certainly worth your time, and boy will it suck up your time as it is highly addictive.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each "dungeon." You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this, the game is entertaing for a couple of hours as you discover all the ways to utilize your classes/races abilities to give you the best shot at defeating the boss at the end. However, for me, the fun stopped pretty quickly after you unlock the grunt of the different loadouts you can have when entering a dungeon. The reason why it stopped being fun was because in order to beat the level you have to use the bonuses that each race/class has effectively. Thus, when you use a class/race you never deviate from the approach that gives that class/race its edge. Therefore, after you unlock the basic classes, it feels as though there not much deviance from the game to keep the dungeon runs refreshing.\n\nThe Last couple of hours I played consisted of me logging on to play a dungeon run or two, and then logging off because I felt bored. Since I have stopped playing this game though, I did not experience what the rest of the game had to offer. It is possible that the runs got more interesting, but to me it was not worth the time to go through it, or the money i spent to buy it (while it was on sale).\n\nBefore I end this review, I do want to share some positive aspects of the game because there were good implements of the game that kept me interested for awhile.\n\n-Game has a sense of humor and keeps the game in a light mood even though it is difficult.\n-There are puzzles in the game which put you in a situation in which there is one method that will make you successful.\n-If you want to be tested to the limits, these are great\n-The game explains everything very well and there was nothing that terribly confused me when playing\n-Game does take good planning to be successful. You cannot simply just click everything to death.\n\nOverall I would have to give the game a 6.5/10.\nI encourage you to look at the other reviews for there are things that I left out about the game. Also, make sure to watch the video on the store page, for that is what the general gameplay of the game looks like. Lastly, just make an informed decision before you hastily bought it like I had.\n","June 23, 2014","false","8.2"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","40","56","0","0"

As the ruler of a kingdom, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding for you.  The buildings themselves offer unique perks to improve the efficiency of your kingdom while you take control of a hero as you send them out into the further reaches of your lands on quests.\n\nEach quest that you undertake is an entire adventure in itself.  Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.\n\nYour buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.\n\nThe quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.  I found it to be far more enjoyable than I was expecting.

It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.\n\nGreat retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.\n\nIf you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game.\n\nDue to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level.\n\nBy the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.\n\nIs the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game). If you know a friend who owns this game, ask them to set up an account at the website and you can try out the game before purchasing!","June 22, 2014","true","121.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Even the easiest dungeons take many tries to finish. This game mixes basic RPG elements with roguelike quests/levels. If you die while trying to complete a quest you have to start all over again. Now, many of the battles (at least in the beginning) can be finished within minutes, provided you know exactly what to do. Completing quests earns you money to unlock and upgrade new classes, and of course, this will unlock new quests for you. All of this should make the game a little easier.\n\nBut the game might just be a bit too hard because I couldn't even complete 3 quests. And while I still had a good time playing it (mainly because of the short levels) I think the game isn't always well balanced. It requires dedication and effort, -two characteristics I actually possess- but if you have the feeling that you aren't making any progress it's time to quit.\n\nStill, a very good and fun game, once and if it clicks, but beware of the difficulty (spikes).\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","March 2, 2014","true","4.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

The strategy and careful planning, combined with many choices in which the player must weigh opportunity costs, appealed to me as someone who enjoys both puzzle games and roguelikes. This market version, however, is a bit disappointing.\n\nAlmost immediately I noticed that the quick and seamless gameplay of the original has been replaced with lots of flashy graphics and animations, most of which are far too long and prevent input until they have finished playing. While these animations are relatively short, the slowness becomes noticeable the longer you play. Those little microseconds add up. Yes, this is a turn-based game in which you cafrefully think through your decisions, but let's be honest-- the first 2/3 of every session is pretty much blasting through the weak monsters or exploring in hopes of finding the right item with the RNG. The real magic of the original was in the last 1/3, when things start to get tense and you really have to plan ahead. So it's frustrating when this version forces you to slow down at the part that deserves to be sped through.  These slow animations carry over to the menus as well, and it's  exacerbated by the dull, mediocre banter which tries too hard to be funny, and which takes forever to skip.\n\nAnd of course, there are tutorial levels you can't skip. Really? Really?? This is 2014 and you are still making unskippable tutorial levels?\n\nPerhaps the newest feature of this version is the introduction of the gold-to-buy-buildings (which then unlock new heroes or give small upgrades) system. There was absolutely zero reason to add this, because they do the exact same thing as simply completing the challenges in the original alpha. At least in the alpha, you didn't have to click through twelve haphazardly scattered menus-- once you beat the dungeon, the next level or hero was unlocked automatically. Seriously, why even add this?\n\nThe artwork is polished, but the style is just ugly. There is really nothing redeeming about it. While the alpha had simple, easily distinguishable 16-bit pixel graphics, this version tries way too hard to be detailed. It's like staring into those gross Ren & Stimpy  or Spongebob Squarepants closeups for hours on end! No one wants to do that. The music is also unmemorable-- it sounds like generic stock medieval fantasy music, versus the ominous, synthy fanfare of the original; it says a lot when a 5 second introductory song is more appealing than an entire soundtrack.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about how QCF Design has trolled other indie developers. Back when DD was still in development, League of Epic Heroes, a game by a single dev on iOS, got a cease and desist and was threatened with a lawsuit for "copying" the gameplay concept. At the time, LoEH was actually superior to both the DD alpha and the beta. The main developer of DD complained about intellectual property, but honestly, who hasn't copied game concepts before? Every action RPG since Diablo has been a rip-off of it, but we understand that they are still original in their own right. League of Epic Heroes had a unique inventory system, original graphics and assets, and only borrowed the gameplay of DD. The developer said it was unfair that someone else was releasing a Desktop Dungeons-like game on iOS before he could, but that's what you get for taking four years to finish something! Now there is still no iOS port of DD, and of course, there are two Android games which are like DD but very conspicuously, they have not been removed-- sounds to me like the dev just wanted to cut out the competition.\n\nSo: A release that is actually worse than the original, and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer who can't handle market competition. If you want a fun, puzzle dungeon crawler, save yourself the money and go get the original freeware version of this instead.","May 13, 2014","false","7.1"," 49 of 79 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","49","79","0","14"

It's obviously well done and gets great reviews.  That said, I don't enjoy it very much.  I was looking for a game that could I could play quickly on the go or as in between other games and based on the reviews, this seemed to be it.\n\nI've played around 15 hours now, and just don't enjoy it that much.  If you like rogue-like puzzlers then it's probably a good game for you.  For me, it just lacks that balance between depth of gameplay and casual mental involvement.  If you approach this game casually, you'll almost certainly never win (other then the few introductory games); and if you approach it to  win, then it's certainly neither casual.\n\nI also found the depth of gameplay everyone talks about to be a bit lacking.  After getting frustrated, unable to beat even the first "normal" dungeons, I read a couple of the brief introductory help guides on the community page.  Yes, there are some nuances around skills and abilities, but once you get the "always kill monsters higher level than yourself", that's about 90% of what you need to understand and succeed in this game.\n\nIs there skill involved in this game?  Absolutely.  Is it well done?  Yes.  Could it be a nice, quick diversion or an entire Friday night's gaming session?  Totally.  Is it for me - no.  I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, and it feels like I'm totally mission something, but for me it just isn't there.

That was a really good choice. My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.\n\nPros:\n\n- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.\n\n- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.\n\n- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.\n\n- Daily dungeon.\n\n- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game. Difficult dungeons take about 20-30 min and you need to be focus all the time.\n\n- Good difficulty curve and very good tutorials.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Can't think of any.\n\n\n\nOverall this is an extremely well done game (once you play for a while you'll notice this in the little details).

And as simple as that sounds: dont plan every of your moves carefully, and you will fail. Be prepared for a tough mental challenge if you choose to play this game, in which the depth has no limits...\n\nConcerning the graphics, dont let you fool by its simpleness- there is an AMAZING amount of content behind it: a lenghty campaign, random generated dungeons, optional puzzles, tutorials, achievements, (upgradeable) buildings, unlocks (races, classes), quests...\nI played for 30 hours now, am still discovering new ways to optimize my play, and still have tons of stuff to do!\n\nOn the negative side, the game suffers from a lack of final polish (refinemen and comfort):\nSome descriptions and tooltips are lacking, few are even wrong, which leads to several bad experiences and losses, until you have learned the game properly. Be prepared to play all tutorials and use the Wiki in order to really understand this game.\nAdditionaly, the balance is lacking, and thats the only really bad thing i could say about this game. Some monsters and gods are (in relation) stronger than others, and since dungeons are randomly generated, frustration is a part of this game.\nIt goes as far, that some challenges and dungeons are not always beatable, as a certain constellation is necessary to succeed, and thats the point where it hurts.\n\nIn the end, some will love this game, while others will hate it.\nPatient people with a preference for mentally demanding, turn based games will find hundreds of hours of enjoyment in this game, while the casual and/or action gamer might get frustrated by the learning curve, the slow pace and/or the randomness.\nFor me, this was one of the best purchases ive ever done!!!","June 26, 2014","true","34.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really loved the style of artwork portrayed in this game. This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they "offer" (using the word "offer" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead, to them, the tutorials are basicly just slimmed down dungeons with specific situations with only one SPECIFIC way out to complete with no instructions whatsoever. This makes it impossible to progress further into the game, which stunts the enjoyment to a grinding halt. This COULD HAVE been forgiven if they decided to put a difficulty mode choice option somewhere in the game but that exists just as much as their tutorial instructions do. I would have never paid 15 dollars for this game, had I known that the replay value (do to difficulty) was shorter than a first round knockout match between Mike Tyson and some random crackhead midget. This game is worth maybe about 2 dollars at this point. In my opinion, if the developers were to atleast put in a difficulty option, the gameplay value and price value would rise tremendously. And that's just putting a band-aid on a large cut that needs surgery. That wouldn't REALLY solve the problem here. I DO love a challenge. But I would like to be given a competent tutorial so that I can actually enjoy the game as it was intended to be, which is "difficult", NOT impossible.\n\nThis part here is specifically to the developers:\nYou have a game with a mass amount of potential but you guys need to put more effort into this game. It's not just about making it more aesthetically pleasing from your free game version. You need to step up to the plate and make this game more user friendly. We need a way better tutorial system because the tutorial system in it now is horrible. And I'm putting it as nicely as I can without allowing my affability make me cringe too much.\n\nIn conclusion:\nI only hope that I can enjoy this game and be able to recommend it in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/telephis/recommended/226620/","telephis","Nik SG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/telephis/","300 products in account","Desktop Dungeons is a great game that fittingly belongs on the desktop although at first glance may look like it is better suited to playing it on a portable device. Dungeons generally take 10-20 minutes to complete (or fail) but the base mechanics are addicting enough that I did not find myself saying 'just one more', sessions ended only while glancing at the clock and being surprised enough to force myself to stop.\n\nThis is a surprisingly deep experience for a somewhat simplified dungeon crawler. Not only are the layouts different each time you start a dungeon (even the same one multiple times) but there is quite a bit outside of these in building up your kingdom and unlocking classes and races. The dungeon mechanics themselves are for the most part pretty standard - move, attack, kill, level up, repeat. The twist here is that as you explore, newly discovered tiles refill your (and any damaged enemy) health and mana bars. The impact of this was lost on me at the lower levels, but as you progress you will find it is impossible to explore the map and plan all your moves ahead of time. There are some abilities that help mitigate this but for the most part, each step is a resource not to be wasted and a wrong turn can mean the difference between leveling up or running out of options seven levels later while fighting the boss.\n\nHere lies the first of my two main issues with the game. I have had dungeons where the first half of my exploration resulted in dead ends or creatures far above my level 1 hero you always start as. This can be frustrating as it means you lose out on health/mana regen later on when those tiles could have been useful. I readily acknowledge that this is very much part of the game and there is strategy here above what my compulsion for exploration allows, but it can be hard not to feel that such runs are pointless to pursue.\n\nMy other issue with Desktop Dungeons has nothing to do with gameplay - the writing takes me completely out of the experience. The game world seems steeped in lore and interesting hero / creature design, yet all the dialogue is extremely casual and self-referential well beyond the tongue-in-cheek point. It's too bad, and is one of those situations where a flaw is almost made worse by the amount of potential it has. I would have preferred the tone to get more serious as I realized how deep the experience could be, and not the other way around. That may be personal opinion, but I really feel as if it is an area of missed opportunity in an otherwise enjoyable and lasting experience.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Desktop Dungeons to anyone looking for a game that satisfies in a way games like Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky does, where it doesn't matter if you play 5 or 50 games a session and can come back the next day and still find fresh gameplay waiting. The excellency of the procedural generation (which is greatly designed, no randomness here is used as a crutch) is exciting in its balance of interesting and clever levels, and even though the difficulty gets quite high early on you will most likely be able to find fun with it no matter your skill level.\n\n\n---Desktop Dungeons---\n+ Addicting base mechanics\n+ Deep experience tied to player skill progression\n- Some runs can be a letdown at the very start\n- Writing direction is not for me at all\nIt is my opinion that you should buy Desktop Dungeons anytime it is $12.50 or less!","November 25, 2013","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And somehow it does this with each individual run being a small one level dungeon that you can play quite quickly - there is very little lost from each myriad death.\n\nProbably the best aspect is the slow unlocking of various races, classes and gear by completing quests and spending the loot from successful runs. Every day I play I might unlock a new class or find some nifty trinket in a dungeon that I shove into my 'locker' for future runs.  Each combination of race and class opens up a new way to look at leveling up and new strategies to kill the endboss.","September 15, 2014","true","69.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the cutesy artwork either - under the brightly colored hood lies an engine made of pure unadulterated mathematics. Do you fight the stronger enemy while you are lower level, earning extra xp you may need later? Or would that fight require you to eat into your valuable potion supply? The answer is right in front of your eyes, 95% of the time, it's up to you to figure out the optimal path if you can. Or, have a calculator handy.\n\nI'm not joking about the math either. This game is like a combination of Soduko, Minesweeper and the popular roguelike Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (I mean this in the best possible way). That's isn't to say that the rpg theme is painted on. On the contrary there is a satisfying asymettry to both the challenges you face in terms of levels and bosses, and also to the way the various classes and loadouts need to be deployed in order to surmount those challenges. The number of abilities and potential interactions, combined with a high degree of randomization, means that things stay interesting and fresh.\n\nExpect a game to last anywhere from 5 or 10 minutes from the early levels/challenges and upwards to an hour when attempting to successfully navigate some of the later dungeons, where a single miscalculation or wrong move can snatch sudden defeat from the jaws of victory. The logic and mechanics are incredibly tight (using unexplored space as a kind of resource is a genius mechanic IMO), and the fact that you now to get to build out your own kingdom as your acquire resources just adds another element of fun.\n\nAwesome game! I can't wait to see what happens next with the franchise.","November 26, 2013","true","253.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

After just on around 40 hours of game time now, I can say that this game is incredibly addictive and fun thanks to its smart progression, incredibly polished systems and charming art/music combo.\n\nIt's described as a game you can play during coffee breaks, but I'm personally taking around 40mins to 1 hour to finish a dungeon properly as it can sometimes take some brain-raking and planning to overcome the obstacles in front of you. What does work really well for quick burst though are devilishly challenging puzzle challenges. These double as advanced tutorials and are almost a must for anyone wanting to really know what the game may expect of you.\n\nAll in all, a really challenging but incredibly rewarding experience so far.

I cannot think of any other like it and it succeeds on so many levels that I am blown away by the amount of time and energy it must have taken to create this. That being said many of my friends would (and have) toss this aside very quickly. The best comparison I can think of for this game would be chess, crosswords, or suduko not because this game operates by the same level or rules but because of the amount of mental energy required to play well (or poorly but with maximum effort in my case).\n\nOn a high note this game does an excellent job of rewarding progress. Even nearly 80 hours into the game I am still unlocking new aspects every couple hours. The high difficulty factor and this make every finished map lead to both a sigh of relief and quick inhale of anticipation as to what might be next. There are not too many titles you can find that can or will provide this.\n\nThe game is a puzzle/roguelike/rpg with a steeeeep learning curve. It goes from fairly easy, to somewhat challenging to difficult to "okay quit smacking me in the balls" tough in a span of about 2 hours or playtime each at which point the challenge continues to escalate as you progress through each map after. I personally enjoy the challenge but I think this is a balancing issue that is likely to turn away alot of people before they really get into the game. This is a shame because of the amazing amount of possiblities and strategies you can and will need to master to get through it. I have to grudgengliny give it a slight knock for this.\n\nThe only other major criticism I have is that the tutorial is a bit limited. In a game that gives you such progression the mechanics of many of the aspects are not clearly explained. There are puzzles that come with many of the unlocks that are obviously suppose to help out with this. Unfortunately they are pretty limited (and freakin hard as hell themselves) and do not provide you with much help. This can add on to the frustration level pretty damn quick.\n\nThe graphics are obviously not the draw here but the cartoony and light-hearteness of the game provide a nice counterpoint to the toughness factor.\n\nAll in all if you own or play mostly titles that contain the tags "board games, tcg, puzzles, strategy, tactical" there is a really good chance this is a gonna be one of your favorites. If your looking for something light-hearted and dislike high difficulty you are likely better off walking the other way.  Objectively I rate his high for orignality and length of content as well as awe-inspiring game design and detract slightly for the poorly explained mechanics and balancing issues.\n\n7/10\n\nbump this to 9/10 if your a fan of puzzles and high challenge...\n\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","123.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it does have the trappings of one, such as leveling, equipment, classes, gods, etc. it plays more like a puzzle game.\n\nYou enter a one-screen (sometimes with a basement) dungoen with one or more bosses hiding in it. Your objective is to kill all the bosses. However, you will have to level up your character enough in order to be able to stand a chance against the boss. You do this by defeating lesser enemies in a logical order, using your class and racial abilities. Enemies don't move, so you have plenty of freedom to think out your moves. Strangely enough, you gain HP and mana by exploring the dark areas of the screen, so you'll have to manage this resource carefully.\n\nOverall, this game fits the bill for those who like puzzles, but also enjoy random elements and roguelikes or rpgs.

You take these tips with a grain of salt as the variability to your death changes with each play-through...Although I use the term "play-through" lightly since you never actually get through some of the more hardcore rogue-likes without hours and hours of dedication to understanding the game's many quirks and traps.\n\nDesktop Dungeons feels like a solid blend of Rogue-Like and Puzzle with a welcome sense of progression as you earn gold and unlock new classes and races along the way. All of that mixed with the ability to spend 10-20 minutes on a single session is also entirely welcome.\n\nThe puzzle-like aspect of the game is a great mix to the genre. Instead of spending your time focusing on surviving until your next death, you know exactly what you need to do: kill all of the enemies. The helpful levels that appear next to the enemy names allow you to expect what's coming whether its a victory or a disappointing failure. Rogue-Likes are always known for their randomized nature with their random levels and random encounters; Desktop Dungeons has these to an extent but when you're level 5 and you're about to swing your sword at a level 9, you know you're not making a sound decision. The screen also turns red when your next move is fatal, which helps quite a bit as well.\n\nThe progression in the game also allows for a sense of accomplishment. No longer do you feel that sense of loss when you lose everything you worked so hard to get. Each "dungeon" is its own instance and if you know you're about to fail you can easily just retire and keep all your money (the items you acquire get sold for more money) which can then be spent on upgrading classes, races and even buying gear to aid you on the next quest you go on.\n\nAlong with multiple locations, there's plenty of different quests and challenges you can attack. Each class has its own set of challenges that give you bonus money and there are also general challenges that give you more gold just by doing things like spending a certain amount of gold or piety during a quest.\n\nThis game is certainly recommended if you enjoy the difficulty in Rogue-Likes but like to spend a casual amount of time slowly increasing your stats, or in this case, your kingdom.","November 25, 2013","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The main thing that makes this one interesting is that combat is basically deterministic; you can predict the outcome of each fight pretty accurately, you don't have to worry about getting screwed by the RNG at a critical point.\n\nThe thing is, this may not sound like a big difference, but  it completely changes the flavor of the game. Instead of an RPG, it ends up being more of a puzzle game, where the objective is to figure out how to maximize XP gained and minimize the waste of health and mana, by deciding where  to go and what to fight next.

It is a very addictive and fun game, and I completely finished the original version (a freeware game you can google up), unlocking every class and race.

Johansen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JSJohansen/","1978 products in account",""Why does a cartoony game cost so much?" and "is it worth it?" are most likely the two first questions that come to mind when checking this game out; while reading through the description, you'll eventually find yourself staring at the (bullet-point) list of features, the one that will strike you the most will most likely be the following statement: "6 hours? Try 6 billion."\n\nYou probably smiled, smirked or chuckled. "How could this even be possible?" Thankfully this is a game, which means it won't be able to hear you laugh and then manifest itself physically in the real world. Take a moment to call your parents, siblings or a friend - because you just dodged a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bullet.\n\nUnder the cute, cuddly and humorous exterior is a sadistic, unforgiving, angry and hateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - running at an impossible speed - screaming "choo choo" while attempting to penetrate every visible orifice - with such a force - that you are able to not only realize - but fully appreciate - that the laws of physics has a theoretical limitation of just how strong a force can be while still being able to exist within our universe.\n\nThis entire ordeal would last for SIX. BILLION. HOURS.\n\nAll warnings aside, this game is my personal GOTY. Why? Because the main complaint in the game world is *replayability* which this game has taken to the extreme, not by adding a "new game plus" or the like; but by giving the player a kingdom to control.\n\nLike many other roguelikes, you unlock new races, classes, items, buildings, gods etc - while you play. This might sound like a gimmick to extend gameplay, but it couldn't be further from the truth, the progress you make in this game feels as satisfying as *insert difficult game here* if not more so. Unlocking something is more than a popup screen saying you unlocked something, instead you find passages placed at random, in the randomly generated dungeons.\n\nEach passage leads to a random event, a puzzle, an npc, an altar or something so mysterious you don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you just saw; as of this recommendation, I have played for ~35 hours. Out of those ~35 hours, I've had 10-20 victories, and hundreds - if not thousands - of deaths. So far I've only scratched the surface, just now having reached the first "Hard" dungeon. Remember, I just recently reached a "Hard" dungeon, meaning those hundreds of deaths were on "Normal" which tells you just how ♥♥♥♥ing extreme the difficulty is in this game.\n\nI didn't want to put spoilers in this recommendation, nor did I want to spoil my own experience, but - yes - "Hard" isn't the final difficulty, after "Hard" comes "Vicious" but by then I believe the game will no longer use 'gold' as a currency, and instead just directly import my god damn tears.\n\nIf you scrolled down here looking for a tl;dr go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.","November 11, 2013","true","66.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabrill/recommended/226620/","cabrill","Cabrill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabrill/","660 products in account","Stupendously fun game that is essentially a modern day Minesweeper infused with the most potent distillation of role playing mechanics!  You play the wise administrator to a budding town that is pestered by the hardships that accompany being located in the very center of a dense labyrinth of dungeons.  You must hire dungeon-invading heroes of unrestricted race/class combination, outfit them as you can afford and send them into harms way in service of the kingdom!\n\nYour first order of administrative business is recruiting a weakling, level one hero, because all of the powerful heroes retire immediately as just reward for surviving a dungeon.  This requires making decisions on which buildings to initially construct with your limited resources.  Your choices determine what race/class combinations you can choose to send into the nearby dungeons, and with what items or services you can furnish them.  Assuming your coffers can afford such bonuses.  Each building you construct provides its own set of bonuses and a unique item selection that can be upgraded.\n\nActual dungeon gameplay consists of moving your chosen hero around a tile-based grid which is covered in the fog of war.  Under each square of fog exists either a monster (level 1-10), an item (or a place to purchase one), an altar dedicated to a specific god, a stat boost, some treasure, or a staircase to a sub-dungeon.  Sub-dungeons offer mini challenges with their own rewards, boost/items enhance your hero's stats or give them new abilities, gods alter your playstyle by forbidding certain actions while rewarding others, and monsters are what you will be primarily hunting for.\n\nApart from scenarios and puzzles, your objective will always be to kill the boss monster, who is always level 10.  In order to slay such a beast you need to equip yourself, and gain levels by finding and eliminating all of the other monsters in the dungeon.  However, they fight back!  Monsters will NEVER initiate attack with you, but they will retaliate when you strike.  After each fight you will need to recoup by exploring the fog of war.  Each square revealed from the fog will replenish your health/mana, but also the health of any unpoisoned enemies.  Once the fog is gone, though, your only means of healing for additional fights are potions or appealing to your chosen god.  Fail to take out the boss before you've expended all of your available resources and you have to retire in shame, with the entire venture possibly a net loss after the cost of preparations.\n\nBoth the meta-game of kingdom administration, and the individual dungeon dives are very enjoyable.  Spending your limited gold feels critically strategic and there are many possible strategies given the available combinations of race/class/equipment/deity which lead to some very satisfying combos.  Every dungeon is a challenge, and by the end of 10-20 minutes you may actually feel kind of attached to your valiant hero that you will never see again.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is that the puzzles are too difficult.  I played about eight of them and each one had a VERY specific solution that had to be performed EXACTLY with no substantial deviations in a chain that can be up to fifty actions in length!  One mistake at any point in that chain and you need to start over.  Some people may enjoy the mental gymnastics necessary to plot out every possible way your hero can move across the board, finding at which points to use which abilities/itemsY and finding the sole solution from a myriad of possibilities - but I didn't.  Thankfully, the puzzles are optional and if you skip them the only thing you'll miss out on is a relatively small sum of gold and some items you could just as easily unlock from doing any of the quests.  Had the game penalized me for not playing the puzzles it would have been a dealbreaker, but mercifully this is not the case.\n\nFar more enjoyable than the puzzles are the scenarios in which you play a themed, semi-random dungeon that has an objective that may be something other than killing a boss.  Some of these scenarios feature unique classes specifically for the story, and can be humorous if you read the notes, signs and story.\n\nAlso, the game uses a cloud sync independent of Steam which allows you to log into an account from any platform (including web) and continue playing!  Overall I'm very impressed with this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys casual role playing condensed into 20 minute play sessions, fans of Minesweeper or strategy, or anyone who enjoys mind-numbingly difficult puzzles!","January 11, 2014","true","47.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I WANT it to be amazing.  The fundamental flaw is that it is simply too difficult for the casual (and in my instance, hardcore) gamer and you often waste time trying to beat a level that is straight up unbeatable.  Thanks to random generations, you can find you have shot yourself in the foot many turns ago when approaching the boss and there is nothing you can do but quit for a measely 25g or so trying to climb your way to the next 1000g upgrade.  I do understand it is a roguelike and the purpose is to die often but the agony of defeat and the time you just wasted zaps the fun right out of the game.  Unless you really want a difficult challenge and are ok with losing because you made a mistake 15 minutes ago on a 20 minute level, then by all means pick this up.  If you want to constantly be calculating moderate to heavy math every turn as if you are playing sudoku and chess simultaenously, pick this up.

If so, get this game.\n\nLONG VERSION: Despite the developer's claim that "reviewers have trouble with genres", the core genre is simple: At heart, Desktop Dungeons is a strategy game. Success requires careful management of limitted resources. There are plenty of RPG elements in the game, but RPGs are typically centered more on their story, which, lets face it, isn't exactly this game's strong point.\n\nEach dungeon has a simple goal: Defeat the boss(es). This is, of course, easier said than done.\n\nAs mentioned, fulfilling that goal will require very careful management of your resources. Obvious resources are health and mana, but there's also item slots (you can only carry so much stuff), blankspace (exploring unexplored parts of the dungeon regenerates health and mana, but re-exploring already explored parts does not), conversion points (turn items into something else), levels and experience (levelling up fully restores health and mana, which is highly abusable), gold (for buying stuff!), and piety (too complex to explain here). In addition, your class (as well as many other factors) helps define just how efficiently you can use these resources. For example, wizards use less mana for the same bang, monks regen double health from blankspace, and fighters gain experience much faster. Mastery of the game will come from a thorough knowledge of its mechanics, intelligent use of resources, and at times, a bit of luck.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this game is HARD. The learning curve is very steep. While you are guided through the basics via tutorial, the rest of the mechanics will need to be figured out on your own. Do not expect to win every time. (However, also notably, this difficulty rarely stems from randomness issues; a highly skilled player should lose in only the worst random situations)\n\nThis game is also humorous. In fact, it's rarely NOT humorous.","November 26, 2013","true","222.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If so, get this game.\n\nLONG VERSION: Despite the developer's claim that "reviewers have trouble with genres", the core genre is simple: At heart, Desktop Dungeons is a strategy game. Success requires careful management of limitted resources. There are plenty of RPG elements in the game, but RPGs are typically centered more on their story, which, lets face it, isn't exactly this game's strong point.\n\nEach dungeon has a simple goal: Defeat the boss(es). This is, of course, easier said than done.\n\nAs mentioned, fulfilling that goal will require very careful management of your resources. Obvious resources are health and mana, but there's also item slots (you can only carry so much stuff), blankspace (exploring unexplored parts of the dungeon regenerates health and mana, but re-exploring already explored parts does not), conversion points (turn items into something else), levels and experience (levelling up fully restores health and mana, which is highly abusable), gold (for buying stuff!), and piety (too complex to explain here). In addition, your class (as well as many other factors) helps define just how efficiently you can use these resources. For example, wizards use less mana for the same bang, monks regen double health from blankspace, and fighters gain experience much faster. Mastery of the game will come from a thorough knowledge of its mechanics, intelligent use of resources, and at times, a bit of luck.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this game is HARD. The learning curve is very steep. While you are guided through the basics via tutorial, the rest of the mechanics will need to be figured out on your own. Do not expect to win every time. (However, also notably, this difficulty rarely stems from randomness issues; a highly skilled player should lose in only the worst random situations)\n\nThis game is also humorous. In fact, it's rarely NOT humorous.","November 26, 2013","true","222.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Levelling up gives you 100%health and mana, and you have to exploit this all game so that you don't use too many potions.... you'll need them for the boss in the level.\n\n2nd, because it's only 10 minutes, things have to be simplified. You move around on a checkerboard style tabletop. revealing a tile (standing next to it = gaining visibility of the next tile) will restore some health and mana.\n\n3rd, this is not a 10 minute game. You can play a dungeon in 10 minutes, sure, so you can play in 10 minute sessions, this can be a positive... but "just one more, it's only 10 minutes" will quickly translate into hours of game play.\n\n4th This is a Rogue LITE - it does have a progression system where you can unlock new classes, abilities, etc between runs, in a similar way to Rogue Legacy. [A true rogue-like features permadeath where you lose everything and start again at level 1.]\n\nFor those that like this game, it's addictive. Look at people's play times, the ones that have reviewed this. there are some who have 15-30h, then there are those with 80-120 hours, and the odd one over 200h - that's about the point where you beat the game, from my understanding / reading on the wiki.\n\nDo I recommend this game? That's such a hard one. Yes, If you know what you're getting into when you buy it, but the Store description is deceptive, and doesn't really explain just how this game works, and I was dissapointed about that, I wanted more 'hack n slash', and less 'calculating the next 7 steps to level up without using that mana pot' So for me, Although the game itself seems solid, I do like it, and I will play it some more, but I already know I won't clock it if it requires 200h it's a No.\n\n\n\n","December 25, 2014","false","10.7"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

You pick a class, buy some starting items and venture forth into a randomly generated dungeon. Your "hero" always starts at level 1 and you have to find a way to make the best use of experience boosts, glyphs, items and gold to beat the boss (or bosses) of the level. If you're successful you bring back treasures that will help improve your kingdom and allow you to discover new dungeons and monsters.\n\nThe goal is to use your resources to beat higher level monsters and get the experience boost you need to level up high enough to strike the boss. Uncovered tiles regenerate you and your foes, so waste as little as possible. Keep weak monsters around to strategically level up mid-fight and gain a full heal. There are lots of strategies and once you master them you can tackle any dungeon with any class. The mechanics are very deep and the advanced dungeons can take you one or two hours to beat them. Some later dungeons also abandon the idea of a single screen map and will offer two or more screens to play with, or challenge you with shifting walls. There's even a minotaur that chases you.\n\nI've been playing the game since beta and there's still more content for me to uncover. The newly added daily challenges adds new motivation to keep playing the game and the absolutely fantastic soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky has been a steady part of my music playlist since release. If you like puzzles and you like strategical fights then this game is a must buy.","April 21, 2015","true","30.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game advertises that it operates primarily in 10-15 minute instances, which is appropriate, but not necessarily accurate, as the serious player will quickly discover that you will be well rewarded in later levels by careful consideration and chess-like strategizing.  The aim in each dungeon instance is to clear out the dungeon boss by leveling up, acquiring items, and making use of every possible resource at your disposal (including the unexplored areas of the dungeon: every new tile revealed restores health and mana) - which is deceptively easy in earlier stages, but will prove frustratingly difficult in later levels.  Think of it as much as a strategy/puzzle game as an RPG - and an excellent, if unorthodox, example of all these genres.  If you're on the fence try the alpha - available free at the developer's website - for a taste of what the game offers: the full release is both more accessible at first and more difficult at last, while providing more control over your circumstances at every step of the way.  Whether you are a casual gamer looking for a new fix, a hardcore gamer seeking new challenges of your wit and will, or simply a conoisseur of the quirky - I cannot recommend this game enough.","February 19, 2014","true","123.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also the combat is deterministic not random, and the result is shown to you in advance! You'd think this would make it easy but it's not the case.\n\nRather than listen to me waffle on, trying to describe how it works, you should watch a gameplay video of it and try the alpha version which is free.

This new version is a complete b4stardization of the original.\n\nIn the original, I could unlock new characters and races by completing certain challenges. Simple and clean.\n\nIn this version, I have to purchase upgrades scattered across various parts of the town map and play levels over and over again to collect gold to unlock things. It's as tedious as playing a pay to win game with in-app purchases. Instead of being a puzzle/rouge-like game, it's now a repetitive RPG. The challenges are easy if I keep playing the same boring levels over and over again for gold. On the other hand, if I don't use gold, they're unfairly difficult.

If you played the free alpha, then you already know whether you like the game; this new version features many improvements, but it's still the same type of gameplay.\n\nAnyway, the second video (with the gnome wizard runthrough) does a decent job of showcasing game mechanics. Your goal is to explore a randomly-generated dungeon and ultimately to defeat a high-level boss monster. To beat the boss, you'll need to have leveled efficiently. This (usually) includes killing the highest-level monster that you can at any given time, since you get bonus XP for killing a monster whose level is higher than your own.\n\nThat's pretty much the core of what makes Desktop Dungeons interesting: you're always trying to beat a tougher monster. The way you do this varies tremendously; there's a long list of things that can help or hurt you, and you have to deal with whichever ones happen to be in the dungeon you're exploring. It's this variation that keeps the game interesting hours later.\n\nBottom line: I don't often write reviews. I like Desktop Dungeons enough that I felt I should take the time. I highly recommend this game.","April 24, 2015","true","22.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Personally, i find the balancing (especially in RPG´s) to be the most important thing. The Final Fantasy Series (especially 8, X-2, XII) is AWFUL RPG´s, because they are so unbalanced. There is always broken mechanics.\n\nBut this game. Everything is perfectly balanced. There is a solution for everything. Things that appear useless at first sight (like the glowing guardian) turns out to be immensely powerful when you learn how to use it.\n\nAnd then the final level. Dark Souls... i long thought this was impossible to beat. And i´m a pretty hardcore guy. I must have tried over 30 times... then i started discussing different strategies. Even then, i must have lost 20-25 times... but in the end. It was actually possible.\n\nHow great of a balance aint that? At first glance, you´re like no way... but then, bit by bit... you understand that it is possible.\n\nI have over 130 hours of gameplay in this game. The amount of replay value, and the amount of game you get for the price... is absolutely mind boggling. This game has taken over my life more than any game before. Monster Hunter G. Dark Souls. Meat Boy. Ninja Gaiden. Pokemon. I have mastered them all... but none have absorbed me, and offered me so much joy as this game. Hats of to the developers. And thanks for everything. I love you,\n\nA perfect game. I´ve heard some people think the price is to steep... they couldn´t be more wrong. This might be one of the most priceworthy games i´ve ever purchased. Damn it... i have already clocked 47 hours and i can´t stop playing. I need to be working on my thesis, but instead i´m playing this!\n\nIn all seriousness though, for 13bucks, this is an AMAZING game. It´s so challening, but always fair. It´s incredible well balanced, the music is mesmerezing... the upgrades mechanics addictive. And the gameplay itself is really unlike anything i´ve seen before.\n\nAmazing game. 10/10. I haven´t had this much fun with a title since Dark Souls.\n\n(The end game is so interesting also... because you have to careful manage your economy)\n\nPerfect game.","December 4, 2013","true","156.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Take a bottle of wine, for example: I've found that there is no difference between a ten dollar bottle of wine and a thirty dollar bottle of wine. Anybody that tells you otherwise is trying to impress you. With wine, you get very little return on your investment past the 15-20 dollar price point. There's a reason that many sommeliers refuse to do blind tastings, and that reason being that sommeliers have all agreed to subscribe to the same groupthink that says X vintage and Y grapes grown in Z reason are superior, and none of this information would be available to them if they were prevented from looking at the label on the bottle. Have you ever met anyone who's a certified "master sommelier"? They're truly insufferable people. The next time you meet one ask them a question about wine - any question, it doesn't matter how dumb, will send them into a desperate panic while they fumble to form an opinion, any opinion, about the matter in question. It doesn't matter what their answer is becuase they will be certain to couch it in arcane wine terms like "tannins" and "finish" and other completely subjective abstract concepts that you won't understand.\n\nDesktop Dungeons is like an overpriced bottle of wine. Sure, the label is fancy and the guy trying to sell it to you is telling you about how great it is, using words like "replayability" and other nonsense, but as soon as you taste it you realize "hey, this tastes just like a $5 iphone game?"\n\nJust look at the screenshots.

It can work and if done properly it can create a game far greater than the sum of its parts. Desktop Dungeons, a game which attempts to combine a rogue-like dungeon crawl with a puzzle game, could definitely have worked, if only the elements it chose to borrow from those two genres were actually compatible with each other.\n\nAllow me to explain by way of example. As part of the puzzle aspect of the game, your hero only regenerates health and mana when exploring new areas, not when backtracking over old areas. Blind exploration is dicouraged, as doing so at full health means wasting precious healing. This forces you to think about where you want to go next instead of just going out willy nilly. I know it sounds like I'm praising the game and the truth is it could have been a good gameplay mechanic...\n\n...IF you had any way of actually KNOWING where you should go next.\n\nUnexplored areas are always completely blacked out, and since the dungeons are randomly layed out every time you have no way of knowing where you should go next. The fighter class mitigates this somewhat by automatically revealing the location of enemies that are your level or lower, but that hardly helps out the OTHER classes and even with this, you still have no way of knowing where to find valuable power-ups, equippable items, or spells.\n\nThe whole game is like that. In fact the greatest challenge in this game is not any enemy, but the game's own vague rules. I talked about this a little in my review of Windforge but it's even more true here: we really, really need to be given accurate, real information for a game like this to work.\n\nFor example, there's a speed stat that determines who attacks first in combat, but you can't actually see what your speed stat is. You can see that some enemies have first strike, but even enemies that don't have first strike and which you would expect to go after you in the combat order - like warlocks and zombies - can often end up going first... sometimes. Other times they go second, and since you can't actually see your speed stat or the enemy's the whole thing just comes across as arbitrary.\n\nAnd that's why this game fails on both fronts. The puzzle aspects are too strictly demanding and the punishment for even one single misstep is too harsh, so the game fails as a rogue-like. At the same time, the rogue-like aspects add too much randomness and too much hidden information, so the game fails as a puzzle.\n\nThe worst part is the game has no idea. It demands care, but then forces you to go out blindly, and then punishes you harshly for doing so. It tells you it's all your fault when you fail (and you will) with condescending messages and taunts, but really it's no one's fault because everything is entirely luck-based.\n\nLike I said, the idea of combining a rogue-like and a puzzle game is not entirely terrible. It could have worked, it just didn't in this case. Maybe some other game will come along and get it right. But this one ain't it.\n\nMy Rating: [2] BAD\n\nRead my original review here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com]","December 14, 2014","false","5.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"

It IS unfair (sometimes at least). But that's not a problem - it's an asset. DD has a high replayability and you will have to do several stages and tasks again and again because of wrong class, race, equippment or just one false klick. But in fact that's the thrill: to master the game you have to play some perfect rounds, know all the tricks and skills and of course you need a bit of luck.\n\nThat sounds less fun than it actualy is. You got to plan and think a lot, but winning a difficult level will outweigh that. The approximately 10-15 minutes of playtime for each stage (when you survive, otherwise playtime can be much shorter ;) ) are well balanced between a short break and not loosing to much time in case of failure.\n\nA nice fact is that you can play DD after buying on Steam not only via Steam, but also via the DD website. A nice amusement if you are not at home and on a PC without Steam and don't need download and install anything. That works for Windows RT tablets too.\nWhen playing via website please consider, that Steam acchievments will not be unlocked and it does not count to your playing time. Otherwise I would have several hours more.\n\nIn the end a good occasionally game you should not take to serious.

For those who like a brainy challenge however this game is a must, it combines many elements of strategy with a tidy interface and no dithering about. It allows and even encourages you to plan far in advance and won't interfere with these plans - as a result however when it gets hard it really doesn't mess about.\n\nIt takes a few games to get your head around it but it's very simple to pick up. The outcome of every move is predicted and even an entire fight is easy to plan beforehand with little indicators showing how many attacks it will take with the selected move to take down your opponent and how many he will need to take down you. In this way you can easily see for example that you each need three attacks so if you attack twice and then use a GETINDERE glyph to ensure your attack lands first you will win the encounter.\n\nIt has found an interesting balance for exploring a dungeon. On one hand you want to find new glyphs and stat boosts but health and mana is regained by exploring so ideally you need to utilise that first, but otherwise it is not punished.\n\nMonsters only ever retaliate so braving the unknown is at practically zero risk. Just as long as you set right click to attack to avoid inadvertently killing yourself against a higher level monster.\n\nIf I were to have any gripes it's the lack of direction the game gives you. Not so much the Minecraft sense in "here's a world go amuse yourself" but more in that it gives you TOO much to do. I currently have about 15 quests, several requiring multiple dungeon runs to complete. Completing one will often generate two more. But monetary rewards are good incentive to upgrade your kingdom to provide more options for starting a dungeon.\n\nOverall it's a beautiful game, a true challenge but not in the "haha I instakilled you now do the last half hour again" way. More like an elaborate chess game with increasingly complex challenges.","May 17, 2014","true","147.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core mechanics are still there - strategic turn-based dungeon crawling that plays out like a puzzle you're trying to solve, maximizing the efficiency of every attack, every move - along with a beatuiful music and graphics upgrade, heaps more of the dry, witty humour, more classes and races, and bit of a story arc/narrative progression through the missions instead of randomly generated encounters. (although it's got those too)\n\nIt also feels like the difficulty was amped up a bit more, it seems a lot harder to get up to Level 10, so the game isn't as "casual" as the freeware version.  Not that I didn't have to stop and ponder about how to best solve a dungeon in the freeware version, but I find myself doing it a lot more for a lot longer in the full version.  It's not necessarily a complaint, but it feels like a map takes about 20-30 mins to beat, verses the 10-15 mins I felt with the freeware version.\n\nAll in all an excellent light-hearted puzzle/strategy game with some decent depth and tough choices to make.

I'm very happy it has finally made a real release on steam.\nI think DD is best described as a resource dungeon crawler. You do the standard dungeon crawl. Delving into dungeons, slaying monsters, collecting loot, and (hopefully) defeating the boss in order to emerge victorious, but instead of regenerating you resources [hp/mp] these are regenerated by moving to unexplored areas [aka fog of war]. This forces you to think about you next move. Think of ways to stay alive so you can defeat the next monster, gain lvls and equipment, so you can win. There are also a number of classes and races with different abilities. Each class has deferent strengths and weaknesses that you can adapt to your own play style. This coupled with a number of levels/terrains equates to hours of fun.\n\nHighly recommended as a good dungeon crawler game for casual player\n","June 23, 2014","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since then, the game has grown massive beyond the inital scope and idea, adding in a story, many new classes, races, monsters, and so much more. The gamepay, however, has remained largely the same: Explore a randomly generated dungeon, fight monsters, collect loot, and defeat the boss. But in true rogue-like fashion, your ability to accomplish this is left up to fate and skill. Each new area you explore has different rules and layouts, with features like gods to pledge your loyalty to or shops to buy needed equipment. You will curse at your computer, you might throw your keyboard and mouse across the room. But the game itself is rewarding when you finally get that perfect run together with that smooth combination of careful planning and a touch of luck, leaving you with a warm feeling and a craving for more.

With about 10 hours under my belt, I still have mixed feelings. This game is more of a puzzler than a rogue-like. There is a heavy amount of strategy in the game and multiple ways to accomplish the tasks, but it is not the dungeon delver game that I was hoping it would be.\n\nThe game is hard, but fair. Any time you die, you'll realise your mistake or you'll wish you were a little luckier in finding the monsters you needed. Many of the puzzles will have you banging your head off the wall as you ponder just going online for the answers, but the game can be beaten normally.\n\nI think that my biggest complaint is the lack of depth. As you progress through challenges, the game gets harder, but you don't really get better. The later classes that can be unlocked are just variations of the same character and there is no character advancement whatsoever.\n\nI'm on the fence about recommending this game. I got it through the humble bundle and I think that it was a worthy buy for that, but the lack of depth and the one-off nature of missions makes this a no-go at MSRP.","May 25, 2014","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm very happy it has finally made a real release on steam.\nI think DD is best described as a resource dungeon crawler. You do the standard dungeon crawl. Delving into dungeons, slaying monsters, collecting loot, and (hopefully) defeating the boss in order to emerge victorious, but instead of regenerating you resources [hp/mp] these are regenerated by moving to unexplored areas [aka fog of war]. This forces you to think about you next move. Think of ways to stay alive so you can defeat the next monster, gain lvls and equipment, so you can win. There are also a number of classes and races with different abilities. Each class has deferent strengths and weaknesses that you can adapt to your own play style. This coupled with a number of levels/terrains equates to hours of fun.\n\nHighly recommended as a good dungeon crawler game for casual player\n","June 23, 2014","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best description I can think of is that it's an RPG pared down to it's most fundamental elements. The neat thing is the amazing variety of strategies that come out of the basic rule set. The character classes all have a ton of meaningful variety, and to win on the harder levels you really need to be playing to the strengths of the character class you're playing. The religions vastly change the way you play, and will sufficiently punish you if you aren't. And the random elements (items you find, monsters that you encounter, etc.) are guaranteed to keep you on your toes. Although there ends up being a ton of classes and abilities and statuses and items and religions and monsters, the game has a nice meta-structure, where it won't populate elements that it hasn't explained to you yet. Basically, it's a great game and anyone interested should certainly play it.\n\nAlso, I am not sure if the steam version allows it,  but if you buy it directly from the Desktop Dungeons website, you can play it out of your web browser, which is kind of nice.","January 1, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you defeat dungeons and complete challenges, your kingdom will grow, unlocking more races, gods, classes, and items to choose from or find in the dungeon.  The story might not be the best, but the writing is hilarious and should easily keep you entertained, on top of the deep and interesting gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\n\nLike I said, everything is a resource, including gold, level-ups (they fully heal you, in addition to giving extra stats), items you don't use, and even exploration!  This is the source of the puzzle nature of the game, as maximizing the utility of your resources to defeat higher-level monsters is essential for defeating the harder difficulties.  Every dungeon has one or more level 10 bosses, who must be defeated to win.  These bosses are appropriately epic, sporting significantly higher stats than the other dungeon inhabitants, so much of the challenge comes from getting to the point where you can take them on.\n\nDesktop Dungeons includes a large variety of dungeons and challenges of varying difficulties that will keep you coming back for more.  In true roguelike spirit, all dungeons are randomized each time you attempt them.  While the normal dungeons may just feature a set of monsters and a level 10 boss, the hard and vicious dungeons all have their own gameplay gimmicks which make them feel unique, like separate challenges.  In addition to the standard dungeons, there are also a large number of challenges and puzzles to complete to improve your skills and unlock items.  I can't say I enjoyed the puzzles as much as the challenges and dungeons, but the puzzles are completely optional.\n\nAs you complete those dungeons, you will obtain gold which can be used to improve your kingdom, unlocking new classes, races, and preparations for dungeons.  These preparations can be used to aid future dungeon runs in certain strategic ways.  For example, you can guarantee that you start with a fireball, a useful preparation for the sorcerer.  By doing so, however, you give up the ability to increase your stats through a different preparation.  These preparations provide a good amount of strategy to a run through carefully planning which ones you will need to defeat a certain dungeon.  They also cost gold, which can be daunting for new players.  However, preparations are never actually required to clear a dungeon, and one preparation even massively increases the gold that you receive from clearing a dungeon successfully.\n\nMusic:\n\nDesktop Dungeons has a pretty good thematic soundtrack by the same person who composed the soudtrack for Super Meat Boy.  There are over 20 tracks, many just to set a nice atmosphere for a given dungeon.  I personally still haven't gotten tired of the music, and I've played well over 100 hours of the game, another testament to how fun and addictive this game is!\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics have a nice, distinctive style, and are pretty good for a roguelike.  However, the gameplay is what makes Desktop Dungeons good, not the graphics.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDesktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games, with nearly unlimited replayability and deep strategy.  Most of the negative reviews here focus on the difficult gameplay.  If you want a sense of about how difficult the normal-hard dungeons are here, check out the award-winning alpha version, which is available for free online.  Personally, I think that the difficulty is one of the best aspects of the game.  If you're like me, finally beating a difficult dungeon with a certain class or restriction, is an extremely rewarding experience.  But if you expect a path to beat the game without learning the strategy, you will be disappointed.  The game could be better at teaching you that strategy, but there are guides out there if you get stuck.","June 21, 2014","true","218.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even when you win, the player has to go through dozens of level just to unlock minor upgrades.

The core mechanics are still there - strategic turn-based dungeon crawling that plays out like a puzzle you're trying to solve, maximizing the efficiency of every attack, every move - along with a beatuiful music and graphics upgrade, heaps more of the dry, witty humour, more classes and races, and bit of a story arc/narrative progression through the missions instead of randomly generated encounters. (although it's got those too)\n\nIt also feels like the difficulty was amped up a bit more, it seems a lot harder to get up to Level 10, so the game isn't as "casual" as the freeware version.  Not that I didn't have to stop and ponder about how to best solve a dungeon in the freeware version, but I find myself doing it a lot more for a lot longer in the full version.  It's not necessarily a complaint, but it feels like a map takes about 20-30 mins to beat, verses the 10-15 mins I felt with the freeware version.\n\nAll in all an excellent light-hearted puzzle/strategy game with some decent depth and tough choices to make.

I played free variant for a long time, before picking up this  release.\n\nThe released version adds more of everything, more monsters, spells, classes, quests, rewards ...\nThis version also has upgraded graphic, making everything more charming.\n\nGame play is turn based, with monster being stationary (some bosses have blink spell, that moves them unless you counter it.). At the beginning dungeon has fog of war. You reveal parts of dungeon by moving to adjacent square. You want to be carefull how much of a dungeon you reveal, since each square you reveal, recovers some of you health and mana. This is the main way you will recover health and mana. This means that exploring too much too early can leave you unable to heal, later on. On the other hand each square you reveal can have beneficial items, that you might want. This makes unrevealed tiles in dungeon weary important resource.\n\nThis is a quick game. Once you get used to controls and basic concepts, you can easily complete a dungeon/quest in 5 min. If it will take you longer it will be because you spend time thinking of best move.\n\nGame is also paced quite well, so at the beginning you only have access to one class and one race (human fighter.), but you quickly unlock more.\n\nWith all that said, it is important to remember that this game is a filler game. It's meant to be played in short sessions.\nIf you play it for hours, you will quickly become bored.

It streamlines the concept a bit, simplifying it just enough for me to have a good time.  First you choose a race and a class (more of which get unlocked as you play), and move around a small dungeon, killing monsters and grabbing treasure.  Exploring new parts of the map heals you, so you want to make sure you don't over-explore too early.  There aren't a lot of healing potions on each map, so you'll need those unexplored tiles to heal yourself after each fight.\n\nI've enjoyed the free "alpha" version for years, but didn't think the full version would be worth the money.  I finally bought it on sale, and so far I think it's been worth it.  The most obvious improvement is the graphics, which are now vibrant and whimsical, but still very simple.  Instead of just starting a dungeon through lifeless menus, the game is now framed with an expanding town.  You can still get into a random dungeon with just a couple of clicks, but you also have the option of completing specific missions that help improve the town and unlock new options.\n\nThis version of the game is a bit friendlier than the alpha, with several optional tutorials and practice dungeons to teach you how various things work.  But this user-friendliness doesn't mean it's lost its edge.  It's still a very deadly game of resource management, and I still lose much more often than I win.  But that's what makes it fun.\n\nIf you've never played the free version, try that first.  That will let you know if you like the gameplay.

Then, it gets steep quickly.\nI haven't decided if the problem is the procedurally generated levels (meaning you can't figure out the right path and then execute it properly on the second run, if you didn't manage it the first time), or if the problem is the tricks you can use to beat things beyond your normal abilities (an expectation that once you've encountered an ability, you'll be able to put it in practice like a seasoned rules lawyer).\nEither way, the Normal dungeons are all too difficult for me, even after several runs at trying to solve them.\nThe result, however, is this: far from being a fun and quirky game you can use to fill ten minutes for a break from your work, it becomes a frustrating problem that has players spending much longer than intended trying to beat a dungeon, any dungeon, before giving up in furstration.\nGreat idea, lousy execution.","July 19, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mash strat, stat and items to overcome evil all the while managing your health, mana and survival.

Many ingame achievements such as winning without use of healing or mana pots, using only physical or magical damage, won the round with each of the various classes, etc.\n\nI keeps you going that's for sure but the difficulty ramps up the farther you go and unlocking new classes, abilities and powers for your Mage, Thief, Fighter and Priest (to start) which should hold most of the 'genre' to a good long while.\n\nI had played the free version for awhile prior to the purchase of the retail so I'm hoping to get more time in it amongst the other dozen or so of things I need to get back too (lol, gamer ADD am right?!) but it's nice to play a round at lunch or while on an important conference call for work (note, please do not impact your work productivity on a game; that's foolish..

A rogue-ish, tile-based dungeon crawler with a town-building metagame. If you ever played the mobile game "Dungeon Ascendancy," this feels a lot like that.

Since uncuvering unexplored tiles is your primary healing method, you also have to keep yourself from exploring the whole dungeon before killing any monsters.\n\nDD seems like a really excellent base engine for some game-changing DLC or a very interesting sequel.","March 9","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely a one-of a kind. Honestly, the game is fun, strategic and has received a lot of acclaim and approval from the gaming community. But getting past that, is it really a game you want to play? You start out as a Human Fighter trying to beat dungeons, steal their loot, all for the rightful mission of building your own cities. On the way, you meet fearsome monsters and plots that could end your city..Or fund your wealth. A lot of story-telling is involved, for example, you can even call forth the power of the ancient deities to aid you in your quest, or make a Pact with another to become more resilient. There are a lot of customization and combinations one can try to beat the levels.\n\nThis game is definitely worth its price.
