I enjoy RTS games that deviate from the norm.  This does both, and I really wanted to like it but I don't.\n\nLet's get the "early access" stuff out of the way first: sometimes your game is too early in development even for early access, and this game is a prime example of that.  The UI is hideous, hard to use, barely functional and sometimes busted.  Actually managing anything is more of a chore because of the UI, and keeping track of things is difficult.  Moving the camera around in the world is cumbersome at best.  Too many things require ridiculous micromanagement where it feels like things could be much more readily automated.  Placing buildings and trees is spotty, I'm not convinced that the game itself even knows what a legal placement is.  Casting spells is hit or miss, as sometimes you wanna cast a spell on someone or something and end up selecting them instead.\n\nAs it is now, this build is nothing more than a prototype or proof of concept and, in my opinion, has no business being sold for money right now.\n\nI see potential here, I do, but as of writing this I can NOT recommend this to anyone.\n\nGripes not about early access: resource scarcity and discovery is frustrating and annoying.  The game description says it is 2D, but it feels more like it's 1-dimensional.  If you think about it, even games like Black & White are fundamentally 2D, just using 3D graphics.  I don't really like the idea of a god game in a side-view one-dimensional space such as this, but it is unique and some people may enjoy the change of perspective.  Resource costs are just ridiculous.  It takes like 15 logs and 10 stone to build a building, yeah okay cool that makes sense, but it takes 5 logs and 2 whole bolts of cloth to make a single bow.  That's just silly.\n\nThe title screen music is VERY nice though.  I just wish there was more music throughout the game, as it just disappears when you actually start playing.\n\n\nKey provided for the purposes of this video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5aWBDuNlPk\n\n*edit: pasted wrong video link","December 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 87 of 124 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","87","124","4","17"

You control a tribe, your ‘minions’ (no, not the annoying yellow things we’re all sick of), and need to fight skeletons, barbarians, swamp people, sometimes tribesmen and the inevitable starvation that we all put our townspeople through whenever we play these kinds of games. You’ll need to build housing to expand your population, pay tributes to the barbarians you’re at war with so they don’t flatten you the next day, mine for stone and ore, grow food, build portals and explore the surprisingly large world for those diminishing resources. It slightly reminds me of Kingdom, so if you liked that, you’d probably also really like Life is Hard.\n\nYou’ll also have to keep your villagers happy with a steady supply of beer, made in a tavern. Keeping inter-village relations friendly is also a great idea. Occasionally, a caravan trader will stop by and you have the option to trade with him or loot his goods (which will damage your relationship with him and his village). You can also send out your own cart to gather resources, although it will occasionally break, requiring resources you’ve gathered at home to repair. It may also get looted itself, so it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the expense and the risk.\n\nThe game offers multiple bonuses at the start to help customize and diversify each playthrough, adding hours of replay time. You can pick one god out of six at the beginning of your township and each god gives you extra resources, damage, or faith. Damage bonuses are particularly useful against the nightly mobs and later on in the game barbarians, faith is used to cast healing spells or special attacks for your paladin, and extra resources are very, very helpful. Believe me when I tell you, you’re going to be counting every single resource you have.\n\nAt this stage, the game is still in Early Access and still has quite a few bugs. Currently you cannot save your game at all, which is both a blessing and a curse. The steam overlay is currently a little funky, although it works perfectly fine. The tutorial pictures will sit on top of the text if you’re not playing the game full-screen with a higher resolution, although this is easily fixed by doing the aforementioned. I really love the hot keys that are available for each of the building, spell and tribe menus, as well as the menu’s themselves. While they’re mostly easy to understand, you’ll come across one or two buttons that don’t seem to have a clear purpose, but again, it’s not too big of a deal. The developers first language is not English, and while all the text is completely understandable, you’ll definitely notice.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game if you enjoy resource management and strategy games. If you’re not a fan of playing perfectly finished games I’d definitely chuck Life is Hard on your wishlist to wait until it’s out of Early Access, but so far I think it’s worth the $8.

That said it's relatively bug free. Saving a game takes FOREVER and my computer says the game has stopped responding and is frozen but after giving it up to 5 minutes it finishes saving.\n\nThe game is decent especially seeing as it's a small team. I only had the one major bug the day I bought it when it was crashing whenever you tried to play and it was fixed by the next morning so the dev's are on top of things. I recommend this game if you like supporting alpha games that have potential and are ok playing the unfinished game and watching it develop. I don't recomend this game if you want a finished game that has everything already implemented and set.\n\nAs a budding programmer myself I see a lot of potential in this game and even have ideas on what I would do differently. Or implement. One thing I would like is when you set villagers on gather wood they don't change that setting unless they die or you tell them to stop. though I think that is supposed to be how it works since thats how mining works. likely just a bug like no tree in area so it stops. I'd also like a farmer setting. The crops grow and need to be planted so frequently it takes away from everything else. I feel a farmer setting so that they deal with that would be perfect.","April 5","true","6.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

High reviews, and the low price drew me in, but it was the gameplay that kept me going.\n\nLife Is Hard is yet another survival simulator, but one of a totally different breed. You start off with four villagers, each of which are capable of gathering every resource you need, and a chosen god, which allows for various features during the game. For instance, one god allows you to gather extra faith, which allows you to heal your villagers, deal damage to enemies, and plant trees necessary for wood.\n\nIt operates much like an RTS (Real Time Strategy) game, similar to Starcraft and Age of Empires in terms of 'build trees' and various buildings that produce various resources. One building allows you to make bread, which provides food, another is an armory to build weapons and armor, etc. Due to this feature, the game is a constant balance of resources.\n\nI'd say the main selling point of the game is that it's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ charming. You can tell that a lot of work went into it, and the passion behind it is palpable. I've played my fair share of survival sims, but it's rare that I replay them at all. With Life Is Hard, I finally found a nice sit-down survival sim that allows for quick one-off runs while still maintaining it's charm and overall fun.\n\nVERY high replay value, although initially, it's a lot to adjust to. In time, when you get more used to the game, different gods allow for all sorts of different builds. You could be a warring tribe, a peaceful tribe, farmers, merchants, etc. With all of this quality and attention to detail, as well as the high replay value, this is shaping up to be a beautiful little game.\n\nAt the moment, the game is marketed at $7.99. While I think this is absolutely worth the price, I might wait for the sale if you're unsure. Overall, if you enjoy survival simulators, and want to support indie developers, this is a great little game.","January 26","true","3.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It is an Early access game so I am going to review it just as that with what is in the game as of right now. I will update my review as they proceed to add content.\nFirst off I really like the pixelated art style the game gives. Everything looks really nice and really has a good bit of detail. The other thing that is nice about the game is the amount of depth the game has for an Early access title. At first things are really hard to understand even with the tutorial but if you go back and read things over and over like I did you should have no problem. Now I will talk about what I did not like. That being the sounds, it really is annoying to hear some of the same sounds over and over. Maybe it's just me but I had to cut sounds almost all the way down. Something else that is annoying was the janky ui, its really hard to tell what you are doing at times or what you need to do. Like I said before the tutorial is really hard to understand so you may need to watch some youtube videos to get a little extra help.\nSo after about 5-6 hours of playing the game I would say that there is enough here already to warrant a good purchase and they are putting in content pretty steadily. I would recommend this game right now and if you can catch it on sale thats even better.","November 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

I am interested to see how the game will develop, and will most definitely re-visit the game and my review of it in a few months.\n\nAs a strategy game Life is Hard already offers a decent complexity of choice -- updgrade the settlement, craft items, explore, gather resources, and defend from skeletons by night and norse raiders by day. All activities are limited by availability of free settlers to carry out orders. From time to time help your settlers with spells at the cost of faith points.\n\nAll this sounds nice and undoubtedly will make for an engagind and difficult strategy game, however at the moment it's mired by a very poor user interface -- in terms of form, accessibility, as well as the amount of information available. Other reviewers mention this too, and some dismiss this criticism arguing that players can learn and adapt to the interface with time. True, but we should not have to.\n\nMost of the orders are issued by clicking on an object -- building, resource, etc -- and the nearest free settler will take care of it. Some orders can be set to repeated -- chopping trees, minig, gathering rocks -- by clicking again on the resource. This can be a bit finnicky as sometimes the click areas don't seem to overlap with the object in question, or clicks don't register. Elsewhere the clickable buttons lack tooltips to clarify what action ca be performed. There are menus to see status of each settler and issue resource-gathering orders quickly, however these don't work properly -- cannot click on settler to jump to them, and clicking the issue order button doesn't always work.\n\nPlayers also have a Hero unit to direct, a stronger attacking unit with skills. Controlling the hero is a pain though. The hero is utterly lazy -- monsters can be destroying building and killing settlers next to him yet he won't do anything unless ordered (or attacked directly). There is a button to select the hero but it scrolls the camera to him as well. The world is a very, very, very long horizontal map and TONS of scrolling is required to navigate it. There is a 'minimap' which can be used to quickly scroll over vast distances but it less helpful when navigating medium distances (like from one end of your settlement to the other). This gets in the way if your Hero is chilling while skeletons attach from the other end of the settlement as you have to scroll for several long seconds while your settlers are being killed. There should be an option to order the hero to a particular location without moving the camera. Oh, and if the hero dies there is no indication of this. Yeah. Clicking on the 'center on hero' button does nothing.","February 25","false","5.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","4"

I know it is Early Access, but it is in version .9 now and should have most of the bugs worked out. I KNOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. Here is a list of bugs I came across not even mentioning the horrific balancing and game mechanics:\n1. Villager instantly died from illness, then when I revived him with faith, he kept insta-dying.\n2. I bought "Reinforcements" from the nomads, 8 to be exact, but nothing showed up, no one came. I spent all of my wood on them for nothing.\n3. I "declared war" on the Nords. I selected 6 soldiers to go, but nothing happened. No war happened at all.\n4. My villagers were going to sleep for like 20 hours a day. They would wake up and I would task them, then walk about 10 steps before turning around to go back to sleep. Happened with multiple villagers.\n\nThose are just what I would consider "bugs" so far. There is a laundry list of unintuitive gameplay controls and mechanics. It took me 2 hours of play to figure out how to get villagers to do stuff. The combat it horrific, random villagers seem to run into battle and throw themselves in the line of fire instead of staying behind the hero or well armed villagers. You can't really control villagers(especially in battle), you cant position them very easily, you have to issues them a tasks(chop wood, hunt, gather berries, "guard here", etc) to make them do anything so combat is very difficult to control. All combat involves is people standing next to each other swinging repeatedly. That is fine, but it is very difficult to get anyone to fight the right enemy, so everyone dies when they didn't need to. Nords are stupid OP. They come demanding resources from you every couple of days, if you can't pay then they attack you. Usually if you can't pay you aren't going to be able to defend against them either. I went to attack the nords and they had an infinite supply of soldiers to keep throwing at me. I killed like 10-15 of them, but they kept coming, even after I destroyed the two houses they were getting all of this population from (wtf). The skeletons come every night. These are just some of the gameplay mechanics that are awful. The balancing is up to interpretation as this is supposed to be difficult. The problem is when the difficulty is amplified by the shoddy controls and UI. Really, I haven't seen many games with this bad of a UI. Half the time I am in a menu and have no idea how to get out of it or get to a different menu. There are losts of clunky problems involving tasking the villagers and getting the right ones to do the work you want. I would be okay recommending this if the devs were able to streamline the UI and controls more and get rid of some of the bugs. I can't recommend it until then though.","May 27","false","3.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

I am at the moment coming from a much simpler game to this called Kingdom and the tutorial fails to properly teach you what you want to know.  However, that said, it is also a game where you learn as you go and with little to lose I do love the fact that you can play, get ♥♥♥♥ed up by barbarians/skeletons/hunger/whatever and then restart and go on.\n\nI cant understand how to place buildings and what the requirements are.  I can do it however sometimes it wont let me place buildings in a perfectly normal place.  Also, my villagers dont constantly do their job such as farm/gather wood.  They do it for a bit and then stop. Not sure if that is a feature at this point?\n\nIm loving all the hot keys and such, P to easy assign and C to view characters is great, it would be nice to have S working to go to the surface as well and not just underground but Im sure it will come in the future.  There is plenty to be improved on however I would reccomend this without a doubt!\n\nPlease watch the video above for my first reactions and also examples of the issues i have mentioned so far.\n\nThanks and have a great day guys!","November 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","13","29","3","4"

It's still using the Personal Version of Unity...\n\nThe game started in a 2560x1440 even though I have a 1080p screen, it's not a widescreen. So I had to scoot that over to change the resolution. As soon as I changed the resolution the screen went black and remained that way. Had to restart the game to see the changes, finally decided I'd just click Fullscreen and that seemed to do the trick.\n\nOnce you get in-game you'll see the tutorials are VERY lacking, the moving speed (moving the camera left and right) is really fast and no adjustments for it. When you click buttons there is no indication it was clicked so you have no idea if the button you just hit actually worked or not.\n\nThe game in it's current condition is not worth it, even at $7. I'll personally be refunding it. It's pretty clear this was someones hobby project. They're inexperienced and they released it far too early. I thought it would be at least SOMEWHAT as fun and interesting as Kingdoms, but there is just far too little polish. It needs some major work.","November 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 23 of 50 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","23","50","0","10"

This game is also very good for what it is... as it is only a small pixel game, most likely created in a matter of weeks/months, of which shows that the developer is a hard worker. I can tell a lot of work has gone into this game, and I would like to thank the people who have left reviews for me to base my one upon, although I may visit this game in the future and play it, and develop my review even further.\n\nConsAs I did mention that the game is a small pixel game, I do have to put some bad things on here, this game would be pretty good if it was a 3d game. Also the UI is a bit bad, it has little functions, and would be much better if it was a bit more enhanced, other than that I have seen a couple of reviews saying the game is glitchy, but they have failed to state the glitches so I cannot give my input on that.\n\nOverall reviewThis game looks really really good, but I am not all that good at strategy games and plus I don't really enjoy playing them, but I would personally give this game a go, it doesn't look like it is fully based on strategy, so I wouldn't mind testing it out a bit, I would personally recommend this game, as it is $8, and is very smart, I give props to developers, and give them a nice review due to the detail I have seen so far, keep up the work.\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s):[/h1] Pirozhok Studio, Vitaliy Ruzankin\nPublisher(s): Pirozhok\nPlatform(s): Windows, SteamOS, Mac\nRelease Date: November 3rd 2015\n\nSourcesSteam Store Page\nReading reviews\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 15","true","6.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

I love the concept and i understand that this is in beta but. . .\n\nThis game has some serious problems to the point of not being fun. For example the nords guy comes almost every day to demand resources from you or else they attack. Thats a great concept. However, you only give us 1 day to prepare between each time he comes. The first day he requires 8wood/stone. Then the next is 20? How is this fun?\n\nYou don't allow the players to build any proper defenses or even allow us to place stuff where we want to. Last i checked Farms are built in open fields not on dead trees only.\n\nAlso i dont know if im the only one getting this game breaking bug but the women always sit in the houses sleeping... They dont even make any more babies ... they just sleep. Now i dont want to bring sexism into this but i think women do more then just sleep...\n\nAlso there is no quick move function other then space bar to MAYBE go where your base is begin attacked. Building have no hp so they are dead before you can press space bar anyways. Also since you are under attack you can't even defend against it.\n\nHero has no hp, attack damage or changeable equipment. Matter of fact he isnt even that speical. Why even have him in the game.\n\nThe list of issues continues i just dont feel like investing any more time at the moment into this.\n\nIn summary your game is broken. There is just so many issues that the game is bordering on unplayable.\n\n::Edit:: After comments from Pirozhok studio\n\nYou say every three days but i've had "Nord Ambassador"  come every two days, during a few of my play throughs.\n\nI've been playing rts style games since warcraft, command and conquer, and starcraft. To me this is what this game reminds me of. A 2D rts/survival which is great. Like i said before I love the concept and understand that this game is in its early stages. However, a much better user interface is needed. You should be able to have  "warrior units" that you equipt with proper gear  be selectable and hotkeyed.  If it is night time for example i should just be able to find the threat "press 1"  and send my troops to defend. HECK maybe even have a formation where archers are in the back with the melee troops in the front. I mean that would be an awesome idea.\n\nDay and night cycle needs to be extended. I didnt time your cycles exactly but 3 min of day time seems kinda off and that night time doesnt really feel tense enough. I want to sweat dreading night time. Not just day night day night. Should be a dusk and dawn with events (like skellies burn in sun light). Maybe have the monsters act differently during the cycles. It is just a throught. Right now its just very bland.\n\nWith all due respect but the hero is useless at the start of the game. His spells suck. He can barley survive the first night of skellies. Hp regen is a joke even with the "skill" you provide. He didnt even regen his hp fast enough from the first night to survive the second night. He has no upgradeable equipment.  At least non that i can see. I felt that this hero is compareable in damage to an unarmed village person ..... I mean that cant be right lol. Also instead of have skills cost faith have a hero leveling system would be much more involved. Get a little rpg element to it would be fun.\n\nNext topic building placement. Yes i know upgrading your town hall gets you increased building radius. However, if i build the "gates" to block skellies, nords, or those meteorite fire guys. It doesnt matter cause all it does is slow them down. You cant move your guys (other then the hero) to defend the gate. Also you cant build the archer towers close enough to the gates to even defend the gates before they are breached. Speaking of the gates are they made of wood or paper cause the skellies break them down within seconds. Its not just the archer towers, i have had countless troubles placing every one of the provided buildings. For example You can only place farms  on trees or berry bushes. Thats kinda silly.\n\nWood Resourses.... You literally have a forest of trees in the background... Yet after the 5th night. Takes my villagers a day to go find a tree to chop down and bring it back... A whole day. So unless i use three faith to build a tree to have it chopped down closer my town hall, the expanding process becomes next to impossible. This would be less of a problem if i could build the supply building where ever i want but even after expanding my base still wont let me place it where i want inside my walls. The walls of which i cant defend.... with the gate made of paper.\n\nStone Resourses... Not much of a problem here at the start pretty straight foward. My only advice here would be in the tutorial make it so you set your guy to auto mine before switching to the farming part of the tutorial. I forgot to go back to set him to mine a few times. My  problem with mining was only until my miners explored more of the mine that Hey they are under attack. Oh whats this a portal that has tons of minions coming out of.... I love the idea of the whole underground area but i dont think they should just automatically come out of the portal and attack. You should the one to unlock the next area of the mine. Not just have 12 goblins come out and kill all your miners. SURPRISE!... It wasent a very fun surprise. You should have the portal be closed untill your troops open the portal so you can atleast confront the threat when your ready.\n\nFood.... is not bad. Need to lower the damage of the animals in my opinion. Farming is easy enough but you should should have a tooltip to make it automatic farming. I dont want to be bothered auto planting four farms constantly of pumpkins, wheat, and corn. Suppose to be a god in the game right? Same thing with shrooms in the underground. Should be auto farmable.\n\nTowns people: Need to be able to fully heal after sleeping for a day. If i have warrior units i need them fresh for the 3 min day night cycle. I dont have to have to sit there and take off all the gear and put them on someone else. Thats boring and slows the game down.\n\nHad an idea for a new area while typing this. Do the whole jack and the bean stalk  story. Have an event where you can plant beans in the farm and grow them into the clouds. Have your troops attack a castle with monsters to steal treasure. Could be fun for a new area down the road.\n\nThanks for taking the time to write me back. Since you took the time i wrote all this as my thanks! Good look with the game and im looking foward for future updates.","January 15","true","9.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","2"

I gave it a try, as I love strategy and resource management games, and it simply does not manage to keep me interested. The game feels clunky (the interface is subpar at best), and only a few parts of the resource management can be automated (I don't think you can automate farming, for instance), which is not great for a "strategy" game (imagine sending a worker in starcraft to the mineral patch manually every time). I realize it's early access, but the game just doesn't feel... fun.","November 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

I don't leave them lightly. I hope that the developer pays attention to any feedback.\n\nLuckily I got this on sale for $3.19 (60% off). I was hoping I wouldn't run into the problems other people were having since I've dodged problems before, but this is just ridiculous.\n\nI've only played 30 minutes, and I've already run into these problems:\nCan't cut down trees - As someone else pointed out, it just all of the sudden loses the ability to chop them down. Considering everything requires massive amounts of wood, this is a HUGE problem. It's such a glaringly obvious defect that I can't even let it slide for an Early Access game.\nSaving is ridiculously slow - It's so slow, there's even a notice saying it can take up to 2 minutes. It actually can take longer. But for a little village with 7 minions, 2 houses, a farm, and a pig pen, that is just obscene. I've had massive Minecraft worlds with epic structures that would save in a blink of an eye. Almost every game I have can save in under 5 seconds. I don't know what this thing is doing, but damn, it needs fixing.\nThe minions are just too slow - I chose God of Architecture in hopes of them going faster. Nope. They are so slow that gates are useless. They are a waste of wood. The skeletons always break them down. Along those lines, a regular farmer minion can punch a skeleton to death whereas my one warrior got killed since he only hits once every few seconds.\nGuaranteed invasions from the start - It's damn near impossible to get going because of those stupid skeletons and "ambassadors" coming to ♥♥♥♥ you of your resources. With extremely high resource requirements for even the most basic of things, growing is just painful.\nYou have to memorize controls - Really? I can play Ages of Empires without needing to press random keys to perform an action. I couldn't even figure out how to get back and forth to the main toolbar at the bottom. Sometimes it was a left-click, sometimes right-click, other times I just pressed ESC twice.\nI could go on just based on 30 minutes, but you get the idea, and other people have pointed out the flaws. I'm not going to bother posting feedback since I'm sure it has been covered. I'm going to Follow the game for updates, and hopefully these massive problems will be fixed. I really want to like the game, but when I can't even play it due to the game itself, I have to give it a No.\n\nI'll revise this later if it gets better. This thing should've never gone into Early Access at a pre-alpha stage.","April 17","false","1.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","11"

There is one main cause...\n\nThe bugs. As of right now the game is almost unplayable due to some pretty massive problems.\n\nHere are a few I've encountered:\n- Suddenly completely unable to chop down any trees. Reloading saved game does not help.\n- Invisible villagers. They can be called to perform jobs and will go there but the job is not carried out.\n- Villagers getting stuck and not moving. Reloading saved game does not help.\n- Game resizing from fullscreen to windowed randomly with no option to turn it back on.\n- Cursor broken and restricted to a smaller area in the game window.\n- Infuriating sound problems where sounds lag or produce buzzing. (Windows 10 specific)\n\nThe tutorial is bad. You're instantly thrown into it and forced to place buildings and equip villagers with items before you even know the basics like how to move the screen, navigate the UI or what the village even looks like. They also don't tell you about most of the game. It's easier to skip it and work it out for yourself.\n\nThe sound is terrible. Even the sounds that aren't broken and produce lag and buzzing sound terrible. The voices of the villagers sound like someone recorded their non-English-speaking kid siblings in a cellar.\n\nThe art is decent. I like the pixel style but it could use some more polishing. The big update was needed.\n\nThe game play could be fun! It has a lot of potential! I really wish they work hard on this. If the bugs are fixed, more features are added and the controls are made better I could imagine myself spending hours playing this.\n\nThere are two major things that need to be made better though:\n- You need a lot better control over your villagers. You need to be able to cancel tasks and make them walk to where you want them. Being able to select multiple villagers would also be nice, especially as your village grows.\n- You need a way better warning system for when enemies are near. As of now there is no warning or indication what so ever that enemies are destroying the blockades into your town. This means that even if you've got defences up and villagers who can fight, the enemies can get really far into your town before you can fight back. It also doesn't help that the villagers walk superslow and that you can't make them walk towards the edges of the town manually to get ready.","April 15","false","8.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","6"
