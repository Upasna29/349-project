The biggest problem I have with this game is the lack of modules/ships/races.  I had unlocked everything after the first few normal missions, and there just isn't much.\n\nUnlike GSB 1, where there wasn't much in terms of ship class specialization, GSB 2 is all about specializing what a ship can do based on its size.  This means that each ship size only has a few different weapons/modules, and they all basically do the same thing.  Dreadnaughts, for example, have a handful of different laser and missle weapons they can use.  But the range is the same on just about every component, and the damage is very similar.  Ultimately your choice comes down to "fire slightly faster or hit slightly harder".  There also isn't really a good point defense option in the game either, but that doesn't really matter because missles are just basically slow beam weapons - they lack the range or damage or GSB 1 missles weapons.\n\nLike I said, GSB 2 predicates the game on specializing ships based on size.  Dreadnaughts are *supposed* to have a hard time killing fighters, which are supposed to be good at killing dreadnaughts, for example.  The idea behind this is you need a mix of fighters/destroyers/dreadnaughts to have a viable fleet.  In practice this specialization doesn't work.  Fighters can't damage dreadnaught shields or armor, and dreadnaughts have access to tractor beams which allow them to kill fighters.  Destroyers meanwhile, which are supposed to be the anti-fighter ship, arn't amazing at killing fighters because destroyers are quite fragile and, unlike dreadnaughts, fighters actually can kill destroyers quite quickly.  The AI is kind of stupid and ignores destroyers with its fighters, but that doesn't fix the underlying problem.\n\nUltimately, I found that a fleet composed of dreadnaughts, each of which had two tractor beams, could easily beat all of the normal and hard missions in the game.  The absolute lack of components makes this a very boring strategy, as just about every ship of a given class is going to look almost identical to any other ship of that class regardless of how you try to build it.\n\nI was also dissapointed with the other races.  The game ships with 4, the basic terran race you get at the start and the 3 other races that you have more than enough points to unlock after the tutorial mission (along with just about every component, seriously I know I said this before but I think I had unlocked literally everything by mission 4).  I don't get what the benefit of the other races over the terran race is.  They all appear to be the same - focused very heavily on armor with 1 or 2 exclusive components that arn't really any different from the basic components.  One thing I really liked about GSB 1 was that the races were quite distinct, but GSB 2 is just really lacking in that area.\n\nAll in all, the game is dissapointing.  I see what they were going for design wise - trying to force you to make more complicated fleet and ship designs by hyper specializing each ship class.  However, their implementation of that fell flat on its face and, in practice, all it has led to is a very simplified, very boring version of GSB 1.","April 18, 2015","false","2.4"," 262 of 291 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","262","291","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/344840/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","A gratuitous sequel or a gratuitously tough act to follow?\nGratuitous Space Battles was always going to be a tricky one to follow, it was lightning in a bottle, a game where you sat back and enjoyed a cold or hot drink as fleets you carefully designed smashed into each other for your entertainment. It had the benefit of many years of polish, expansion, and even a full on 4X-lite mode which allowed you to involve yourself and lose yourself in a campaign based around those massive, wonderful battles.\n\nIt's a game with a very unique premise and therefore making a sequel was always going to be a harsh one to follow up, because whatever was made, it was going to always be held up to not the "initial release" of GSB, which barely anyone remembers, but the final, expansion laden version, which has so much more added to it. Extra races, game modes, everything.\n\nWhen the first game was so riveting, how do you go about improving the proverbial bicycle?\nSo we come to the second iteration of Gratuitous Space Battles. It's called GSB 2 but frankly I'm going to look at it from a different angle and call it Gratuitous Space Battles "Version 2". What -should- have happened (and Cliffy is going to hate me for posting this) is that existing purchasers should have got an upgrade discount, a significant one, as a way of thanking them for their support and encouraging them to buy in to the new version of GSB. Financially it would not have been perhaps the best option, it's hard to say, but it would have been the most palatable option for the fans and would almost have certainly disarmed most of the initial complaints.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is functionally GSB but effectively rebuilt from the ground up, it has a new combat engine with additional classes of ship, a much, much more powerful graphics engine which means that the combat in space looks orders of magnitude more pretty (this is something of a double edged sword for some). However, much like the initial release, it only has the basics behind it, the initial set of challenges, the initial races and building blocks for you to get creative with. The blocks are good, the graphics and layout is a major step up though, but it's very, very much GSB1 upgraded, and there's no escaping that fact.\n\nMore no doubt is planned and will be added (indeed, custom battles are in, and more tools are being added into the ship creator screen), and Cliffy almost certainly will add a full fat singleplayer mode of some description (though it's unlikely to be an open ended 4X this time). But once again, we're back to GSB "Version 2.0" as opposed to say "2.7.x" with all the expansions and patches and balancing.\n\nSo there is good news on the horizon, yes?\nYes. I expect so, if previous games are anything to go by, this game will see a lot of post-release support, and a lot of extensions which will flesh out the game, solve the balancing, and over time refine a lot of the rough edges. Once the content is in and there's more meat on the bones, and the weapons are more balanced so they have their respective roles (along with the new ship classes), this will without doubt exceed GSB "Version 1", even with its' many expansions.\n\nBut claiming it's a sequel and not an upgrade of the original is probably the mistake that's been made, even if it's a perceptive one, this is very much the new version, and it should have been treated as "Gratuitous Space Battles 2.0" and not a sequel. It's not, it's the GSB we all know and love, but it's had the work done to it that makes it worthy of a major revision change, and a major update fee for people who were on the 1.x branch. People who hadn't bought in should still be paying in sum, the full price and deservedly so, GSB remains a brilliant, wonderful gem of a game, one that hasn't aged much (and with GSB2, it has the potential to remain current for an awful lot longer), but perhaps this was one of those occasions where a bit more care for the existing customerbase would have paid off in the long run.\n\nA tough place to be for an indie dev.\nI respect the need for Indie Devs to put food on the plate, but I also know the market, I've spent most of the last decade watching, analysing and monitoring the market as it's shifted, like dunes of sand across the desert. As good as the game is, it's not a sequel, it's the new version of GSB, it's -good- for what it is, but it's still very much in it's infancy, and therefore at least until the rough edges have been sanded off, you may want to wait just a little longer. As much as it pains me to stand against Cliffy, because I've been one of his more positive supporters over time, I feel this time he misjudged the launch and the initial rollout. Nothing unfixable, but for now I'd suggest giving this game more time to mature.\n\nUpdate : Post release, where's the gravy?\nThe game has been out now for quite some time, and this still remains a bitter pill for me to swallow, having been, and remaining a supporter of Positech's work. GSB2 has been a commercial misfire. The campaign as it is, is lackluster, and despite my repeated attempts to get a proper campaign structure put in, there was little interest in my suggestions. So what we have now is something that's barely functional and only adequate. There's STILL no significant post release content, even though there's been plenty of patch work and tweaking of balance (which still remains a bugbear, perhaps owing to the additional complexity of the game now with the additional ship classes and so on).\n\nI still believe it should be one to watch, and perhaps purchase at deep discount. But I cannot recommend this at full price as it stands. There's not enough here compared to it's infinitely richer predecessor, and prettier graphics alone don't cut it. Had Cliffy actually implemented a campaign worth a damn, then things might be a bit more promising, but right now? No dice. It seems right now his focus is on Democracy 3, which is probably for the best, as that is far more successful.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist it, and wait for a steep discount.\n\nUpdated 4/10/15","May 31, 2015","true","15.6"," 54 of 81 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","54","81","2","10"

The gameplay has potential, but it's unbalanced, it favors a stupid strategy, and once you figure out your special fleet, it will beat all 10 levels, of which is basically the whole game. For $25, I spent about $2.50 per hour I paid, and you can find plenty of games where you'll get much more gameplay for your buck.\n\nIt's got a ton of potential. It's super fun to design ships, use your energy/crew economy and try to figure out the most balanced and effective fleet to crush an opponent. But once you figure out the game, how the parts work, and spend a little time designing a really good ship, you'll beat the whole short game.\n\nI had a ton of fun at first. Then I realized that I could just create a fleet of my strongest ship and crush all the levels they have, and there are not many levels at all. You can fight in about 10 different scenarios, with a normal/hard/extreme difficulty, but once you made your special fleet, you can pretty much crush any of them. For me, that was just putting as many of my dreadnought class ships as I could. They had just a few anti-fighter (small ship) weapons, and tons of one type of missile. It destroyed everything on almost every map.\n\nAnd once you figure that one out, you can just rack up "Honor" which is used to unlock new parts, but they're not going to change the game too much.\n\nI want the game to be more balanced. I want to have to build a balanced fleet with specialized ships that heal my ships, special dog-fighters, destroyers that counter their destroyers, but it doesn't matter. All I need is my one dreadnought with all the missiles and it'll crush anything large or small.\n\nSo, IMO, this game is a waste of money. It needs some massive changes for it to actually fulfill it's potential, and I don't think they're going to spend their time and change it that drastically. If your dreadnoughts can take care of all the little guys because their armor is too high to take any damage from them, why bother building small guys that won't be able to destroy their dreadnoughts? Just have more dreadnoughts than the enemy and you win.\n\nIt's really too bad, because I was having a ton of fun until I figured that cheap move out.

I have literally grown up with video games, and I am critical of them because they are important to me.  I like this franchise.  Keep that in mind.\n\nGSB2 is immediately something of a letdown.  The first --UNQUESTIONABLE FIRST-- thing any sequel should ALWAYS be doing is refining its UI.  GSB suffered from a horribly primitive UI wherein the mouse hand performed 99% of the interaction.  Ten fingers plus only one point of input=a very inelegant interface.  A game with as many sliders, locations, and items to interact with on a constant basis as GSB absolutely DEMANDS a more fluid control scheme.\n\nGSB2, above all else, has not remedied the problems of the first game.  Aside from the formation shortcut shift+F (the only one I use on an absolutely constant basis) there are far too many inputs and interactions in dire need of shortcut buttons, hotkeys and less intervening mouse clicks to get things done.  There are so many forced, unneeded clicks to jump around that just moving from one screen to the one you want feels tedious.  The series of actions needed to navigate the menu are unbelievably clunky; I counted having to hit the 'main menu' button FOUR TIMES CONSECUTIVELY to get to the actual main menu from some screens.  Not cool, Positech.  We're about to hit 2016; you can do better than this.\n\nI highly recommend, indeed IMPLORE the devs to rethink the menu navigation and interface; there is no logical need for it to be this clunky.  Number crunchy though it may be, it's played by human beings, and needs to be designed for human hands.\n\nThat said, I do still appreciate this sequel for what it is; more ways to build and blast tons of spaceships.  New weapon types, new support systems, more classes of ships, BIGGER ships, and generally just MORE of everything to like about the original.  If we can just get some efficiency, some human consideration, better conveyance and some elegance in design, GSB could go from cult favorite to mega-hit very, VERY quickly.","December 19, 2015","false","2.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It hasn't, it has surpased it by leaps and bounds. You not only have control over the weapons and gear your ships take to battle, you have the ability to design their apperance. To some this may not be a big deal, but to me it adds a layer of creative fun. The weapons and gear are varied and have an impact on tactics that can be profound when correctly used. The battle commands given prior to launching your fleet are easy to use and familiar to any one who played the first version.\nOne of the major changes is that Dreadnaughts are now part of the standard make up of the game. In the first game you had to download mods and go through the hoops to get them to work right, more about that later. Anyways, dreadnaughts make the game epic in scale that it might otherwise have lacked. There is nothing that says you have to use them, a small scrappy fleet can offer advantages over ponderous ships. There is a great deal of satisfaction though in seeing 3 or 4 heavy dreadnaughts glide through the debries of theri foes.\nNow, the mods. The first version had a healthy modding community and had tons of fun and crazy stuff. Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, and Star Trek were mod favorites. There was also a ton of mod races that were fresh fromt the mind of their creators. The game was made for mods and it was part of its brilliance. I haven't tried playing around with modding this version yet, but if it is anything like the first game it is sure to get some amazing mods and great DLC expansions.","June 9, 2015","true","9.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Well if you did, you are going to LOVE Gratuitous Space Battles II.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HxLtmv8vLjc\nI have been enjoying the Beta over the last few weeks and have finally had the chance to try the full release today (April 16, 2015).\n\nWithout a doubt, GSB II is pretty much a remake of the original with a variety of new key features and graphical upgrades. It includes what the original base game included; A main campaign, with an assortment of ship variants and weapons immediately available to you. You will then design new ships, place them on the battlefield using a limited number of command points, then push the "Fight" button to watch your ships fight for your honor. If you win the fight, you can use any unspent command points to then purchase new weapons, devices, armors, shield systems, hulls, and even a brand new race to fight your future battles. All of this hasn't changed from the original.\n\nWhat has changed is:\n\n► The ability to fully customize your ships with the visual editor. I must say that it is pretty darned good. It's not perfect, but it does allow layers, lighting and even moving parts.\n► New command for your ships and fleets, including formations\n► New size classes\n► Amazing visuals\n► New modules and ship rules like fighter bays for carrier ships\n► online features like the ability to challenge your friends (I cannot verify this yet as I have not been able to test it yet)\n► Modding support at launch!\n\nAlthough I have experienced a couple crashes here and there even with the full release version 1.23, the game seems to run pretty well even at the max settings. That being said, it is really quite pretty and the sound track is amazing.\n\nThis needs to have more content overall in order for it to become as relevant as the original. In particular I would like to see a strategic campaign like the original had added to it back in the day that allowed you manage your whole empires economy in a galactic conquest. Make that multiplayer somehow, and this would blow the roof off the pc.\n\nAll in all, it’s fun and satisfying to watch your ships crush the enemy for what appears to be, no reason what-so-ever.\n\nDisclaimer: I have not been given anything in return for this review. I purchased the Beta from the GBS II website in February 2015.\n\nFly safe!","April 16, 2015","true","2.2"," 68 of 123 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","68","123","2","0"

I like the funny random ship named, I like the chatter during combat, I enjoy the minor amount of strategy involved.  I loved the updated graphics, the explosions are pretty.\n\nWhat I don't enjoy are the ship modules.  There's really only a few of them worth using and there are obvious bests and not really any strategy to making a good ship unless you run into a problem where there's an anomoly that prevents you from using one of the components you're using.  Multi warhead missiles is the only weapon you ever need which is ridiculous, a nuke if you feel like it, tons of armor, repairs, no shields are EVER needed and rarely useful.  You never really need engines either which is uh.. a bit unrealistic but whatever.  Engines shouldn't even be a module, they should just come on the ship.  There's one map that doesn't allow repair modules... that's the only one I had to make a new ship for really after my basic dread/cruiser/destroyer setups were made.\n\nOn the note of ships all you really need to obliterate almost any map is a few dreads with tons of armor and repair systems and a few combat tractor beams to take out fighters.  Now there is one map where the enemy has a TON of fighters and this didn't work too well but other than that..  There's no point in frigates, none.  Fighters and Gunships (bigger fighters) are also completely unnecessary which is ridiculous and you only really need cruisers if you can't use dreads at that system and you build them just the same as you would a dread.\n\nI got about 9 hours out of the game before I had defeated every single battle map on normal, replayed a few several times over to see how little I could defeat it with and played through one shot of the "campaign" as they call it... which is a joke really because it's just like 6 battles in a row with the ships you set up for the first one. (minus any that die along the way)  A good bit of that time was spent designing ships (visually) as well which was fun, definitely a nice touch to the game.\n\nSo in closing I'll say this.  It was well worth the money I paid for it, it's a beautiful game visually compared to the first and I did get a good amount of fun out of it for the money I spent.  This said there is some serious room for work here, the game feels unfinished in some ways.

Those folks who had issues, should revisit the game.  The latest tweaks are mostly graphical re: shields.  I am updating this review to let people know the developer has consistently worked to fix bugs and add tweaks and even content, since the release.  If you were on the fence about this game, or you were initially disappointed with glitches, play the updated game with a fresh outlook and I think you be pleasantly pleased.\n--------\n\nThis is not just a redo of GSB1.  The game improves the graphics and the game play is similar to the original in that you design each of your ships, select and put together your perfect combination of those ships, give each ship orders for battle contigencies and then watch it unfold!   Formations of ships, placement and orders given, all play a role in what happens in the battles.  That part is the same and even better than the original!!!  GSB 2 adds new ship categories including gunships, destroyers (support ships) and Dreadnaughts (aka: battleships).  The Dreadnaughts can also be outfitted to be carriers as well.  It all depends on your designs.  This is where GSB 2 really shines!  You can modify all defensive and offensive aspects as well as engines, crew cabins, targeting enhancements, etc.  Once you decide on your ship's functional pieces and parts, you can design the asthetic pieces by adding various wings, structures, vents, engines, antennae, and so much more!  Pick the color of your ship and/or each individual part.  You can add spinning, blinking, and glowing parts to your ships.  So MANY choices! --The possibilities are nearly endless.  The battle modes are fun with 3 different levels of difficulty.  If that is not enough action for you, then try my favorite part, the "CHALLENGES"!  Face other players' fleets in asynchronous battles online.   The extra Steam workshop features push this game over the top.  If you are new to this, then the workshop can help you even more, being able to see what others are doing with their ships, etc.  I have spent many hours on the 1st game, the beta of this one, and will spend MANY more hours (much to the chagrin of my wife)  on this one!  This is NOT an arcade-style ACTION game.   It is not a 4X game.   It is an intellectual, planning and creative game that will provide hours of enjoyment as you try to build a better fleet than the game's or other players on the internet!","April 18, 2015","true","108.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasobenhaus/recommended/344840/","thomasobenhaus","a_tiny_child","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasobenhaus/","288 products in account","GSB2 improves upon nearly everything from GSB1.  If you're like me and you like watching some pew-pew and some boom-boom in space, you'll like Gratuitous Space Battles 2.  GSB2 is about the spectacle of watching fleets of spaceships blow each other up.  It is the best part of any sci-fi movie, turned into a game.\n\nThat being said, I will now qualify my recommendation and address complaints I've seen others make.  While I do think GSB2 improves upon nearly everything from GSB1, it doesn't really CHANGE a whole lot.  Nothing is really new or revolutionary to the design, although almost everything is a step up.  And the complaints others have made about about crashing, or what feels like a lack of content, are legitimate, although it has more content than GSB1.  Like I said, there isn't a lot of NEW stuff, although basically everything has been improved.\n\nGSB2 is a much prettier game than 1, with better lighting, better looking explosions, better looking ships, customizable ship appearances, and better looking debris and backgrounds.  I did turn off asteroids because, while they look cool, they were ultimately distracting.  Because there are a lot more layers of things happening (debris, ships, asteroids, clouds, etc.) it can be difficult to understand the action at times, especially when you have the wreckage of dozens of ships slowly floating across your screen.  While everything has more detail, GSB1 looked cleaner, if that makes sense.\n\nGSB2 seems more balanced than 1.  I'm writing this review after having played all the way through the missions that come with the game, and I beat them all on normal.  Combined arms are now much more important.  Whereas in GSB1 I basically never used destroyers, they have now become an important part of every fleet, because fighters are now harder to deploy.  Fighters in GSB1 were OP; you could deploy as many of them as you wanted, limited only by pilot availability, and simply use them to overwhelm larger and more powerful fleets.  Now fighters have fuel, which limits their deployment time before they have to refuel, and they have to be assigned to a "carrier" (cruiser or dreadnought with appropriate module) and carriers have limited hangar space.  Overall I found fleet composition to be more challenging and thoughtful experience.\n\nEven in the few hours I've played, I have experienced a handful of crashes.  While the crashes were annoying, no progress was ever lost, and I was able to get back to where I was within seconds.  The game loads fast.  I think complaints about the crashing are COMPLETELY legitimate, but overall the crashing didn't detract from my experience.  I also experienced a saved fleet not being available to load.  It only effected me one time, because there was only one time I wanted to recycle my fleet composition and disposition, but it is still a problem (albiet one that didn't bother me too much).\n\nThe one complaint I've seen that I don't quite understand are the complaints about a lack of campaign or strategic layer.  I mean I understand that people would like something like that... but... I mean it IS called GRATUITOUS Space Battles for a reason.  This game is about building fleets and watching them explode.  It delivers.\n\nGSB2 isn't a game I'm going to sit down a put 20 hours into all in one sitting, but it is a game I'll come back to from time to time over the next couple of years, just to fiddle around with ship designs, and to watch waves of missles smash their way through formations of spaceships.\n\nIf you've never played GSB1, then this is a great place to get started as it offers the same joys as the first one, but more interesting challenges.  If you loved GSB1, as I did, I think GSB 2 offers plenty to like.","April 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

By providing a fair few missions, each with 3 difficulties each, it seems that it may take a while to get bored of. After playing for a good 2 hours, I have already picked up what the basic concepts, you build and customise ships, deploy and give them orders, then watch the cluster**** after. After taking a look into GSP1, I can already see that there are HUGE graphical improvments, and lots more content. About the optimization, I can run the first three missions on max settings perfectly with a GTX 645  at 1920 x 1080 resolution (8Gb of RAM and an i5 4440 (OC'ed to 3.3GHz), so I can say it's quite good and may not require up to a 670. As for bugs, I haven't noticed any apart from the relatively frequent crashing, which is disapointing. I shall now hop into conclusion:\n\nPros:\n\n~ Great 3D-style graphics\n~ A LOT of customization\n~ Plenty of community support\n~ Good looking multiplayer\n~ Days of replayability\n~ Blinding effects and visuals (not literally)\n~ Good mod support\n\nCons:\n\n~ Crashing a lot\n~ Some visuals are low quality\n\nOverall, the game is AMAZING and great for someone new to the GSB series (I see were the repetitive aspect from GSB1 player). The only problems are the ones listed and should be fixable.\n\nRating = 9/10\n\nKind regards - general223\n","April 17, 2015","true","20.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

I'll probably shelve it for a few months and check back when the game gets fumigated for all the bugs.\n\nI'm also not convinced that $25 was the right price point, although I did buy it at that price. It does feel like they recycled a lot of content. The last game was DLC heavy, and I hope this doesn't end up being a cash grab. As it is, when the bugs are fixed it will be an enjoyable game.\n\nConclusion: If you're a fan, grab it. If you're new to the game, wait a month or two.

The new challenge mode - where you can fight other player's fleets - means there's an almost unlimited set of challenges you can use.\n\nI also love that I can get ships from other players. GSB2 offers an incredibly detailed set of assets for customizing how your ship looks, and frankly I'm a bit too lazy to do much cosmetic fiddling. With the shared-ship option, I can get really pretty ships for my fleet, even if I end up customizing their gear.\n\nThere are some bugs, but there's been a lot of progress in cleaning them up, and the core gameplay is pretty awesome.\n\nThe one-man team behind GSB2 has made a gorgeous, intricate game that's well worth your money.

Not everyone will though...\n-Easy to spend a lot of time in\n-Customizability\n-Ability to dim out the background WHILE A BATTLE IS GOING!!!!! One of my favorite features\n-Decent textures\n-Small size in game files\n\nCons:\n-Crashes, it crashes a lot.\n-I want to be able to zoom in more, and the textures seem to be dumbed down as the actual battle starts. Things dont look nearly as good as they did in the editor\n-The editor needs work, it needs to be able to be bigger, and some zoom  would be nice, and a little bit of fixing things snapping when they shouldnt when the grid is on, or moving away from where you put them.\n-5:4 ratio isn't supported, or the HUD really needs some fixing up\n-Did I mention Crashes?\n-Personally, I would like a little more control over the units and what they do.\n-Message box in battle is not able to be seen completely.\n\n\nThose are that then. Yes, I know this is a beta, but I have seen better alpha's, with less crashes, (Kerbal, and Space Engineers (you may disagree on the last one)) So if you are getting this game expecting a perfect experience, don't waste your money.

For a start, the game itself feels less polished than when GSB 1 was first released. It's hard to discern what's going on in battle and it's more of a cluttered mess than the first game. Also, in GSB1, each weapon had unique flavour text upon release and yet in GSB 2 many weapons share the same descriptions etc. The weapons currently in the game aren't even that varied or interesting and there aren't that many anyway, to be honest it's as if a bunch of weaponry has been reserved for future DLC releases. (I truly hope this isn't the case, it's a slap in the face for customers)\n\n2. The Crashes. Oh god, the crashes. My computer handles most games reasonably well, Fallout series (3 and Vegas) on Ultra etc. etc. yet even on low settings, GSB 2 keeps dying. I can only play the first two battlefields and even then only if I don't put too many units in. In larger scale engagements, the game will just crash mid-battle. Oh and if I lose (even on the small maps), the game freezes and I can't even use Task manager to shut it down. I have to log off from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete screen.\n\n3. Virtually no racial distinction. They feel like slight variations of the same ships. In GSB 1, choosing a race made a significant difference to the way the game was played and yet in GSB 2, all that really matters is your choice of fitting. The hull itself, and by extension the race, makes almost no difference.\n\nThe only good feature at the moment is the visual customization... and that doesn't redeem the game. In its current state, for me at least, it's completely unplayable.

That being said, I will present what I like and dislike about this game alone with no comparisons between GSB1 and GSB2, which I believe is more fair and unbiased.\n\nPros:\n+ Good and easy user interface, which is very easy to use and understand\n+ Sound quality is surprisingly well done\n+ Ship building mechanism is fun and also easy to use\n+ Space battles are graphically impressive and fun to watch\n+ Fun and challenging online community\n+ Plenty of unlockables and a nice variety of missions to play through\n\nCons:\n- The game is prone to crashing.  It is the single biggest annoyance I have with this game.\n- The AI that commands your ships can't be controlled but you can set their target priorities before the battle.  Some people seem to dislike this but I think it works well in this game.\n- I personally would enjoy more of a serious campaign that has some story, but this game does not have that.\n- Fighters seem to be a bit overpowered in my opinion, as a few carriers with several wings of fighters can overwhelm almost anything including large capital ships.\n\nThe game is quite enjoyable if you like watching your creations destroy and get destroyed in large quantities.  While I think that the twenty dollar price tag is a bit steep for most people, this game is very much worth the money if you wait for it to go on sale.  I have certainly got my money's worth out of it.  *IF the development team can fix the crashing issue,  I believe this game is well worth owning for gamers who want a relaxing space battle game.  As I said before, I haven't played the first game in this series, but having said that, this game has loads of features that I enjoy and that I believe are well done.","July 27, 2015","true","38.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The ship designer is far more powerful this time around, with the ability to color and retexture every part (Yes, you can make your ships look like actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ using textures. Please don't do that. We're all "mature" "adults" here) as well as add modules to the game. Rotating bits and bobs, lights that actually flicker and die as the battle goes on, engine glow and contrails, it's a 2D ship designer's dream come true.\n\nI can also play it in the second way, which is as a puzzle game masquerading as a spaceship strategy game. Every fight is a puzzle, and many have unique gimmicks in the form of anomalies. In one battle, the enemy may have a lot of fighters and bombers, so destroyers with tractor beams and anti-fighter lasers are key. In the next battle, tractor beams don't work because of a technobablon particle flux wave, or whatever, so you need to plan accordingly. You can make your own puzzles too, with challenges and custom battles (also a little buggy).\n\nBuy this game.

I'm really not surprised actually.\n\nCliffski, you said in your blog that you believe gsb2 is superior to gsb1 in every way. I can't discredit your opinion because maybe it is to you, but how do you account for such a poor rating in steam compared to gsb1?

If you put big ships too close together, all you get is a glitchy, flashing, white blob. There is only one type of game play: place ships on the screen, then watch an automated battle with zero interaction. The tutorial is a gigantic wall of text and does nothing to teach you how to play. The story periodically changes between non-existent and incoherent. Oh, and you need to enjoy crashing to enjoy this game.\n\nThe graphics are 2D only. The ships look like flat, bland, colored rectangles. There is no lighting effects--no, the colored lines and 3 frame explosions don't count The backgrounds are $4 on Turbo squid. The planet is stationary regardless of moving the camera, but the stars move drastically, so the stars appear to be somehow closer than the planet; it doesn't make sense.

You can design your own ships and construct massive fleets to send into battle but not much else. The title really says it all: you get to position your ships and watch them blow other ships up in glorious slow-motion or super speedy motion (or regular speed, if that's your thing).\n\nPros:\nNice visuals and sound effects. Lives up to being gratuitous. Lots of customizability as far as aesthetics go. Plenty of replayability in skirmish mode. If you're looking to spend twenty minutes blowing up an entire galaxy's infrastructure, look no further.\n\nCons:\nYou're able to design and position your fleet, but there's not much you can do once the battle begins besides watch. If you're looking for an Empire at War type game, this isn't it. Aside from that, the main drawbacks boil down to how similar all of the battles feel; get all of the ships and smash them into the enemy's face.

GSB2 would be a worthy successor — unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of battles end in a crash and a bug prevents most of the ships from even being visible, so you can't even enjoy the battle before it inevitably crashed. (It's not just me; read the other reviews!)\n\nHere are just some of the problems I've encountered:\n\n1. The game crahes constantly. It crashes during more than 75% of battles, and I can't advance more than about 80% through the campaign because of crashing.\n2. Ships randomly disappear and cannot be seen during battles.\n3. I cannot save or load fleets. Sub-fleet saves do appear to work.\n4. Ships disappear from mission selection and and are randomly deleted during editing. Since the last update they reappear when restarting. (It's okay, you'll be restarting soon! See #1.)\n6. The game does not seem to respect the options configurations. Turning off some FX means nothing is visible.\n\nVerdict: DON'T BUY! The game was released in a totally broken state, and the developer hasn't done much since to address game-ruining bugs. I doubt this game will ever be playable.","April 25, 2015","false","15.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I've noticed a few other minor ones before this, small graphics glitches, ship designs which temporarily disappeared, and such; But nothing which actually prevented me from playing.  Until this morning.\n\nI was trying to beat one of the latter scenarios using only frigates or lighter ships.  A futile mission perhaps, but that's partly the appeal of the game.  Setting a goal and then trying to beat it with the absolute minimum expenditure of resources.  This lead to me creating a huge formation of frigates, which seems to have exceeded the maximum that the game would allow.  This caused the game to crash whenever I’d try to start the scenario.\n\nI’ve been in this situation before. You submit a bug report and then maybe get a canned email response saying that the problem will be looked into, and then nothing further . You wait months and just hope that there will be a fix in the next patch.  Hell, you often just hope that there will BE a next patch.\n\nSo how long do you think it took Positech to get this resolved?  About 10 minutes. I got a personal response straight from Cliff (the one-man developer of GSB2), got a workaround to the problem and assurance that it’d be fixed in the next patch. That’s a huge indication that this is someone who really cares about their games and will work to make ‘em great.\n\nUnfortunately this experience has left me in an existential crisis and has potentially revealed a serious flaw in my psychological makeup. Years of internet immersion has honed my sarcastic wit to razor sharp perfection.  I can be a snarky ♥♥♥-hole at the drop of a hat, spewing smarm and vitriol at anybody who dares to not be perfect on the internet, all from the comfort and anonymity of my bedroom.  And I like to think I’m quite a bit better at it than most.  But now I find that I need to praise something. To be positive and supportive. My every instinct recoils at the notion.\n\nBut why should it.  I really like the game. Judging from his lineup of games, Cliff seems to have very similar tastes to my own. Games that don’t rely on twitch skills, but on planning and strategy.  Games where you can constantly tweak a bunch of individual small aspects to see how they affect the system as a whole.\n\nAnd that’s what GSB2 is. If you think that just completing each of the missions is the goal, you can achieve that fairly quickly and with little planning.  Just throw more ships at the problem and eventually you’ll win.  But the real challenge is trying to do it with as little as possible.  I usually start by making a fleet which can win the engagement fairly decisively, and then start whittling it down and tweaking stuff until I think I’ve got it down to the bare minimum. Eventually I get to where I’m sure it’s just not possible to do it with anything less.  Then I check the high scores and see that not only do I not have the best score ever, I’m about 50,000 points shy of it.  Holy ♥♥♥♥, I’ve got to rethink this whole strategy. This is how this game eats up hours of my life.  And it’s time well spent as far as I’m concerned.\n","April 20, 2015","true","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No more will we see the same Rush/Anti-rush/Static fleets of the first game.\n\nThere's also a lot more customisation, even allowing you to customise the aesthetic of the ship, in addition to the modules and hardpoints of the first game.

It's not the type of game for people who like real-time multiplayer either. It may not even have the greatest reviews, but for several months GSB 1 had tons of bugs, glitches, and crashes too. A lot of people haven't looked past that fact, fail to remember that fact, or straight up expected too much out a flashy new release promising huge starships beating each other to pieces. Sure it crahes a lot, and is unfairly measured up to GSB 1, which as it stands, features a bunch of DLC and patches, and has no faults. It took years for that to happen. You cannot expect GSB 2, with it's completely redesigned engine, to be fault free. All the patches and refinements that GSB 1 featured were wiped out, the engine's capabilities were expanded, and patches have a lot more ground to cover. Don't judge the game based on it's progress since release, it hasn't had any time yet to mature and expand. Within a year, someone (or Positech themselves) will have DLC out, and everybody will be happy again. It's not a perfect pick-up game, and it won't be until you laden it with so much DLC it looks and plays in a totally different way.

The less total cost of your space-crafts deployed to tackle the mission, the more honor points you will get in-return for you to unlock more modules, equipment and factions. Again, there is no direct control over the ships during the battle. However, you can assign certain tasks and behaviors of your ships during the deployment phase.\nThere is also an online mode of the game, which you can tackle space-craft formations created by other players.\n\nHowever, this sequel still fall short on one major problem inherited from the previous game. That is, the lack of a background story. Without a story-line to hold the game together, this game ultimately feels like a space battle simulator like the one in Ender’s Game.\n\nPresentation\n\nVisually speaking, the upgrade of graphics was not dramatic, but there are definitely more efforts put into the details of the space-crafts and the battlefield.\nLighting and shadow effects were also improved to help create a more realistic 2.5 dimensional environment than its predecessor.\n\nBeing able to build your dream ship is one thing, but the greatest enjoyment comes from the way it shines in action or…in total destruction.\nThere was also a great improvement on the user interface during the battle and players can now look at each space-craft’s status at the same time.\nAlthough some of the icons might be a bit too large which could block the view of the battlefield, this was no doubt a welcoming improvement.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, if you are interested in the previous game or being a Sci-Fi fan, there is no doubt that you will be spending hours and hours of time in this sequel.\nFor those that are new, it depends on whether you would value the limitless creation provided by this game over the lack of a background story.\n\n","April 17, 2015","true","28.0"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

This game does not let you control the ships once the battle starts, all the strategy is in creating the best fleet you can and customizing all the orders they will follow when the battle starts.\n\n-Highly Customizable ships.\nlet me start by saying, the strongest aspect of this game is how much you can customize each ship you put on the field.\n\nthere are 18 different Hull types for Humans (and also the other 3 races but i haven't unlocked them yet to confirm if they also get 18), each with advangages and Disadvantages.\n6 ship types\n-Fighter\n-Gunship\n-Frigate\n-Destroyer\n-Cruiser\n-Dreadnought\n\n\n\n-Positives\n-Very customizable\n-has a lot of Depth to the strategy\n-and i think its different.\n\n-Negatives\n-looks like a short single player of only 12 missons.  (the first two are tutorial missions)\n-Mutliplayer doesn't seem to work.  if it does work, i have no idea how it works because it isn't very  intuitive.\nEdit: i have managed to figure out mutliplayer but i am still leaving this as a negative.\n-some Ui Elements are broken and can be draged around when they shouldn't be.\n\nshould I buy this game?\nif you really enjoy games that are all about the strategy and really let you change all the different aspects of your fleet and ships this game is probably for you.\n\nif you don't know if you would like this kind of game but are interested and don't know if spending money on it is worth it.

Think of the old adage "try to build the better mouse trap" The game itself is simple, design ships, face off against an array of enemy's and win. What this game does though to is credit or determent, depending on who you ask. Is that you must make all your plans and strategies before you even warp in.\n\nNo there is no way to directly control your fleet in battle. This game is pure macro management and completely cuts out micro. This is done for fairness in facing off agings other players fleets. Which is the main part of the game once you beat the main mission chain. The fact that since the opponent can only set guidelines for their fleet before they upload it is only fair that you must do the same as well.\n\nThe challenge and what makes this game have a high replay value is that you must build your fleet on a budget. Each match has a max number of points "Honor" that you can spend and what you don't spend you earn in points at the end of the match provided you win. These points are then spent to unlock items like weapons, parts and new ship hulls including bits and bobs that you can use in the editor. You however can only earn that extra honer once and to earn more you must beat the challenge again with a smaller fleet.\n\nThe big new thing over this sequel is the ship editor. This allows you to truly make your own fleet. Form the base hull you can then add items to it to allow for a large range looks. Make your own race or try to remake your favorite SciFi franchise.\n\nAlso in this game modding is built in and fully supported. Adding new components is vary simple so long as you have the software to make the part and their is the full workshop integration that makes the steam version truly shine.\n\nAs of the writing of this review there are some stability issues that are being worked on by the team and updates are frequent. There are also a number of things about the interface and how things are done that can be improved. And personally the support from the developers is really great and fast.\n\nFor what the game offers the current price of 29.99USD may be a bit steep for most. Considering that there should be a good amount of DLC if the first game is any indication.\n\nGSB1 was one of my favorite games ever and I'm sure I will get as much out of this one. If you enjoyed the first game you really will like the new one.","April 18, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can literally spend forever designing the ships, tweaking the small details on the visual side, and planning the layouts to optimize them for your in-battle needs.\n\nI am stunned that this game is made by one guy - it is an impressive work, and I can only recommend you to spend your money on Gratuitous Space Battles 2, especially if you're into sci-fi :).","April 26, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have seen a few bugs but they are very minor and are not preventing me from enjoying the game.  The new in-game ship editor is a big deal and allows me to pick and choose from a good selection of visual components for each race, then resize, recolor and rearrange them to my heart's content.  Very simple to use.  I like the changes made to gameplay.  More ship classes and a little better balance.  The game looks gorgeous and now includes much prettier lighting and semi-3 dimensional layers so that there are shadows and you can see the ships below the ships on top just by scrolling around the screen.  The explosions and destruction are quite satisfying. I do hope the races from the original GSB reappear in GSB 2 because I would love to work with the designs and tweak them.  I found them very appealing.  This game is making me truly happy.  It is my new favorite. :-)","November 8, 2015","true","160.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The differences between each race and hull are more pronounced.\n\nI like this change, as I tended to only use one or two races in GSB1 and use the same hull for multiple roles.  The new ships come in three sizes, each with two classes and three hulls for that class.  Large ships, for example are cruisers and dreadnoughts; the former has a wider array of modules available but fewer slots, the latter has many slots but can only use heavy weeponry, so cannot defend itself against smaller ships or missiles.  The four races seem to have a bit more variety between them: hull bonuses have much larger magnitudes, making each one good for certain tasks - you no longer just pick the one with most sockets and ignore the rest.  This all adds more variety to the fleets you can field and allows your fleet to be more versatile.\n\nThere are many small changes which make GSB2 quite different to play than it's predecessor...\nIf you clump your ships together, they will arrange them selves into different layers (i.e. in 3D).  This prevents all that jostling which ruined your formations in GSB1.\nWeapons are also now resticted to arcs over which they can fire, according to their socket.  A dreadnough, for example, will have some front facing guns, some side-facing guns, and maybe one to the rear or a full 360° turret.  Cruisers will have more 360° turrets.\nThe player can customise the appearance of their ships, helping to differentiate between roles (I paint all my long range ships blue, front line ships purple, defenders green etc.).\nSmall ships (fighters and gunships) require a carrier bay in order to be deployed.  They have limited fuel and ammo and must return to said carrier to replenish these (if they survive).\nThe campaign mode is different - you deploy a fleet and take it through a series of battles, only being able to re-deploy those ships which survived the last round.  It's rather short and easy, though.  I'd like to see more of these and higher difficulty added.\nYou can now deploy two of your own fleets against each other, allowing you to test ship designs/deployments etc.\n\nThere are still some improvements to be made, however...\nThe flavour text is copy-pasted between modules of the same type, e.g. all the plasma guns have the same description.  It would be nice if they each got a description of what sets them appart from their neighbours.\nShield boosting destroyers tend make front line dreadnoughts invincible.\nFighter/Gunships are much too weak - they are deployer one-by-one from their carrier and move in an orderly queue as they fly into the wall of enemy flak.  These ships need to form a nasty swarm to be effective but they just don't carry enough fuel or ammo.\nI'd like to be able to zoom in on the visual customisation screen so I can place pieces more precisely.\nA few missions gave me loads of honour points and I gobbled up all the parts.  I then didn't feel like I had to optimise my fleet any more, I could just throw everything agains the single player missions.  I'd like to have some incentive to minimise my fleet, maybe having parts cost more honour; perhapse an expansion can add some very expensive (though not over powered) parts to buy.\nI'd still like more variation between races.  They all have 90% of the same stuff to use and will field variations on the same ships.  I'd like the races to feel wildly different, so you have to adjust your play style when playing both as and against them.\nI turned the voice-over off, it felt unncessary.  I don't need to be told I've entered ship design mode or that a ship is taking shield damage.  I can work these bits out for myself, I'm clever like that.\nI'd like to be able to tell the tutorial to bugger off.\n\nOver all, GSB2 still has what made GSB1 great.  There are some pros and cons but it feels like a worthy sequel.  However, I also feel you only get to make one "more of the same" sequel.  GSB3 had better be totally different.","October 3, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't are about the above then buy the game.","March 1","false","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(they did :P)\n\nedit: after the changes the dev team have made/ are making i am changing this review into a recommended one. It is definitely worth the money now since the patches (which were changes to research and extra levels etc.) i will be spending more time with this game in the near future, because it is really fun and strategic, the art style is awesome and i love the customization. On release day i felt there as little to no reason to edit ships, since normal mode was too easy (for me anyway being familiar with the previous game), but the recent changes give me motivation to spend more time tinkering and figuring out how deep the game really is. I look forward to the future of this game, mod support, dlc etc, have me excited to play more, my only big wish is if somehow there could be a feature to fight randomly generated fleets for more honor, but there'd need to be more stuff to unlock with honor to keep you going in the long run! thank you!","April 17, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

(time & enjoyment vs cost) Which in the end makes this a title to avoid.\n\nFootnote: The developer believes this game is superior in every aspect to the original, but since it didn't make him more money than your average $13 USD per hour worker, he doesn't want to update it anymore. I can't say I blame him, no amount of bugfixes is going to fix the real problem with this one. But seeing as the customers who tend to buy and play games make about that much per hour, I'm left wondering if I'm supporting the right person. I hope his next game returns to the quality I came to expect from his other titles.","January 27","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
