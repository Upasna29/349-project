Up your something anyway, as the 'hero' of the game goes by the name Sticky Dicky, and is described as 'having sex with anything over three pounds'.  Watch your back when you play this is all I'm saying.\n\nApocalypse is listed as having an Adults Only rating, for Violence Blood and Gore Sexual Content Nudity Strong Language Crude Humor, but since it also has local co-op, I got it so my daughter and I could play.  We did notice that when playing together, experience and money earned are separate for each player, so be sure to share!  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but you try explaining that to your daughter when you have 200 more gold than her.\n\nI've liked playing  Apocalypse so far,  It's a pretty straightforward side scrolling beat 'em up, but includes gear you can equip as well as attribute points to spend when leveling up, so a bit of customization available.  The only thing that might keep people away is the fact that the game is so crude.  It's pretty much just stereotypes and ♥♥♥♥♥ jokes slathered over an otherwise regular game.  I don't mind, but I also get that some folks don't care much for slathered ♥♥♥♥♥.  You can add your own Donald Trump joke there, I'm gonna go play Apocalypse: Party's Over.","May 30","true","2.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

If you can look past the crude humor, which honestly is not that bad if you watch crude shows.  After a while you forget about it anyways and start enjoying the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are solid (no pun intended), pretty standard beat-em-up, you have light attack, heavy attack, jump, and specials.  As you play the game and gain levels you learn different combos and specials.  You will also gain stat points that you can use to customize your character.  You go from stage to stage and pretty much beat up the enemies and fight bosses.\n\nSome gripes is how the heavy attack is tied to a mana bar, which is a bummer, I guess it is to prevent spamming attacks.  Some combos are a teeny bit strict on the timing you can pull off, not a huge deal, but when you start panicking you will notice it.\n\nOverall this is a decent game, a very fun beat-em-up.  I feel the price is good you'll get your money's worth.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.","May 30","true","2.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Though, right off the bat you can hit it with a false advert for claiming it's an AO only game but when you fire it up it's M. There is so much pen15 in this game it is crazy. Pen15 coins, pen15 weapons, pen15 chraracters, good grief. For five bucks you could certainly do way worse.","May 30","true","0.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

You also tend to use the same combos cause they do the most damage and then you have to wait till the enemy comes back on the screen.\n\nNOTE : Im currently stuck on the President boss and i cant find a single way to damage her, its almost like she cannot be killed. I cant get past this point in the game is anyone else is having the same issue?","June 1","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's basically an adult version of "Steets Of Rage"\nThe comedy is rather low brow but still amusing.\n\nMy video below covers the first few levels (edited down) and what to expect. I'd recommend this game but perhaps the humor is a bit much for some.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9vrieDUX-80","June 4","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
