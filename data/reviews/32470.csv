"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/recommended/32470/","thethoon","Thoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/","87 products in account","A decent game made great by its space battles and player mods\nPlenty of bang for your buck, with three campaigns, about a dozen turn-based conquest modes, and classic skirmish battles. However, if you're an experienced RTS fan, you might find the ground battles lacking. The unit controls are imprecise, the balance questionable, and the pop limit placed painfully low.\n\nThat said, the space battles are magnificent. Each class of ship has its place, and the pop limit gives you far more breathing room. The game just shines here.\n\nAnd when vanilla bores you, check out some of the mods on moddb. I personally recommend the Revenge of Thrawn and Republic at War projects, both of which introduce a plethora of new units familiar to longtime Star Wars fans.","October 15, 2014","true","48.5"," 268 of 277 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","268","277","8","1"

'Nuff said.\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay is fairly limited.\n-Units are fairly limited.\n-Ground Battles aren't exactly bad, but they aren't great either.\n-Multiplayer servers shut down. (You can download third party programs to get multiplayer, though I havn't tried this yet).\n-No workshop. (Mod installing isn't as easy as it could be).\n\nSo, these are my thoughts on this game.

Gold Pack also include the expansion pack Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption in one package.\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War takes place before and to the event of Episode IV, to the Battle of Yavin, while the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption follows the underworld faction Tyber Zann with the Zann Consortium.\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War gameplay is more like map conquest called galaxy conquest since this is the Star Wars galaxy, you start on a galactic map, establishes bases on planets like Coruscant, Tatooine or Naboo, build up armies and galactic fleet, then engage in space or ground battles on map in real epic battles. You get to command the Star Destroyer fleet with the Galactic Empire or squadrons of X-wing with the Rebel Alliance. This game can entertain you for many hours.\n\nWhile Star Wars: Empire at War has great gameplay, the graphics are somewhat, inadequate for me. Kind of like, ugly, but at least has some detail. The effect are not that great too, except for the Death Star. The performance are great nevertheless.\n\nThe one of many greatest thing about this game is that there are many mods out there making this game even more interesting and fun, like Republic at War or Thrawn Revenge, try them.\n\nThe downside of this game is with the expansion pack, Star Wars: Empire at War - Forces of Corruption, it still have many minor bugs that left unfixed. Although the bugs won't hinder your gameplay at all, but it is somewhat annoying.\n\nVery addicting game Star Wars: Empire at War is for strategy fans, you get to fight twice to capture a planet, a space battle and planetary battle. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","October 24, 2014","true","63.0"," 136 of 148 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","136","148","3","0"

Game is a spiritual successor to Rebellion which in turn was a time sink i played in the 90's more than i care to admit. It was a awesome space strategy set in the star wars universe and it was deeply addictive and awesome in every way because it used the SW license to the max. And this game? Same but it goes even further and UI is now much better. More units, a proper space and land combat system, ships and races you wont be seeing in the movies much but will find in the SW lore and comics.\n\nDon't be afraid of the aging graphics. you won't be watching the ship details up close in space combat anyway. Detail level on planets is pretty good. nothing to be ashamed of much when compared to modern RTS games.  Game engine is solid and fun factor is very high.  Battles are simplified and will not satisfy more hardcore RTS audiences but as stated the fun factor is high and learning curve is low. It will not take long before you are laying out complex conquest plans on the galactic map.\n\nDLC pack adds a new Zann Consortium faction to play. This faction is the only thing i don't quite like as it's so different from the base Empire and Rebellion factions. It is obvious it has been designed from the scratch to be as different as possible so how does that blend in well with the classic factions? Badly it seems. Certain units are OP when spammed and countering these OP units can be tricky which in my opinion breaks the beautifully simple paper-rock-scissors type of fighting that takes place between the two classic factions.\n\n9/10 anyway. Grab it. Game is still worth it's price even today.","June 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 103 of 109 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","103","109","5","1"

It has everything from the original films and is a bit like playing with virtual star wars toys. You get land and space combat so the best of both worlds really. Warning though as this game will soak up many hours of your time. You get some awesome moments such as launching an AT-AT attack and then using the death star to destroy a planet. There is also a larger galatic strategy to the game where you control planets and what is built on them.   It adds further depth to the game so its not just about RTS. In the land battles you sometimes get to control one of the iconic heroes / villians which is a whole lot of fun if you come up against an opponents opposite.\n\nIf you are a die hard star wars fan and love RTS then you cannot go wrong with this game. 10/10","May 3, 2014","true","8.9"," 75 of 79 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","75","79","0","8"

In order to play with your buddies you will have to download and install a program such as Evolve or Tunngle, in order to play online over LAN.\n\nStar Wars Empire at War is a strategy game.\n\nUnlike some strategies, Empire at War is very basic. With little micro management, and a small unit cap. This makes it great for those new to the genre, who are looking to get into it.\n\nThe gameplay is in real-time. Meaning it is actually fun, unlike turn-based titles. There are two types of battles: space, and land.\n\nIn space battles you have a space station, which you can upgrade. Through this station, you build new units and buy upgrades for them, unlocking more units and upgrades as you upgrade the station. You must destroy the enemy's station to win.\n\nThe land battles put you on a planet in the Star Wars universe. You have a base with multiple buildings, each one allowing you to buy different units/upgrades. As with the space station, you can upgrade your central command building to unlock more advanced technology. You must destroy the enemy's base to win.\n\nWith both battle types, you can change the win conditions. So instead of just having to destroy their base, you have to wipe them out completely, etc.\n\nThe Gold Pack comes with both the original Empire at War, and the Forces of Corruption expansion pack. Unfortunately Forces of Corruption has some balance issues, but the game is still extremely fun.\n\nThe original game allows you to play as either the Empire or the Rebellion. It has it's own campaign, which is around 5 hours or so in length. But as with most strategy games, the campaign is more of a slow tutorial to prepare you for multiplayer.\n\nForces of Corruption adds a new campaign, and also allows you to play as the Consortium. Which adds new units, upgrades, abilities, and requires you to change your strategy in certain ways.\n\nThe multiplayer still has a very active, but very small, community.

Depicting the struggle of the Rebels, the Empire, and the Zann Consortium. The game is loosely set between the events of Episode III and Episode IV in Star Wars.\n\nPlayers have three campaigns to choose from. The Rebels campaign that takes them across the galaxy to stop the Empire’s advance and stop their new super weapon. The Empires campaign works closely with Darth Vader himself as he tries to crush the remaining Rebel forces, complete the Death Star construction and prevent the leaked plans getting in front of the Rebel leaders. lastly the Zann Consortium campaign where you seek to spread your corruption across the galaxy and earn vast riches along the way. All campaigns are very well written and while linear, they offer a few side missions to add some extra life to the campaign experience.\n\nIn addition to those story driven campaigns, players can also take on the entire galaxy in the galactic conquest mode where players can play as the Rebels, the Empire or the Zann Consortium as they try to achieve particular objectives. There are a number of grand strategy elements present in these modes as you manage funds from the planets under your control and use those funds to improve your troops, research technology and more to get a leg up on the opposing forces. Also you can battle it out in shorter battles in the skirmish mode. Regardless of which you choose to get the Star Wars strategy experience from you’ll find a good mixture of vehicle, infantry and even spacecraft battles to enjoy.\n\nWith plenty of Star Wars references and characters littered throughout the game, it’s a strategy experience that will definitely resonate with Star Wars fans more than anyone else. Star Wars fan or not though the strategy experience is worth playing with real time and grand strategy fans both catered for.","April 13","true","16.4"," 51 of 51 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","51","51","0","1"

It allows you to take control of either the Empire or the Rebellion (Also a faction called the Zann Consortium in the forces of corruption). They both play uniquely, and differ majorly on tech, the rebellion stealing tech from the empire, and the Empire making their own. You fight for control, sending fleets of starships into battle over planets, before launching seperate ground forces to completely conquer the planet. The gameplay is good, easy to control units and good user interface for anyone just coming into the genre. The Forces of corruption is a good addition to the game, allowing you to corrupt planets as well as take them over, giving you access to lots of nefarious things, even allowing you to enslave certain races, using them for cheap soldiers. The game is very good, and I give it a 8/10.","November 4, 2014","true","32.8"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","0"

I have played this game alot and have enjoyed it severly! But that won't get you to buy it, will it cause everyone has their own tastes!\n\nPros-\nLong gameplay, a single galactic conquest could take a couple days with breaks in between.\nMultiplayer, since the shutdown of gamespy it's been difficult to play multiplayer but with programs like gameranger you still can and it is VERY enjoyable.\nBattles, the battles are VERY fun but can sometimes get repetidive but thanks to the still active modding community and the DLC, this problem is solved.\nThe tactics and strategy aspect, I, personally, am in LOVE with strategy and tactics and this game is full of it. A corvette cant beat a star destroyer head on but put that corvette in a ambush like position and it might stand a chance!\nStar Wars, must I really explain this part?\nThe unpaid DLC, the DLC is very enjoyable with new units and a new side. Insteading of running around with stormtroopers why not run around with stormtroopers AND giant robots!\n\nCons\nRepeat, this game can get very boring since the gameplay is limited to half a dozen land and space units on each side so it gets boring. But thanks to modding and the DLC it can be fixed.\nModding on steam, its a bit annoying when installing mods on steam because you have to download the mod and find the steam folder and install it there them mess around the launch options. The community(including myself) has been BEGGING for a workshop integration for the game but there has been no luck...\nThe campaigns,The campaigns are a bit frustrating and boring and the story is trippy.\nUnit size, the units are not realistic with its actual canon size. Boba Fett is half as large as an AT-ST, no matter how awesome you think he is.\n\n\nHowever the cons are solvable with modding and the game itself is VERY  fun! I definitly recomend this to star wars fans and RTS fans!","August 1, 2015","true","198.9"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","41","44","3","0"

Probably because I've never played C&C but anyways this is a very simple RTS but a very fun RTS too. First, there are the Space battles which are pretty fun and can be super epic. Then there's the land battles which are pretty slow and boring, there are some cool moments that can happen but you will most likely auto-resolve. There are 3 campaigns, Many Galactic Conquest modes, and Skirmish battles. Galactic Conquest is what I think is the best mode because you can conquer more planets and choose your approach. Campaign is a simple Star Wars story and teaches you how to play the game. Skirmish battles are land/space battles where you destroy the enemy base. Unfortunatly the game's multiplayer no longer works but you can play regular Empire at War (No Forces of Corruption because Steam counts it as DLC.) with Gameranger.\n\nWhat I do suggest if you get bored is that you download some mods. Some of my favorites are Republic at War, Thrawn's Revenge, and Super Star Wars: Rise of the Droid Empire.

I prefer space battles much more than ground battles, but both are good and there's several really well-made mods to the game such as Republic at War and Imperial Civil War. I bought it on sale, but it's well worth the full price.","January 17","true","23.8"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","0"

This allows for an entirely new type of gameplay as the new units have far more weapon spots and units which makes your screen light up with turbo lasers.\n\nthe expansion however can run a bit slugish if you go insane and spam battledroids as the game tanks and doesnt run too well.\n\nin general i would say if you like RTS conquest games then give this a shot, its pretty cheap now and the free expansion Republic at War allows for a near whole new game.","October 29, 2014","true","38.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Everytime I boot Empire At War up, I quiver down to the deepest fiber of my being. I am enamored with concept of commanding an armada of space nazis in a universe where the laws of physics are cartoonish and the extent of technological doctorine is more shortsighted than trying to romance your unforgiving boss's daughter at the company christmas party. Inspite of the very massive flaws in the Star Wars univers, I still love playing as a glactic hegemony whose best option for soldiers are ordinary humans in hardshell space diapers. I love swooping in and using projectile weapons that have subsonic muzzle velocities that can be hit like a baseball by a glowing laser stick. Often times I will fantacize about being a sith lord and I wonder to myself why anyone would subject themselves to the self righteous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry of the Jedi Order. Its deep thoughts like these that get me through days of choking down Mountain Dew soaked Cheetos and constant reposturing to cope with chronic back pain. Most discomfort in my life can be offset with a successfull planetary invasion in this game. The tactical and strategic interphases are incredibly intelectually stimulating and I feel great accomplishment with every victory. On a good day of playing this game I can feel my self esteem increase and sometimes I even muster up the courage to say "Hi" to cute girls I see at the local grocery store when I go to get more Mountain Dew and Doritos. Overall this game is quickly becoming a lifestyle for me. I came. I saw. I conquered. This is my new motto. Becuase of all the euphoria I experience from this game, I will give it a solid five out of five Fedoras. Now only if someone could make an Evangalion mod for this game.","June 29, 2015","true","158.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","86","19","22","30","0"

The modding community has allowed many adaptions to allow republic versus CIS and many, many more modes and maps. If anything I think the game is too short, I also think the AI needs to be harder for more intense game play. The models for the base game and even the models for mods are fantastic. The varying  units for each side are brilliant and really show the difference between factions. Even after playing the base game there are many tutorials to install new mods to allow new and exciting gameplay. When it comes to the forces of corruption aspect of the game I think it is an exelent new story for the galaxy. Being able to experience the way Zanns plans unvail and experience first hand the Wrath of the empire is incredible. Again all the game really would need is a harder AI for "Hard" or just a new difficulty level. In conclusion I would deffinetly recommend this game to star wars fans and even strategy game fans. C:\n\nAnd now to Forces of corruption, in general I quite enjoyed the campaign but it was kinda short in my opinion. On galactic conquest "Equal Footing" playing as the empire is quite hard, even on easy. I build the second death star and Darth Vaders flagship the executor. The Zann band of pirates controlled a small fleet and a handful of planets. I moved my main fleet to Kuat to build more star destroyers and support ships, Zann sent a defiler to corrupt Kuat and before I could remove the corruption they sabotaged the planet destroying all forces in space and on the ground putting the planet in nuetral. I lost the second death star and couldnot rebuild it. Now if you think about it zann consorptium is over powered, I did overcome the consorptium and held my ground but they can take out your ships and planets like theres nothing to it. Even with the over powerd consorptium I still enjoyed the challenge and still won.","August 7, 2015","true","160.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I just recently bought the steam version so I could play online with other Steam players on Forces of Corruption via GameRanger. If you can get past the slight balance problems and bugs the game has you will enjoy it a lot.\n\nPros:\n1. Very cheap $$$ wise.\n2. Regular Empire at War is almost perfectly balanced.\n3. Both EaW and FoC have a very fun fast-paced Skirmish for Land and Space.\n4. EaW and FoC's Galactic Conquest can give hours of entertainment.\n5. Forces of Corruption has a very fun Campaign.\n6. Both EaW and FoC can run on low-end PC's with lower graphic settings while having the ability to look amazing on higher graphic settings. (Graphic enhancement mods exist as well)\n7. Both EaW and FoC have countless mods, custom maps and etc that extends the gameplay.\n8. Pretty easy game to mod and a good start if you want to learn how to mod games.\n9. Very simple map editor.\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n1. Forces of Corruption isn't balanced. (Not even close)\n2. The Campaign's for Empire at War aren't the best and can get boring. (My Opinion)\n3. Multiplayer no longer works without 3rd party software such as GameRanger.\n4. Multiplayer can be very buggy and cause a lot of Synchronization Errors. (Via GameRanger)\n5. If you attempt to play Forces of Corruption online with another player with the Steam version then he must also have the Steam version. Steam players can't play with Retail Forces of Corruption players due to a version mismatch. (Does not effect regular Empire at War)\n6. The EaW AI is very dumb, the FoC AI is slightly better but still isn't that great. (AI Improvement mods do exist)\n\n\nIf you are interested in playing the game online I truly suggest you download GameRanger at www.gameranger.com Official online servers were shut down due to GameSpy shutting down.","May 5, 2015","true","67.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","3"

Commanding a legion of stormtroopers or tanks to assembling an armada of star destroyers. Dont forget to check the Moddb mod fourms. Theres always people that want to expand the perfect Star Wars strategy either by converting the game into republic at war, or to a Star Gate mod. Eitherway.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lukozer/recommended/32470/","lukozer","Lukozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lukozer/","421 products in account","As RTS games go, this title isn't going to redefine the genre in any way. But that doesn't stop it from being an enjoyable enough game, especially if you're a Star Wars nut. Personally i find the space battles to be the real highlight for me, they're just so much better than ground force battles. I also must admit to having NEVER played as the rebel alliance, i always play as the Empire... purely because their ships and vehicles look so much better! For this reason i'm not sure just how balanced the gameplay is in terms of unit strength or if the number of recruitable units varies to make up for the difference in strength... after all, sure an AT-AT is going to be pretty tough to beat, but i wouldn't fancy the rebels chances if the Empire could recruit as many AT-AT's as the rebels can recruit in soldiers!\n\nThose of you who want to play as the rebels will be at least partially pleased to hear that the AT-AT doesn't appear until VERY late in the campaign. Same applies to the vast Executioner class Star Destroyers, although those ships seem to be lacking in firepower and are little more than enormous target practice sites. The bad news for the rebels though is if the Empire manage to finish constructing the Death Star and retrieve the stolen plans, they've already as good as won. If you're playing as the Empire then consider this good news, especially as you then get to destroy 4 or 5 planets and revel in genuine global destruction.\n\nIn terms of graphics and audio, this game is fine and has stood the test of time well. In terms of gameplay it's pretty simple, bringing in little in the way of new features to the RTS genre. So if you're a fan of Star Wars and like the established RTS style of game, you're going to really enjoy this. If you're looking for something new, this will be a very shallow game indeed.","May 1, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Perfection. The pinnacle of Star wars games. This game, along with Battlefront II and KOTOR, forms a triumvirate based on success, technology, and most importantly,FUN. I won't make this beginning too long, beacuse, if you are seeing this, you have probably played prefection already. But for those who haven't played (what are you waiting for?)I'll elaborate on some aspects of the game.\nNOTE:In this anylisis I'm writing about the gold pack itself. Apart from a few exceptions,I won't make any distinction between the original EaW and FoC\n-Graphics\n7/10\nWell, yes, I have talked of perfection and all of that stuff before, but, the graphics aren't perfect. The original game graphics are poor and cheap.The battles are truly spectacular,specially the space battles.Land battles aren't that wonderful, but they are playable and fun.\n-Duration\n10/10\nI won't talk much about this aspect. The "Galactic Conquest" mode can last for days, and you can repeat it  again the next day and have brand new posibilities! This game is REALLY long.\n-FUN FACTOR\nWe finally arrived at this aspect. The previous two were just a warm up.Now is whe the real review begins.\nIt's completely awesome.Period.\nOkay.You're still reading this.Then you are interested in the game.It's clear now.\nThe game features the Galactic Empire, The Rebellion, and, in FoC, The Zann Consortium. The main Campaign drives you through the perils of each of the factions, though the Consortium is only available in FoC.\nThen there is the "Galactic Conquest" in which you control one of the factions to ultimate galactic domination, crushing, liberating or corrupting.\nAnd there is also a skirmish mode, but you guys must already know what entails.\nIn fact, the feeling of crushing Echo Base(Hoth) with your AT-At's is wonderful. There isnm't any feeling like it.\nWell, this is all, finally, I can only say that.... 12/10.\nPERFECTION.Once more,yes.[/i]\nOverall game mark: 9/10\nI told you just a bit earlier that there isn't a feeling like crushing echo base,but, there is one.\nWriting this review sitting back and relaxing with my cup of tea, listening one of my favourite Dire Staits song.If you have read this....Thanks.It's been a pleasure.\n","December 19, 2013","true","532.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

DUDE GET IT!!!!!!!!\n\ni have played this game for about 4+ years and the gameplay is just   wow to any negative reviews YOU ARE A NON STRATAGY FANBOY OR YOU HAVE A BAD PC\n\nnow to start the real review\n\nI bought this game about 5 years ago I do not know it has been so long. I fell in LOVE with this game from the start which if you are a Star Wars fan and major geek (and i am proud to call myself that) then you know some of what Lucus Arts has to offer game wise i remember i watched videos about this and i was wondering how i could get it my mom back in the past  (like i said 5 years ago) never let me buy anything that was not from gamestop but i bribed her to get it from Lucus Arts themselves and I was waiting for the game for I say a week.\n\nWhen the game arrived I was surprised at the size of it (4GB) which was farely little compared to some games I had played in the past so I slid the disk into the PC and started up Empire At War (not Forces Of Corruption) and I first got taken by the battle in the background and I was a beginner at stratagy games back then.\n\nAnyway I went on the story and it was hard but fun i remember i was playing the rebelion mission where Han Solo has to steal blueprints from Outpost That was the hardest mission of them all\n\nThe skirmish is just a slice of the heaven that is Star Wars, it makes the battles micro sized compared to anything else the space battles were ok but it was small like i said  the max unit cap is 25 but with an AI with you it makes it more fun,\n\nI remember from the start of my battle it took about 2 hours to complete one where as now i can blitz my enemy and be done in about 15 minutes if i made myself make it last i remember i was just playing a few minutes before i posted this review and i spawn camped my enemy god i love doing that,\n\nThe Galactic Conquest mode IS THE BEST where to start...  well let's see you start out with a huge force and fight for control of planets while defending yours and working to the ultamate weapon (for Empire you know what it is) while keeping your income going with mines and defending them with fleets and troops.\n\nall in all 10/10 it sucks Lucus Arts closed down i would have loved to see them make another one of these.","April 15, 2014","true","227.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The modding community has also done wonders with this game and for the Republic at War mod alone is worth buying the game.\n\nThe game is split into 2 distinct parts. The galaxy overview where you build bases, move your troops and play in a Risk like format. The second part is the the RTS side of the game where you control your troops directly. This is further split into space combat and ground combat. I'm going to give each a review and then add the sum for my total review.\n\nFirst with the ground combat it always involves protecting or destroying the buildings. The defending side get's units through deployed troops already built and gets further free troops from buildings designed to construct units. The offensive side I find often is at a disadvantage and it becomes of game of invading with totally overwhelming numbers or playing more tactically with stealth based units. This generally ends up being long winded and downright boring battles in the later parts of the game where the combat is meant to be more fast and furious to keep a game going. For the ground combat I'd give it a 2/5.\n\nSecond the space combat. This is where the game really shines and you can recreate some of the great moments from the movies. The Rebels and the Empire both play very differently and it keeps the fights fresh each time. The Imperials go for that ovewhelming numbers and get free Tie Fighters and bombers from the capitol ships. The Rebels why they need to buy Fighters and Bombers are generally more well rounded to deal with threats. Capitol ships on both sides play fairly the same with your standard Rebel Crusiers and Star Destroyers but what makes space combat so unique is that larger ships and space stations have hardpoints to target. To many Tie fighters take out the hangar. Mon Calamari Cruiser flanking around you take out its engines and leave it stranded. This adds a whole new dimension to and RTS that I've never played before and makes it a truly tactical experience. Space combat gets a 5/5.\n\nFinally the Galaxy Overview portion. It's fairly straightforward and just involves moving units, building bases on planets, sabatoging enemy bases and upgrading the tech tree. For players who don't want to play the battles can actually play and entire match from this screen and let the computer simulate the battles for you. It's different, it's cool, it's noting totally special but does offer a new take at strategy games. The Galaxy overview gets a 4/5.\n\nDon't expect much difficulty from the computer. The AI is somewhat dissapointing but fear not. One of the best parts of this game is what the modders have created for it. The Republic at War mod can take the place of the expansion and allows you to play out the Republic vs. Seperatist conflict. The AI in that is tough. I'm at the point where all I play is Republic at War and it offers the challenge that I was looking for from an AI in an RTS. AI gets a 4/5.\n\nSo when you add it up the game is a 15/20. That takes into accounts both the vanilla game and the modded game. The modded version is much better and totally free so it's absolutely worth getting. Vanilla version is more for people who want to learn the game or are big Star Wars fans. In all it's not super difficult and definately different from most RTS games on the market. I definately recommend this game!","July 1, 2014","true","98.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Now before the actual review, I would like to warn windows 8 users: MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THE RETAIL VERSION!!! You will find this game super cheap on Amazon, E-Bay, etc, but they will not run correctly on win8 systems. There is an official patch to fix this, but it doesn't always fix the whole problem. However, you will not need to patch and/or modify the game on steam to work :)\n\nNow for the review:\n\nYes EaW is old, but it can compete with most current RTS games pretty well. EaW brings cool ideas to the table like space battles, hero units, and a conquest mode in which you have to conquer the galaxy!!! While EaW wasn't the first to do some of those things, they sure did them right. Ok now time for the generic Pros and Cons section:\n\n\nPros:\nDoesn't feel repetitive\nHas a large map variety\nExplores a part of the SW timeline from an interesting new perspective\nIt's in the SW universe!!!\nSpace Battles\nBalancing is ok (Aside from the Rebels and their suprise armadas out of nowhere!)\nZann Consortium adds a fun new play style\n\n\n\nCons\nKinda pricy for an old game\nGraphics (Expected from an old game)\nBattles should be bigger (There's probably a mod for that)\nMP is dead :( (There are programs for running MP on Gamespy dependent games though, look up Evolve or Gameranger)\nRebels are really OP and can do massive suprise invasions\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you like Star Wars, RTS games, or both, then buy this game. If you are looking for stunning graphics and scripted events every minute, then this game is not for you.

Well it's a strategy title for one, which means its different from the usual hit people with glowy swords games that are the norm for this franchise. Actually... it reminds me alot of the Total War games. There's a "galaxy map" where you move your dudes and build stuff on planets, and then there's the battles where you use the dudes you built to fight the other enemy armies. And of course the final goal is to take over the galaxy.\n\nIt's actually pretty good. The space battles are fun and filled with shiny lasers. The ground battles are less so, but still decent enough. Expect to fight alot of similar battles over and over since that is the nature of these sorts of strategy games, but if you have fun, then it should be okey. There is plenty of replay value to be found, and there are mods if you feel the vanilla game isn't quite everything you want it to be.\n\nAnyway, it's basically a Star Wars Total War game.

Their space units aren't too shoddy either\n\nThe Zann consortium are a nice, interesting faction, able to corrupt planets to make invasions easier. they have the most credits of anyone, and are incredibly survivable compared to the other two factions, able to stick around through deviousness and stealth, like the rebels. They lack any particular strengths in terms of space or land, but their Droidekas and Canterous Tanks make excellent ground forces, and their Keildabe-class battlecruisers aren't too shoddy.\n\nThe Empire is glorious. Pilot the SUPER STAR DESTROYER Executor in climactic (and very one-sided) battles across the galaxy, exploding space stations and planets with the Death Star and being incredibly intimidating and awe-inspiring. The Empire, despite less population space in space, is clearly the winner in any machup, and on ground the formidable arsenal of AT-AT's, Stormtroopers, AT-AA, Sith, and repulsor tanks makes them nigh impossible to remove without heavy losses or superior tactics.\n\nEmpire at war is for anyone who has ever wanted to feel the sheer power of commanding thousands of units into space battle against thousands of other units.

I personally play this game becuase of the galatic conquest were you star off on a couple of planets, then you start to build your army up and fleet, then attack the enemy planet and capture and defend it you can also build the DEATH STAR as the Empire. The skirmish mode is great aswell, there are three factions you can choose from The Empire, Rebel Alliance and the Zann Consortium, They all have a great verity of troops in space or on the ground. The other  thing I like about this game is the AT-AT the Empire have and they can drop troops which is amazing, so for a example get 2 AT-ATs go to a capture point drop some troops off let them capture it then get your troops and the AT-ATs to storm the enemy base. The one thing I dislike is the ground battles when you capture a point and call some troops in and a ship comes down which is awesome but they your troops are very open for attack and some times which happends to me alot is if you play against hard AI, If there the Empire and they have a AT-AT and it's at your capture zone you call some tanks to deal with it, Then the ship comes down and the AT-AT destroys them which is a waist of cash. But apart from the "spawn killing" it's a wonderfull game and I highly recommend it to anybody","October 28, 2014","true","83.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its just a plain and simple game with hundreds of hours of fun and maybe more. It dosen't say I have that because I played it years ago not on steam. Of course you can either play as the evil Empire or the Rebels, I have to say I found it easier to play as the Empire compared to the Rebels, but when your the empire and you finally manage to buil the Death Star it is so amazing, its just like your in the movies but instead of watching it your controlling it :) If your a Sci-Fi fan, RTS/ strategy or a Star Wars fan I would recommed getting this game now, I would say it is worth the money because there are so many skirmishes you can play and depending on how you play the campaign can go on forever literally, I even built the biggest fleet with over 200 space craft and possibly more and my laptop was lagging due to the ammount of ships I had in the game lol.","August 3, 2015","true","92.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I played many, many hours of this game as a kid and I bought it on steam because the Forces of Corruption expansion wouldn't install properly on my computer. This game installs and plays but let me warn you, SAVE OFTEN. Do not count on the autosave. I got some PTSD from the steam version after I played some hours in the campaigns. The game has some serious game breaking bugs. You may not get them, you will be lucky to get them 1 out of every 5 times you play the campaign. But when you do, you will want to tear your hair out. The one I got in the steam version (similar stuff happened on the disc version) was when I moved a character to do a mission within the time a scripted sequence was occuring in dialogue (IIRC) and he bugged out inside the planet. I needed him for the next mission but he was stuck in the planet. What's supposed to happen is you get your character back after a small period of time but that didn't happen. The autosave happened right after that so my save file is unplayable. SAVE YOUR GAME.\n\nEdit: I decided to do a retrospective video on the game to provide more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0ZUdrCwy0M","October 3, 2014","true","8.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Harpoons in the future are the key to controling the universe apparently.\n- The NINE supply... MFW\n- Confusing and very annoying/frustrating when trying to build your units, why not be like the space battle and have everything built/unlocked at one key location? WHY BREAK YOUR OWN GAME!?\n- The ultimates are ultimately useless until you knock out the shield generators- and even then, they really don't do that much damage, and are too slow that you literally need the force to make them connect with anything viablly tactical.\n\nFinal Review/Opinion:\n\nGreat game overall, if the supply lock wasn't so low for un-modded battles, this would be an even better game, but even with the supply locked to a default the battles are intense, and every choice or reinforcement you call in is a  carefully decided choice. Should you go for the giant capital ships, slow but powerful? Or should you field a specialized fleet of fast movers capable of dodging the fire and taking out his big supply units? Micro versus Macro, fleet ships engage with decent AI, fighter squads also engage in decent AI at a ship to ship level of combat. The ground battles are giant blobs however, whoever has the better blob wins.

Planets have space stations, ground structures, and special effects based on the specific, such as planetary weather or tactical advantages such as production discounts for specific units.\nSpace battle mechanics. Frigates, Cruisers, Capital ships and Space Stations have "Hardpoints" that have different functions, like torpedo launchers, turbolaser cannons, shield generators, or engines.\nThe hardpoints are individually selectable as targets and can be destroyed in any order. As hardpoints are destroyed, the ship loses functions, for example destroying turbolaser cannons will silence them, destroying shield generators permanantly disables shields, and destroying engines reduce speed and manuverability.\nThe hardpoints also have limited firing zones. What his means, is that turrets can only engage targets in their cone of fire, so it's possible for skilled tacticians to ambush larger ships and hit them in their "Blind spots" to gain a tactical advantage.\nEach factions has it's own unique line-ups of ground forces, starships, and heros. Each one is unique, and nearly all units have special abilities to exploit. All units also have carefully designed strengths and weaknesses, and using each one correctly is the key to success.  No point-and-click tank and plane wars where the bigger army wins. A small force of well-played units will trump a large force of point-and-click steamroller armies.\n\nOf course, the game is a bit outdated. The graphics aren't up to date, and the game sacrifices intense, specific battles. It makes up by combining all 3 levels of command in a simpler way that caters to smart, creative tacticians rather than "Point-and-click steamrollers" who are used to just ordering a hundred tanks and craming them down the enemy's throat.","January 31, 2014","true","47.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Space Battles are fabulous, with great visuals and epic combat, this alongside the in depth galactic conquest gamemode with its economic system and planetary management make the game great. The ground combat however is rather hideous and clunky with units needing to seemingly stand about 1m away from eachother to even notice eachother.

Play the Empire and crush the rebellion with your lumbering fleets of Star Destroyers and the legendary planet-destroying planetoid, the Death Star. Alternatively, shatter the tyranny of the Empire as a fledgeling Rebel Alliance, utilizing fast and agile ships to run circles around your foe.\n\nUltimately, of the three gameplay modes, Space Battles are where the game design shines the most, followed closely by the campaign map, both of which overshadow, by a large degree, the lackluster ground battles. But this is not an issue. The Space Battles and Campaign map are so engrossing that you will likely get more fun and replayability out of those two modes alone, than a version of this game where more time were diverted to making better ground battles.\n\nUltimately, I highly recommend this classic gem of a game to Star Wars and strategy gaming fans alike!\n\nP.S. I have probably over 200 hours in this game on the CD version, which I had since barely a month after its release!","December 2, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Game has a lot to offer and I find it incredible that despite being made a fair while ago it still holds up today as a great game.  It's an easy game to understand, it was my first PC game and I never had trouble understanding how to play. I love being the Empire and crushing filthy rebels with my fleet of Star Destroyers, and when that doesn't work, when there's dirt you just can't quite get, there is always the Death Star to help you get those hard to reach places. The multiplayer has been down for a while now but by downloading something like Game Ranger which is what I use, you can still play online.

Bad RTS game.\n\nYou can play as either the Empire or Rebels. Both play very differently and require full attention in all the battles. The difficulties are minute in difference and the AI is garbage. The good thing from this game is Galactic Conquest mode, which feels like you are actually taking over/freeing from the enemy for complete domination.\n\nThe Gold pack includes Empire at War and the expansion 'Forces of Corruption'. Both are the same technically with the add on of a few new models/units and a new faction which brings a new experience to the game that doesn't focus on combat. The new faction lets you play as a pirate faction call the Zann Consortium. your main focus is to corrupt planets and do "side battles" which let you sort of unlock another way to corrupt a planet. Corrupting a planet doesn't give you full control but you can sabotage buildings, unlock tech, or bribe past planets.\n\nIf you like having outrageous Star Wars battles then I highly recommend getting this game. If you are looking for a well balanced RTS game, don't get it.\n\nIf you are feeling like you've done everything in the game, check out these fantastic mods.\n\nRepublic At War: http://www.moddb.com/mods/republic-at-war\n\nImperial Civil War: http://www.moddb.com/mods/thrawns-revenge","August 11, 2015","true","71.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can play against AI or players on both the surface of many different planets or in space above them or in fields of asteroids. Empire or rebels the choice is yours, both have their own campaigns. If you add the "Republic at War" mod you may play as the Confederacy of Independent Systems or as the republic. Personally that mod has breath new life into the game for me, made me buy it in a non-CD version and play it some more. To be able to swarm the clone troopers with battledroids or hammer the CIS to submission with superior quality is both fun options.

Also due to the reinforcement poins "à lá" Dawn of War II and deploy squad limit, you have to make intelligent choices on which troops you are going to deply 1st and the ones you want deployed once you have secured some territory.\n\nIt has fair graphics for a 2010 game and the sound FXs and music bring alot of atmosphere to the game.\n\nI find this game to be worthy of the money I've spent in it despite not having played that much.","May 4, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of my favorite RTS's of all time, right next to AoE. The dual plane RTS mechanic is what makes this game a great balance between combat and building your empire.

I would highly recommend the Republic at war mod for this game, as it adds the factions and planets from the Clone Wars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majormarijuana/recommended/32470/","majormarijuana","Just chillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majormarijuana/","93 products in account","Honestly, it doesn't seem like this game came out 5 years ago. This is one of my favorite RTS's of all time, right next to AoE. The dual plane RTS mechanic is what makes this game a great balance between combat and building your empire. I have yet to replay  through the story, but I recall it being really fun and quite long (If you consider the different story lines just one campaign, it is even longer). Also, being able to refine and hone in your ground combat skills in the skirmish mode is very helpful, since you don't have to initiate an extensive galactic conquest match. Since I don't want to have a wall of text, nor feel like making an in depth review, just buy this game. Here is a synopsis of why you should:\n\n+ Star Wars\n+ Really great space battles\n+ Fun ground battles\n+Great sounds and sound track\n+ A good learning curve; this game can appeal to casual gamers as well as hardend RTS players. It just depends on how much time you want to put into the game, and if you want a challenge (the CPU opponents can get pretty feisty lol)\n+ A plethora of units from the entire Star Wars galaxy\n+ The cinematic view is cool\n+ Space battles in particular are super fun to just sit back and watch. Something about them lasers...\n\nReally the only con(s) would be\n- Price. But the game gives you so much content for a fraction of the cost of a big name companies would charge. That said, I'd suggest getting it on sale if you still have reservations about buying it\n- Graphics. The game is 5 years old, what do you expect? Even so, it really isn't that bad maxed out, it actually looks quite good for its age!\n\nAll in all, great game. I have yet to find anything bad/wrong about the game. 10/10\n\nEDIT:\nI've since played throught the campaign, and its really fun. Not necessarily note worthy story telling, and there isn't much of a plot, but I still found it entertaining to play through. It isn't as long as I recalled, being that it took me ~5hrs and I was purposely taking my time.","May 30, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is really an unique experience to command those rebel forces to destroy the death star and save the galaxy, to create a path of destruction with your imperial star destroyers or to corrupt your way through the galaxy with the Zann Consortium.\n\nThe game has good graphics (for its age), lots of strategies to try and many different worlds, vehicles and military units with unique traits to discover. While it has a few flaws (the expansion bugs sometimes and the AI is way too predictable when you know how to play), they're not likely to disturb the gameplay too much.\n\nHonestly, I think this is an excellent game that is definetly worth trying.","May 9, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today, I am going to review Star Wars Empire at War: Gold Pack :). (No Spoilers) Now, this is just my opinon so don't be too frustrated. On with the review! :).  Let's start with the graphics, the graphics are pretty good for 2006 but Darth Vader is a bit two dimensional, so are the Stormtroopers, you can hardly see the eyes on the Rebels, and some of the aliens too :(. Regrading the voice acting, it is really good, you can hardly tell that it's not the same voices from the movies. The story is very well done too, if I do say so myself ;) You can choose a side, the dark side or the light side and the game starts around the time inbetween episodes 3 and 4.\n\nMy favourite part of Star Wars EAW is the Strategy!!! The Strategy is the main focus of the game, the strategy can be a little frustrating, however it can be pretty fun as well. So..... do I recommend? Well, mostly to people who like Star Wars or strategy games or both. Looks like it's the end of my frist review. I hope you enjoyed it! See you guys later, May the Force be with you ;) !!\n\nJav-Rex 9/10","August 24, 2014","true","609.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The few squads of fighters I had from the station's hangar bay helped, but only for some extra firepower. They quickly died.\nThen, a wonderful voice came over the communications system. "Reinforcements en route."\nI glanced near my space station. Sure enough, 3 Tartan Patrol cruisers came in from hyperspace and instantly fired upon the foe. The rebel fleet fought and fought, but alas, they did not succeed.\n\nI just won an impossible battle.

A winning combo in my humble opinion :P In addition to fighting real time battles over planets and in space, there is a campaign mode with a map where the player can plan which planet to attack, which production structures to build, and planetary defences. Planets have natives allied to the different sides that will help that side in any battle there (Rebellion/Empire/Zhan Consortion) and also provide unique bonuses for whoever controls them.\n\nThe bundle also comes with 3 full campaigns, the third culminating in the player controlling a Eclipse-class super star destroyer complete with it's very own anti-ship superlaser. Not to mention that the Empire can build the Death Star itself and use it to destroy enemy planets.\n\nAlso, X-wings, lightsabers, and Darth Vader.\n\nWhy don't you have this game?

Ok First things first.  Yes it's a big galaxy strategy game of Star wars, you can build fleets and armies, have land and space battles, build star destroyers etc, it's all there.\nBUT: When I'm playing it I'm thinking, for every thing the game does well, there's two things that crop up that make me think, 'rebellion did this better six years earlier'.\n1)You get limited 'command points' so that the biggest battle you get is about 5 star destroyers... if you have 20, fine, they come in one at a time as reinforcements.\n2) Ships repair automatically, so if you cripple a ship in a hit and fade mission, eg, you play as rebels, fly in blast a big star destroyer, fly out then your main fleet comes in just after, literally 1 second can transpire, which represents maybe 1/12 of a galactic day, and that ship will be completely fixed.  So anything you don't destroy is immediately repaired.  That seems like basic logic has gone WAY out the window.\n3) You can not sabotage anything, you can only steal technology as the rebels, so usig spec forces or whatever doesn't come into it all.\n4) Ground battles are  alittle repetitive, and if for eg, you take over a planet, you can't build defences on the ground level until a battle starts... WHAT THE HELL! So eg you can build BIG things like Ion cannons or shields for the planet, but little 'build pads' for local defences to help you shoot down AT-AT's or whatever can't be built until an invading army arrives... what was my army doing for the six months I held that planet, just standing there? Then they go.. 'oh right, the enemy is landing, maybe we shouldn't have been just giving each other piggy back rides this whole time...'\n\nThese might sound niggly as problems, and  they are, but they and a few more I wont mention REALLy pile up to hold the game back from being great.\nThe story is paper thin, leads up to the destruction of the 1st death star in star wars 1977.\n\nTHE EXPANSION PACK:\nIn short, it fixes about three little problems, much improved story campaign, you can now sabotage and do things like that BUT ONLY WITH THE NEW TEAM, but the issues above are still largely present.\nAnd when you play games with all 3 teams (ie NOT the campaign) You can see how balance was not an issue for the developers.\nThe new team, the pirates are SO overpowered and will absolutely cripple the rebs and imps, so play as them or get angry, that's your choices.\n\nSo overall, yes I do recommend it, you can see by my hours played that I still gave it a go, and the expansion definitely improves the game enough to give it some reply value. ( I got a MOD with some maps, so I could play the expansion on old maps WITHOUT the new pirate team, thus it wasn't so unabalanced, but could play with the new features, ships etc)\n\nFlying into battle with the Death Star II and Vader's super star destroyer with another 4/5 star destroyers is still very enjoyable. So worth a play, but beware its drawbacks.","May 14","true","73.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not lying when I say I fought (and barely won) a battle where they brought 100 over the little things.  THEY SUCK!\n- Turbo lasers and a shield generator on a planet can make it difficult to advance and the AI had a tendency to spam anti-aircraft units\n- Little variation...  meaning, Empire, Rebels and Pirates (in F.o.C) are the only ones you can play as (without mods).

Steam however has rewritten the client, so you can still play single player & multiplayer WITH OTHER STEAM USERS ONLY. EA has effectively cut off all Steam users from playing the game with other retail users, but there is a way that retail users can patch their game to play with Steam users. Technically speaking, Steam probably shouldn't even be selling Star Wars games anymore, as it's going to lead to a lawsuit with EA (not that I really give a damn about EA when it comes to Origin). They can't really go after the users for purchasing the games off of Steam however, so feel free to do as you like. Just keep in mind that you're limited to playing online with only other Steam users & retail users who have patched their game to allow them to play with Steam users.","May 9, 2013","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have friends with the same game and mods you can play against or with them on Tunngle, Game Ranger or Evolve, and also play custom maps.\n\nThis game gets a 10/10 from me simply because it made you feel like you were in the Star Wars universe, Especially when there are massive space battles going on, Lasers everywhere, TIE's and X-Wings dog fighting, Star Destroyers and Mon Calamaries blasting eachother to peices.\n\nYou will buy this game.","December 29, 2015","true","88.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

A game like this was a long time coming, as the last title to have a similar theme (“Star Wars: Rebellion”) was released back in 1998.  I won’t bother reviewing a game that is well over five years old, but I will say that it was an incredible feat and achievement.\n\n\n\nEssentially, the player will control either the Rebels or the Imperials and attempt to wipe the other out.  Galactic Conquest mode will let you play a game similar to what you may have experienced in “Star Wars: Rebellion”.  You’ll attempt to grow your empire by capturing planets, which in turn gives you more money in which to expand further and build fleets.  Unlike “Rebellion”, you’ll be in complete control of both space and land battles, though you can automate them if you wish.  Skirmish modes are available for those who just want a quick fix, though it doesn’t do Galactic Conquest justice.\n\n\n\nAn expansion was released later that year (“Forces of Corruption”) that adds a third faction.  This faction resembles a pirate faction that acts very differently during Galactic Conquest mode. I honestly wasn’t very fond of this new faction, as spreading corruption around for the sake of earning credits was tedious and repetitive.  The expansion also forced all three to be played in Galactic Conquest mode, rather than allowing you to pick and choose which factions would be present.  Luckily, Steam lets me load the core game and not the expansion when I want to eliminate this faction.\n\n\n\nOverall, still a great game after all these years.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6_mb4QmOnA\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG3Hw3gTUs0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJyq23qI74g","April 16, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A game like this was a long time coming, as the last title to have a similar theme (“Star Wars: Rebellion”) was released back in 1998.  I won’t bother reviewing a game that is well over five years old, but I will say that it was an incredible feat and achievement.\n\n\n\nEssentially, the player will control either the Rebels or the Imperials and attempt to wipe the other out.  Galactic Conquest mode will let you play a game similar to what you may have experienced in “Star Wars: Rebellion”.  You’ll attempt to grow your empire by capturing planets, which in turn gives you more money in which to expand further and build fleets.  Unlike “Rebellion”, you’ll be in complete control of both space and land battles, though you can automate them if you wish.  Skirmish modes are available for those who just want a quick fix, though it doesn’t do Galactic Conquest justice.\n\n\n\nAn expansion was released later that year (“Forces of Corruption”) that adds a third faction.  This faction resembles a pirate faction that acts very differently during Galactic Conquest mode. I honestly wasn’t very fond of this new faction, as spreading corruption around for the sake of earning credits was tedious and repetitive.  The expansion also forced all three to be played in Galactic Conquest mode, rather than allowing you to pick and choose which factions would be present.  Luckily, Steam lets me load the core game and not the expansion when I want to eliminate this faction.\n\n\n\nOverall, still a great game after all these years.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6_mb4QmOnA\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG3Hw3gTUs0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJyq23qI74g","April 16, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me tell you... Corruption!!! Why isn't there some kind of tech or what ever to help control this super annoying feature? Many fan boys have complained about this and yet nothing was ever done. Two: No one is faster than the computer so why can't the player start to move their units on the campaign map in pause or during the start of a battle? I find some times I go from battle to battle without being able to react to anything on the campaign map. Just give me 1/2 a second to move my units. Good Lord! And, this is a big one, multiplayer isn't supported anymore!!!! WTF!?!?\n\nWell, that was my two cents. Oh and don't expect updates with any of Petroglyph or LucasArts' games. Won't ever happen because they don't think they make money from fixing released games. Yet they still sell them and at full price almost ***6 YEARS*** later! humm? Shame on you!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frenchfrey/recommended/32470/","frenchfrey","Frenchfrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frenchfrey/","54 products in account","Excluding the expansion, I've always like this game, however, there are some weird qualities this game has that will leave your head scratching, but before I get to that, lets look at the positives.\nSingle player modes, there are quite a few, but you either play as the rebels or empire, for an RTS game that kinda sucks because most RTS have multiple factions, but this is star wars so whatever, each side has their own story in their respective campaign modes, they follow the story but as soon as you get farther into the campaign the less the story matters.  As far as timeline is concerned it's more along the lines of A New Hope than any other point.  Anyway, what's nice about this game is that there's space combat and ground combat, and the campaigns dive into both.  You build an army, send it to a planet, space combat if necessary, then land on the planet for a ground assault.  Simple, effective, and fun.\nThere's Galactic Conquest which follows the same type of gameplay as the main campaign but a more do at your own pace and strategy.  This is where balance imo becomes more lopsided.  After playing a few rounds with either side, I've come to this conclusion.  The Rebels ARE FAR stronger than the Empire in terms of Navy and Army.  Empire have certain units that are most definitely stronger, IE Star Destroyers and AT-AT's, but as a unit the Rebels just kick so much ♥♥♥, even the heroes are more than a match for Empire heroes.  Each side also has special abilities, Empire can build a deathstar and instant blow up planets and systems, while the Rebels can sneak attack a planet they deem weak enough to liberate under the Empire's noses.\nEvery planet is different however, some side with Rebels making it harder to win for Empire and vice versa.  Some can't have speeders on the planet, so yes, strategy abounds in this game.\n\nThen there's the skirmish mode, it's so weird.  You don't have to build any main buildings (like a barrecks), they're already prebuilt, you just upgrade your soldiers, build mines/turrets, summon soldiers, and that's it, but this is where my biggest gripe comes in.\n\nThe enemy players regardless of difficulty, WILL BUM RUSH YOU!  They will send every available soldier they have straight to your base, so if you don't build anti-infantry turrets right away, you're going to have a bad time, seriously.  What's more annoying is that even if you build turrents, they will try to run straight past them straight for a target at your base.  The ai logic is ♥♥♥♥ poor to the max.  It's also randomized so sometimes games will be harder than others, again regardless of difficulty.  All in all, the game has held up for quite a while as it came out almost 10 years ago, but the poor ai logic can sometimes just kill the game.  I give it a solid 8/10, great game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai","October 29, 2015","true","87.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You actually have to think about the maneuvers of your ships as well as their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nLand battles are some times lacking, the AI is pretty smart in this game so watch out, they will rush you.\n\nThe only thing that I dislike about the game is that some times, escpecially the Rebels (Scum that they are), the AI will research to the point they get that one good unit, and spam it to high hell. Get used to seeing mutiples of the same unit in armies towards the end game.\n\nBeen playing with Zann's boys mostly, favorite faction to date. (MANDALORIANS!)

At first I didn't fully understand why this game was received so well beside it's nice (Star Wars) atmosphere. However when I played some more and got further into the campaign I began to understand that also the gameplay was quite fun :).\n\nPositive:\n- The Star Wars part of the game is VERY well done. The models look great, the landscapes, flora, fauna and weather are nicely done, the sound effects and music are good and the Star Wars characters are also well done. If you are a Star Wars fan, that part of the game won't disappoint you. The atmosphere of the game is just really nice.\n- Apart from the Star Wars part the graphics and design is well done. The user interface looks nice and is easy to use, the graphics look good, the models are pretty detailed, the terrain is detailed, effects are also nice.\n- The gameplay is quite nice. You have a galaxy  map on which you can manage your planets. You can build structures on planets, trains/produce units if you have the necessary structures, research/steal tech, spy etc. There are units for on land and units for in space. All units can freely travel to planets in real time (though the galaxy map can be paused). Some planets are connected via some sort of travel lane which makes travelling between those planets faster which may prove benificial when controlling the planets. some planets have room for more building than others and planets may have bonuses if you control them. You can capture planets by destroying all ground buildings and units of the opponent controlling the planet. Before you can land your ground units on a planet you need to clear the space units around the planet (in a space battle) along with the space station and perhaps defences though none of these thing may be present (which makes it more easy :)).\nOn land battles you need to destroy the enemy base (if there is one, can be build on the galaxy map) and all enemy units. The map layouts are quite nice. There are hardpoints spread around the map which can be captured and then used to put turrets on. There are infantry only zones, native threats (or allies) and wheather effects. If you got bombers in orbit of the planet you can call in bombing runs.\n\nNegative:\n- Gameplay may become somewhat monotone. Though this may also just be me, because I get that more often.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you like Star Wars and RTS games that focus more on tactics then this is probably a very nice game for you. If you mostly like basebuilding RTS games then you should be somewhat more carefull. I think this is a pretty good game and would rate it somewhere around 80/100, but it just isn't for everybody.","June 19, 2015","true","33.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Battles are fun and dinamyc and the galactic conquest mode depicts the star wars universe pretty accuratly. The exapansion is also a lot of fun. It adds a playable faction with unique units and buildings and adds a few units to the republic's roster and the rebel roster. This game is set in the starwars universe in the context of the first trilogy.  If you are interested in playing the clone wars there is an overall mod called Republic at War (RaW). This mod is perhaps the greatests overall mod I have seen in a video game.  It is even closer to the star wars universe than the base game. You can play as the confederacy fielding a variety of droids and massive spaceships. Or the rebublic using battalions of clones recruited straight from kamino.

Battles are fun and dinamyc and the galactic conquest mode depicts the star wars universe pretty accuratly. The exapansion is also a lot of fun. It adds a playable faction with unique units and buildings and adds a few units to the republic's roster and the rebel roster. This game is set in the starwars universe in the context of the first trilogy.  If you are interested in playing the clone wars there is an overall mod called Republic at War (RaW). This mod is perhaps the greatests overall mod I have seen in a video game.  It is even closer to the star wars universe than the base game. You can play as the confederacy fielding a variety of droids and massive spaceships. Or the rebublic using battalions of clones recruited straight from kamino. This game is worh getting just for the expansion. I find it better than the base game anyways.","October 25, 2015","true","93.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BUT the programming of this game is bad when on galactic conquest the main aim of galactic conquest is to defeat the other fractions e.g. rebels and the playable pirate fraction but soon as you defeat one the program by passes having to defeat the other fraction and says you one the game which is really short if you’re the empire and have the death star. Also the add on may not work on newer systems so if you have windows 7 or newer then it’s a 50/50 chance it might work you just have to hold your breath. The game worked on my system which has:\n\nWindows 8.1 64bit\n16gb Ram\nIntel core i7\n1tb hard drive\nGTX 860 2GB GDDR5\n\nOverall it’s a good game and I would recommend it.\n","February 5, 2015","true","30.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

BUT the programming of this game is bad when on galactic conquest the main aim of galactic conquest is to defeat the other fractions e.g. rebels and the playable pirate fraction but soon as you defeat one the program by passes having to defeat the other fraction and says you one the game which is really short if you’re the empire and have the death star. Also the add on may not work on newer systems so if you have windows 7 or newer then it’s a 50/50 chance it might work you just have to hold your breath. The game worked on my system which has:\n\nWindows 8.1 64bit\n16gb Ram\nIntel core i7\n1tb hard drive\nGTX 860 2GB GDDR5\n\nOverall it’s a good game and I would recommend it.\n","February 5, 2015","true","30.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ashame that the multiplayer is nolonger available.

Rebellion vs Empire in the Star Wars universe that features a galactic map system (Something people might be familiar with in the old Star Wars Battlefront games). However EAW features both land and space battles in a two-step invasion system to conquer a planet. The ultimate goal is to take control over the entire galaxy, but to achieve it smaller, and much more tedious and annoying goals must be finished. The online multiplayer last time I checked no longer functions due to gamespy shutting down their multiplayer servers (RIP). But back when it was online there were a few gamemodes, none I really played. It had a fairly sizable modding community which provided custom maps, Which I am not sure you can get anymore as they were hosted on filefront. Not to say this game is boring, but just throwing out there that there are custom maps for this game you could find.\n\nStandard MapsEvery planet (Excluding one, the astroid fields.) has it's own space and ground map, which will lead to hours of gameplay alone as you battle through each of them for either faction. But be aware a lot of them have native species which will either side with you, your enemy, or themselves. There are build pads scattered across the maps in key locations and choke points where you can build turrets (AA, AT, and AI), radar scanners (Sensor Nodes), or a medical station/vehicle repair station.\n\nMisc.The graphics on thisgame show their date. The game itself is pretty old. But like I stated before, there are mods for that. Just use google and you can probably still find them.\nThis game has very few custom songs, maybe none at all from what I know. All the music I have heard in this game is recycled from the official movie's soundtracks.\nI would especially recommend this game for newer players getting into the RTS genre as it is a very forgiving game on the easier difficulties. RTS veterans would still have a bit of a problem playing on the hardest difficulty as I have found the AI player does not really have many restrictions on it, meaning it will start producing units from multiple locations at the same time and have dozens of fleets moving at the same time, leaving the player at a severe disadvantage.","April 1, 2015","true","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't know if Nostalgia is blinding my judgement or not!\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game set in the Star Wars universe. It got an expansion pack which expands the game a lot.\n\nGood things:\n-The main game has 2 campaigns, 2 factions, and a lot of planet to play with. Meaning a lot of different ways to win/lose.\n-Battles on Foot AND in space. And in the WHOLE FREAKING GALAXY.\n-Newcomer friendly. This game got me into strategy, and seeing as how I f*cking love this genre, it's a VERY good thing.\n-It's about the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you get to play as DARTH VADER.\n-The expansion packs adds a 3rd campagin, faction, and a dozen of planets.\n-With the expansion pack, you get to chose your base's layout. This may not seem like a huge thing, but it can be important depending on your playstyle.\n-You get to use THE DEATH STAR(s).\n-The 3rd Faction has Destroyer Droids. Nuff' said.\n\nBad things:\n-This game's graphics aged REALLY badly.\n-It's set in the Galactic Civil War. Meaning you don't get to play as CRISTOPHER LEE (R.I.P.).\n-Boba Fett is Empire only. Even with the 3rd Faction.\n-The Death Star may make your game crash. (That's not a good thing in case you're wondering)\n-If you don't have the Expansion Pack, Luke is Space only. And with the Expansion Pack, he's on foot only.\n-The main game has cinematics in case you lose/win. The Expansion Pack doesn't.

It's a Star Wars game where they add Ground control style combat on land, Star trek Armada Style space combat (which was a pretty good RTS, not AMAZING but it worked) with Hyperspacing mechanics that allow you to reinforce just about anywhere. Complete with a "Risk" style map ripped from Dawn of War. Sounds great right?\n\nWell it just doesn't play as well as it sounds on paper. Again it's  hard to describe but it all just feels so bland. The units aren't terribly interesting (except some heroes), the textures are plain, yet muddy, and it all feels like they took a lot of concepts that were AMAZING in previous RTS games (Ground Control's Dropzone mechanics, CNC Tanks, Company of Heroes' Squads, Dawn of War: Dark Crusade's Risk map) but didn't properly understand WHY those mechanics worked the way they did in those games and thus it ended up watering it all down.\n\nGranted if you are a fan of the Extended Universe before Disney De-canonized it you'll get a kick out of the extra units and characters (Where else will you have Kyle Kataran throw down with Mara Jade?). but all in all, to me it feels very bland and watered down.","January 3","false","1.2"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","0"

Yes, there's a pause button on the galactic map, but you can't do anything while paused like move fleets or build units. It only works on the tactical map. Also, some of the scenario maps seem glitched on tech levels. If you go to advanced settings and reduce the starting tech level while playing on hard, then you start with reduced technology but the computer starts with regular technology. Having X Wings, Y Wings, and basic frigates doesn't really match top of the line Imperial Star Destroyers.\n\nThere's also no hold position command. You can tell units to stop, but it's very easy to lure or get lured, especially when units won't respond instantly after being lured. This creates a very annoying situation where rocket infantry wreck light tanks, anti-infantry vehicles wreck light infantry, and aircraft become pointless (although aircraft dominate easily until AA weapons are around). In space, it means fighters and bombers won't withdraw from cruisers, and larger ships that are slightly misoriented beacuse they advanced two inches too far take forever to turn around.\n\nThe game really isn't that bad, but it's like they choked it for no good reason and ruined the experience. If the units were responsive, tactical map unit caps didn't exist, the galactic map was turn based instead of real time, and the pause button let you issue orders while paused, then this would be an easy thumbs up. I have no idea why they ruined their own game with arbitrary restrictions.","April 28","false","59.5"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

It's real time with a pause, which wouldn't be an issue execpt the game refuses to let you make any meaningful orders while paused. It will only be an hour or so before you started getting bombarded with battle prompts (which you can autoresolve) back-to-back, and it just becomes completely unmanagable as your attention is constantly divided. It seriously plays like a turn-based system that was retooled to realtime at the very last second, and its shows. I cannot understate how frustrating it is to deal with.\n\nAnd while the battlescape is fun to play on, it also has issues. Pathfinding for you or the AI is atrocious, and you'll often have to bear ships taking a full minute to turn around when they could have just moved forward. On top of some pretty awful unit balance, battles are always completely lopsided and predictable.\n\nDo not get this on anything but the cheapest of sales. The cool battles might draw you in, but the game turns into a slog very, very quickly.","December 24, 2015","false","5.3"," 14 of 42 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","14","42","3","0"

Both on land and space battles, there are units and certain aspects of different factions that you can exploit to garantee a win.\nIf you decide to play a conquest game, beware when fighting against the Empire. If they are able to build a death star, it can quickly decimate the areas you control. When defending against it in space, you will have a couple of minutes to try and destroy every last space craft the enemy has, before they'll be able to use the death star to instantly destory your space station or planet, forcing you to lose the battle.\nThe Consortium is just as bad. While they have most of the cool and fun to use units, all of their units are designed to ignore your units shields, auto kill any fighters you have, etc. while they have individually shielded structures, and gain bonuses to what really matters (space station wise), hard points.\nMost larger ships and space stations have things called 'hard points', such as turbo lasers, ion canons, proton torpedos, engines, and shields. Once destroyed, they can not be recovered. While the Empire and Rebels usually can increase their shield strength or firepower, the Consortium increases the armor on their space stations hardpoints. Why this is so important is because each faction has at least one or two units that can bypass shields, usually missile ships or bombers, so shields aren't entirely important to bolster. Being able to better defend your hard points is a little more effective.\nAs for on the ground, both the empire and rebellion have a unit that can fly, a special, unique kind of unit that ignores most rules of combat. Bolstering incredibly high mobility and decent firepower, they can skip the ground combat and go right for the enemies base. With a large enough force, most units wouldn't be able to shoot them down, while you quickly wittle away at their forces and structures. Seriously, they are just that powerful.\nThis doesn't mean I hate the concept of this game. Rather, I hate how little thought and care was put into the game. It had the potential to be so much better, and I would love to see someone try and remake the game.\nI strongly recommend not buying the game for more than $6.\n","January 31","false","132.2"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","29","9","31","4","6"

It is Star Wars after all. But after playing for a good 5 hours, I can tell that this is not a Star Wars game that I like. Which is very rare for me.\n\nMy experience with it so far has been pretty horrendous, mainly through seemingly cheating AI mechanics and sudden difficulty spikes. Naturally, I was playing on Easy, and I'm not great at RTS, but I sort of assumed it would be more like C&C where you would have time to build up your forces and then assualt the enemy. Its not like that at all. My experiences come from C&C Red Alert and Generals and I've also played a fair amount of Shogun Total War. My issue I feel is that the time scale of the game literally leaves you behind within 30 seconds.\n\nIn Galactic CQ, I am frequently being raided and out-gunned within the first 5 minutes of play. The AI steam rolls as it doesn't seem to be confined to the amount of actions a human could physically decide upon and take. The AI is so precise and clinical in its processes, that within the first 5 Galactic days, the Rebellion already has amased an economy 5 times greater than my own. I've been through forums and such and there seems to be no real answers about why this game is so different in play style to C&C or Shogun. But I feel its the fact that the AI moves so fast.\n\nPersonally I was looking for a more casual Star Wars C&C clone. This is not what this game is, unless you're already good at such game. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I had time to learn and not be swept off the game board almost immeditly by huge fleets which can't physically have been created with only a starting credit cap if 5K. Inexperience is also a deciding factor. The tutorials are decent, but they don't really provide you with the load of how much you have to do and organise. Also, the reinforcement mechanic which the player is forced to use, but the AI can happily spawn tanks etc against you... is just broken.\n\nAlso, don't bother playing the expansion. The 3rd faction is so OP that there is literally no point, unless you like seeing all of your "owned" worlds, completely corrupted and leeched within 30 seconds.\n\nJust glad I bought it on sale. If we consider £1 for 1 hour of play-time, I'd say the game at least achieved that.","May 4","false","5.1"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","3","18","2","4"

The first bit of the tutorial was a breeze, but as soon as the second one started, I was lost.  Drag this there.  Zoom in.  Click that.  I followed what I was told to do, but didn't have much comprehension as to why.  There was too much information given to me in that second tutorial and I was unable to absorb it in order to use that knowledge in-game.\n\nI skipped the rest of the tutorials and started a campaign (on easy) to see how much the information on the second tutorial impinged on the game.  On the second part of the campaign, I was presented with the world map - right there, I was lost.  I dragged R2-D2 onto the planet I was meant to, and did the same for a couple of troops, but when I zoomed in to that planet, it said the battle was starting so onto the ground I went.  Moved right a little while and found a laser turret, quickly followed by more troops than I had.  Didn't last long before I was wiped out.  The commentary said to call for reinforcements but I'd no idea how to do that.\n\nShould I have dragged more troops on before getting to the planet?  I understand that Empire at War can't just be more of the same that was presented in Galactic Battlegrounds, but this was too much of a departure/advancement for me.  I'd far rather be put on the planet and have to build my base before encountering the turret and troops - I could then have built more if needs be.\n\nGiven I'm fine with other similar games, I blame the tutorial.  If it was anything like the one in C&C Red Alert 3, it could impart as much new information as it needed to without the user feeling lost.\n\nI understand I'm in the minority here given 93% of users recommend this - perhaps if I sat with one of them and have them walk me though the basics, I'd have a better chance of enjoying this title, but as it is, I'm sadly deleting it in frustration.","February 4","false","0.7"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","3","18","0","1"

Before the expansion, Empire at War was a below average strategy/rts game that I went ahead and played sometimes anyway because it managed to pretty faithfully create a Star Wars feel.\n\nThen I bought Gold to get the expansion, even though I didn't enjoy the original very much.  I was thinking I would get some more "hero" characters and maybe the new faction would be nice.  The new faction is not nice.  Almost nothing that comes with the expansion is from Star Wars--most of the hero units you get are characters that I guess came from Expanded Universe or one of the animated series, or maybe created originally for the game.  Whatever they are, new hero units are terrible.  They don't fit with the original character and stand out like a fist-full of sore thumbs.\n\nWhy fill my Rebel Alliance hero roster with all these off-brand characters such as "Garm Bel Iblis" when you still haven't added a Princess Leia character?\n\nThe new faction is the worst.  The Zann Consortium--a criminal empire, is made up almost entirely of "Not from Star Wars" units such as Urai Fenn, and Tyber Zahn.  Why not make it Jabba the Hutt's faction and use all the bounty hunters from Empire Strikes Back for the Hero units?  They did include IG-88 and Bossk at least, but overall this faction doesn't feel like it came from Star Wars at all.\n\nThe Empire is full of weird characters too.  If this game has moved away from Star Wars, then why the Hell am I playing it?  Not for the gameplay, that's for sure.\n\nSpace Battles are kind of fun.  They look good, and feel like Star Wars, at least until the new, wacky Zann Consortium ships show up.  Ground Battles are terrible and have been terrible since the original game was released.  Ground battles are clunky, simplistic, poorly balanced, and just plain not fun.  And now that there is a bunch of Not From Star Wars units running around, I'm just playing a poorly designed, generic sci-fi rts on the ground.\n\nSo lame.\n\nThe Strategic Game/Empire Management?  Not very good.  Kind of boring--you play it because its Star Wars and it vaguely feels like you are commanding the Empire/Rebellion.  Again, the more the game moves away from actual Star Wars units and feel, the more Im asing myself why I am playing a clunky, poorly designed RTS game.\n\nThe answer is, I'm not.  I'm done with this crappy game and I do not recommend that you buy it.","January 28","false","33.0"," 9 of 32 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","9","32","0","3"

The issues is noticed during the main campaign of the FoC; where, if a player corrupts a planet that one of the main characters is suppose to do a campaign mission on, then there is a chance that the character will become stuck on that planet, invisible.  The player will have no way to interact with the character or start the mission.  How you will notice, is that the character will suddenly vanish off of the map after completing the corruption mission.  No matter where you look, it won't be visible.  If you click on it's icon in the upper corner, it will direct you to the planet where the character was suppose to do the mission.  The reason is, because that character is stuck on the planet; just invisible.  This breaks the game.  The only thing you can do is return to an older save and avoid using corruption when you last did it.\n\nThe fact that such an aggrivating bug exists in a released product, is enough to earn it a poor rating.\n\nEdit: I deleted some comments due to fallacies.  Just because you never experience a problem with a product; doesn't mean no problems exist.  You can go to the Star Wars wikipage for FoC and see the campaign bug mentioned on the page.  Granted it says that it was patched; but, obviously it wasn't done so effectively if it still persists for players.  There is literally a recent steam community discussion you can look up, where someone is describing the exact issue and multiple other members are trying to help them trouble shoot the issue.  The final concensus was: you guessed it, restart the campaign.","March 6, 2015","false","40.0"," 24 of 77 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","24","77","4","1"

It crashed pretty frequently-- usually during cut scenes.\n\nIt still crashes during cut scenes, which is basically all the time. And it's the type of crash that freezes the system, forcing a restart.\n\n----------------------\n\nDid some recommended updates and reinstalled the game. Runs pretty well now and it doesn't crash nearly as often (but it still does).\n\nThe original is pretty fun. Really interesting game, scratches the "star wars galactic conquest" notion but there's some weird mechanics.\n\nHero units are ridiculously overpowered. Remember when Chewbacca and Han Solo killed a swarm of stormtroopers and ATSTs? Me neither.\n\nDuring battles the defending base generates a free unit, and will regenerate the unit whenever it dies- giving the defender a suicide trooper to constantly use. You'll see this in the first battle-- xwings constantly flying to their deaths. Random troops constantly charging your ATST. The attacker brought 100 stormtroopers? Well, you're going to get a free unit every 10 seconds so send that SOB in. If the attacker doesn't rush you basically win. But then this gets ridiculous when you have a higher-end factory and you get a free tank squad constantly.\n\nAnd then the expansion breaks the game. Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge was a great game. Yuri was pretty imbalanced but still beatable. In this, the "whatever they are/pirates" basically can cast spells to literally "take over entire system"-- and you're constantly "uh... why'd I just lose that system?"\n\nAnd then they're on a different research tree. The Rebels and Empire research new/upgraded units and build those. The "pirates" research upgrades and then the units receive those benefits. Suddenly the 10 fighter swarms that die in seconds have shields and bombs and are decimating your forces. And the pirates are still dumping those level-1 units out for the same price.\n\nStick with the original.

Anyways, it's an old game, and I HATE to say it, but it has not aged well. At all. In fact, if I ever play it again, it will be entirely for nostalgia's sake, unfortunately. The problem is the balance, especially in land battles.\n\nThe way everything is set up just feels weird. It feels like vehicles can die too easily, the Empire infantry weirdly stack up into box formations that just doesn't really fit with the Star Wars atmosphere, and the rocket artillery on the Rebel's side is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY overpowered, to the point where they can almost take out your entire military force at the beginning of a match (yet when you use them, they don't feel nearly as powerful). It's just kind of a weird game, and yes, the space battles are cool, but they have also aged to the point where unfortunately, it's just not worth it anymore. The meta game  (galactic conquest or whatever it's called) is also weird. A lot of time there are strangely fast time limits to win the game, which annoys me because it gives little time to really develop a nice army and tech that can really do damage. And since it's all in real time, it sometimes devolves into a game of tag, where each side has their core planets, and then all the outlying planets are taken by one side, then taken by another, and so on and so forth, and this is due to the unit cap, which restricts you from truly building a large enough force to take over the empire. There's so many connections to all of the planets that it's not easy to actually form a stronghold, and while there is strategy in that, the game isn't quite good enough to compell you to want to develop the skills to master that strategy. I don't think I ever finished a single galactic conquest map. I ended up just reverting to multiplayer (which I can only assume is dead now).\n\nIf you played the game before, and just want nostalgia to kick in, maybe pick it up on a sale, but if you've never played it before, I'd say move on to better RTS games.","June 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 26 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","2","26","0","1"

I like the idea with the galactic conquest where you have to attack the planet from space, then attack by land. The whole Galactic Conquest is really all it has going for it though, since multiplayer is soon to be shut down, and land battles suck so much. Space battles are good though. However, because the land battles suck so much, it even ruins the Galactic Conquest. That is the entire reason I really dont like this game. The land battles just completely destroy the experience for me. I dont understand the whole, click a button, and units go into automatic cover and are completely invinsible. I also dont understand the whole thing with 1 infantry can kick a tanks ♥♥♥. For a person who has never played an RTS before, I'd say go for it, you'll get used to the whole combat system better than I did. If you are and RTS fan, then no, this game, in my honest opinion, sucks because the land battles just really, really make the game awful. If your just gonna buy it for the space battles, than go for it, but in that case get it on May 4th, but it is not worth the $20 price tag it has now. It had really good potential, but the land battles just totally destroyed the experience for me.

It feels like someone came up with this idea by saying:\n"Hey, let's make a Star Wars RTS!"\n"That sounds like a great idea, what should we make it about?"\n"I don't know, lets wing it!"\n\nI'm not going to harp on how none of this makes sense lore-wise, because the fun and value is in the gameplay.

The problem is that since the gamespy servers are down, you can no longer play multiplayer, which was the funnest part of the game, which is why I do not suggest buying this game.","February 4, 2015","false","289.2"," 11 of 49 people (22%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","22","11","49","5","0"

It looks and feels a lot like those games but it lacks the ballance opposition, clarity of objectives and ease of interaction that those games did so well.\n\nThis game has the longest most-annoying tutorial i have ever seen in a game and STILL teaches you prectically nothing about how your units might be different in some way... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nBy the time you finish the tutorial, you won't want to play it anymore.  Watch the idiotic AI stand there and get killed by the enemy while chase them all ofver the map when they run away! I like being able to micro manage my Army; i don't like being required to micro manage every move of every troop just to prevent them from doing the stupidest thing possible. I'm an expert RTS gamer, but this game is nothing but hot mess of confusion. How anyone can play it at all is beyond me.","May 5, 2015","false","5.6"," 4 of 32 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","4","32","3","2"

Major flaws plague every aspect of the game. The developer made the poor decision to make the strategy map run in real-time rather than in a turn-based fashion, resulting in the need for constant pauses and frantic clicking; land battles are campy and boring; and space battles leave no room for tactics, as the bigger fleet nearly always wins by default.\n\nThis game was created with an obvious degree of laziness, and the result is a frustrating experience. One can only assume that this arose from complacency on the part of the developer; perhaps it was believed that the Star Wars factor would compensate for the game's obvious shortcomings. If so, the developer was very incorrect.\n\nDon't buy this game.","February 16, 2013","false","4.6"," 9 of 51 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","9","51","0","6"

It's gameplay is fast enough to not get boring quickly but it still maintains the challenge and pace of a true startegy game. If you have a beefy system, I'd recommend modding the game to allow for (virtually) unlimited population caps, especially in space battles. Nothing more fun than playing with friends and having a massive battles spanning across the entire map.\n\nDon't worry if your system isn't powerful either, my laptop (AMD E1 @ 1.35GHz) can handle pretty large battles with not a huge loss in framerate. Plus it runs it with max details and AA too so I can't complain too much.\n\nAs I'm only a user of LAN multiplayer, I cannot comment on the Online support but I believe that programs such as gameranger may help get you playing over the internet.\n\nAll in all.

If you think of it as a Star Wars RTS, then it's friggin' amazing. It's a lot of fun, especially for a hardcore Star Wars fan, but don't expect the depth or balance of a top-notch RTS.\n\nThe only major flaw I see (and it is a massive one) is the new faction introduced in the expansion: the Zann Consortium. Basically the mafia of the Star Wars galaxy, they have all kinds of ridiculously overpowered troops, ships, heroes, and abilities. They completely break the balance of the game, to the point where literally everyone I faced online would refuse to play against the Consortium.","December 3, 2014","true","52.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds installments, it seemed pretty hard to be able to follow up another decent strategy without making it too modernised and missing out key elements that make true strategy games, especially a Star Wars one also.\n\nBut I can truly say they pulled it off with this game. This game is a crystal to the RTS genre and provides players with the ability to be able to Strategically take over the Galaxy, as three different factions fight for power - you have to use all assets at your disposal to assert your faction above others. This power can be asserted by RTS space battles, in which huge fleets massacre eachother, or in RTS ground battles, where every unit has a weakness and strength, meaning that combat must be played strategically.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone looking in the RTS genre, as even for the 20+ hours i've played it, it is a gem to the RTS genre.","September 1, 2014","true","78.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
