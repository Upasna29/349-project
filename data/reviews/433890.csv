It gets you to really think outside of the box to get through levels, building unique machines appropriate to the obstacles faced in each level. The graphical beauty of the game alone is amazing, the simplcity of the UI and the controls are perfect. The game just sucks you into it's world, an addictive, fun solid game that will provide you with a good amount of play time. Definitley reccomend!","May 18","true","2.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I helped test this game and honestly I'm not a puzzle game guy but the building aspect in the puzzle context works... MechoEcho is a nice break from the wildly free form crafting sandboxes zombie horde survivals I'm use to. Here you're faced with a task: get from point A to point B. And do that using a limited set of blocks and your imagination. At first the game is a tutorial explaining basics but before you know it, you're playing levels that force you to question if it can be solved at all with the limited pieces and this turns into a fun challenge.\nThis is where the game gets it right, it will challenge you to think outside of the box. Usually after a break from the game a new idea will pop in your head to go back and try. Even after you solve a level you'll likely find yourself going back to solve the level again with a new configuation and this aspect of replay surprised me, as I'm use to rushing through games and moving on.\n\nIf you like puzzles and building things, MechoEcho is for you.","May 19","true","10.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It feels a bit Tron-like except that everything has an attractive softness about it too. Echo is alive with a fluid particle effect which is memorizing. The build mode is refreshingly easy to use and the controls are fluent and intuitive. My one criticism in this title is that it seems that the "campaign" might be a bit short at only 30 missions. There is however a Sandbox mode which does allow you to build anything you like. At the time of making this video I have only played as much as long the video length, so approximately 30 minutes.\n\nThe developer has provided me with a review copy of this game, but that never influences my opinion of any title. I ONLY feature games I enjoy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xDB0zYijva8","May 18","true","0.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The method of construction is intuitive, and the available building blocks are easy to understand and utilize.\n\nAt the time of review, the game contains 30 campaign levels, a handful of which are tutorialised. This would be my main criticism of the game, in that it took just 6 hours to complete. There is the option to replay levels to come up with different solutions, and a sandbox level is also available, but I do wish the game had more content.\n\nThe content that's there though is enjoyable, and I certainly don't regret buying the game. I just want MORE of it! :)","May 21","true","8.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have nothing but positive reviews for this game. It is a challenging and interesting game. Each level involves new tricks and skills to beat.

The game itself is functioning good, with a bit of lack of comfort actions like being able to move multiple blocks without hacking them off first. The UI could use some work, but the physics themself work fine I think. Graphics and framerate were good, too. The story behind the campaign is good enough to keep you engaged with the puzzles, but you could also completely ignore it if you just wanted to play the puzzles.\n\nWhat pushed me over the edge towards a negative review was the lack of content. The developer claims that you will need 10 hours for the campaign. This is not true. I beat the campaing in about 3.7 hours, which is too little playtime for the money asked. And I suppose there will be others that are faster. Most solutions are obvious at first glance and the few ones that aren´t are spoilered by either the trailers or the game itself.\n\nI haven´t tried the sandbox yet, but I didn´t buy this game for the sandbox. If I just wanted to create amazing constructions I would rather recommend Besiege, which is cheaper and has more options. I was waiting for this because it promised a good campaign with hard nuts to crack. Which it doesn´t. It also doesn´t contain an editor for levels or a workshop for players to share.\n\nI will change this review to a positive one if either the game becomes cheaper, more levels get released or an editor for more levels gets added.\n\nIf you are however new to games like this you will probably have a harder time and thus get more playtime out of it, so you can probably check it out. Could also be good if you want a valuable game for your child to learn and train spatial imagination.\n","May 20","false","3.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

I really did enjoy testing this game out, it has good level design, controls well, and looks amazing but there's two major problems for this game right now.\n\nThe first is that the price is way too high for the level of content you will get. Either this price needs to be lowered, or more content needs to be added because truthfully you could buy a game with way more content for a cheaper price.\n\nThe second major problem is I actually can't run the game. The game launches fine but no matter what I try to do the game has the worst framerate I've ever seen, and I'm sure it's not my PC considering I have no problems with other games. Hopefully whatever the problem is will be fixed soon, but for now it's utterly unplayable.\n\nI do think MechoEcho is a good game and could be very fun but until these two major problems are fixed I cannot leave a positive review for this game.","May 25","false","0.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"
