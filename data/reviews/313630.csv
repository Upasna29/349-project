Both are equally terrifying.”\n―Arthur C. Clarke\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687073782\nThe Solus Project is among the most engrossing games I've played. The creators have clearly put a lot of time and thought into creating this world and its story. While still in Early Access, it is important to note that the current content and gameplay is complete and polished. Regular updates add more content and areas to explore. And exploration is where this game shines.\n\nStranded on an alien planet, with an unstable, volatile weather system, you must survive to make contact with a humanity that has lost it's home and desperately needs a new one. As you search the open-world for parts to build a communications tower and survival goods, as well as try to survive the richly atmospheric weather, you begin to reveal a deep story behind the planet's inhabitants. The mounting level of intrigue, even horror at times, is expertly written and delivered. Anyone at all interested in aliens/ancient aliens lore will be immediately swept into the story and begin to formulate theories of their own.\n\n“The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. There also we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak; and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight." -Numbers 13:32-33\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688004825\nThe story seems to hint at ideas most popularly written by the likes of Zechariah Sitchin and Erich von Däniken, concerning such things as Nibiru (the theoretical tenth planet in a much wider elipse of the sun), Sumerian myths concerning the Annunaki, and the much interpreted biblical passages concerning the Nephilim, more widely written about in the apocryphal Books of Enoch.\n\n"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God (bene Elohim) came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them."  Genesis 6:4\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687074677\nAt its heart, The Solus Project is an exploration game. The game world is beautifully rendered with UE4 and highly optimized for any machine. While it is tagged as a survival game, it doesn't have some of the common elements of EA open-world survival games such as crafting menus and base-building. This absence does not detract from immersion in any way. The story touches on themes that no other game has ever touched, remarkably so, because it is a rich treasure trove of fascination, mystery and intrigue, and yes, as Arthur C. Clarke so famously said; absolute terror.","May 20","true","26.9"," 74 of 76 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","74","76","2","10"

Earth has been destroyed, and all that remains of it is on a nomadic fleet of ships searching for a place to rebuild their civilization. In The Solus Project, you take on the role of a surveying team charting an Earthlike planet that may just prove suitable for humanity’s resettlement. Disaster strikes suddenly and you find yourself marooned on the surface of Gliese. Armed with only the most basic knowledge of the dangers the planet holds, you must set out to solve the mystery of the destruction of your ship, and contact your fleet for rescue.\n\nYou were sent to save the mankind.\nWho will save  you  now?\n\nGameplay\nSolus Project is a single player, first person survival game. Solus Project takes place in an alien alike prehistoric, colourful sci-fi setting. As stated about the sci-fi setting and all, The Solus Project could easily be mistaken for another sci-fi themed survival game. As soon as you start, you're greeted by your PDA which gives you basic information to get you going in the unknown, as well as some tips about survival.\n\nIt might have the same mechanics as all survival games such as finding food and water, be careful with your character's temperature and get enough sleep. One of the differences here, and quite a big one, is the need to create buildings. The shelter itself is not permanent. You're a nomad. Why?\n\nBecause the objective of this game, is to explore, explore and explore! But not generated lands! It's one, big planet full of rich alien foliage, mountains of impressive sizes giving quite a challenge for the player to reach their top. Upon doing so, the view is fantastic especially with the weather the developers have implemented that gives the game even more charm, I simply love the meteor showers with an undescribable feeling. Though the player must be careful as the temperature as well changes and gives more discomfort, giving more difficulty.\n\nThe lack of mini-map gives as well an interesting feeling, since like in the old days, you're let with the single option, that one option being to draw your own maps with the explored areas.\n\nFor the achievers, there is a multitude of secrets and hidden areas ready to be plundered, with quite a reward. More lore. Yet.. it's pretty short without exploring and fiddling around with every bit, you can complete it fast, in an hour or so. Don't fret! Part two is here so the hours have been extended. Have fun exploring, for the mankind!\n\nGraphics\nAs stated above, the whole relief of this planet is not only the reward itself for exploring, but something mandatory as soon as you're in-game. It's quite stunning to see such a beautiful unknown, which makes you want more and more. The Unreal Engine 4 really pays off on this one, especially maxed all out, to let your eyes feast on every little detail. The color palette used for this game surprises me as well, a mix of orange and gray, with lots of blue, metal there and there which are the ambient's mains and it's delicious. Those are the mains, while the secondaries are the ones used for the foliage, items and so on. Talking about relief\n\nOST & SFX\nThis game’s sound design is just superb. The soundtrack is incredibly atmospheric and memorable. The sound effects are incredibly satisfying. The music just adds so much energy and life to the world, as any good soundtrack should. It’s a great listen to while exploring caves and strange structures. Such a great one that I just stared at the scenery and let the time flow with the tune playing.\n\nShould you buy it?\nOverall, Solus Project is out of this world(pun intended)! In my honest opinion, it is a nice experience and take on the survival genre, which is focused more on exploration. If you'd like to experience something new with the same mechanisms, this is your cup of tea, worth the whole sip. Full price recommended.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","March 23","true","0.5"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","39","45","3","2"

What can go wrong....Well about everything in fact, as the planet is basically out to get you- and it will if you are not careful.\n\nWays to die thus far:\nDie to starvation- yep\nDIe to hypothermia- oh yea\nDie to drowning yes\nDie to MASSIVE hurricane- WTF is... ARGHH\nDie to meteor shower- oh look shineh,., OMFG- RUUUNN!\nDie to Lightning storm, while pretending to be Thor.. yes.. yes i did this..\nDie to falling off a cliff, into acid and off various other ledges.. yes- YOLO!\nDie to the "smoke beasty".. ohh whassat?..

I have not found any major bugs, only 1 and that was due to my own stupidity by jumping into a tight space and being unable to escape.. i did this a few time to test it..\nI am at the end of act/ phase 3 and i am eagerly awaiting the ice caved(of death)...\nSaving the game can be harsh- literally if you are caught out in the open and it turns nasty(see above) as you can not save unless at a sleep point(usually a safe place) or a save point. Other than that, and you will have to keep an eye on the elements when out walking, climbing and swimming... Eyes on the skies people!\n\nIf you like wandering about(there is a LOT of this) hunting for items, secrets(found a few of them) as well as key components for crafting stuff, and other "keys" to open doors / solve puzzles this will be right up your street.\nI took a punt on it, and .. i`ve become pretty well hooked!\n\nI have had a great time playing and dying to this game, as survival games are not really my thing, but this game is great fun,and makes you think as you get very little instructions on what to do and where to find stuff...\n\nSo what are you waiting for- get it while it is cheap","April 18","true","20.7"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","30","33","14","0"

Especially impressive coming from such a small dev team.  The level designer (Sjoerd de Jong ) is a genius with UE4 unreal engine.  Just watch some of his tutorials on constructing the world of Gliese, very clever.\n\nThe game focus is on exploring the island and the secrets it holds.  Yes, there’s some crafting and health management, but it’s not too intrusive (unless on higher difficulties) You can freely wander around, or follow the storyline, it’s up to you how you play the game.

Having played for almost 3 hours, I realise my concerns were unfounded and here is why:\n\nSimulation\n\nYou start the game marooned on an alien world but it has traces that an Egyptian type civilisation once inhabited this world. Hieroglyphics depicting gods being praised by their worshippers adorn the walls of the the subterranean underworld. Water drips down the stalagmites, its drops signifying health reguvenation is close at hand. Alien plant species strike from the shadows, breaking your visor and splattering it with blood. You will need a medkit or sleep to heal your wounds from this beautiful yet deadly ecosystem.\n\nVisuals\n\nThe game is near photorealistic in its depiction of life on this hostile planet. The sea glistens and undulates to the rhythem of the tide, a day and night cycle creates unimanginably gorgeous panoramic scenes, cave interiors beckon to be explored with their incredible colour palettes and glistening stones. Asteroid strikes light up the sky with trails of fire and smoke, striking nearby scarring the landscape with their tremendous force. Of all the games in my librabry, this is by far the most visually stunning game I own (80+ games with a GTX 980)\n\nSome screenshots:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627672742\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627698265\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627700934\n\nAdventure\n\nWhilst this is no sandbox, the parametres to explore are wide and there is a deep sense of accomplishment when you discover a humanoid clutching a sword which can be used for a multitude of purposes. Kindling can be lit to ensure you keep warm after suffering from hypothermia, or shade can be used to reduce the impact of heat stroke. An advanced monitoring device held in your characters left hand indicates all your vital signs and even reminds you that you need to sleep!\n\nPerformance\n\nThis game does not perform like an EA game. There is no stuttering, no erratic fps drops, no sudden crash. It runs silky smooth even during natural events such as  earthquakes, tornadoes etc. On my GTX 980 laptop I'm getting 50fps at 3k resolution.\n\nValue\n\nFor just under £10 this game is an absolute steal! The production values are extremely high for such a modestly priced game. Bear in mind, during EA content is being released episodically until May (the release date).\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you love the following themes buy this game: Atmospheric, survival, Simulation, Aliens, Galactic, Crafting, Exploration, Beautiful and Classic\n\nEdit: Just completed the first part in 3.5 hours. It would have taken me 5-6 hours had I explored more rather than stick to the objective.

You should probably be avoiding this review, but here we are.\n\nI'll put the review into individual sections covering the games mechanics,\ndue to the Early access nature and the already large amount of content already in the game,\nthis review will be regularly updated as i explore the current features and any i have come across.\n\nThe game features a robust weather system, with tides changes and water levels rising/lowering, snow falls and rainstorm occur which affects the temperature of the character, requiring you to find shelter and/or a source of heat.\n\nStory\n\nI refuse to go into much detail for now (for your enjoyment) but will update in the future.\n\nGraphics\n\nUtilizing the latest Unreal Engine 4 the game really benefits from having advanced graphics, I find I get a steady FPS on all setting at their highest,\nYou can tweak additional settings in the configs files but i have'nt delved into them just yet (will update when i try them out).\n\nTextures are high quality, lighting effects and the general details in the levels are fantastic, spider webs hanging in caverns, colored lighting\nfrom crystals (some form of torches).\n\nI didn't like the fire effect on the default torch and you can't see the protagonists hands when holding most items but it is early access.\n\nSound\n\nThe atmosphere in the environments really benefit from the high quality sound effects, from eerie sounds in caverns to the flames from a damaged ship engine.\n\nI was genuinely freaked out when I was exploring a dark cave and I could hear these strange noises echoing from deep within. Voice acting isn't fantastic but\nits pretty good, atleast to me.\n\nGeneral\n\nOverall I'm currently enjoying The Solus Project and its a huge step forward for the company since Unmechanical and a gigantic leap since "The Ball",\nI enjoyed The Ball but it hasn't aged well. The player can explore a ton of islands and solve puzzles. It's like Tomb Raider but an FPS on an alien planet\nin the future...with aliens..., Well it has Tombs in it.\n\nThe tombs/caverns are extremely creepy as mentioned a few times during this review. I haven't come across any creatures yet (if any exist).\nI wouldn't recommend this to people that want a Call Of Duty shoot em up or want to murder everything that moves.\n\nI really like the variety in difficulty, from hardcore survival to an Easy mode for those of use that enjoy the game for story and exploration rather than\nthe realistic survival aspect of hardcore mode.\n\nI've barely dented the surface of this great game and will update this review regularly as I play through more content and the game gets nearer to release.\nThe developer is often updating and releasing new updates, Episode 2 was just released with tons of new content.\n\nSummary\n\n+ Fantastic Graphics\n+ Unique Environments\n+ Story\n+ Difficulty Settings\n+ Open Environments\n+ High quality sound\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Will Support VR + Eye tracking\n+ Frequently updated\n+ Weather Effects\n\nNeutral\n\n+/- No character customization (doesn't necessarily need it)\n+/- Can't see players hands (personal preference, could be down to supporting VR mode)\n\nNegative\n\n- Inventory management could be better\n\n9/10","March 13","true","3.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Its more like story driven walking simulator with survival elements than purely survival game like "The Forest". You still need to watch for your food, water, temperature, humidity an sleep indicator. But it is not so complicated and annoying like in some other games.\nWorld have interesting terrain shapes, formations and caves. I like how game looks and what climate have.

While most will bore me with the repetetive gameplay, "The Solus Project" has kept me interested by keeping the survival elements as a side feature and focusing more on the exploration and story. And man is the story interesting. I haven't even gotten that far in, but I'm intrigued. Why did my ship get shot down? Who built all this stuff? Will I ever be found? These are all question I want answered. Mostly though, my very very recent experience with a weather anomaly is amazing. I woke up to a tornado spiraling out of control, I walked out of my house (cave) and was in awe of the tornado, it got closer to me, I ran into a wall trying to escape and then took shelter in my tiny cave, the music is amazing, the voice acting could use some work though.\n\nEDIT: As I progress through the story I can't help but be even more intrigued. There was a civilization here. The best part was finding The eggs and skeletons, and learning about the Sky gods. The graphic are great, the gameplay is amazing. This game is probably one of my top 5 favourite games.","February 24","true","13.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The story is interesting, the environment is huge, beautiful, but dangerous sometimes, so it's hard to survive when you encounter traps, tornados, meteor showers and smoke monsters 'from Lost', not to mention those freakin' moving dolls.

Your job is to scout planets to determine if one of them is suitable for human habitation. Well, as you approach one of them, your ship is hit by something coming from below and you just manage to reach the escape pod in time. As you fall rather quickly towards it, you keep wondering what you are going to find out upon impact!\n\nThe Solus Project is a First Person/Survival/Exploring game with absolutely stunning visuals. At the start of the game, you will see a couple of splendid introduction videos from the destruction of earth to your crash landing. Then, you will step onto this glorious scenery of the planet Gliese-6143-C.\n\nAll is beautiful but you really have nothing on you and your first task is to scavenge for useful items around the crash site. The first one you find is a survival device; a PDA which will tell you when to eat, drink, sleep, the outside temperature, can decrypt alien writing and other useful options.  You will be lead to specific destinations and will be shown where you can find food, water and how to craft items too. The game atmosphere is just brilliant - either you are on the surface of the planet or deep in the caves. The weather element is well done, too. You might experience a meteor shower, lighting and other extreme weather on the planet surface. Try to gather food (cans of food or plants) before entering the cavern just to be on the safe side. Oh, and be careful not to get wet too often especially in a cold environment like caverns. This is a great recipe for hypothermia!\n\nThe game does have a puzzle element to it, but to be honest they are not very difficult (as far as I have progressed) but make sure to read all the notes as well as the Alien symbols which can provide you with great intel; your PDA is very handy for that.\n\nYou will only be able to store up to 12 items in your inventory at the Start of the game, which is a bit of a bugger. I like to gather as many items as I can and you never know when you might need them.\n\nGraphically this game is stunning. Mouse and keyboard for the controls and great sound effects all round. Also, you can set whatever level you want to play, from easy to hard.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Stunning Graphics\n-	Good story-line\n-	Great weather effects\n-	Very good atmosphere\n-	Achievement & trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Inventory could hold a larger number of items\n\nThe Solus Project is a very good First Person exploration game with a good story and splendid visuals! It is time for you to land on the planet Gliese! You won’t regret it!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

A survival game with a more unique environment, and luckily for me the game isn't a full-on survival game.\n\nThe story is that Earth was destroyed, and Earth's citizens are moved out into space temporarily. You play as humanity's last hope, looking for a habitable planet. Unfortunately, you crash land onto an alien world.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the feeling of loneliness. The atmosphere is very strong. Interestingly enough, this is a spiritual successor to the game "The Ball". It shares the same universe and lore. It gives me similar vibes when it comes to finding interesting architecture. This game's environment is a joy to look at. The graphics look great, and the world is filled with interesting plantlife, rock formations and ruins.\n\nAs you explore, you'll find interesting new objects, or random weather effects or situations can occur. Many times I was genuinely terrified, which is great. That's due to the immersion of this game.\n\nThe crafting is quite simple. You can do stuff like combine one rock with another, to sharpen one of them. Using the sharp rock, you cut some dry roots, and then wrap that around a pipe, which you can then light on fire to create a torch. That particular combination might sound a bit complex, but the game makes it quite easy.\n\nThere's quite a bit of managing your inventory and resources, as the world is harsh. You need to keep on your temperature, amount of sleep, calories and hydration.\n\nOverall, I'm having a lot of fun playing through, and can't wait to discover more of this interesting world.","February 20","true","3.6"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

Having had fairly important issues initially running this game in virtual reality (Oculus DK2) I had to resort to the community hub for some help, which finally ame in the form of an update from the developers. Not only were my issues resolved, but options were added to resolve issues others were having, and in the end we even got options that are a welcome extra. Devs that communicate so openly and then deliver on the discussion need to be recognized.\n\n2) Amazing performance. While the game is in "late early access", the VR portion of it is far less complete, but what makes it easy to handle - not being the case with most VR games - is the butter-smooth performance. When I'm not using any recording software I've seen the game stick at 75fps without even touching any of the stock settings. This will lgo a long way in making your playthrough smoother.\n\n3) Well polished. This part applies less to VR and more to the game overall... for what is being delivered, the game is almost there. They seem to have their mechanics about 95% the way, and at this point most of what's not here yet is actual content.\n\nThe game has gotten my attention enough to select it for a let's play video series.\n\nHere's the DailyMotion 2D-only version of my first impressions video:\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3uzrpz_oculus-rift-dk2-the-solus-project_tech","February 29","true","2.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game though is mostly focused around exploring and collecting.\nIn most of normal games like this you expect to be led with single road.\nWell in Solus... There is LOTS of jumping. Might as well call it jumping simulator 2016.\nThe story is getting deeper and deeper.\nAnd this is the point when this game becomes... horror. In a good way that is.\nCreepy Caves? Dangerous Traps? Spooky Scary Skeletons? You like that?\nGood, then buy this game.\n\n\nYour main task is basically to reconect with mankind after crash on Gliese.\nThe Earth is at the edge of extinction and you are the LAST hope of humanity.\nBut! As you will realise, the task will not be so simple.\nNot only you must collect the parts for the comm tower, but you also have to survive the weather.\nThat's not all! There is much deeper story... and ancient civilisation to be discovered!\n\nWell, the bad sides? The game is freshly in release and the devs are giving patches really often, so there aren't many.\nBut, if you are really a nerd and like to play the new maps immediately, you can encounter many bugs&stuff such as:\n- Sound Glitches (sometimes)\n- Teleport Glitches (Teleport gun is a weapon that can save you... or kill you)\n- Irritating Survival Pad (My gosh, this is the most annoying peace of junk in this game)\n- "WARNING!

In that, it has a story worth your attention and every single page is yours to interpret.\n\nSeemingly stranded on a mysterious distant planet (no spoilers!) you must find out what happened. Supplies, shelter, cover from an approaching storm await your travels. You must craft and explore being mindful of your trusty PDA companion known as "Wilson". Filled with environmental details, spectacular sounds, superb music this novel of a game is more than worth your time and effort. Very highly recommended. I cannot wait for more from this "Early Access" game and the studio behind it.\n\nPros:\n-Outstanding atmosphere\n-Superb audio to include voice acting and music\n-Interesting and meaningful story so far\n-Great graphics & very unique overall design\n-Smooth play control\n\nCons:\n\n-UI/User Interface is a bit confusing from the start\n-PDA seems static.

This does not affect my review.~\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634824125\nTags: Early Access, Adventure, Survival, Indie, Sci-Fi, Simulation, Exploration, First-Person, Story Rich, Singleplayer, Survival Horror\n\nIntroductionYou play as a lone survivor of a crashed ship on a strange (and for the most part uninhabited) alien planet.  Tasked with finding a way get back home, you will face harsh environments and uncover timely mysteries.\n\nOverviewIf you want a casual atmospheric survival game set in space, look no further! This is one of the most beautiful and immersive games I have played in quite some time. While it’s no sandbox like some others with similar concepts, what The Solus Project has to offer is quite interesting.\n\nThe levels are crafted even to the smallest detail, focusing on a more linear approach instead of sandbox survival. Don’t be fooled though, hidden within these levels are multitudes of secrets waiting to be found.\n\nThe crafting system is not too complex but was detailed enough to keep me interested. Things you find on the islands can be combined, for example, you use two rocks to make a sharp rock and use that sharp rock on a closed can of food to open it. Recourses are scarce, so be careful what you do (I accidentally burned some important material by using a torch on it…. oops)\n\nThe environment is very complex and includes all sorts of weather; scorching heat, tornadoes, storms, and even meteors. This is without a doubt the best feature that this game has to offer in my opinion. Another detailed part of the Solus Project is the in-depth day/night cycle. Every detail is there: temperatures, winds, humidity, and cloud coverage.  Very unforgiving: a single mistake can get you killed.\n\nThis game is in early access at the time I write this review, and content is being added regularly by active devs. I only found a few problems with the game: The running sometimes glitches (and movement in general is a little awkward) and Saves are not working properly for me (I’m not sure when the game saves and when it does. I thought I saved at a shrine, only to find myself back at the starting area when I started up again.)\n\nSummaryOverall, I recommend that you give this a try if you enjoy atmospheric games with phenomenal attention to details.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/313630/","March 1","true","4.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

If you've played Myst, it's a lot like that combined with a Metroidvania travel here and do this, and go there and get this object type playstyle.  I played it on easy mode until I ran out of the story (it’s still being released a bit at a time because it is Early Access), but on the harder difficulties you can get your fill of survival.  Temperature and wetness contribute to potential hypothermia as well as varying weather such as sunny weather, snow, rain, meteor showers, and tornadoes.  There are also plenty of secret areas to get items that boost your resistance to hypothermia, increase movement speed, etc. and you are guarenteed not to find all of them in the first go.\n\nThere is a story here about Gliese as well as plenty of notes to find and read about your mission and fellow Solus Project astronauts and trying to communicate about your crash landing.  Go to the spoiler tag to reveal what I've uncovered and think of the story.  From the in game texts strewn about on monuments and such it seems that a race of coneheaded people were taken from their planet by much taller humanoids which they named Sky Ones (because these aliens came in spaceships.)  These Sky Ones showed them how to make stone buildings and other sciences.  But there is a sinister element here.  The Sky Ones are underground dwellers.  The coneheaded children are sent to an underground monastery to participate in a ritual called the Flameless Rite, which if I understand the pictures and stone tablets correctly essentially involves running around with a torch that attracts a creature of some sort that is smoke, spikes and rays of light (you don’t actually see what the creature is inside the smoke) which then eats the child and flame.  I can only guess but what I gathered is that lots of coneheads are sacrificed to these “dark spirits” as they call them to power them up and the “dark spirit” is used by the Sky Ones to power their machines or for some other reason.  Of course all of this is done under the guise of some religion so the general conehead populace doesn’t realize they are food, leading to some wise rebels wanting to expel these superficially kind but sinister Sky Ones from their world.  As part of the main story you follow a giant cable from the surface to underground and manage to activate it using a tower which doubles as a lightning rod that funnels the energy.  Overall, it becomes kind of a horror atmospheric game without really meaning to at times.\n\nI recommend it for a change of pace and because it’ll leave you wanting to find out about what happened on Gliese as well as the Solus Project itself.","April 6","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The mixture of surviving and story telling is awesome and works perfectly well.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely beautiful and oh dear the sounds and music of the game, they add so much to the game to make it more immersive. Seriously the soundscape of this game is one of the best I've ever listened to in my entire gaming experience.\n\nA big plus is also the perfect optimization I have a GTX 980ti and it can handle the game perfectly well of course. But I also tested it on another PC with a 4 year old GTX 680 and I can run the game with stable 60 FPS on every setting maxed out (resolution scale 100%).\n\nLast but not least the Story is very interesting and will keep you playing the game because you want to find out and explore everything this game has to offer.

The elements of survival (while basic) make it all the more realistic. I expect them to add a lot more items and functions to that system. That being said; the weather system is the best I have ever seen in a game; the random tornados, lighting and meteors especially knock your socks off! Beyond that the thrill of navigating a (seemingly) dead world is fantastic-even more so when you realize the ancient civilization that  once lived there. Uncovering their history is exciting. I would only say that the game is rather linear (which makes since considering the discover/progression of the game).

This one blew me away...right away.\n\nI had not a real idea of what i should expect on this, i still thought is some space-survival - nothing more, nothing less. Oh dare me to be this stupid indeed. As soon as it started i found myself within a great adventure. Although some of the animations are - and I am far from an expert to rely on a whatever amount of experience in "rating" games - not quite good, this game caught me right away. Making use of the debris, the nature, exploring this indeed very alien place, but on my on - at first.\n\nI still have part 3 upcoming to me, as I haven't had the time yet, but I am SURE, it will keep up its pace and beliveable storyline.\n\nAnother point I would love to mention is the fact, that the developing crew, especially the art and environmend designers made a really fantastic job here.

The intro video was smooth, but soon as I was in the actual game, the frame rate dropped to nothing and was really jerky moving around - had to shut it down fast because it hurt. I started on Ultra graphics, and then tried with low graphics, with the same issue. So you understand, I use an i7 4790K CPU, and a 980ti video card. It's not a PC power issue. Is this only happening on my Vive? I have to mark it down for now, because it's just unplayable on Vive so far (for my testing), regardless of the graphics settings.\n\n--edit-- changing this to a thumb up, since it seems this is a vsync issue they are working on and the game is playable if you disable vsync in the game files.","June 5","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Beautiful alien world with a hint of Egypt in the tombs.  I spent quite a while in the game, but towards the end I just headed for the ending, as opposed to searching every corner.  But now I want to replay with a greater attention to detail.  I do think there is room for more thrills (such as giant balls or other objects rolling/sliding down stairs behind you, or directed-falling as seen in Tomb Raider 2013, for example, and more to see or do in the caves and tombs).  Wonderful atmosphere, and story, with the music, sound and weather effects topping it off.\n\nAt the end of the initial first three levels, I find I'm tiring of the caves and tombs, and hope more outdoor areas are soon to be discovered.  Of course a few minor bugs along the way, but nothing you wouldn't expect at this point, and definitely not game-breakers.\n\nWith a touch more WOW-factor in the caves and tombs, this seems like it could end up being a classic of the genre.  I wouldn't mind seeing a few ideas "inspired" by Mind: Path to Thalamus, such as in seeing clearer pathes through reflections, etc., and maybe a few more puzzles.  But overall, this is a gem, in my mind!  Can't wait to see more!!!\n\n8.5/10","February 21","true","35.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At first you're like, cool abandoned alien buildings and stuff, but after a while you realize something is really wrong on this planet, like creepy dark wrong, and it may not be as abandoned as you think. You should give it a try if you're into movies like alien and interstellar.\n\npros:\n-nice weather and environment system (rain, snow, tides, cyclones, meteors, northern light, earthquakes,...)\n-believable world\n-focus on exploring and finding out what's happening, instead of action (may be a con for others)\n-some light puzzle elements, you won't be breaking your head here.\n-works nice with xbox xontroller\n\ncons:\n-no blowing up stuff (I don't really mind tho, it's not a shooter)\n-so far it's been pretty linear, you do get to explore islands and caves, but when that's done there's only one option: go to the next island or cave (I get the impression the world will open up eventually in a later phase of the game, in a bioshock kind of way, but I'm not sure)\n-the environments, while nicely crafted and unique looking, do use a lot of the same textures and elements which make it look repetitive at times.

The thing I was more afraid of was the optimization thing. You know, UE4 isn't exactly canon yet as far as I know. Still, the game runs smoothly no problem, everything maxed. Now back to the game: reading all info regarding your system and the environment that matters in a extremely well crafted and properly designed mobile device is definitely good and helps immersion.\n\nYou can tell the developers do care about details, since temperature will raise and decrease according to your placement (right under a breaking sun or taking advantage of cooler shades? This matters as well). You sweat? You have to drink more. -15° and you decide to jump in the ocean? Hypothermia, here we go!\nBut what I like the most is that The Solus Project awards exploration while being story driven at the same time.

Although its not under the genre it should be considered a mystery game as well.\n\nThis is a very good exploration game where you alone are exploring this alien planets surface. Most of the gameplay involves the environment of the levels itself. When it comes to level design and feel this game is unique and i can't think of anything similar to it. The environments design is absolutely cool with full day and night cycles with dynamic weather(plus tornados). The surface of the planet does have an alien feel and what you find on the planet is definantly interesting and engaging. The levels span from beautiful all the way to eerie. The detail put into the alien appearance of the surface and structures is amazing especially when it comes to the alien technology that you will come across.\n\nAs you explore you find mysterious pieces of a civilization whos history you piece together through writings and pictures. This story requires you to manually put the words and pictures together to get things to make sense. It pretty much is like learning of ancient civilizations on earth through the artifacts we've uncovered. This method is of story telling is not used often so you'll be in for a treat with this one.\n\nThis is a casual game that is definantly worth a try.

You begin on an alien planet and need to survive by gathering supplies into your backpack and/or gathering them in a cave.\n\nThe nights are very cold and the days are warm, so at night you need to keep warm. You do this by finding the necessary supplies then using them to stay safe. Once you do so, you can begin to explore more safely.\n\nThere are puzzles, traps, secrets, and more along the way. Backstory is provided via pages strewn around from the wreakage. Some story is also provided by alien structures/monuments. The rest of the story is provided by voice.\n\nThe sound effects and music are all really good and help pull you into it.\n\nAs this review is from Early Access, there's currently some bugs. Nothing major.\n\nBut, some annoying things could be better such as when getting wet its quite difficult to read the in-game UI as there's these big water droplets in the way that may not be moving out of the way.\n\nThe water droplet animation is REALLY bad.\n\nAnd some other things... what they improve or fix in the end just isn't known at this time.\n\nYou can jump and move around at will. Into the water you go! The ONLY invisible walls I've noticed are deep at sea.\n\nThere's plenty more to find out for yourself...\n\nOverall, definitely recommended. I haven't wanted to play a survival based game until now. This one is good.\n\n(Its best to have a short review for this game as the more you read the more its going to take away from the discovery aspect of it which is very important here.)","February 19","true","26.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game reminds me the most of "Myst/Riven", and the puzzles are somewhat challegning. That being said, the "challenege" of the puzzels is mostly the challenge of finding the next switch far too often lol...\n\nIn any case, if you are looking for an atmospheric puzzle game with a deep intriguing story, I high heartily recommend this game. It is a lot buggier than any other "Early Access" game I've played, though.\n\nSome of the biggest annoyances for me are that you get ONE save slot (which can be TERRIBLY gamebreaking for any number of reasons when a save occurs at a TERRIBLE time), and there is no real way to completely turn off the "survival" elements of the game for people (like me) who would much rather just "explore" without having to manage an absurd amount of "survival" elements...\n\nAdditionally, the falling damage is ABSURDLY unfair and broken - your legs must be made of chewed up toothpicks, because a 3 foot fall causes falling damage ffs, and it scales in damage EXPONENTIALLY fast, so that anything above 15 feet or so just plain up MURDERS you.\n\nTHANK GOD that the collision detetction is ETREMELY sound, so at least I'm not dying because I slid down a slope all the time like some other games I could mention! n.nU\n\nOn the plus side, it's SO REFRESHING to see a game that DOESN'T use "invisible walls" all over the place (the ONLY time I ever ran into one was when I tried to swim very far out into the ocean, and I guess that's fair - it's hard to come up with any other way to add a barrier in that situation).\n\nAlso, the game runs flawlessly in "Fullscreen Mode" - it just freezes up and lags like mad in "Windowed Mode".\n\nSo I DEFINATLY recommend you try this game! I've been wanting a fun and challenging puzzle game for a long time (one that DOENS'T include tons of "horror" elements, whcih all the morte recent ones usually have, sadly...).","February 20","true","15.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","15"

So I decided to pull the trigger and check it out for myself.   I'm seriously glad I did.   This game has a uniqueness to it that really resonates with me.  It's a puzzle game, exploration game, survival game, but it's wrapped into a neat little package that doesn't feel forced or over-developed.\n\nIt's very much a game that tells it's story through the environment.  Through discovering remnants of your crashed ship to reading diary's and heiroglyphs left behind by the alien civilzation.  None of this is particularly original, but the way it's handled is very well done I think, and the writing seems pretty well.   I can tell there are some very particular characters being developed behind the scenes and I can't wait to learn more.   I can't wait to uncover the secrets this world holds and why oh why some giant green ball of energy blew up my ship.\n\nIt doesn't really feel so much like a survival game as it does an adventure game.  With a sincere focus and direction and an obvious goal.   You aren't just dropped onto a planet naked and left to your devices.  There is a mystery to be uncovered, there are diary's to be found, heiroglyphs to be read, other trapping more inherent with a game like Gone Home or Myst.  The survival aspect I feel just adds to the challenge of solving the puzzles and uncovering the mystery.  The crafting mechanic that's seamlessly implemented into the survival system is very concise and isn't jumbled up with a bunch of silly recipes and experience point curves.  You aren't left fiddling with menu's or having to wait things to happen.  It just works, and it's simple and it's right in front of you.\n\nThis is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys adventure games.  It's got beautiful world and what looks to be a beautiful mystery just waiting to be solved.  And I can't wait to solve it.   If you're looking for something fresh to play and don't mind Early Access - give this one a shot.   I'm sure you will be as impressed as I am.   Stellar game and it's future is looking very bright.\n\nAnd by the way - - Be mindful of of the weather.   Meteor Showers and Tornados will definitely ruin your day.","February 24","true","16.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The world is immersive, and there's a very real sense of isolation that is invaluable in bringing the game to life, but not to the point of horrifying. There's  a sense of fear of what's over the horizon, and the weather anomalies really help to highlight that this is a world untamed by humanity.\n\nPlease finish this game.

It’s a more linear story driven game that gives the player the freedom to explore a level at a time. And many of these levels contain many interesting areas and items to find.\nThe Early Access gives you the first 3 levels out of 10.\n\nYou can speed through the first levels in under 3 hours or 7, if you explore the many locations given to you at the start. In later updates Solus may offer 12+ or 20+ hours of content.\n\nSolus gives us a basic but well done survival/crafting system:\nLooking for food, water, crafting items and tools.\nThere are even collectibles like alien artefacts that give you upgrades to your stats making you last longer on the derelict planet.\n\nThere are no enemies (so far) monsters or "ALIEN life" that could kill the player.\nBut I swear whatever laid them eggs better be dead.\nYour real enemy is the hostile environment on the derelict planet. Hot days and cold nights, mega storms and deadly flora (and falling to your death) are the main kill factors that challenge you in solus.\n\nAnd puzzles...\n\nI will not go into much detail about the story to keep from spoilers and the fact the trailers above pretty much review their own game for you, the story is like the film Prometheus. But without the bad plot holes, and uninteresting characters. But keeping the same ancient alien feel as you look around in runis of a dead alien race that worshiped a god race that may have killed them all.\nAfter some kind civil war or uprising.\n\nOverall I found this game fun, interesting and a frill to play.\n9/10. "Would get scared by living spike balls again."\n\nSo far from the first 3 levels I have played shows the making of a great game. But we will see when the rest of the game comes in the following weeks, and from what there is now... It's worth the investment.\n\nUpdate Edit* Don't use VR it runis the game.\nUpdate edit 2* ♥♥♥♥ me the new levels are creepy as hell!

Of course - it was made by the lead of Hourences (see wondeful "The Ball" game also). You even can find Easter Egg with Nali crucifiction in some secret in the caves:) So i am happy! I really can call it a "New Unreal" game! Strongly recommend - this is not your usual survival POS - here we have strong story and plot and game mostly based on exploration and story and mission based instead of those usual flat collecting of junk and keeping your stomach full. So for all Unreal fans - buy it and your will never be dissapointed. Even for EA stage this is a masterpiece already. 11 from 10!\nP.S. Does someone missed that cool Translocator thing from Unreal Tournament 1999? Prepare for a mighty return:)\nP.P.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/313630/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPure awesome!! I cant stress enough how good this is, especially, for an early access game. Too many times you see altered artwork of the worlds and videos that always llok 10x better than the actual game. So far, this game looks good, runs good, makes sense, et al. Everything that you expect out of a game - the basics - are already done correctly.\n\nNow, you crashed on a fairly hospitable planet. Lucky you. Plus you have one main tool and there are survival notes that got scattered all over the palce. So, the main tool you use is a PDA. And its a sweet little tool. It scans an object when you look at it, tells you how your health is, receives incoming satellite messages, recordings, is used as your save tool (sleeping will automatically save), and more. By more I mean after scanning the object you also have the option to pick the item up or craft it into something right there. Its totally fluid and you arent moving in and out of menus trying to do your next action. Centralizing the majority of the information into an easy to read smaller screen isnt an original idea. But this is done well. Its clear, concise, and smart. It sits on the bottom left of the screen. When you look down your hand automatically moves more of it into view. When you need to select other options, like sleeping, it can cover the full screen. What I like about this is that it feels and acts just like an important tool in the field should. Its not cumbersome but it also isnt hidden. Its that fine balance.\n\nWorld design is really nice so far. I didnt expect the caves to be so nicely done and well thought out. Also, after carefully climbing some rocks outside, I was absolutely sure that I would find something very valuable at the top. But I didnt. And I like that even more. It shows me that the devs arent predictable. So what if you scaled the mountain jumping from column to column. You know what you get? A can of food and a journal entry (ie the same stuff you find on the ground)\n\nSuggestion to Devs:\nI am gathering artifacts and other things that can be used for upgrades to my character (and I gueess my suit). However, Im not sure if Im not far enough along to be able to equip those things or if its done automatically. It says that you can upgrade your gear from the "Stats" page/option but even after selecting that page, and having acquired upgrades, it doesnt seem that I need to apply them or cant at this time. My only suggestion would be that since they do such a good job starting you off with everything else in the game I think there should be a message in the "stats" page the first time you open it. If you open it before you can upgrade yourself then a simple message of "This is the page that will allow you to upgrade your system, your PDA will notify you when it is time" and of course, if you dont open the page up before its necessary just having the PDA instruct you how to do it, like it does with everything else.\n\nAnother cool thing: Ability to set your units of measure in the very beginning of the game. Im from 'Murica, so the metric system always makes me doing calculations on the fly. Two of my cars speedos read in kph so I am used to doing that while driving. But when it comes to liquid measures, forget about it. I can dmetric temps because of my computer rig. But I couldnt tell you what is a safe body temp in C. So I selected standard unit measures to be displayed in the game. Awesome little feature that they couldve easily overlooked or decided to keep out.\n\nConclusion: Im super excited about this game. I saw the price and I didnt expect much at all. I expected bad character movement, glitchy, unpolished worlds, and I thought I would at least experience poor performance and crashes. Noe of that exists in Solus. It feels like a game that does not need to be in Early Access. You know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of "The Forest" but in outer space/landing on a foreign planet. Rather than a survival book you have a PDA. It looks similar too. Im so glad I purchased this. I consider the price to be a discount, even if you buy it at full price. And I cant wait to see where they go with this. I imagine that this type of story can always be added to. And Im hoping that the devs do that through DLC's later on.","February 23","true","2.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","2"

There's a cross of Tomb Raider puzzle solving mixed with some hardcore survival, but the survival is even part of the puzzle. You have to make good choices about when to consume things and what to take with you from one place to another. The game is really short right now. Not worth what I paid, but I realize that I'm buying in to something, so I look forward to the story continuing. From the videos you get the impression that it's openworld survival, but it's rather linear with opprotunities for exploration. It's an interesting casual game, I was looking for something like this, and am glad to add it to my library.\n\nThats my initial review. As we can expect with a beta, there's going to be some issues. We should expect the issues to be addressed or resolved. I submitted a ticket over a month ago about an issue which has somehow made my game unable to load the save. Since there's only one save slot, this is a big deal, and I just can't convince myself to start ALL OVER. I still haven't heard anything back about it.","February 29","false","9.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

The execution, however is VERY sloppy and in some aspects downright unprofessional. The music is decent, but the amateurish voice acting and UI design make it very difficult to get into the game, as it is constantly reminding you of how rough and unfinished it is (it also literaly reminds you constantly with an ever-visible white text caption at the top of the screen).\n\nI was very tempted to ask for a refund, but since the game is very cheap I'm going to hold on to it and see if it improves over time.\n\nFor the moment, however, be advised that in my opinion the game needs to mature and right now all it does is ruin itself and everything it promises.

What passes for the survival element is your fading food, water, and sleep meters. Replenishing these feels more like a chore than an adventure. There are no real options available: just hunt around for cans of food, refill your water bottles time and again, and try to figure out how the designer intended you to worm your way into the next area. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe opening and cut scenes are tedious, but the game play graphics are great.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game. Well, unless you think it's fun to look for keys to unlock the next area while gathering conveniently placed food/water to reset your food and water timers.\n\nIf your idea of survival involves wide ranging choices, random discoveries, random dangers, and the freedom to venture into the forest or scrounge along the beach, forget it.","February 21","false","1.4"," 18 of 47 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","18","47","3","6"

It's very pretty and fun to explore at first, but the scenery quickly gets somewhat repetitive (especially in the caves) and the survival/roleplaying elements feel very tacked on and pointless.

It's emmersive, suspenseful, and kinda spooky. Unfortunately, the survival aspect of the game is bad. But other than that I can't wait to play the next part.","February 22","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It run so damn smooth. This game looks amazing. Though sometimes i'm not sure if i'm a survivor of a ship crash or a archaeologist in this game, but i always get the urge to explore and read every bit of info i find be it a alien tablet or a note found in the ships wreckage that is spread throughout this alien planet. This game really is huge and very easy to get lost in. i have spent many hours wandering around looking for a way out in the undergroud ruins. i've been chased by the smoke monster from lost. this game has a great atmosphere and for once a alien planet that actually looks alien. If you want to be a alien archaeologist this game is for you.","May 19","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

You are one of the last humans alive in the universe. You crash land on an alien beach (ARK) and have to use basic crafting supplies to survive (ARK). As you progress alien sounds and relics empower and guide your path to find a benevolent intelligence at work.\n\nThe strengths of this game include a bizarre alien weather system, which makes survival interesting and unpredictable. One minute you're burning hot, the next you're freezing. You can retreat to various safe areas, which typically coincide with save points, but you will encounter a dark presence, which leaves you few options for a safe retreat.\n\nAs survival games go, this one has puzzles that remind me strongly of any of the recent Metroid games. (I say recent, I think back to Gamecube and Nintendo 64) The puzzles require intelligence and planning. You will eventually have more locks than keys. Choose wisely! (spoiler)\n\nThe textures (graphics) leave a little to be desired, but as you go you get swept up in the big picture. There are very few glitches (if any, I have encountered none) and many hours to be derived between searching for secrets, dodging the weather, hunting for aliens, and finding interesting new things to craft.\n\nThis game gets 5/5 from me. Definitely recommended.","June 6","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth every penny and a must have if you have a Vive.","June 6","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
