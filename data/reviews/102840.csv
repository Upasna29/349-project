"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/recommended/102840/","WitteCS","'Witte - Ice Cream Time","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/","1286 products in account","Sequels are a funny thing. When a game is good-but-not-quite-great, we see the smallest solutions to itty bitty flaws, a few things that could have been spectacular given just a little more spit-shined development time. Yet those few tiny tweaks typically aren't enough to regenerate interest, never mind entertain for hours on end, when a sequel turns up. It' almost as if that game had its chance, and now we expect more, more, more.\n\nShank 2 doesn't reinvent itself in the slightest, which is why, more than most sequels, it's difficult not to compare it to the original. Developer Klei used past criticisms to patch its pants and glue its building blocks together. It shuffles its pieces around, finds better places for them to fit, and defies the idea that overhauling a flawed experience is absolutely necessary.\n\nThe result is, of course, a better 2D brawler, the kind most wished it would have been the first time around -- and it'll absolutely turn your Shank crank again.\n\nShank 2 addresses flaws Klei is acutely aware of, so it practically shouts about how much better it is now than it used to be. Main character Shank dodges with an effortless flick of the right stick, which is a massive step up from the clunky trigger/stick combo from the first game.\n\nAttacking and healing aren't tied to the same button as they were previously. Where the animation system used to inhibit Shank, it now enables him: He moves faster, pounces farther and higher, and can switch between weapons mid-combo without a split-second delay signing his death certificate. In addition, exclamation marks above enemies' heads act as an instant-death counter-kill indicator, which is massively helpful for plucking particularly troublesome guys from a group. Also, disarming and executing dudes is quick enough not to break your rhythm, but slow enough to glorify the grossness of kicking a baseball bat down someone's throat. Uninterrupted murder is a beautiful blend of graceful fluidity and harsh ferocity, and few melee-centric action games achieve this kind of big-combo bliss.\n\nThe combat is improved for more than basic input reasons, too. Enemies attack in different ways from various places -- dudes chuck grenades from across the screen, careful shooters take precise pistol aim from above, and maniacal machine-gunners fire bursts in your general direction. Instant-kill pits make short work of bad guys (and you) too, and throwing switches to crush five guys beneath a shipping container is sickening fun. Each encounter is an unpredictable puzzle where evasion, aggression, and an impressive array of acrobatics earn you a personal accomplishment greater than any leaderboard high score.\n\nJuggling and switching from your quick-attack shanks to a heavy sledgehammer to the shotgun aren't just cool-looking tactics -- they're completely necessary to surviving. By comparison, the first game is slow, unsatisfying, and cumbersome. (Really, you can never go back.) Shank 2 is demanding, and in a 2D action game so reliant on player precision, these simple tweaks make your life a hell of a lot easier.\n\nEven the most difficult problems in Shank 2 have easy solutions. More importantly, its harshest conditions can't come close to the maddening challenge of its predecessor. This is perhaps the best step forward -- the first Shank had some ridiculously difficult spots. In Shank 2, you'll only bash your head against the occasional brick wall as long as you let it stand. When shotgun blasts or the scythe aren't doing enough damage to certain characters, swapping to the revolver or chainsaw is usually enough to take 'em down. Main character Shank no longer switches weapons on the fly during a level, though, and must instead trade gear between deaths. It's small inconvenience, but knowing weapon properties -- bonus damage against fat enemies or a knock-back effect, for instance -- and changing your strategy accordingly is the key to powering through tougher sections. Boss battles are a particularly great example of these and the rest of Shank's greatest design elements coming together. As bosses are meant to be, they're the final exam for everything you've learned along the way -- if you didn't pick up on and make use of something new and important, you're going to have a tough time with their interesting patterns and brutal attacks.\n\nCo-op would have made the campaign a cakewalk, which is perhaps the reason it's single-player only this time around. Shank 2 trades the first title's local cooperative campaign for wave-based online multiplayer. It's both a trade-up and a trade-down. Clobbering coordinated bombers before they blow up supply caches for 30 waves involves all the single-player's best Shank-isms -- two players use the terrific combat, mount weapons, and set off traps to eviscerate and burn bad guys -- and requires serious skill. Dying doubles your ally's duties, plus they're responsible for reviving you, so bring a coordinated comrade or suffer the consequences.\n\nEarning cash for kills to buy mini-guns, turrets, decoys, and, uh, a wild boar gives you a reason to seek out incoming enemies as well, rather than just let your buddy take care of the worst situations. There's an alluring draw to replaying the three maps with new characters, too -- each has his or her own statistics, like health bonuses, item discounts, or damage modifiers, and each match plays out differently based on how you experiment with various pairs. Survival Mode feels thrown in out of obligation rather than inspiration, yet it still brings enough new to the table that it'll melt away an hour in an instant.\n\nSurvival Mode is probably where most will spend the majority of their time -- Shank 2 is only a couple hours long, and there's little incentive to replay the campaign. Granted, the single-player is flashy, gorgeous, and where the coolest stuff happens, like escaping giant boulders and buzz-saws, fighting through a burning village, or exploring a massive boat with a bunch of diverging paths. Survival Mode is missing distinctive qualities to call its own, so it exists if you feel shortchanged but is inessential if you'd rather move onto the next great game in your library.\n\nIf there's one major change in Shank 2, it's the tone. Thematically, Shank was absurd. The game was dark and violent, which didn't quite fit in with the Luchadores, strippers, guys in gimp masks occupying each arena. Shank 2 is about martial law, facist oppression, and endangered family. It doesn't do anything to capitalize on this stuff, which is a shame -- the cinematics are still goofy, profane, and senseless, and some of the bosses are a bit out of left field, visually. The grim approach a nice touch to the gameplay, anyway, and fits into the grand scheme of making Shank 2 feel much more in line with itself.","November 7, 2014","true","18.2"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","41","49","3","0"

Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.\n\nBefore you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.\n\nAnother problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on "esc" and close it, or Steam overlay on "shift+tab". Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press "esc" again and then close menu window.\n\nBoss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.\n\nBy accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).\n\nI also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....\n\n\n","December 4, 2013","true","18.7"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

No, You do not play as a knife. (Shank - Prison slang for a homemade knife) Shank is the name of our fearless protagonist.\nAs Shank you can unlock and use various weapons that fall into two categories: Melee and ranged.\nYou can dual-wield pistols, blast multiple enemies with a shotgun or strike fear into the hearts of your enemies with a chainsaw.\nThere are also sections where you get your hands on a minigun and oh god is it fun to just let it rip and watch the massacre take place in front of your very eyes.\nShank is relentless and knows no mercy.\n\nYou can rack up combo-chains by launching your enemies into the air, shooting them and just being creative by using your surrounding enviroment such as holes for an example.\nYou can also pick up explosives such as grenades and molotov cocktails.\n\nThe gameplay is faster and more responsive than in the previous title making Shank 2 a bit more enjoyable. The only thing bad about the game and what also makes it worse than the previous title is that there is no co-op campaign anymore. Instead of that we get a new two-player survival mode tho. The survival mode can be played and beat playing solo as well. Survival mode offers various challenges and unlockable skins that you can use in both modes: campaign and survival.\nTo be fair then co-op would have made the campaign a bit too easy in this title so it's hardly a con but it's still less content for us since, well, co-op is still optional. I've played through the campaign 1.5 times but i would play through it again if it would have co-op in it.\n\nThe gameplay is followed by epic music and cool cartoon/comic styled cutscenes that suit the gameplay well and really add to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nLet's narrow it down, shall we?\n\nPros:\n+Fast, smooth and brutal gameplay\n+Just the right amount of gore in both gameplay and cutscenes\n+Awesome music that fits the game perfectly at all times\n+Well done voice acting and animations\n+Unlockables that keep you playing the game\n+A whole new mode: Survival\n\nCons:\n-No co-op campaign\n\nOverall Shank 2 is an improvement\n\n9/10 - Shank 2 is a must have for every beat 'em up and/or side-scrolling fan.","October 5, 2015","true","12.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","27","30","6","7"

I was very much disappointed.\n\nWhat I liked\n* The help system. It's location specific, it can give you hints if you die in some particular location or in a boss fight. During the game play there are some tips how to perform combos. Very nice.\n* Usable objects in the scene.\n* Throwing people around for crowd control.\n\nWhat went wrong\nLet's talk gameplay:\n* Some new moves compared to Shank 1. Too many moves. The game is fast, you will have problems to remember all of that in the heat of the moment.\n* Blocking is gone, dodging is now on the *second* thumbstick. You need to shuffle your hands constantly. Insane.\n* Enemies no longer wait if you grab someone. It's more realistic, but it's definitely less fun. It's much harder to do spectacle killing now, making the game less enjoyable.\n* The fighting system is now based on counter attacks. A nice idea, but unusable when there are multiple enemies nearby, because during your counter-attack animation the other enemies are slashing you down. Suboptimal.\n* The Shank character is now smaller in most of the screen, making it harder to see what you or your enemies are doing and performing combos correctly.\n* The story... in Shank 1, it was simple, but it matched the theme. In Shank 2, it's total nonsense.\n* There are several completely different environments. That sounds nice in theory, but they seem to be arbitrarily chosen without any connection. Some of those environments are so special effects heavy, that you'll have problems to see just about anything important on the screen.\n* The game is freaking hard. Much harder than Shank 1, and we're talking about normal (the lowest) difficulty here. Health potions are almost non-existent. After you kill a whole screen of enemies and you're almost dead, you'd expect a treat in the form of a health potion for your effort. Instead, you'll get a second whole screen of enemies. And then third. And after that maybe a very small health potion.\n* If you die, you respawn a screen or two back, which is OK. But in this game, you die a lot. And it breaks the immersion. If I received a health potion, I would still have the feeling that it's me who's fighting there in the game, and I'm really trying hard to survive. Instead, the game decides not to give you any health potions, overload you with enemies, kill you, and then respawn you a screen back with full health. Similar effect? Not at all. The more you die, the more you not care about what's happening on the screen, because there's no motivation. You'll respawn anyway, so what.\n* The boss fights are weird. On one hand, you don't need to rely on grabbing the opponents in the right moment anymore, because you cause a decent damage to them even with your regular weapons. That's fine. On the other hand, the most effective strategy is usually roll under their attacks and shoot them from afar, over and over and over again, until the boss is dead. Which is boring and tiring.\n\nAnd also some technical aspects:\n* The configured the gamepad buttons in an insane way, half of the buttons were on a completely different place than it was supposed to me. (Shank 1 was completely OK)\n* There are bugs in the gamepad configure screen and it's practically impossible to reconfigure it, if you don't search the webs on how to workaround the problems.\n* The game performance is considerably worse than in Shank 1.","January 8, 2015","false","5.1"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","38","49","3","1"

Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss.\n* The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total).

It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. There are still lags even on high end systems.\n\nThey added lately some MP gamemode Survival which means you have to survive in a certain map with applicable traps & buy equipment mode 30 waves. There are even zombie waves. Strangely if you play over internet it gets at some point dissynchronized. So if you are protecting your armory piles some Goonies can blastup another one than on your teammate map. That's unacceptable and makes it either incredible hard to survive 30 waves.\n\nGood is that you can unlock many new charcters. My favourite is Sunshine dressed like the girl from KillBill with a longsword and desert eagles. The main game suffers from repetive enemies and a quite flat boring story.Though you can do some counterattacks the gameplay hasn't really changed. The hard mode still exists.

It is more fast-paced than its predecessor, it is more violent - once again the bosses get the goriest executions. Gameplay-wise not much has changed - perhaps now there's more emphasis on countering enemy moves (a small, red exclamation mark indicates an incoming attack). Also, I decided to keep the sledgehammer and bid farewell to the chainsaw.\n\nWe can now throw molotov cocktails and use mines as traps. One particular thing I liked is the way the game wants us to use the environment against enemies. Cars can be dropped in the garage, hanging sharks can be used to slap enemies at the docks and there are several places where machines can be turned on to lay waste to the oncoming hordes of the militia.\n\nOh, the militia: don't expect a great story here, either. Shank just wants to go home but after the fall of Cesar a so-called General Magnus took control with the use of his soldiers. Since Shank's mentor is captured by the enemy, once again he becomes enraged and we can see his revenge story through just like we did the last time.\n\nAlthough there are fewer levels than in its predecessor these look more varied and the drawing is excellent just as it was the last time. I particularly like those scenes where the foreground is deliberately barely lit so we only see the shadows / silhouettes of Shank and his enemies. Levels end in boss battles and as always they are pretty challenging. At one point we control Corina, Shank's aid, who seems to be faster, more acrobatic, but weaker. Also, her scythe has a better range than Shank's chainsaw.\n\nShank 2 continues to be a very good side-scroller, brawler game. There's a greater variety of enemies and with countering / evading there's more maneuverability here. The camera now shows a smaller Shank - this more zoomed-out approach helps with the flow of the combat and makes this action-packed game heaps of fun.","March 28","true","5.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Mash X and Y the entire game and have a sore hand afterwards. There exist much better side-scrolling action games that don't make you break your hand to play. It's worth catching on a super sale and playing through once. It's a pretty standard game and nothing really stands out, so playing through it more than once on hard mode or survival mode is not worth the time. It is very easy to die too meaning you will be doing some parts over and over again which means more torturous button mashing. I may not even finish it just because I have 151 other games installed that don't make me mash buttons a trillion times throughout the game. Other than that, the sound and music are fitting, and the gameplay, well that's the game's downfall because you just hammer buttons.

There are a lot less "cheap" deaths, although a lot of the enemies themselves pull some pretty cheap/unblockable moves. The result is that most deaths in this game feel a lot more justified than in Shank 1.\n\nThe original game's controls were dumb enough - it required 12 buttons to perform all actions, completely ridiculous for a fighting game with such a shallow combat system. This one is even worse, with 14 buttons required. They added a dedicated "pick up/use" button, and added 2 (!) dodge buttons. These add absolutely nothing to the gameplay, but make it so that you have to map a couple controls to the right analog stick... really really stupid. Do you want your dodges to require you to move your thumb from attack/jump controls? Probably not.\n\nThey mostly got rid of the QTE type boss fights from Shank 1. Boss fights in this one involve shooting your guns A LOT, maybe 300-500 hits kills a boss. They feel more like Mega Man bossfights than fighting game boss fights. When EVERY boss gets to half health, you can grapple to trigger a short cinematic.\n\nPresentation wise, this game is quite a few notches below Shank 1. What little story there was there is pretty much eliminated here. Cutscenes are quite poor quality, and some of them look like they were hand drawn, scanned to 720p and then stretched poorly to 1920x1200. The game takes place in south or central america, but all voice actors sound like they're white game developers from Seattle. The drop in quality makes me think the budget for this must have been a step down from Shank 1.\n\nDue to less cheap deaths, I'd say this game is better than Shank 1 by a hair, but still pretty poor. The controls are stupid and overly complicated for such a simple game, the combat system is still pretty much button mash with the occasional jump out of the way, and the presentation is almost non-existent.\n\nI WILL recommend Mark of the Ninja, don't be scared off of it because of this, but by the same token, don't by Shank thinking it'll be the same quality as MotN.\n\n","March 20, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't mind that fact that it's tough hell I like tough games, when it's the game that's challenging. I don't like a moderately challenging game that is made hard by it's horrific controls. The original Shank was great, the controls were all there and made sense. This one however... using the thumbstick to dodge, why? OK they removed block that's ok with me, but that block button was how you initiated a dodge, so now they muddied up the game play by forcing you to have to pretty much play with your right thumb over the stick to dodge at a moments notice, which 90% of the time will fail horribly or not even respond. I will still give a pro and con list so you might use this review to help you out.\n\nPros:\n-The animation in this is much nicer and smoother\n-Same violent slash fest as the first one\n-Editable load out pre-mission/player's death (there will be deaths)\n\nCons:\n-Responsivness? What's that?\n-Lacks intuitive controls.\n-After the time I spent it still feels like I'm playing the same stage.\n-360 degree world?

If it wasn't for the constant waves of enemies you have to fight, it would be a much duller game. As for replay value, it serves no purpose in going back, unless you're  an achievement hunter. There would be no way of going back to this game aside from playing survival mode with your friends.

It was a good fight and I enjoyed shanking that guy, but I always felt as if more could be done with the concept. It seems that I was not alone.\n\nIn Shank 2 you can can shank two different people for a total of two shanks. That's *twice* the number of shanks that you got to perform in the first game, which is a significant improvement if you're the number crunching type (and I am). I know that they say that quantity should be subservient to quality (i.e. was Aliens better than Alien just because it added an "s" to the title? I'll leave that for you to decide, but the answer is yes), but for my money I'd rather get to enjoy shanking two different guys over just shanking one*, and I think both the developers and you will agree.\n\nShank 2 delivers.\n\n*It's possible to replay the game on two higher difficulties, giving you a total of *six* possible shanks.

Most of the game is pretty mindless bashing and shooting up enemies where you actually feel like a bad-♥♥♥, however there are couple of frustrating parts.

The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.\n\nAnother improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.\n\nEverything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.","December 21, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them.

I fell in love with the shakespearian dialogue, the witty comebacks of the sidekick -- which serve the purpose of, like Sancho Panza in Cervantes' masterpiece, Don Quixote, giving the player a stark contrast to the grim, serious, philosophical nature and theme of this game, and ultimately remind the players of our own humanity.

Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.\n\nThere is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on  a sale.","November 3, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After his revenge, Robert "Shank" Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called "Militia" takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style.\nThe fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10\nPlot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10\nMusic and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10\nGraphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10\nCooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?\n\nI have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10","August 21, 2015","true","44.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While the core of the game is the same, what they added is not enough to make up for the subtractions.\n\nThe controls seem to be a little nicer with the ability to stop combos and such, but the ramped up difficulty on "Normal" can cancel out that ability as it seems there is always a new wave of enemies (always including a ranged mob) that will knock you out of the combo.\n\nBoss fights, as well boss fights. We all know the jump, dodge, attack and repeat nature but this time they liked to add in atleast 2 more random baddies to the equation. It's bad enough I need to jump, duck, dodge and roll and then attack the boss but adding more random crap in to the experiance doesn't make it "hard", it makes it tedious.\n\nIf your looking for the sidescroller, try the original Shank or Mark of the Ninja, both a much more enjoyable experiance.","August 5, 2014","false","3.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall.\nSecond, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well.\nOn to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully.\nAnd then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable.\nIt's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","February 24, 2012","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story in this one is more like Collatoral damage of Taken 2 where you should know not to mess with someone who just tore your troops apart like mere tissue paper and killed one of your generals in a horrific way.\n\nReally, Shank was just fine, drinking booze on the bus and if you left him alone nothing would happen. To quote spoony: "But oh no. You had to come down and shake his ♥♥♥♥ing tree and now he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and going to come after you" which is the basic plot of the story, plus for a single level you get to be a different character and switing weapons is done in a in-game menu whilst paused which is so much easier.\n\nOnly real downside is I feel sick that it had to be related to EA. Eitherway, if you liked the first you'll love this and if you didn't like the first.

This review examines the game from its story as a standalone.\nNote 3: I also have no one to play co-op with. This review excludes the co-op part.\n\nPros:\n\n- Responsive combat\n- If you have a controller, use it. It feels excellent.\n\nCons:\n\n- Typical story, replace damsel with older damsel. Also the story makes me cringe. But that may be just me.\n- Relatively short game if you play on normal\n- Combos? What combos? Maybe I'm just bad at this game, I dunno :(\n\nShank 2 is a game that is not for the story-driven. As a guy who loves story-driven games, this is a game that just... what? That's not a story man. Shank 2's story doesn't feel like a story - it feels like filler for the game's mechanics, which are solid; not revolutionary, but solid.\n\nIt's hard not to keep a negative tone about this game because I didn't really enjoy it; I was soon playing it for the sake of "finishing" the campaign. However, the game's combat is very solid (that's a third) and it felt great to play with a controller. Sometimes the combat makes me feel as though the situation was out of my control, but those moments are few and far between, and it was actually me not being alert most times.\n\nOverall, I don't really recommend this game, but for reasons that may not ring with you. If you like playing a game purely as an excuse to whack baddies, this is OK. But for people who are story-driven and like a good campaign, stay away.\n\nTL;DR: Get this game for an excuse to whack some baddies; platforming combat is good here. Stay away if you like good stories and a long game, regardless of the gameplay.","July 27, 2014","false","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It wont win an emmy, but the art and combat system should (though be warned, it is build for a controller, its not impossible to use a mouse and keyboard by any means, but its also not as easy) Shank and the other playable character (only playable in one campain mission, but is accessible as a coop partner) have a good number of nice, hand drawn outfits, which sounds simple but every single animation had to be redrawn for them to have these, so i think thats fairly impressive.\n\nThe story consists of 8 levels, it is fairly short and as said in the summary, isnt emmy material but it gives you an excuse to hurt the bad guys.\n\nShank has 3 melee weapons, 3 ranged weapons, and alot of outfits. The coop character has 2 melee and 2 ranged\n\nThe gameplay is best described as a twitch beat em up, you will have to dodge and click buttons at the right times and with some precision in order to look like a badass and not get hit. Its hard to learn but once you do manage to get the rhythm down, you feel like a badass with animations that seem to be built for those times when you stab a guy, throw him into another before leaping over them with a shotgun.\n\nGet it on sale if you like twitch-beat em up style games!","December 6, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Because it's very repetitive, the musics are the same for the whole game, and that's very annoying to play with that dümb music playing and playing again. But, nevermind the music, you can turn it off (Of course you can, if not, I would be god damn dead right now), let's talk about the gameplay itself. You play Shunk, or whatever, and you cut people. That's all ! You cut people with knifes and machetes again and again ! Enemies are all the same, checkpoint is a forbidden word in this game, bosses are just boring and wasting your time, etc. But at least it's pretty decent when you look at the graphics, yeah, it's all drawn-by-hand, and it looks awesome ! It "looks" awesome. Looks.\n\nUps :\n- Nice graphics\n- In the first hours, it's still fun to switch between Knifes, Machetes, Guns, etc., it makes the first levels a little more exciting\n- You don't need a PC from the NASA to make it work, and that's a good point if your PC is cheap.\n- A little coop mode, didn't test it yet. (I need to find someone who likes this game first...)\n\nDowns :\n- Musics are... BLEH.\n- Too repetitive\n- Enemies are all the same\n- Bosses are full of bugs, and seriously not interresting\n- The story. I don't understand anything about this "conflict" or whatever.

Trust me, I tried. Emulating gamepad,changing controls for over 30 min. First of all controls are absolute garbage, you'll find dodging only to te left side and different control bugs gamebreaking. Because of that fact I wasn't even able to win first level of the game. Because of that I can't really review different aspects of the game. You are probably thinking "Well gamepad maybe is broken, but what about keyboard?". Who would like to play fighting game on keyboard? It's bugged in the same anyway. All in all if you are planning on buying this game I'll have to persuade you not to. I had 2 attempts on playing this. First one was right after I managed to beat Shank 1 on hard difficulty.

Trust me, I tried. Emulating gamepad,changing controls for over 30 min. First of all controls are absolute garbage, you'll find dodging only to te left side and different control bugs gamebreaking. Because of that fact I wasn't even able to win first level of the game. Because of that I can't really review different aspects of the game. You are probably thinking "Well gamepad maybe is broken, but what about keyboard?". Who would like to play fighting game on keyboard? It's bugged in the same anyway. All in all if you are planning on buying this game I'll have to persuade you not to. I had 2 attempts on playing this. First one was right after I managed to beat Shank 1 on hard difficulty. Decided to go with the flow and I got gifted this. Now after few years I thought to give this game one more shot. Like said before, fighting over controls then with enemies.

Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes.

So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them.

I really do.  As a fan of beat-em-up games, I can't complain about the gameplay itself.  The combos are easy, and the game itself is challenging.\n\nUnfortunately, playing this game on Linux with a 360 controller is basically impossible.  On the menu screen, right maps to up for some reason.  The dodge input doesn't work, the RT and LT buttons do nothing.  While I had similar issues with Megabyte Punch, that game at least gives you the ability to change your controls.  In Megabyte Punch, you select the command you want to change, then press the button you want to change it to.  Simple.  In this game, I don't even know how the control changing works.  I click one control option, and it always changes to either Y or Z rotation.\n\nIt's too bad.

The murder-controls are tightened up a bit (but the default config is different from the original), but at the expense of weapon diversity (last melee is unlocked only at the end). Hard difficulty is much, much more difficult than the first game. There's a brand new game mode that is basically co-op (tower?) defense, and can be played online and not just local. The art definitely stands out, but for me it straddles the line between awesome and amateurish.

Shank 2 is one of the many games I bought during my first Steam Summer Sale and I didn't want the games I bought to collect virtual dust, so Shank 2 was one of the first games I played. And from the moment I played it, I was glad that I gave this game a try. From the art style to the fighting game like combo system, this game is fast-paced and awesome to play. From the many times that I've died playing Shank 2 was because I made silly noobish mistake such as not dodging quick enough but once I got the ryhthm of how the game played, I died less during my first playthrough. Some levels in this game requires fast reflexes for the enemies because the multiple of enemies and how fast some of them move can be overwhelming because many can come from different directions and can be somewhat difficult to dodge the attacks.\n\nMy only issue with the game is that there's another character that you play in the game called Corina but you only play as her in one mission of the story and never play as her again. Also the final boss is surprisingly easy. From the other boss in this game I died probably more than 5 times because it took a while to get their patterns down but for the final boss I only died once and learn his patterns easily beating him the second time.\n\nPlaying Shank 2 was such an awesome experience for me that during my first playthrough, I had to stop myself from trying to 100% this game playing it the first time lol XD. But when I play through this game a second time, I'll definitely try to collect every unlockable costumes and achivements in this game.\n\nLike I said earlier, if your looking for a fast paced game and a fan of beat em ups, I strongly reccomend giving Shank 2 a try and I hope you have a awesome time playing it as will. :D","June 23, 2014","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack.

For the combat, there're variaty of melee weapons, but some are cut and limited in your inventory. Enemy now can do damage even you're fell on the ground, so be careful!\nI'm really disappoint that developers cut co-op campaign mode off. But replace with survival mode as tradition.

Events in the past game are barely referenced to, if at all. So how well does Shank 2 fare against its predecessor?\n\nTo begin, the first Shank wasn't a remarkable game. Even with its short single player campaign, the plot was weak and the gameplay repetitive. Shank 2, with its superb art, suffers a similar fate but with an even weaker story and more uninspired foes.\n\nGameplay-wise, Shank 2 tries hard to be diverse. There is a large variety of actions and attacks at your disposal and in moments of high intensity, it's all too easy to get buttons mixed up, resulting in eventual death.\n\nTo encourage replayability, Shank 2 boasts a leaderboard that tracks player scores built up by combos and items collected. Additionally, there are a dozen or so alternative skins unlocked by completing achievements. If you're not interested in those, then one playthrough may be enough.\n\nGrade: C","June 19, 2012","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The murder-controls are tightened up a bit (but the default config is different from the original), but at the expense of weapon diversity (last melee is unlocked only at the end). Hard difficulty is much, much more difficult than the first game. There's a brand new game mode that is basically co-op (tower?) defense, and can be played online and not just local.

Shank 2 is one of the many games I bought during my first Steam Summer Sale and I didn't want the games I bought to collect virtual dust, so Shank 2 was one of the first games I played. And from the moment I played it, I was glad that I gave this game a try. From the art style to the fighting game like combo system, this game is fast-paced and awesome to play. From the many times that I've died playing Shank 2 was because I made silly noobish mistake such as not dodging quick enough but once I got the ryhthm of how the game played, I died less during my first playthrough. Some levels in this game requires fast reflexes for the enemies because the multiple of enemies and how fast some of them move can be overwhelming because many can come from different directions and can be somewhat difficult to dodge the attacks.\n\nMy only issue with the game is that there's another character that you play in the game called Corina but you only play as her in one mission of the story and never play as her again. Also the final boss is surprisingly easy. From the other boss in this game I died probably more than 5 times because it took a while to get their patterns down but for the final boss I only died once and learn his patterns easily beating him the second time.\n\nPlaying Shank 2 was such an awesome experience for me that during my first playthrough, I had to stop myself from trying to 100% this game playing it the first time lol XD. But when I play through this game a second time, I'll definitely try to collect every unlockable costumes and achivements in this game.\n\nLike I said earlier, if your looking for a fast paced game and a fan of beat em ups, I strongly reccomend giving Shank 2 a try and I hope you have a awesome time playing it as will. :D","June 23, 2014","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fast paced, high intensity, violent, action brawler, with a B-movie story. You have 3 attacks: your shanks, which are a light damage fast attack; a sword, which is a slow, heavy damage attack; and a gun (I believe the first gun is a revolver). Plus 3 different types of grenades; a timed grenade, a land mine, and a molotov cocktail. Their are also different guns and heavy weapons that you can unlock like a scythe or an uzi. The weapons are pretty balanced and you choose your loadout before each level.\n\nIf you're reading this during the 2013 Holiday sale, this game is definitely worth the $3.39.","December 22, 2012","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The murder-controls are tightened up a bit (but the default config is different from the original), but at the expense of weapon diversity (last melee is unlocked only at the end). Hard difficulty is much, much more difficult than the first game. There's a brand new game mode that is basically co-op (tower?) defense, and can be played online and not just local. The art definitely stands out, but for me it straddles the line between awesome and amateurish.

There seems to be alternative skins ,but idk if they change the gameplay, and I will probably never find out because after the first 2 levels or so I got too bored and quit the game.

Events in the past game are barely referenced to, if at all. So how well does Shank 2 fare against its predecessor?\n\nTo begin, the first Shank wasn't a remarkable game. Even with its short single player campaign, the plot was weak and the gameplay repetitive. Shank 2, with its superb art, suffers a similar fate but with an even weaker story and more uninspired foes.\n\nGameplay-wise, Shank 2 tries hard to be diverse. There is a large variety of actions and attacks at your disposal and in moments of high intensity, it's all too easy to get buttons mixed up, resulting in eventual death.\n\nTo encourage replayability, Shank 2 boasts a leaderboard that tracks player scores built up by combos and items collected. Additionally, there are a dozen or so alternative skins unlocked by completing achievements. If you're not interested in those, then one playthrough may be enough.\n\nGrade: C","June 19, 2012","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I am disappointed that the co-op campaign of the first game was replaced with a mere wave survival mode in this one, the single player campaign delivers the same sort of experience as the first, a beer-soaked, white-knuckle, bullet-riddled rampage through a grindhouse version of South America, and that's nothing to complain about. I would best describe Shank 2 as a 2D "Stylish Action Game", a term that never really caught on, since people think God of War invented this style of gameplay when, really, Devil May Cry did it first- and better. To be fair, the Shanks are closer in style to God of War, and though there is a combo grading system in the game you can get by perfectly well by mashing the buttons until you have smeared your enemies into the pavement. Shank 2 delivers fast, brutal action, varied weapons and cinematic boss battles, and despite the short length of the game it is excellently paced and good fun to play throughout. I hope this is not the last we have seen of our headbanded hero and his messy adventures.","July 31, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a more responsive, speedier activity title that gets rid of the accursing side of its stunning liveliness.

Dodging is put on the right stick which takes to long too reach when you are having your thumb on the attack buttons. The countering is done with the same button as you grab with. The problem with this system is that it works really bad when facing large groups of enemies. You will die a lot because of that. They also put more focus on the story which is really bad.

The unlock system is less interesting and the graphics are less refined. The original Shank strongly harkened back to a Metal Slug type of game. The fighting system in Shank 2 is much more complex. You have multiple weapon loadouts and various combos. The style is very close to fighting games. You have fast attacks, strong attacks, juggles, grabs, pounces, counters, ranged, and grenades. You also can dodge with the right stick which adds a lot of depth to the game. It reminds me of a mix between the Arkham games and Super Smash Brothers. The game is much harder than the original Shank. Even on normal difficulty you need to really pay attention to enemies and learn the cues and how to counter them. This isn't really a beat'em up, but more of a metroidvania style game with a strong fighting system. I strongly recommend it, but only for people who like fighting games and a challenge\n\n8/10","November 15, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank and its sister sequel Shank 2 were developed before Mark of the Ninja and does not focus on straight stealth like Mark of the Ninja did, but full on action with the same art style and same bloody action\n\nThe game is exteremly short, homing in at around 3 hours. But it does have its good and bad sides. Bad, because it is extremly short but good because it does get repetitive after a while. Shank also suffers with the same length problems homing in at around 2-3 hours long, thankfully Shank 2 does offer a co-op survival mode\n\nThe graphics are much improved form Shank and made me remember playing Mark of the Ninja (I played Mark of the Ninja before Shank and Shank 2) as well as Disney cartoons, only Disney's cartoons are less bloody than Shank is. The animations are also really good, from the sword play to the gun fighting\n\nThe controls are very annoying on PC and it shows that Shank 2, as well as Shank, were originally developed for Xbox and then horribly ported onto the PC, it is impossible to play it on a keyboard, so much so that I had to plug in my controller to play it properly, and if you do happen to have a controller, I highly recommend playing with it as soon as you start. No wonder the game highly recommends playing with a controller when you boot up the game, it wasn't joking...\n\nThe music and sound effects, are okay but nothing memorable\n\nYou will die, a lot, Shank 2 is much more harder than Shank and there is a huge difficulty spike in the very last few chapter of the game, I died a lot more in the sequel than in the first one, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was okay but nothing special, it does suffer like Mark of the Ninja's voice acting, some good, some bad...\n\nI had fun playing Shank 2, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","November 29, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blocking and grappling are now on the same button. Playing with controller feels like being handicapped, since when is dodging on the right joystick? It is complete lackluster since I have to spam X, A, Y, B for attacks in synergy to dodging. A good thing is that they are giving you an option to re-bind the keys. Yet there is no free or comfortable buttons left. This is why they combined blocking and grapple in the first place. I would of been fine with this if it allowed me to bind dodging to Left Trigger in synergy with movement joystick. Simply put, controller felt like a complete garbage to this sequel while it performed good enough in Shank 1. This forced me to switch to keyboard & mouse, which has been improved in the sequel. Dodging was way easier to do on keyboard, since all I had to do was hold shift and move into the direction I was going to dodge. But yet again I found a problem, my heavy attacks were on shift+lmb. So i tried to re-bind it on a mouse4 or mouse 5. Sadly those were not programmed in to the game. So without much hastle I just mapped it on my keyboard to not mess up my dodges. To sumarize my whole experience in one word, frustrating.\n\nWhile playing through campaign, I found out that it wasn't really worth using meele. Since I was constantly jumping/dodging while tossing darts. This made it an ultimate weapon on hard to take down enemies. Even the boss couldn't withstand it. Kinda sadenss me to see it this way, because even if the first game had it's best equipment you always ended up using them all.\n\nEven worse they took out the momentum of finishers. In the first game you couldn't be harmed while in the momentum, just like assassin's creed. Making it 1 on 1. Though it wasn't perfect and sometimes you still got hit by it, at least it was an efficient way of staying alive during enemy hordes. I guess it was over abused on hard mode, but heck it didn't even had checkpoints. So they ended up trading momentum for checkpoints and as a final effort we got a completely useless battle momentum.\n\nStory wise, I can't really say it's any better than Shank 1. Voice acting is at the same degree. Enemies were all the same as in shank 1, only difference was the skins. Game lenght wise, it was shorter than Shank 1. Basically only noticeable difference was a little improved graphics.\n\nVerdict: Worse than the first game. If they just... wouldn't... of... screwed with game controls and mechanics and improved upon the first one. This could of been a great hack & slash game.","August 23, 2014","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blocking and grappling are now on the same button. Playing with controller feels like being handicapped, since when is dodging on the right joystick? It is complete lackluster since I have to spam X, A, Y, B for attacks in synergy to dodging. A good thing is that they are giving you an option to re-bind the keys. Yet there is no free or comfortable buttons left. This is why they combined blocking and grapple in the first place. I would of been fine with this if it allowed me to bind dodging to Left Trigger in synergy with movement joystick. Simply put, controller felt like a complete garbage to this sequel while it performed good enough in Shank 1. This forced me to switch to keyboard & mouse, which has been improved in the sequel. Dodging was way easier to do on keyboard, since all I had to do was hold shift and move into the direction I was going to dodge. But yet again I found a problem, my heavy attacks were on shift+lmb. So i tried to re-bind it on a mouse4 or mouse 5. Sadly those were not programmed in to the game. So without much hastle I just mapped it on my keyboard to not mess up my dodges. To sumarize my whole experience in one word, frustrating.\n\nWhile playing through campaign, I found out that it wasn't really worth using meele. Since I was constantly jumping/dodging while tossing darts. This made it an ultimate weapon on hard to take down enemies. Even the boss couldn't withstand it. Kinda sadenss me to see it this way, because even if the first game had it's best equipment you always ended up using them all.\n\nEven worse they took out the momentum of finishers. In the first game you couldn't be harmed while in the momentum, just like assassin's creed. Making it 1 on 1. Though it wasn't perfect and sometimes you still got hit by it, at least it was an efficient way of staying alive during enemy hordes. I guess it was over abused on hard mode, but heck it didn't even had checkpoints. So they ended up trading momentum for checkpoints and as a final effort we got a completely useless battle momentum.\n\nStory wise, I can't really say it's any better than Shank 1. Voice acting is at the same degree. Enemies were all the same as in shank 1, only difference was the skins. Game lenght wise, it was shorter than Shank 1. Basically only noticeable difference was a little improved graphics.\n\nVerdict: Worse than the first game. If they just... wouldn't... of... screwed with game controls and mechanics and improved upon the first one. This could of been a great hack & slash game.","August 23, 2014","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are the main things that made the experience frustrating for me:\n\n- Awkward combat and controls. Even by the end of the game, I never felt like I could control Shank's movement as precisely as I wanted, and half the time he and the enemies just bounced around the screen as we desperately tried to hit and dodge eachother's moves. It's just really clunky and silly looking a lot of the time. I would have liked more precision in the movement.\n\n- Too much dodging. If you try to fight stuff straight up, you'll die over and over and over. Dodge is controlled by the right joystick, and you have to hover over it constantly and use it every time an enemy flashes yellow, charges, fires a projectile, leaps at you, etc. When you have 7 enemies on screen charging back and forth in different patterns, firing waves of bullets, and cleaving at you it's just incredibly annoying that the key to winning is to dodge dodge dodge dodge. I'd have preferred more straight up combat where I could fight something without watching 6 other things and constantly being interrupted.\n\n- Difficulty spikes in weird places. I spent half an hour (1/6 of total play time!) on a single turret section that was preceded by a long easy section with no checkpoint. Every time I died I had to re-do the easy section to get back. I got stuck on a boss earlier in the game for half an hour, yet beat the final boss on the first try without even knowing his attack patterns.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game. The controls and style of combat just really annoyed me. I'm glad I finished it though and there is a sense of satisfaction you get from beating the difficult parts. The cutscenes and story are groanworthy, but clearly that was their intention. I just found it all very forgettable, whereas Mark of the Ninja was just a fantastic experience with a great ending. If you're choosing between the two, I'd definitely go for the latter.","July 12, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The unlock system is less interesting and the graphics are less refined. The original Shank strongly harkened back to a Metal Slug type of game. The fighting system in Shank 2 is much more complex. You have multiple weapon loadouts and various combos. The style is very close to fighting games. You have fast attacks, strong attacks, juggles, grabs, pounces, counters, ranged, and grenades. You also can dodge with the right stick which adds a lot of depth to the game. It reminds me of a mix between the Arkham games and Super Smash Brothers. The game is much harder than the original Shank. Even on normal difficulty you need to really pay attention to enemies and learn the cues and how to counter them. This isn't really a beat'em up, but more of a metroidvania style game with a strong fighting system. I strongly recommend it, but only for people who like fighting games and a challenge\n\n8/10","November 15, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shank and its sister sequel Shank 2 were developed before Mark of the Ninja and does not focus on straight stealth like Mark of the Ninja did, but full on action with the same art style and same bloody action\n\nThe game is exteremly short, homing in at around 3 hours. But it does have its good and bad sides. Bad, because it is extremly short but good because it does get repetitive after a while. Shank also suffers with the same length problems homing in at around 2-3 hours long, thankfully Shank 2 does offer a co-op survival mode\n\nThe graphics are much improved form Shank and made me remember playing Mark of the Ninja (I played Mark of the Ninja before Shank and Shank 2) as well as Disney cartoons, only Disney's cartoons are less bloody than Shank is. The animations are also really good, from the sword play to the gun fighting\n\nThe controls are very annoying on PC and it shows that Shank 2, as well as Shank, were originally developed for Xbox and then horribly ported onto the PC, it is impossible to play it on a keyboard, so much so that I had to plug in my controller to play it properly, and if you do happen to have a controller, I highly recommend playing with it as soon as you start. No wonder the game highly recommends playing with a controller when you boot up the game, it wasn't joking...\n\nThe music and sound effects, are okay but nothing memorable\n\nYou will die, a lot, Shank 2 is much more harder than Shank and there is a huge difficulty spike in the very last few chapter of the game, I died a lot more in the sequel than in the first one, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was okay but nothing special, it does suffer like Mark of the Ninja's voice acting, some good, some bad...\n\nI had fun playing Shank 2, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","November 29, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As epic as it was on PS3. And as hard :)\nIf you want to either get Shank 1 or 2, I would recommend getting 2 first, as it is better in every way, especially with survival mode. My favorite indie game of all time! Would definitely recommend this to anyone","May 9","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is hard, but it is super tedious to get through. The first few levels are fun until the overpowered bosses get a hold of you. I would not have a problem with this if the bosses were programmed to be as strong as me and as good as me. But they are so strong I got bored mid fight. For a fast paced action game to be like this really takes away a lot of enjoyment out of the game.\n\nA boss fight should not be about how long you punch the guy but about how much skill it takes to land the punches.\nI won't even go into detail about checkpoints, whoever designed and placed them clearly had no idea what they were doing. Why? Just why? For hardcore mode going to the beginning of the level is no big deal, or even mid level. But to have it even on normal is just overkill.\n\nPlay if you enjoy small burst of enjoyment and bosses with infinitely health.\n","May 3","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It contains 30 waves of increasingly difficult enemies, which are incredibly hard to beat towards the end. Two controllers are recommended for this.\n\n+ Works well with controllers (Tested with Logitech F710)\n+ Great fighting moves\n+ Challenging (and beatable) splitscreen co-op survival mode\n+ Very responsive controls\n\n- Works not so well with keyboard and mouse, since meleé attacks are directed towards the cursor.\n- A few minor bugs","May 10","true","52.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you do not have one handy, I'd give this game a hard pass.\n\nMangled FingersFor a beat-em-up that requires tight controls, someone should've really raised an issue with the god awful keyboard controls. I do not understand why they would have 3 key functions all bound to the Shift key. Dodging, Strong Attack, and Pounce, all rely on having the Shift key pressed. So if you're trying to dodge, and follow with a strong attack, then pounce a third enemy, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nBreakdownHonestly, I don't think I got through enough of the game to give my usual Pros vs. Cons section here. However, I will say that the game is difficult, but for the wrong reasons. Early on there's a section with a meat grinder that you're supposed to throw enemies into, a very easy section by all standards, but I was having issues because I would consistently pounce or roll or fly into the meat grinders due to the shoddy keyboard controls.","May 18","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
