After hours of playing the non-Steam version, here's what I think about the sim.\n\nWhen I heard of this truck racing simulator to come out, I was instantly looking forward to it. "What, a truck racing simulator that's realistic?" I bought it on the release and I gave it a go. I was amazed. You do need to set everything up and I do recommend you to set your in-game wheel to 900 degrees first (if you have a wheel at all). But when everything is set up correctly, it's A BLAST!\n\nPhysics: The trucks have about 1000-1100hp and weight about 5000-6000kg. It depends what trucks you choose from. Some trucks are a little lighter with less hp, others are heavier with more hp. You need to brake early for the corners, because the machines are very heavy for racing machines. Corners have to be taken very slowly. And be careful with the throttle! You do need to steer the trucks with your right foot a bit, create oversteer to get them round. The physics are from the rFactor 1 engine, but they are authentic and realistic, but above all, they're FUN to drive! It's a blast, really.\n\nGraphics: The graphics aren't bad at all and they improve with each update. Reiza is doing a very good job with the graphics. The sim looks full of life  and graphics aren't bad, especially when you think this is actually rFactor 1.\n\nTracks: The tracks in FTruck are mostly Brazilian and not very common for people that are not Brazilian. There are about 15 tracks in the sim with their own configurations. Most people know Interlagos though! Reiza is doing a very good job with the tracks, especially Interlagos looks almost identical to it's laser-scanned version in iRacing.\n\nTruck slection: The following truck brands are in the sim: MAN, Mercedes, Scania, Iveco, Ford and Volkswagen.\n\nThe good:\n\n-Tracks are very convincing, true to real and all the tracks from the real series are included.\n-Graphics are well done, even with the older rF1 engine. When someone is off the track you can see dust blowing from the trucks and it's hard to see :)\n-Truck physics (you can feel the heavyness of the massive machines, but on the straights they are very fast and can outrun a fast road car easily. 240 km/h is possible on some tracks that offer straights that are long enough)\n-It's challenging!\n-Multiplayer! It's fun when there are enough people in the server.\n-Truck damage (debris falling off)\n\nThe bad:\n\n-It's price. Sorry Reiza, you should have asked more for this wonderful simulator :) Haha (not very serious point here, but really, it is worth more)\n\nNow let's get to the more serious points.\n\n-AI can sometimes push you off the track. The trucks are very big and heavy, so side-by-side can sometimes get rough.\n-Setting the wheel rotation to 900 degrees is a bit difficult, it should be possible to adjust in-game. (go to your FTruck installation folder, UserData, then go to your player's name, you'll see a Controller.ini file. Click and drag this to your desktop, right click and press 'Edit'. Then search for the degrees of in-game rotation which is 270 by default. Change this to 900, save the file and put it back into your profile folder from where you got it. Done!\n-Menu and UI are too much rF1 inspired.\n\nThat's about it! A great price and a very unique racing simulator. This is the only realistic racing sim where you can drive the Brazilian truck racing series. Just go ahead and purchase this one :)","February 2, 2015","true","13.8"," 105 of 113 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","105","113","12","4"

You feel like you are really sitting high in the cab, you can feel the weight of the truck under you, and with the sounds of the horns, air brakes, and heavy diesel engine, there's enough going on to make you think you can actually smell the exhaust smoke around you. It's a real challenge to drift these things through the turns, and the AI is as good as any out there. Although my main interest is formula cars or touring cars, I originally bought this sim when first released a couple of years ago, & quite honestly the reason I bought it was simply because it is made by Reiza - they take some beating when it comes to race sims, and this one without doubt provides believable & realistic racing. If you feel put off by the mostly Brazilian list of circuits, then don't be - they are all extremly well made tracks, a good mixture of long and short, fast & twisting, and all of them are enjoyable to race.\nFor anyone who likes editing/modding, there is scope to paint your own trucks, edit the drivers and teams, and more if you know what you're doing.\nHighly recommended, and great value at the price.","February 2, 2015","true","12.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"

A must-have for simracers, with its unique truck vehicle dynamics.\n\nIt is a hardcore piece software for the usual gamer though. It does not have that immersive video-game feeling like Codemaster's F1 series. You just enter a vehicle, put it in a track and practice/race. It is at its best through a serious racing league and online racing (for real, not a "bumper cars race"). You can find a lot of real race drivers on these leagues.\n\nYou won't have chance to properly taste it without a good wheel and pedals set.","February 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The realism factor is incredibly high. If you're like I was and only accustomed to driving other sims with fast cars with good brakes, get ready for a thrilling learning curve here. These big rigs are heavy in the front, light in the rear, with gobs of power in between. To quote the great James May, "Does understeer, this lorry."\n\nThe sound is incredibly realistic, the graphics look really good, and racing the great AI is thrilling enough to work up a sweat. Damn fine fun, this is. How I wish I had discovered this gem sooner than I did. Made by the same great developers (Reiza) that created the awesome "Stock Car Extreme", the quality of this sim is top shelf work. If you enjoy a realistic driving game/sim, do NOT miss this.\n\nPS: For those unfamiliar with the real world version of Formula Truck racing, spend some time checking them out on Youtube and be amazed with how well the series is simulated here.

I can't answer for all the different pads out there but with my 360 controller the answer is a resounding YES!\n\nThe trucks are, surprisingly, quite easy to manage with a controller even with all driving assists off. Also, you don't need to muck about with too many controller settings except:\n1) Map your controls accordingly (this is the only area where the game setup falls down, even choosing a 360 pad in the settings will give incorrect inputs for steering etc...),\n2) Put speed sensitivity up to around 70% and put a bit of deadzone in for the analog stick, probably around 5-10% depending on your pad.\n3) If the steering is too sensitive you can take the x-axis sensitivity down to 0% and have good control, this is what I am currently running it at.\n\nJust remember, this is a sim racing game, so you do have to drive appropriately. It will take some time to get used to, but the reward is worth it when you nail it.\n\nI have been playing this game quite a bit since before it was released on Steam.

So most gamers must play single player mode vs the AI trucks. The AI cars of both FT and SCE games are good, but not almost perfect, like the Race07 game, they can't behave well in many sudden and unexpected situations.\nOverall it's a good (and unique) game, i wish the AI was better and there were free multiplayer servers with many players.","February 27, 2015","true","36.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

I did write it up in tandem with Stock Car Extreme  at an unearthly hour of the morning (around 4am) plus I'd taken an increased dose of morphine, so feel that i'd missed a lot of the game elements.   My initial  feel for the game was colored by the  default key bindings.  At the time (and probably due to  the  increased amount of morphine i'd taken) I'd though  you couldn't  remap the  key bindings.  A couple of community members put me right on that matter.  It's strange how   something can put you in a mood  which then affects the rest of   the things you write about it.

This is not really a game for everyone, this is a hard core sim, and the trucks themselfs are not that easy to drive. its heavy, got lots of torque, and not that agile. but the long breakingzones, and really good drafting and accelration that they do have makes it great at pack racing. Despite logic, the tracks used are tight, often far more narrow then you would want. but, thats what makes this fun.  The ai is top notch and the physics are pretty solid as well. the sounds are also great.\n\nthat being said, for people with a wheel, I strongly recomend it, for people with only a gamepad,(which I have played half of my hours or more with) its still very playable, but, I would struggle to recomend it as much.\n\nIf you own stock cars extream and love that, get this and love this as well.\n\noverall, i really have to recomend this, especaly when its on sale, really fun, and a great way to waste hours of your life\n","January 2","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But...there's always a but...it's simply not all that fun. The trucks are pretty cool to look at and listen to but there's nothing else left you can do with them. The turning radius is pretty darn awful, even when you're driving utterly slow and still, the tires wear down fast. The speed is dramatically slower then a car and you never get that racing feel...other then when you hear it spool up. The AI isn't entirely challenging but it gives you a run for it, every now and then. Don't get all gassed up over the trailers, the graphics aren't that great. There's no customizing, no color scheme changes or create a driver option. It's just simple game.  You'll put some hours into racing but you'll get bored quickly. I suggest not to get your hopes up. If you're a customizer...I'd pass. Oh btw...the xbox gamepad controls are a bit funky, good luck configuring!","April 15","false","8.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What makes this unique you may ask? Well in Formula Trucks you race strong, heavy, loud and powerful big rigs against each other instead of the small, fast and boring typical race cars. Take your big rig and race around the track using your truck to decimate the opponents. This game is also very realistic, there is no third person view of the truck, just a first person view as the driver. See yourself as the driver of this massive truck, check your mirrors for other trucks, switch gears, check your blind spots. This is a great game for all hardcore and newer fans of the racing genre.\n\nIs this game worth it?\nThis game is reasonably priced and contains bundles of joy. Its not everday you get to sit behind a massive big rig, or even drive the metal beast. Race across the world on all types of tracks with all types of trucks. Spin out opposing trucks as you race and try not to have your own truck spun.\n\nPros  Get to drive big rigs.\nGet to race across the world.\nLots of trucks to choose from.\nRealistic controls.\nCan switch between gears.\nLook through mirrors and windows.\nFun to drive.\n\nCons\nConfusing trying to start the game\nTo many controls to keep track of.\nWish there were a bigger variety of trucks.\n\nMy final verdict\nAll in all this is a decent racing game, its very unique and realistic and therefore I rate this a 7.8/10. This game has a lot of potential and room to grow. This is an older version of the series as you can see it is called 2013. I am not sure if there is a 2015 or 2016 version as I am not the biggest racing fan. This game for its age is still a lot of fun and is a ton of fun playing against a group of friends.\n\nIf you liked this review and would like to see more please check out our curation group Here","December 9, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

If you like trucks and you like racing, then you'll like this game.  If you're on the fence about it, go try the 60 minute demo on Reiza's website and see what you think.  The trucks are different to drive of course.  You'll need to stop sooner and get a feel for how the trucks handle.   This title is classic Reiza though.  The handlng is well done, the tracks are well done, and the force feedback is just right.  I normally use a Logitech Driving Force Pro, but hooked up an XBOX 360 controller and it works just fine as far as controlling the car.  The only negative I can come up with for this review iis that I'd love to see more tracks and trucks but I'm sure that Reiza is working on that.  All in all, a great game at a great price.","June 28, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
