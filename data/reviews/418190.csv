Helen, the titular Elven child warrior, fights each enemy one-on-one.  Every weapon and spell has attack power, defensive power, and a specific deployment countdown; thus you can use a broadsword, which has high defense, as an automatic shield as you wait for it to slash.  The enemies operate likewise, and just as you can see their countdowns and the attacks they lead to, they adjust their tactics based on yours.  There are no random die-rolls; every bit of HP loss is determined directly by weapon stats and defensive subtractions.  This system is very fun, and it creates a much greater sense of involvement than the "I hit you, you hit me, I heal me" progression of yore.  I never got bored with it in the nearly 12 hours I spent with the game!  Helen is fairly easy, but it's so much fun fighting monsters and exploring the castle that it doesn't really matter.\n\nNegligible negatives:  I encountered a couple of crashes and you currently can't fullscreen it without FPS drops or tearing (I would suggest Windows Magnifier to combat the lack of fullscreen).\n\nHighly recommended -- a wonderful value for the cheap price!  I had a blast playing this before work every morning!","April 2","true","11.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","0"

It seems simple at first glance, but once you get into it you realize it is a LOT more unique than most RPGs out there, you have to think along the lines of which of your weapons/shields/spells should be best used for each situation, ESPECIALLY the boss fights.  So far i'm loving this title already and while some "might" get stuck at parts, they just have to use what they can plainly see to get them through each time they are stuck.  The part with the locked rooms for instance, well...  Let's just say that the hint you're given literally spells out what to do, all you need to do is just relax where he says to, simple as that.  ^^\n\nAll-in-all I love this title already, a solid 9/10 for me, worthy of a sequel if you ask me, hell, even RPGMaker titles based on its unique system would be nice as well, dead serious here...!. ^^","March 18","true","27.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

More fun than just about any other RPG on the market, completely unlike any other RPG Maker game I've seen. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages between Effect (attack power), Defense (you can reduce damage even while attacking), and Wait (the delay before the attack occurs). The wait timer is the key to it all, as even a single point of difference in Wait can change your options significantly.\n\nYou don't have levels, but your weapons do. You spend your XP to improve your weapons, so your starter gear can still put up a fight for a long time without needing to be replaced. There are also a lot of weapons to choose from, but you can only carry 8 at a time. However, you are able to get back dropped items, so there's never any worry about dropping the wrong item to make space for new ones.\n\nThere's very little randomization in the way enemies react, so it's a little like a puzzle to try to figure out the most efficient ways to take down each enemy. Saying that, the AI is a little weak. Once you know what attacks they have, It's easy to lock enemies into a pattern that they will never break out of. Figuring that out, though, can take some educated guesswork.\n\nThe dungeons are different in both appearance and theme. One area is about helping people, another is about solving (easy) puzzles, a third is about finding secret rooms (other areas have hidden rooms, but this area uses them to progress as well), and the starter areas and final zones to round out the package. The story takes you up and down through the levels multiple times, so there's additional backtracking in case you missed something or you can use shortcuts. Content-wise, other than the equipment there isn't really a whole lot, but I don't have any complaints for the price I paid.\n\nI'd really love to see more games in this style, and I definitely recommend this game for 16-bit RPG fans!","March 19","true","9.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

There is a visible increase in the design skill as you progress.\n\nAudio is acceptable.  Visuals I believe are mostly the included RPGMaker tilesets and sprites.  Story is weak, but gets better.  The menus are overly basic, I'm not sure you can load a save without restarting, or change audio volumes.  Lastly, one puzzle involved an element I never knew the game had, thankfully at least there are online playthroughs if you're stuck.\n\nThe combat is the main strong point and interesting enough to last for the duration of the game.  The only skill needed is basic math, the game has no resource management except spending EXP to upgrade items.  Had the game been longer, there was plenty of room for the combat system to grow as to not get tiring.\n\nOverall, is satisfactory.

I managed to find practically nothing custom in there, except the unusual battle scripting. So, if it's an issue for you, be warned.\nBut for me this was no problem at all since I happen to really like RPGmaker2000's default sprites, tiles, themes, etc. And I love playing as an elf character, so that was yet another appealing point for me.\nAlso keep in mind that the game was apparently made by one person, so you could cut him/her some slack. And most importantly you can rest assured: Helen's Castle DOES NOT feel like a cash-grabbing quickie made on a lap.

First, a positive criticism! It's a RPg, ok, but not as the other.\n\nI have a passion for RPG currently on Steam. I'm looking for games type "Old School" with fighting turn-based like in Final Fantasy. I want a nice little story, with sub quests. And with this game, I was greatly served!\n\nThe story occurs gradually. The fights are completely new and awesome and it's not the turn-based. No inventory with items to find and store. Just select weapons that you find. You must choose which is best for each fight. There is not much, just the basics for each level. Those that you do not keep are stored in a location that you access easily.\n\nThe most interresting happens during the fight! You must use sparingly every second of every fight! You will see when you will play it, I don't want saying more!\n\nI can only recommend this game with a coherent story and really funny dialogues the most of the time and until the end!\n\nI have one regret, there's no Steam success...","April 27","true","17.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ralett/recommended/418190/","Ralett","ＥＮＤＭＹＬＩＦＥ 2: Electric Bugaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ralett/","320 products in account","Short Review:\nA light, fast-paced, incredibly full of value RPG stuffed with character and charm, well worth the $2 price. Definite recommendation.\n\nLonger Review:\nHelen's Mysterious Castle is, at its core, an action-adventure game with RPG elements. The main character, Helen, explores the titular castle to discover who she is, why she's there, and whether or not she should leave. However, Helen cannot speak, or even read, instead conversing with by replying "?" and "!", adding a charming quirk to her adventure. Side characters instead will fill you in as the game progresses, and the story is pleasant enough for any age, neither too childish, nor too serious.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between this game and other RPGs lies in the unique combat system. Imagine an Active Time Battle system from Final Fantasy that you can control the flow of. Each weapon has a "wait" stat, which tells you how many more moves you'll have before the item you selected will be used, or, in the case of shields, how long it will be active for. This adds tactical play, as all battles are 1 on 1, and you can see when the enemy will attack, too. EXP from battles goes to leveling up items, and health is increased by breaking jars that sometimes contain health capsules.\n\nBattles are fast, dangerous, and even puzzle-like, but your inventory can hold 8 items at a time, and a majority of items are useful enough to get you through a fight one way or another. If you run out of room, dropping an item will place it in an item bank you can access later in the game.\n\nAnd if you die in battle, you aren't forced to reload a save--the game sends you back to a nearby location and gives you a health boost item to make the fight a little easier next time. I beat the game without saving after dying and I don't think a 100% perfect run unlocks anything special, so don't worry, there really is only a benefit to dying.\n\nThe Mysterious Castle is packed with secrets and intelligent game design, teaching the player the mechanics without telling them, in a sense. Graphics are pleasant, sound is great. If I had one qualm, it'd be that sometimes there are secrets that involve walking through random walls. Some of these areas are hinted at through dialogue, but I became conditioned to run straight into every wall for a while just in case. Nothing is missable, but items are valuable, so I can't hold it against the game necessarily.\n\nPlus, the game is only $2. I won't give a playtime so you won't know when the game ends, but I guarantee you'll get your money's worth.\n\nI 100% recommend this game, especially because even if you don't like it, you're only losing a Large Fries side order at Wendy's, and the money goes to someone clearly passionate about game design.","March 27","true","8.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You level up your weapons and not your character but you do get health upgrades by defeating bosses and cracking open certain pots which add up.

The story reveals itself as you make your way through the titular mysterious castle, and while an RPG that drops you right into gameplay without a cutscene or whatnot can be disorienting, it does allow you to get right into the battles, which is where HMC really shines.\n\nI'm a fan of JRPGs that:\na) require more than mashing A to win\nb) have defending be a viable strategy\nc) have grinding/buying a ton of healing items not be the solution to everything\n...and HMC meets all three criteria. Battles are duels - you (Helen) v. a monster. As you explore, you can find a massive array of weapons, with each weapon having three stats - Effect (how much damage the weapon does), Defense (how much of your opponent's damage the weapon can negate), and Wait (how long it takes to use the weapon). Each enemy also has its own set of attacks, which makes battles a kind of back-and-forth dance: the monster is getting ready for a big attack! Do you put up a shield to block it? Or use your longsword to both attack and block some of the damage? Or spam a ton of quick, weak attacks so that you beat them first? Or charge up your healing spell so that it comes out right after the attack connects?\n\nAnother thing that makes HMC unique is that Helen herself never levels up: you still earn experience points after battle, but they're instead used as a kind of currency to level up your weapons, to increase Effect & Defense and/or decrease Wait. The only way Helen can get stronger is through HP upgrades, which are found through exploring - these optional upgrades, as well as the veritable arsenal of weapons you can find, gives the game a great amount of replay value.\n\n\nThe story is genuinely funny at times, although ultimately it's not much to write home about. The game itself isn't particularly long, too - it can easy be finished in an afternoon. Regardless, Helen's Mysterious Castle is a delightful little JRPG, and two dollars is a steal for a game this fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitzlunar/recommended/418190/","Blitzlunar","Blitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitzlunar/","306 products in account","I enjoyed this reasonably lengthed game. Took me about 8 hours to beat it, but I'm also the kind of person who likes to grind, so about an hour to an hour and a half of that was grinding. The combat is definitely interesting, that much I'll say. You have a variety of weapons that take different amounts of time to execute, so you'll be planning ahead most of the time rather than reactionary decisions.\n\nThe enemy's attack and remaining "wait" are always visible, so every fight kinda feels like a puzzle. You have up to 8 weapons that you can carry at anytime, so what you bring will determine what your strategies will be, which is a really interesting idea that I hope someone adds more complexity to in the future. Some of your weapons offer a passive effect to further add a little bit of variety in your playstyle. Your character never levels, but you find items that increase your max hp, and the experience you gain is like a currency that is used to level up your weapons.\n\nWhat kept me playing the game until the end was the combat and my curiosity for what new weapons there were. By the end of the game you can pretty much predict what will happen, so the story wasn't a big interest of mine. But the combat remained interesting, for at least the first half of a fight when you encounter a new enemy. After the first half of a fight the AI will fall into a predictable pattern, but I suppose that's the "puzzle" aspect for ya. Figure out the optimal strategy and you've got it down. And that's what I enjoyed, manipulating the system in every fight, maximizing the efficiency of my loadout and strategies.\n\nThe one big gripe that I had with the game was that when you finally find that new weapon you've been waiting for, but your inventory is full, you have to drop a weapon to get the new one to try it out. You can get the weapons you drop back, but it's a lot of leg work to go back and change them out. So when you find that sweet new sword, but give up your bow only to find that you miss that l'il bow, now you gotta hoof it through enemies to get your sweet baby bow back. I would've enjoyed this game much more if you had, say, a backpack to carry everything, but could only bring your loadout into a fight.","March 28","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't count the number of times that system has caught me off guard at how well its al planned out.\nAn excellant game, priced well below its actual value. I almost feel like I am robbing the poor developer for getting it for such a low price\nThat said, there are moments when this game fails to explain elements and its suprising how few of the items are actually all that worth using (The only bow you need is the Longbow. Even in late game it is invaluable with its speed) and the game doesn't do the best job of explaining where you are supposed to go (Finding the final dungeon had me stumped for a while, forcing me to look up a guide). When in doubt, just click on everything.\nOn the one hand this is very refreshing from the modern obsession with holding the players hand all the way through, but I fear it might lose a good number of people who would otherwise adore this delightful little gem\nThat said, it is still excellent.

While the story and control figurations arent easy to follow up, but thats where the game really draws you in. The feeling of having to figure out the game and its story on your own is a whole lot better than having a "hey listen, hey listen" tutorial bot nagging in  your ear every 2 feet. The gameplay or combat system is where the game REALLY shines, it's a 1v1 match (every time) and is all about strategy and timing, it is fun and incredibly addictive, in addition everytime to defeat an enemy you gain XP, but not to your character but to your weapons and gear so most of the game (until you are full of beef) you are basiclly in the same hp status. The graphic yes are not the most stunning when looking at todays modern games, but is still charming to view. This goes for the music as well Its not distracting but still very catchy and grand to listen too. If you are still reading this then ill wrap it up, Basically if you are into challenging rpgs and are looking for a good time then PLEASE by all means give Helens Mysterious Castle a whirl.","May 19","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hands down, no contest. The combat is extremely complex. What starts as rock paper sicissors evolves into a game of ai exploitation as you learn to turn the enemie's own strategies against itself. A well timed flurrry of arrows against a blocking foe can leave them with no room to counter-attack your sword.\n\nThe writting varies heavily but the core story is fantastic and quirky.","May 19","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
