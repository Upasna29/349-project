Levels that change based on item pickups, meaningless hat accessories, and levels that are clearly far too difficult for the puny physics system implemented. As other reviewers noted, the first levels are unforgivably difficult which sets the tone for the whole game. As you continue, though, you realize that the satisfaction of completing a level is short-lived while the bad taste of a platformer that tries to hard to be something it's not lingers.\n\nA decent platformer for those hardcore enthusiasts who enjoy brick-wall challenges and keyboard controls. For all else - just play Super Meat Boy.","December 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","33","43","3","0"

Not once did I get the feeling of achievement when completing a stage. It was always the continuous repetition and not my improving skill. Oh, there's also that one level with randomly generated obstacles that sometimes make it impossible for you to win (or even kill you during spawning). Yeah, I liked that one.\n\nHonestly, instead of playing this, just pick up Super Meat Boy, everything is bigger and better there. And it's far more rewarding.\n\nPS Don't dismiss my review because of my playtime, it's so low because I played offline.","February 19","false","4.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

Particularly annoying since you can't remap buttons and the controller layout doesn't have a "shoot" button. That button is used only in one level, you will need to switch to keyboard for that level.\n- Game is extremely short. Only 15 levels, with each level fitting in a single screen. Game can be completed in little more than an hour.\n- Music is repetitive. Not bad, just repetitive.\n- Some levels are poorly designed: the "shoot'em up style" level and the final boss are particularly annoying.\n\nCould have been a good game with some extra effort from the devs.\n\nNote for achievement collectors: the "no death run" achievement is bugged and you get it awarded simply for completing the game no matter how many deaths. A game almost impossible to 100% turns out to be relatively easy. Devs promised to fix it last Halloween but 6 months latter it's still bugged.","April 30","false","2.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

This game is not difficult or unfair -- it's simply irritating and it tries to be.\n\nThis is what happens when someone watches a handful of XNA tutorial videos on YouTube, borrows every page from IWBTG's playbook, and decides to make a game.  What results is an irritating product that punishes the player for anything less than pixel-precise movements in some levels, and outright insults the players in others.\n\nYou think you've made it to the exit of a level?  Go ahead and run to the door and leave.  Surprise!  A giant boulder crushed you, and you have to start the level over again.  There was no hint of the boulder over the exit, but you're dead anyway.  Try to dodge it next time, maybe.\n\nTrying to pilot this little spaceship thingy through a field of floating eyeballs?  Well, the locations and speeds of them are determined purely by chance, and all too often you won't have any room to navigate between them.  Try again; maybe the random number generator will go easy on you next time.\n\nI can't come away from this game with any impression other than it's supposed to be a "joke game".  Taking one look at the achievement list and seeing "Die 1000 times" as a legitimate achievement seems to confirm that.  Thing is, these types of games are simply passé now.  Games like IWBTG were funny novelties at the time, but their time has passed and they're not fun anymore.  This is a waste of time.","May 3","false","1.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Stigmat is a 2d platformer piggybacking of the recent success of games such as Super Meat Boy and Bloody Trapland. First off it's bad, extremely bad. The controls are terrible, feature no momentum and belong in a flash game. It has no story and boring level design to boot. I couldn't get it working at all with an Xbox or Steam Controller even though it claims support for both. The levels feature invisble walls, yes, even in a platformer. The "Hats" are used as costume unlockables but are just purely plageristic or stale meme based jokes. I don't think I've ever actually played a less functional game not too mention that the game is hard for the sake of being hard. There is no enjoyment to be had here and it requires patience to learn where each level screws you over and gets you stuck to actually progress. 0/10, I wouldn't even bother with a free key let alone buying this!","May 23","false","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I beat it in ~ 100 minutes, with ~ 850 deaths.\nIn terms of the story, (which I don't necessarily feel it needs to be too sensical in a platformer) there is none. You get your eye taken out, and you go find the guy. In terms of playability though, its good fun for a person ( like me ) who has already beat games like Super Meat Boy, and enjoy a painful challenge.\nBut to anyone else, they might find the game much more painful than fun. The obstacles in this game are mainly spikes, (which will kill you even if you come 100 pixels too close to them) and any obstacles that might come flying at you once you've grabbed the key, (a recurring mechanic to unlock the door to progress.) I got this game as part of a bundle.(It came very cheap) and as I mentioned before, I only got 100 minutes out of it, but I did enjoy it. So, if you're into this sort of thing, I wouldn't buy it at full price (due to the shortness), but I would recommend it.","March 16","true","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am the composer of this game called "Stigmat". And here it is  my special review for English-speaking players. This game has positive and some negative sides.\nSo let's start from pros:\n+ Smooth textures and in general nice graphics. I can even say that players can feel the atmosphere of being underground.\n+ Awesome visual effects wich also create beautiful image and make the game more dynamic.\n+ Ruthless hardcore.\n+ The game constantly throws up more "deadly suprises" even on each level.\n+ You can customize your hero with different hats.\n+ Frequent updates wich add different stuff and new levels.\nAnd cons:\n- Low FPS on old computers.\n- Minor bugs (that you may not even meet).\n- This game is bad for your nerves. :)\n\npss...
