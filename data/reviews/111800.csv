Instead they were working on a miniature robot that was a blend of their two computer games. Tetrobot was activated in their absence and had to go rescue them from "The Boss." Definitely cliche.\n\nAs Tetrobot, you start out only being able to jump but quickly get a drill attachment. With this drill you are able to drill and collect certain blocks in the level, similar to Minecraft. Throughout the game, a couple of upgrades are added to Tetrobot to allow it to drill and collect different types of materials. With this collected matter, Tetrobot can regurgitate the blocks onto the paying field following a couple of rules:\n1) The first block must be anchored to the level. It cannot just be put into mid-air. Subsequent blocks must be attached to blocks currently being placed.\n2) Groups of four blocks must be placed. No more - No less. This creates "Tetronimos" I-J-L-O-T-S-Z.\n\nCollecting and building platforms to get through the level is the goal. There are couple other things such as undrillable blocks, falling blocks, slimes and TNT. Each level also contains a Treasure Chest. Collect this chest and bring it to the level and you collect the "Block That Matters" for the level. The blocks that matter all pay tribute to different games.\n\nFinally, every level has a star available. If you finish the level with a set level of blocks in your inventory you get a star, i.e. finish using the minimal number of blocks left on the board. Finish at the minimum get a gold star. Finish below the minimum and get a green star.\n\nRescuing Alexey and Markus will probably only take 3-4 hours. One of the Steam achievements is to complete this part of the game in one session. However, to get 100% (all the BTM and stars) will take significantly longer. I have played about 15 hours and still have 16 stars to collect and 14 bonus levels to complete. This is a fun little puzzle game that can provide a casual distraction to full out rage quit.","March 22, 2014","true","19.6"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","34","40","0","0"

The object of the game is to control a little drilling robot and solve a slew of increasingly mind-bending puzzles. Your Drillbot can drill certain blocks (dependent on the quality of its drill) and then use those blocks to create platforms. Different blocks have different ways of behaving with certain situations and objects. You are also going to need quick fingers and lightning fast reflexes if you want to solve the puzzles in the "most efficient way" to earn a Gold or even the Green star!\n\nThe game is notably short if you don't have a obsession for completing everything and gaining every little golden star in the game, but at the same time it doesn't drag things endlessly and spread itself too thin. Almost every new puzzle requires different kind thinking. In the casual category, this game shines!","November 29, 2013","true","28.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

Certain blocks fall when placed, others when touched. Some blocks will catch fire, others will not. Some can be drilled whilst others cannot. It's a puzzle game and as such needs rules but I found myself asking why they are so arbitrary a lot.\n\nPossibly the biggest problem is that there are no save points during a level and there is no ability to rewind an action you didn't mean to make. Some (most) of the levels are too long and if you make a mistake jumping and running you'll find yourself redoing solved puzzle elements. Also if you make a mistake near the end of a puzzle you'll need to restart and redo all the jumping and running and blocking that went before.

The early gameplay is enjoyable enough, but later sections abandon the casual puzzle elements to push timed and precision platforming. By the end, Blocks really don't Matter, as they do nothing new in the later half. It's a mixed-up and clunky game, almost guaranteed to frustrate anyone by the end.\n\nI was initially interested in the gameplay and story, both of which slowly fall apart. The game features seven core block types, and hides secrets behind special blocks you can't break at first. The character upgrade system feels decent, giving reason to replay older levels with new abilities. The number of upgrades is very small in fact, and the later blocks behave very similar to others. Gems are just a harder Stone, and Obsidian is an unbreakable Sponge. Puzzles become fairly stale towards the end of the game, with the extra Chocolate Castle levels adding some fresh changes.\n\nThe clunky controls and character that is literally a block makes things more difficult. Later levels rely heavily on guiding AI that will one-hit kill you, avoiding drops that will one-hit kill you, and traversing areas that allow no mistakes to slow you down. This is not a casual puzzler, and not a game about digging. It quickly expects precision and minimal mistakes.\n\nIt seems the game ran out of ideas near the end, and just turned up the difficulty in timing precise moves. There is an awkward level editor with very little information on how it works, and some extra levels that again rely on AI usage to solve puzzles. It's been some time since the game stumped me into an "Aha" moment. I feel the game makes references to other games to create conversations, as this game is not of the quality of its influences.\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing game that will challenge your mind, I would look elsewhere. I've been enjoying Qbeh recently, it has nice puzzles with a great atmosphere and a push for exploration. Blocks That Matter fails to impress. Check videos or the demo, and know that the game pushes heavily into platforming in the later half. If you are still interested, it's not a regretable purchase at base price. I'd still recommend waiting for a sale, you aren't missing anything by waiting.

The game started out good but turned out way too repetitive to be enjoyable, largely because there is no way to undo a previous action -- if you make a mistake you need to redo the entire level. Some of the levels are too long and/or have monsters/traps that insta-kill you, so even if you place everything right you might mistime a jump and get killed, and then you have to redo everything. This was at first boring, then frustrating, and at level 34 (timed sequence with traps) I outright started hating the game.\n\nIn the end, Blocks That Matter becomes simply too tedious. Instead of feeling a sense of accomplishment for figuring out a puzzle, too often I got bored with the game because I had to redo the entire level several times to figure all the moves, or I had to redo the entire level even after figuring out all the moves because I got killed. I don't recommend it, unless you have plenty of patience and you've run out of better puzzle games to play.","November 14, 2015","false","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Deal with it.\n\nI don't think Blocks That Matter are worth €5 of your money. Why? To begin with, it's not a very complicated game. It's a puzzle platformer, based around manipulating blocks, that might as well been a Flash game. But it's not a very well designed puzzle platformer either.\n\nThe "premise" of the game is ridiculous: two devs (who are basically Alexey Pajitnov, creator of Tetris, and Markus "Notch" Persson, creator of Minecraft; the game doesn't attempt to hide this) create some small robot who has to solve puzzles to go to portals and to then go to more portals and for some reason rescue the two heroes. (I didn't really pay attention to the story, it's a puzzle game.) Yeah, could do better in terms of plot development.\n\nThe Tetris and Minecraft references are very prevalent in the game, and by very prevalent I mean the core of the game's design. You got blocks. Of different types, which behave differently. Blocks, which look very much like in Minecraft. And behave quite a lot like in Minecraft. (gravel and sand fall down, wood and stone doesn't, obsidian is unbreakable, etc.)\n\nAnd then you can use these blocks to build structures. But only structures shaped like Tetris blocks.\n\nThat's the game.\n\nI'm sure there are more kinds of blocks with properties that I couldn't dream of (the game even shows me some of these new blocks I can't do anything with in the first levels of the game, as if to taunt "you can't do this yet! better backtrack later!"), but the gameplay is frustrating. I'm probably bad at the game, but to be fair, getting stuck in a level and having to restart it by manually killing yourself (or blowing yourself up, in this case), is not good design in my book.\n\nThe music is okay, the visuals are okay, but all this to me is a mix of two already-existing games, just in the puzzle genre. There's zero originality in this, and I doubt I'll play this longer, it's just not fun to do.\n\nYou can buy this if you don't mind all of the above though I guess.

I purchased it in a Humble Bundle, so it also came with 10 bonus levels, which was really cool.\n\nI have a slight warning, though. Level 34 is brutally hard and nearly had me rage-quit. It feels out of place with the rest of the game, as it pulls a Super Meat Boy kind of platforming skill for a few minutes. Still, after that level, things come back to normal and the game is far more focused on puzzles than platforming. I completed the entire game in about 8 hours, mainly because I used no online sources for hints and pushed through the Chocolate levels(bonus ones).\n\nI'm disappointed that the game comes with its own bonus levels as well, but locks them until you complete certain objectives in the game. I would have liked them to just open when you beat the game.\n\nAnyway, pick up this game if you like puzzle platformers. It is not at the top of list of great ones, but is decent fun, and is a great sale purchase.\n\n7/10","May 18, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I think "Blocks That Matter" I also think "!&*#%$@*!!!" because I was forced to replay certain levels severals times as a whole. It didn't matter I failed in the last part because I could not time something right or make a crucial jump or avoid something. Disappointment. I don't like when developers don't give more than one difficulty. I didn't get this game for challenge, but mechanics and fun. I wanted to relax and I received completely opposite sensation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/111800/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Wow, I was really impressed with this game. The demo made the concept seem fun enough but I wasn't sure how much they could really do with it, and needless to say I was surprised. Pretty much every level plays with the core concepts in a new way, and the introduction of new drilling abilities allows you to go back to old levels and solve them in new ways. There's loads of replayability here, too. You can complete a level normally, you can complete it with the treasure chest, and you can complete it with the maximum (or more than the maximum!) number of blocks. And each level will play differently depending on what you're trying to do; a lot of levels you can only clear normally the first time through, which is maybe a bit annoying, but the game's short enough and powerups come quick enough that it barely matters. There's also 30 extra levels beyond the main game and a level editor/community level hub, so if you can exhaust everything the developers put into the game you still have plenty to keep you entertained.\n\nThe game does have a few weak points to it but they're generally more nitpicks than anything. Though the game is technically a puzzle platformer, it's much more puzzle than platformer, and the least fun levels tend to be the ones that have a platforming focus, as tetrobot is not an especially good platforming character. He has a long airtime but a low jump (necessary for puzzles) and a large hitbox (and anything that can kill you also does, too) leading to some clunky platforming sections, most notable in a few of the bonus levels. As well, the bonus levels have some meta-puzzles to them that I could do without/didn't bother trying to figure out myself because I'm lazy, but the main game is kept clean of them so I can't complain too much. A checkpointing system would've also been helped on some of the longer levels, as accidentally getting yourself killed several minutes into a complex puzzle and being forced to restart can get tedious. Thankfully most of the levels are kept either short or relatively danger-free.\n\nMinor stumblings aside, this is a great game and a worthy addition to any puzzle game enthusiast's collection. You get quite a lot out of it for the low price, as well. It's an indie game that loves indie games and does what it wants to do quite well, allowing it to stand up with the games it references.","September 22, 2014","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mjtmjt/recommended/111800/","mjtmjt","Mike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mjtmjt/","128 products in account","I first played this on Xbox 360 several years ago and enjoyed it immensely, although I wasn't particularly bothered about the user generated levels. When I saw this was in the Steam sale (even though it's cheap already), I snapped it up and played it again, finding it just enjoyable as the first time round.\n\nI felt I had to review this game, because many of the criticisms other reviewers have, are actually the aspects I *enjoy* because it makes it a bit more challenging, and gives the game a bit of longevity.\n\nThe lack of mid-level save points and undo ability means you actually have to sit down, look at the levels and really *think* about your next move rather than moving about at random knowing you've got a safety net to fall back on. The kind-of-sequel to this game (Tetrobot and Co) does have undo ability in it, but that suits the difficulty of that particular game. For this one though, being able to undo would have made it far too easy. Removing the requirement to put down exactly 4 blocks at the same time would also make it little more than a walkthrough.\n\nIf you're not scared of something which relies on you to think strategically, it's well worth the money - even at full price (currently £3.99). But if you want your hand held through the game, it's probably not something you'd enjoy (although you should probably try it anyway to give yourself an education).\n\nI'll be fair; it's not perfect. The graphics are overly simple, sometimes jumping can be a bit 'take-a-guess', and the user-generated levels are an unnecessary addition, but none of these things detract from the gameplay in any way.\n\n==================\n\nTL;DR - if you're a wuss who can't handle a challenge, don't buy it. But if you like something which is a bit of an 'old school' challenge, go for it :)","January 10","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can get rid of blocks by placing them in rows, like Tetris. Its alright for a little while, but it grows boring quickly. I never actually bothered to finish the game, but I can imagine that the ending is probably a letdown. If you like puzzle games and platforming, or just want to give Notch and Alexey some money, go ahead and buy it.\n\n\nSeriously though, does anyone actually remember Alexey for anything other than Tetris?","November 27, 2015","false","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/111800/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Blocks That Matter is a puzzle game with some platforming involved. The Adventure Mode has about 40 levels total, and there are also about 20 optional bonus levels to be unlocked as you collect hard to reach blocks locked in chests through each area. You are also given access to several bonus levels that have tie-ins to other games that were included in the same Humble Bundle that must also be unlocked. If all of those levels were not enough, you also have access to numerous player-made levels that are available for download in-game. The artwork is cute and interesting to look at, but is not rich with much animation. The main character is a small robot by the name of Tetrabot, and it looks very much like a little clothes washing machine. The puzzles aren't too complicated, but I do find myself restarting each level many times in order to get them right. Especially the last ten or so levels are quite difficult and will require your focused thoughts and attention to hit upon a solution. Your goal is to manipulate blocks in the environment in order to gain passage to other sections of the levels and to exit through portals. The music is very good, and of the ambient chiptune genre. This is a relaxing game, and even its storyline is cute and fun. The chests (containing video game history trivia blocks) scattered throughout each level are mostly very difficult to reach, but they are not required to proceed. The premise of the game is very creative and does not resort to cheap gimmicks or pretentiousness to accomplish its goals. All puzzles are intuitive and logical, challenging the player in the most adequate of ways. Some levels are significantly more difficult than the majority, and you will retry many, many times, until you are able to pass it, but this does not subtract from the overall quality and enjoyment of the game. For completists, there are dozens of hours to be spent with Blocks That Matter, with all the additional content made available as bonuses and for free. The ending was adorable and continued to showcase the artists' distinguished style. Even for someone such as myself, who does not enjoy puzzles as a whole, appreciated, rejoiced, and experienced hours of entertainment from this puzzle platformer gem.\n\nBlocks That Matter is good.","March 20, 2014","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You want to get to the goal with the help of blocks that you mine and place them in tetris patterns of four blocks. Most of the time every block counts, so no wasting.\nThe main "adventure" mode has a good difficulty. If you want something more challenging, you can collect all chests in every level or collect stars, which require more strategy. There's also a level editor and steamwork support with levels to download. The editor doesn't seem finished (which it tells you) and i managed to crash the game with a specially crafted ice level that moved too many ice blocks at once, i guess.\n\nThe game doesn't let you rewind certain parts of the level; if you die you have to restart the same level.\nOne annoying problem i had was the audio got randomly disabled, which sometime fixed itself and oftentimes didn't. When it does work, it's totally ok. The music were nothing that bothered me or jumped at me. Just something chill to solve puzzles with. Sounds are good too.","August 31, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Two things. First one -  variety of levels and "stuff". The second - challenging, but not frustrating gameplay. In my opinion, Blocks That Matters has both of this things. We've got a plenty of levels, which are dosing new things in appropiate way - they're not revealing too early everything, but also they won't make player bored. What is more important, the game encourages to re-play some of the levels - with new abilities we can achieve special blocks or limit of blocks, which we should carry with us to complete the level in "100%". And to achieve these things we will very often need to end the level in another way, than previously. I could complain for additional levels, because in my opinion, many of them are far too hard (in comparision to the "campaign" levels).

Jumping around a slime figuring out how to arrange your array of wood, stone, metal, and sand blocks in order to get them all back before you reach the next platform is a thrilling expierience.  Every puzzle completed feels like an accomplishment:  Rewarding and fun.   The addition of stars for completing a level with the most possible blocks and the treasure boxes add replay to each of the puzzles.  I have only played 30 of the campaign levels and still find myself engrossed in what challanges lay ahead.\n\nThe game is in no ways flawless, as the story is entirely seperate from the players control, predictable, and segments of dialog replay upon every single re-entry into the level that they occur in.  The player is expected to use their "look key" (Default C) to view the entire room ahead to know weather or not they should keep 3 sand blocks and a stone or 1 wood block 2 stones and a sand, and is rewarded with re-starting a puzzle if they choose wrong.\n\nWhile at times leading to frustration, and leading me on through a predictable storyline, I find myself entranced through the game living up to its words and displaying its ability to live up to the challange of both a puzzle and a platform game.  I award thsi game 8.325 repeating stars and reccomend it to anyone who likes to mix puzzle-platform games.\n\n","July 3, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jumping around a slime figuring out how to arrange your array of wood, stone, metal, and sand blocks in order to get them all back before you reach the next platform is a thrilling expierience.  Every puzzle completed feels like an accomplishment:  Rewarding and fun.   The addition of stars for completing a level with the most possible blocks and the treasure boxes add replay to each of the puzzles.  I have only played 30 of the campaign levels and still find myself engrossed in what challanges lay ahead.\n\nThe game is in no ways flawless, as the story is entirely seperate from the players control, predictable, and segments of dialog replay upon every single re-entry into the level that they occur in.  The player is expected to use their "look key" (Default C) to view the entire room ahead to know weather or not they should keep 3 sand blocks and a stone or 1 wood block 2 stones and a sand, and is rewarded with re-starting a puzzle if they choose wrong.\n\nWhile at times leading to frustration, and leading me on through a predictable storyline, I find myself entranced through the game living up to its words and displaying its ability to live up to the challange of both a puzzle and a platform game.  I award thsi game 8.325 repeating stars and reccomend it to anyone who likes to mix puzzle-platform games.\n\n","July 3, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No messing around with having to unzip files and put them in the right place, the game makes the whole process seamless.  Also, you can see the community's rating (both upvotes and downvotes) of any given level to help you decide if that level is worth your time, and then contribute to that rating once you've played the level.\n\nAs the system requirements would lead you to believe, you really won't need a very beefy gaming computer to run this game smoothly.  It runs perfectly well on a computer I built in 2004.\n\nOverall, Blocks That Matter is an incredibly good game, astonishingly so given its price.","December 12, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Collect blocks of different types (with different traits), place them (4 at a time), jump on them, erase them if there are 8 of them in a row.

There is no rewind function, which forces you to restart a level if you make a mistake anywhere in it, and levels are quite long. Then you need to re-do all the placing and jumping to get to that point, and inevitably make a mistake in trying to do it quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feufo/recommended/111800/","feufo","Feufo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feufo/","270 products in account","This game is a tribute to Tetris and Minecraft. Blocks That Matter is a classic platform game. You control a little robot and have to reach the exit of each level. But to go to the next level, it is sometimes necessary to reach areas difficult to access. Logic, otherwise that would be not interesting.\n\nThis small robot thus needs to collect blocks of materials (wooden, stone, sand, steel, ruby...) to create tetrominoes and so move forward in the level. Thus yes, roughly, you have to dig as in Minecraft to get cubes, which you pile to make the various forms from Tetris to move forward. And yes, when you have 8 cubes side by side, you can blow up them, as in Tetris.\n\nOther originality, cubes have various properties. If the blocks of stone or steel can hold normally in the air without problems, the blocks of sand or granite will fall inevitably on the ground if there is nothing to retain them; also, wooden blocks can be on fire, and ice blocks can slide on the ground.\n\nThis game is pretty long.\n\nThe main campaign contains about forty levels, and it will be needed between 6 to 8 hours to reach the end (according to your speed of reflection to solve the puzzles :p).\n\nBut reaching the last level does not mean that you ended the game.\n\nIndeed, in every level, there are two objectives to achieve (besides the classic “reach the exit” one): there is a chest to pick up, and you also have to get a star by using the least possible your blocks to finish the level. Levels were built so that there are several puzzles in a single level. That is you will have a first puzzle to be made a success during your first passage in this level, but when you will have got back the improvements freed during the game, you can redo these levels by way of places which were until then surrounded by blocks which you could not break up to fetch the chest and/or have the star.\n\nNote: Chests are trophies, easter eggs for other famous games, with in bulk: Boulder Dash, Portal, Bomberman, Tetris, Minecraft, VVVVVV, etc.\n\nBesides the main campaign, there are 20 levels bonus, which free little by little according to the total number of stars acquired during the campaign. Another series of 10 levels bonus, on the theme of the chocolate, also comes to be added.\n\nFinally, the game has a level editor (not obvious to use) allowing you to create and play your own levels, as well as to play and note the levels of other players.\n\nDesign is simple (they are only cubes!) but rather attractive. Musics are very nice. Scenario brings a small touch of humor, to perfect the whole.\n\nConclusion: a very nice platform / puzzle game, that you can play again and again.","July 12, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Collect blocks of different types (with different traits), place them (4 at a time), jump on them, erase them if there are 8 of them in a row. So far, not the most interesting, but not enterely un-engaging either.\n\nWhat makes this a downvote for me is that the game punishes tiny mistakes heavily. There is no rewind function, which forces you to restart a level if you make a mistake anywhere in it, and levels are quite long. Then you need to re-do all the placing and jumping to get to that point, and inevitably make a mistake in trying to do it quickly. It made me rage-quit over the tediousness of it.","December 20, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feufo/recommended/111800/","feufo","Feufo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feufo/","270 products in account","This game is a tribute to Tetris and Minecraft. Blocks That Matter is a classic platform game. You control a little robot and have to reach the exit of each level. But to go to the next level, it is sometimes necessary to reach areas difficult to access. Logic, otherwise that would be not interesting.\n\nThis small robot thus needs to collect blocks of materials (wooden, stone, sand, steel, ruby...) to create tetrominoes and so move forward in the level. Thus yes, roughly, you have to dig as in Minecraft to get cubes, which you pile to make the various forms from Tetris to move forward. And yes, when you have 8 cubes side by side, you can blow up them, as in Tetris.\n\nOther originality, cubes have various properties. If the blocks of stone or steel can hold normally in the air without problems, the blocks of sand or granite will fall inevitably on the ground if there is nothing to retain them; also, wooden blocks can be on fire, and ice blocks can slide on the ground.\n\nThis game is pretty long.\n\nThe main campaign contains about forty levels, and it will be needed between 6 to 8 hours to reach the end (according to your speed of reflection to solve the puzzles :p).\n\nBut reaching the last level does not mean that you ended the game.\n\nIndeed, in every level, there are two objectives to achieve (besides the classic “reach the exit” one): there is a chest to pick up, and you also have to get a star by using the least possible your blocks to finish the level. Levels were built so that there are several puzzles in a single level. That is you will have a first puzzle to be made a success during your first passage in this level, but when you will have got back the improvements freed during the game, you can redo these levels by way of places which were until then surrounded by blocks which you could not break up to fetch the chest and/or have the star.\n\nNote: Chests are trophies, easter eggs for other famous games, with in bulk: Boulder Dash, Portal, Bomberman, Tetris, Minecraft, VVVVVV, etc.\n\nBesides the main campaign, there are 20 levels bonus, which free little by little according to the total number of stars acquired during the campaign. Another series of 10 levels bonus, on the theme of the chocolate, also comes to be added.\n\nFinally, the game has a level editor (not obvious to use) allowing you to create and play your own levels, as well as to play and note the levels of other players.\n\nDesign is simple (they are only cubes!) but rather attractive. Musics are very nice. Scenario brings a small touch of humor, to perfect the whole.\n\nConclusion: a very nice platform / puzzle game, that you can play again and again.","July 12, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can use some modicum of the default controls, which cannot be rebound because the game doesn't recognize the keyboard, but the crucial 'drill' command is double-mapped to the run button and thus the game is unplayable without a gamepad.  The menu control scheme is awkward and the game's resolution cannot be changed without graphics corruption (Radeon HD6950) rendering the display useless.\n\nI can't reccomend this game on these faults.\n\nEDIT:\nWell, it took me awhile to find out that you can hit blocks with your head. Nothing in the game told me this, I had to rewatch a trailer on the store page (which isn't exactly HOW I should be learning about said function). Otherwise I seemed completely stuck in that initial room.\n\nThis doesn't happen to a lot of people I guess, but I guess I'm just one of those few. xP\n\nPlayed a few levels now... default controls are still unmappable and absolutely terrible. IMO, tab for puzzle, Q-E for block type choice, drill on Ctrl makes infinitely more sense. If only I could actually re-map them.","April 19, 2012","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s is a tricky puzzle solving game with 50+ levels that will get more challenging as you go along. The gameplay and design follow closely to game like braid, limbo, and The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom. The art style is much more basic and cartoon like than the titles I mentioned too. I also don’t think Blocks that Matter is on the same level as braid and limbo, but it comes close.\n\nIn the past couple of month I’ve been playing every 2D side scroller that I can get my hands on. I’ve just been going nuts for these games. I’ve been using the site unikgamer.com to keep track of the 2D side scrollers so I can say that I’ve beat them all, but as of now I still have quite a few to go through. Here is a link  to the page I’m talking about. It’s a reader voted list of all the best 2D side scrollers of all time. I don’t necessarily agree with every choice, but It’s a pretty darn good list nonetheless. I don’t think you’re gonna see Blocks that Matters on that list anytime soon because it’s not very well known, but I think it deserves to be at least in the top 200.\n\nSo here is how you play: The object is to reach the exit portal, but to get there you’ll need to jump around over blocks, obstacles, and enemies. The only real ability you have is to place blocks on the map. But you can only place blocks 4 at a time, and this is what makes things tricky. Each block as different attributes, like wood blocks burn, sand blocks fall if the block under it is taken out, other blocks explode, and some blocks are permanent once placed.  Each level makes to solve a unique puzzle by placing your blocks in a certain fashion. Be prepared to have your brain teased over and over again. I said that the game is pick up and play, and by that I mean that for me I would get frustrated by a puzzle and just quit, only to have the answer to the puzzle come to me later and I’d hop back on. It’s really a cleaver game.\n\nI picked it up on a steam indie bundle for pennies, and I feel like this game alone was worth the price of the 10 game bundle.  I put around 6-8 hours in the main story line to beat it, and there are more levels and challenges available to players for increased replay value.\n\nThere is a story to the game, but it’s not taken very seriously, and it can even be skipped ( I wish I had found out sooner). The story actually surrounds the developers of the game and how they get kidnapped or something. It was all good and what not, but to me, the way it was written, it was like the developers were honoring themselves. You’d have to play the game to understand, I felt like I was visiting some hipster indie developer loft where the developers tell each other how awesome they are. It really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nIf the puzzles weren't so well thought out then this would be a pretty mediocre game, but the puzzles are brilliantly cleaver and make you really sit and think after you die repeatedly though trial and error. I’ve since suggested this game to several friends, and I would do the same to you loyal readers.
