"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/recommended/423720/","hyperduel","Hyperduel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/","1983 products in account","Product received for free\n\nYou might be old enough to remember those brightly lit and colorful vector style games from the early 80's arcades...ones which ignited your imagination with awe & wonder as they hypnotically called out for you to drop a quarter inside so that you could go head to head against both this marvelous machine, as well as fellow players, to see who would come out on top with the highest score.\n\nI now introduce you to Color Chaos created by Daniel Riley, an old-school styled twin-stick shooter which seeks to capture and mimic that very magic of years gone by in those gathering rooms for teens which could best be described as an electronic wonderland for those fortunate enough to experience it.\n\nI found the gameplay dynamic of this particular title to be rather unqiue & intriguing. And the way it works, is that you are able to shoot enemy ships of any color except your own, and they in turn adhere to the very same principle when firing upon you. Two exact colors cannot harm one another here, but it becomes even more interesting still because both you and they have the ability to shift current colors to a different one, which adds an entirely new element of tactical play in this game.\n\nThere are also 2 game modes present by the way, 'Classic' (progressively harder and more numerous enemies the longer you stay alive) and 'Chaos' (described as more enemies, more firepower and more chaos), so as to inject a greater amount of variety into the gameplay.\n\nFurthermore, also present is a nifty power-up system in place which allows you to temporarily increase your ships' abilities in various ways, by simply moving toward & collecting the item whenever it appears on the screen.\n\nI spent a reasonable amount of time experimenting with and playing Color Chaos to develop a good feel for it...in order to ascertain what its strengths and inherent weaknesses were. And in the end, I felt it was somewhat of a mixed bag. A very admirable effort to be sure, which, if tweaked in a couple specific ways could be even more fun.\n\nFirstly, I will go over some aspects of it which I wasn't a particularly big fan of. I felt that there was simply an excessive amount of color bloom present, especially toward the center of the screen, where it all blended together into a hazy semi-translucent morass which wasn't very easy on the eyes I might add. It might have instead been optimal to leave the inner gameplay area a largely pitch black star-field to more nicely contrast with the pretty colors of the ships and boundary lines. That would have actually looked rather sharp and pleasing. It isn't to say that the the current effect is poor by any stretch, I just feel that it isn't necessarily ideal, and this is only my personal opinion on the matter. Others may or may not agree with this.\n\nSecondly, Color Chaos is exceedingly difficult, especially when using a mouse & keyboard. It was definitely designed for the hardcore enthusiast of this genre in mind....with each game typically measured in several white-knuckle seconds for the typical gamer, and certainly not in minutes unless you are perhaps a seasoned veteran who practices relentlessly. And because of it being sudden death, once you are dead then that's it - you'll need to start over again to strive for a new high score, which is clearly the main objective here incidentally. The difficulty stems from the fact that enemies are chasing you continuously & relentlessly at all times, forcing you to mostly move in a wide circular pattern so as to avoid them, while also firing upon you with bullets which travel at a surprisingly fast pace. It was difficult to establish any kind of rhythm or groove since each individual game simply didn't last very long. Perhaps making the enemies sometimes change direction in a more random manner might have added even more to the satisfaction of the gameplay dynamic. As it was however, I just couldn't imagine myself sinking hours at a time into this, and thus it's more ideally suited to being played in short controlled bursts.\n\nNow onto the decidedly positive side of things, I will say that the game itself runs exceptionally well with no framerate issues and even includes the ability to play with both keyboard & mouse, or a controller...with remappable keys for the former.\n\nAdditionally, both the background music (ambient electronica) and sound effects were superbly implemented, and it is definitely one of the highlights to be found here. Together they both generated a very mellow and relaxing vibe to the game, which counter-balanced nicely against the sheer challenge of it. Somehow it works, and works very well.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, I would say that this is a fairly good game for the price point it is at, especially for those who appreciate this specific type of challenge and its old-school feel. It's one that I could definitely see myself playing here & there in small bursts if I'm not up for a lengthy session playing something else, or if I simply don't have the time to do so. It could be better in a couple ways, sure, but nonetheless it's still very fun, and I applaud the developer for attempting to capture the magic of those games which we used to play way back in the day...transporting us to those happy times when our world was filled with row upon row of chaotic flickering color.\n\nI'll rate this one 3.5 out of 5 stars, while at the same time giving a smiling nod to nostalgia.\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","May 10","true","3.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

It was developed and published by a guy called Daniel Riley. The game itself is very fun and addicting to play and is hard to stop playing even when you tell yourself that this will be the last run.\n\nGameplayThe game itself is very simple and easy to understand. You have your shooting and movement keys that comes prior to every shooter game. Your main mission is to stay alive for as long as possible and try to get the highest score as possible, and that's pretty  much the whole gameplay. But the main difference between Color Chaos and other twin stick shooter is the colours that the enemy shooters are and the colour that you are. In order to destroy the other shooters that are trying to destroy you, you will need to be a different colour prior to what colour they are. But something that is helpful if you are the same colour as them is that if they hit into you they can't hurt you. So if you are the same colour as the enemy then you will not destroy them, this requires you to pay a bit more attention to the game and what colour you are prior to their colour. I find that this mechanic is really interesting to play with throughout each time that you play through this game. I really enjoy this mechanic that I haven't seen before in the classic twin shooter games, this really makes this game unique.\n\nNow there are a few types of game modes that you can play through, which make the game a bit more interesting and adds more replayability to the game itself. You have the classic mode that is a endless wave upon wave of enemies that spawn more and more frequently prior to the longer that you stay alive throughout the run. You're trying to get the highest possible score and survive the longest to achieve that.\n\nChaos mode is basically like classic mode, but there are more enemies, more shooting and of course more chaos the longer you survive. You will find a variety of powerups that will help you increase your firepower to make the odds a bit more in your favour. Turbo Classic mode is more of a quick reaction test as you fight waves thick and fast in classic mode. Turbo Chaos mode is basically Chaos mode but is much more quicker, with more enemies and firepower. I really like the amount of different game modes that this game has, it really pushes your ability of this game at different levels to see how good you are at the game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are very vibrant and colourful, which shouldn't be that much of a surprise as this game focuses upon colours. But the small problem that I have with this game is that the system requirements are pretty heavy for such a simple game, I guess it's from the graphics of the game. But seriously 8GB of ram required? Not even some AAA games require that much ram. System requirements aside the game's graphics are superb.\n\nThe music for this game is very dubstep like, and I guess suits this type of game but I can see for some people why it wouldn't suit some people. For me, it doesn't suit it very well but that's only personal preference for the game I can simply turn off the music and put on my own music for that.\n\nPros+ A unique type of twin shooter\n+ Nice amount of game modes\n+ Controller Supported\n+ Lots of replay value\n+ Decent price for the game\n+ Steam Achievements and Trading cards\n\nCons- The system requirements seem to be heavy for such a simple game\n- Personally, I don't like the dubstep sort of music that goes with the game (a personal preference)\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsColor Chaos is a great twin shooter game that has some awesome and unique gameplay, there are a decent amount of game modes to keep you interested, the game is controller supported which is great for this game. It has lots of replay value and is a decent price for the game. The only small thing about this game is the system requirements that is needed for this type of game.\n\nRating: 7/10","June 3","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
