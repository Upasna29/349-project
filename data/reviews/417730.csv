Well what can I say, this is a subparearly access title with a bitter after taste and one salty developer.\n\nMy original review for this game was "i paid 99 centsand all i got was problems". Most of you would be able to pick up theundertone of Jay-Z's - 99 Problems and for those who didn't, I suggestyou start here with the music video. Yes- my original review was based on lyrics from a song which was then alteredto fit in some connection with the game. The first one being the fact that I paid 99 cents and the second one being that I encountered issues.\n\nShortly there was a response from the developer, "You're quoting someone or what? What problems did you have? How did you pay 99 cents? The game has never been selling for 99 cents. You should be reported."\n\nIt was at this point I felt bad for the review I had posted so I decided to shed some light on the review and provided him with specific feedback on where the problems were and even went as far as offering to PM him and provide the information on where I'd purchased the game but these offers fell upon deaf ears and were shortly followed up with more nit-picking and allegations of piracy.\n\nThis now places me in a position where I have worked upon my meme-like review to provide useful information about the software that I purchased only to be told that I was the issue that I was and had supported piracy. Thank you Danail Zotov, maybe you should think about the terms you are usingto describe someone who out of the thousands of games on Steam bought and then went out of their way to offer support through multiple channels upon request.\n\nThis is the first and last game I will bother supporting in any form that is released from this developer.\n\nP.S. The game was bought from HRK Game, you may find the Developers link in the Footer under Services a good place to get started on removing your game from their listings or profiting from their sales of your game.","May 3","false","1.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","11"

With some improvements and fixes this game can and will be great. I've been following this game since it was on greenlight and its amazing to see it come this far. I recommend it because of the price and what it has right now. It is not by any means a finished game, but as long as the dev keeps up and works on it this game is looking good.","November 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","17","31","2","2"

It is top notch compared to other indie racing games.  Also the pastel-colours create a very nice prominent art style which sets this game apart from others.  Another great thing is how there are numerous different modes of racing, so it is not just the same thing over and over.  It's also ruthlessly hard, as the description will indicate, your skills are required.  Make a mistake and you pay the price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-lJHdwVA9I\nNow it is still in early access, so that greyed-out multiplayer button in the main menu would be absolutely amazing to experience.  I hope they can add that to the game at some point in the near future so we can try this out.  This game has a promising future!\n\nIn my short experience, I was not able to find a game mode where you race against AI cars.  Just against the clock.  I would love to hear that this is already in the game somewhere, because I feel that this is required of a good racer.  But as-is, there is some fun to be had here doing the challenges.\n\nGripes: controller support is broken.  I had to use keyboard and mouse, which was upsetting.  The arrow keys on the keyboard and so without analog controls it is a huge setback.  Since the game is only a few days old, we'll cut it that slack.  But I think that would be the first thing this game needs fixed.\n\nAlso, there were some frame drops in some areas.  Very capable system getting a rock solid 60 FPS and it would suddenly die down to 15 FPS during a turn.  These areas were few and far between so it was not a rough ride just a thing to note.","November 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","1"

And in a good way. (Probably top 5).\n\nIt really is brilliant, it's not perfect, but it's early acces. So it's not going to be. Especially by a small developer. But for a small developer this is absolutely one of the more impressive games out there.\n\n\nIt's fun, quick, challenging. And it does have partial controller support, (don't use the triggers, use the second analog stick).\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the greater games of 2016.\n\n\n","January 3","true","9.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

Not worth 99 Cents let alone the 8.00 dollars being asked.\n\nFirst off, I take no pleasure in this review, no unlike the game.\n\nThe campaign "mode" is terrible. It looks like a mediocre track created in a better games track creator mode. The physics are terrible. The Gates simply push you through the ground and the balls serve no purpose (As far as I was able to get). I could not get past the 1st race, but perhaps I'm just a noob.\n\nOne of the worst things was the camera work. Never seemed to show what you needed to see.\n\nAs for the other mode, it is a tad more fun. However it seems to be a poor attempt to clone Rocket League. All the same issues apply to this mode.\n\nOn the good side, my FPS was fine.\n","April 1","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"
