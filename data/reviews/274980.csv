This game is amazing, exactly the kind of learning style I love and was looking for.\n\nBUT\n\nIf you are buying this game to learn how to speak fluently (For me, fluent Japanese) by solely relying on this game and nothing else, you will be very disappointed.\n\nIf you are buying this game as just one of the many tools to help you learn a language, and you consider yourself a visual learner, then this is perfect in my opinion.\n\nBeing able to click any object in the house and instantly be told what it is called, is the next best thing to having a native speaker with you while you point at things asking what they are called. As a huge plus with using the game, you see how it is written; in Romaji, Hiragana, or Kanji depending on what you pick if learning Japanese, which helps a lot more for me personally than just hearing audio alone. Oh and I highly recommend only using Kana instead of Romaji, you will be glad you did in the long run.\n\nThe time challenge mode turns the game into a scavenger hunt, making your brain work to remember what each thing is called. I feel that having to recall something, especially with a clock counting down, helps you memorize the words.\n\nAlongside basic nouns from clicking on things in the environment, you can also unlock adjectives and verbs associated with each noun. I really like that because it adds context in a way; like clicking on the word "bed" has the verb "to sleep" available to learn.\n\nSo in the end, please use this game as a wonderful tool to master your language alongside your many other tried-and-true methods. I am certainly enjoying it and I feel I am memorizing the words much quicker than looking at definitions in a book. The audio is also very clear and easy to understand.\n\nAs for any negatives, I just have a few suggestions rather than anything actually negative. It would be nice if you could do the time challenge mode where objects light up and you have to type in what the object is called, or maybe choose from a multiple choice list. Right now it is just one direction, you hear the word and click the right object, never the other way around. Also if there was an option to have the speaker say the word again but slowly, to catch those quick syllables.\n\nWeather you decide this game is for you or not, please go out there and learn a new language! Trust me, it feels amazing! :)\n\nATTENTION, NEED TO KNOW TIPS: When doing the time challenge, you have to DOUBLE click an object to select it as your answer. I don't think it tells you that, or I didn't notice. :) Double clicking outside of the game mode, will bring up a window with more details on that object/word you are clicking. Also, when you click on your vocab list, click a word, and there is a little "eye" icon you can click to see what the word is in your native language. I also HIGHLY recommend reading all the hints at the top left of the screen to get the most out of this game, it doesn't take long to read them all.

The whole concept of studying language while playing a videogame probably seems fantastic for every gamer like me, who also likes to broaden his knowledge everyday. However, Influent isn't what I expected it to be. I didn't do much research before buying, just a short review by someone who generally praised the game but mentioned lack of insight on japanese "kanji", which immediately put japanese pack off my to-buy list. Therefore for starters, I picked up french pack.\n\nAfter a bit more than 1 hour of playtime, I can pretty much say that for me the game is a large disappointment. The whole game is situated in a small condo which contains about 400 different objects that you can interract with, and consequently learn more about them in order to improve your vocabulary. Those consist mostly out of basic household items.\nIn French, gender is of crucial importance, and although the game tells you which gender a certain object is, when you actually learn them, gender pronouns or indefinite articles are excluded from the actual word. For example instead of "une lampe" or "la lampe" you'll study "lampe", which means you'll still need to study gender separatly. Furthermore, the game doesn't cover one bit of grammar.\n\nThe game itself isn't particularly fun either, since one is as already mentioned, trapped inside a small condo. If the game would include also some other everyday areas like playground, trainstation, gym, school etc. it would vastly improve the vocabulary covered, but I'm afraid this will either never be available or will be purchasable as a "dlc", for which I honestly wouldn't waste a cent anymore since I don't consider the 400 foreign words to be worth of 10€, while you can learn them for free in (in a sense of content) much better covered "game" called Duolingo, or Anki.\n\nSummary: I love the basic idea, but it lacks a lot of content. Although it is obviously considered as a supplement to your language studies, I still believe that it could've included a lot more than just bare 400 words.","March 22, 2014","false","2.5"," 570 of 629 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","570","629","0","15"

The rest are alternatives to the same word; verbs, which losely apply to the nouns they're tied to; and maybe 10% are adjectives which are the only thing I can imagine being useful in everyday speech.\n\nYou're confined to a tiny apartment and although you can open cupboards and drawers you find mostly duplicate items of what's laying around. There are no ways to look out into the world beyond the apartment and nothing to offer beyond basic vocabulary that you can get for free at a site like Memrise.com","March 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 679 of 854 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","679","854","0","28"

Walk through a landscape and learn a smattering of nouns for household objects and nothing else. No grammer rules, no other words, no cultural context. Can you guys even understand how useless that is? Learning how to say random words for objects you will probably not need to talk about without ever communicating anything about them whatsoever?\n\nHell, you wll never need most of these nouns as a beginning student  of a foreign language anyways. It would be far more useful to simply learn how to say "How do you say this?" in whatever language you are learning so you can learn words that are actually useful to you.\n\nI learned way more useful information on youtube videos in an hour than I ever did with this.\n\nThe only good thing about this is the soundtrack by Lifeformed.

Though it does need some refining, it's a very helpful and affordable option for begginer to intermediate language learners.\n\nIf your only goal is to verbally pick up new key nouns and verbs for a trip abroad, Influent will suffice. However for more in-depth learners who wish to read it's best paired with good old fashioned studying. A primary example of this is that it won't help you understand how to actually read any languages that use non-roman-based characters (e.g. Russian, Chinese, Japanese). Note that you can enable english readings of any language if literacy isn't your primary goal.\n\nI'm very excited to see a real game for language learning, instead of tedious and very over-priced software (Yeah, I'm looking at YOU, Rosetta Stone). I sincerely hope to eventually see DLCs or updates that will allow users to explore the world outside of the small apartment, add more unique yet commonplace items for each culture, or perhaps interact with NPCs to practice dialouge...crossing my fingers and keeping and eye on this game ;)\n\nPros: Playble area is filled to the brim with hundreds of everyday objects to study, DOES include verbs that will unlock as you learn nouns that they're relevant to, affordable, a highly customizeable and unique learning experience.\n\nCons: Small environment, UI is almost too minimalistic (can't cycle though word details; have to return to vocab list), and you can only learn commonplace North American items (useful but limited).","March 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 179 of 225 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","179","225","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/recommended/274980/","PinkLily","(♥) Pink Lily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/","1354 products in account","This game offers a lot of opportunities to expand your vocabulary through fun challenges. If you purchased a few languages, you must select which one you want to start with first; I started with Korean and will later pick up more. Once you select the language (Korean) for example, you have the choice to also select Hangul. Once the game starts you are in an apartment, with lots of household items and the learning begins.\n\nAs you move around (Limited interaction with the items) you can select items and learn the name in the language you purchased. There you can see the English translation, pronunciation, image, spelling, noun and verb versions of the word. Once you have found a few words you are comfortable with you can start adding them to your list, you can then play these challenges like "time attack" which test you in your ability to locate the items; either they are said to you, you read them without assistance of pronunciation of the software meanwhile you are being "tested" in speed/accuracy.\n\nThere is a lot more this game has to offer through these challenges and I recommend getting comfortable with a few set of words before adding more to your list. There is no rush and after each challenge you get a percentage but no penalization for failing. There is also a "To do list" which makes it easier for you to know what challenges you need to complete and they are not meant to be done in any particular order.\n\nOverall I have played this game for only a few hours and am enjoying it. It is a relaxed, straightforward, fun way to learn a set of words in a new language. The price is good and the only thing I would want added is the chance to explore more areas (more locations) this would allow me to expand on my vocabulary besides household items.\n\nNext Phase of Influent?\nAn added software in conjunction with this one; Once we have the words learned take us to the next "Learning phase" Learning how to use them in a sentence, this would help us with the ability to actually use the words and have a conversation. The price is good for what this game offers. An added sweet bonus would be steam trading cards even though it is educational software.\n\nFinal thoughts\nIt is not meant to teach you a whole new language but help you expand on your vocabulary. It does make the learning process of learning new vocabulary fun and I would recommend this game.

Especially if the language contains grammar you're already familiar with. This is essentially who Influent is for. Those wishing to learn vocabulary in a totally new and unique way. You play as just a teenager living in an apartment. You go through your apartment filled with HUNDREDS of items (seriously he may have a hoarding problem). You click on the object to view the word and you double click it to learn more about it (the pronunciation / noun / verb / gender of word, etc.). From a game standpoint, it's nothing special. The greatness of this game comes from the language learning aspect.\n\nI chose Latin as I have been learning Latin for the past few years so I can't really comment on native pronunciation (as it is a dead language). However, the pronunciation for the Latin course is definitely on par with every other course I have been through and a lot of work has evidently been put into making pronunciation amazing.\n\nYou're paying $9.99 essentially for a virtual world that makes learning vocabularly in another language EASY and FUN. These two things are the most important factors that lead me to believe anyone who buys and plays this will come out that much more knowledgable in their target language.\n\nI would recommend 'Influent' for mainly two types of people:\n1. Those who have a good beginners / intermediate grasp in their target language and now wish to learn a lot more vocabulary\n2. Those who just wish to dabble or have fun in a different language while still learning and retaining good information.\n\nI would not recommend this game to people who:\n1. Wish to achieve fluency from this\n2. Want anything more than a giant virtual dictionary\n\nI would also be wary buying this game if your target language uses a non-Latin alphabet and you have no knowledge in the language (Korean, Japanese, Mandarin). Reason being is that you are not taught how to read the alphabet of your chosen language. The first thing I would advise Japanese and Korean learners to do is to learn the alphabet first and it will be much easier later on. As for Chinese (Mandarin) learners, learn up on how Chinese characters are written (particularly radicals) before purchasing or delving in to this game.\n\nFrom a gaming standpoint $9.99 is a ripoff for this game; however, it is intended as a LANGUAGE LEARNING program merely using a game as its platform. And $9.99 for this game from a language standpoint is a REMARKABLE price. This is essentially the same principal as Rosetta Stone (learning vocabulary / phrases with no grammar or alphabet learning). I HIGHLY recommend this game.","March 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 137 of 174 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","137","174","0","0"

Even a basic level of comprehension takes at least a year to develop with a lot of hard work involved in that year.\n\nInfluent will not teach grammar, it is simply and audio/visual application that softens the monumentual blow of learning hundreds of foreign words.

The game raised enough money to be profitable before it was available, so it was released without content and doesn't do anything but look good on an advertisement. There is no talk about increasing the functionality or vocabulary of the game on the product website, and it's not even worth the small price on steam.\n\nThe entire game can be boiled down to this: Hear and/or read a word, and then click on the thing that the word is associated with.\n\nI have nearly completed my first entire language pack in about two days (there's like 5 words I can't seem to locate). I don't feel like I've actually learned anything though. The 420 words available are not enough to order dinner, let alone take a vacation in a foreign land. This game does not teach a person how to begin to communicate in a new language, which is the only thing the game had to deliver after getting over twice the requested amount on kickstarter. They got their funding though, so the only news is that they intend to release more language packs.\n\nOther problems:\n-This game takes way too much video card effort for the type of game it is, and it will begin lagging to death after playing for an hour or so.\n-Does not understand multiple monitors, so it tries to plaster the game centered on total composite screen (hit F11 to get windowed FS on main monitor)\n-The spaceship mode is completely stupid, and is there simply for marketing purposes. It's the same as FPS mode, except you have to hold the mouse button for a while instead of doubleclicking, and you can't stop to aim (since you're flying). Some of the targets are tiny though.\n-The game was designed so that new language packs could be made in a day, with fill-in-the-blanks labels and audio snippets, but little effort was made to do a good job. There is often two words for an item without an explanation for which word to use when. The spoken words are often poorly pronounced and with anomalous noise artifacts. I suspect they found their voice actors on craigslist.\n-Sloppy positional audio often makes words hard to hear when it should really just be monaural (since you're effectively listening to a voice in your head).\n-Stripped down settings and options.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/recommended/274980/","Gao-Li","Gao Li","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/","192 products in account","An okay tool with several drawbacks\nHaving years of university training and real-life experience in teaching not only foreign language but also second language acquisition classes, I can say that Influent can work well as an additional teaching tool to the ones learners already have, provided the players know what they’re doing and are aware that Influent is not actually teaching them how to speak the target language; It merely trains them in recognizing words from that language. Given that, Influent is fairly okay at achieving what it’s supposed to do and I can see it helping certain learner types, although at the same time, it is likely to be just a waste of money to a lot of people, especially as there are products out there that are much better at helping people learn foreign languages. The major drawback being that Influent does not teach grammitcal articles (grammatical gender) for European languages. More about that further down.\n\nPrimary Issues of the software\nInfluent (2016) was developed by the US American game designer Rob Howland and published with the help of his alma mater, the University of Tsukuba (筑波大学), and Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (文部科学省【MEXT / 文科省】). Sadly, despite the academic support behind this project, its issues are clearly visible right away and it is very obvious that Howland does not have a linguistic background. The protagonist in the game simply translates nouns or adjective-adverbs from English into the target language and it is limited to objects inside the virtual apartment.\n\nTo highlight what I mean, we can briefly look at the impressively handy, elaborate, yet slim Langenscheidt’s picture dictionaries, which contain words, transliterations, pictures (and if you own the TING pen even audio clips of proper pronunciation) of local foods, instruments, sports, holidays, animals, tools, jobs, lab & hospital equipment, body parts, family members, ethnic groups in the target culture, climate zones, and so on and so on and it even includes the necessary vocabulary for any occasion reaching from birthdays to funerals or visits to the barber shop or the postal office. And it is merely twice the price of Influent's base game despite offering that much more. Not only that, the roughly 300 page book can even be brought with you, so if you don’t know a word, you can show it to people.\n\nInfluent on the other hand is limited to objects inside the virtual apartment (as can be seen on the store page’s screenshots) and the vocabulary is very narrow, albeit very useful. It can even be argued that one could simply use a normal dictionary and a language tandem to probably achieve equivalent if not superior results.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=603282417\n\nGameplay mechanics\nThe player can move the protagonist around a virtual apartment, click on objects, listen to how they’re pronounced and look at how they’re spelled in the target script or how they’re transliterated into Romaji, Romaja, or Hànyǔ Pīnyīn (depending on the language pack). Additionally, the player can create vocabulary lists and make his / her own quizzes. The game will then show and say a term and the player will have to click on the correct item in the room. You can pretty much achieve the same effect by pasting post-its around your actual apartment and by having a smartphone dictionary app pronounce certain terms for you, in case you forget how to say them.\n\nYou could say that doing that in the game would be less work for you, but writing down new vocabulary, having to use / activate different areas of your brain (to write it down and to read the word) leaves a much bigger, better imprint of the target word in your memory than merely reading it and having the computer program pronounce it for you.\n\nCritique and conclusion\nThere are multiple issues when it comes to Influent, first of all, there are products out on the market that are much better than Influent and cost about the same, so I suggest going out to bookstores and checking them out before buying this. Of course it's definitely possible that they don't have any better alternatives in your area, in which case Influent might be good. Secondly, when learning a language, you usually learn four basic fields: Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking. Influent can only provide the two “passive” skills, reading and listening, you still need a training partner or a formal education to learn (or at the very least have someone correct) the writing and speaking parts. If you cannot find a partner in your area, there are multiple online forums and websites that focus on connecting people for specifically that purpose alone. Influent will also not teach you anything about sentence structures, tenses, clauses or (in-)formal language, in fact, it will not teach you anything beyond the available vocabulary.\n\nWhen it comes to European languages with grammatical gender, Influent will also not provide you with the necessary grammatical articles (Der, Die, Das in German, for example). Let's say you click on the bed, Influent will merely play an audio clip saying "Bett" while showing the correct spelling, but it won't say "Das Bett", which would definitely have been the better choice. Grammatical gender is essential for many European languages, ommiting that means that learners will lack crucial communication skills.\n\nI can see Influent work as something you use besides the learning tools you already have (like school- and exercise books as well as audio tapes or movies), especially when trying to learn gender neutral languages, but it definitely isn’t enough to learn a language with. I like the digital / game approach to learning languages, however the execution isn’t perfected yet and still needs some work.","January 17","true","0.2"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","16"

I was like "oh, another learning game, probably not interesting". though I tried it anyway and it turned out to be something better than "just a learning game". First of all - it is not boring. It even has a plot, you know. You are an independent inventor whose prototype machine named Senjun...dammit, the name of that prototype is too hard to write. So yeah, in order to prove it he wants to learn 300 words in one of the languages. You can buy the game with one language and then buy the rest of languages as cheaper DLCs - I like the idea.\n\nLet's get to the real action. You are in your flat, filled with 420 (blaze it) things. Basically the goal is to walk around and interact with things to see their name. It's a good system in my opinion, since when you look at the thing you know what it is and you get the name in the other language. But not only that, you can also get synonyms and adjectives for some of those too (and in case of Japaneese - how the things I written. I felt good with romaji)! You can see that hard work was put into that, because there's also a native speaker saying the word out loud too! Anyway, after getting to know names of stuff int he room you can try Time Attack mode - it's all about "mastering the words" and choosing the right things. After you master 50 words - SURPRISE, YOU CAN FLY AROUND THE ROOM AND SHOOT STUFF WITH LAZERS! So it's not only learning after all.\n\nNow, a few words about graphics - game doesn't look bad, I like its art style. It is kinda like in comics, so that's a plus. Some of the texutes are less detailed, but that's only things that you can do much with. And they're usually placed in some corners and places normal human doesn't usually visit (unless he's a nerdy RPG player that has to visit every corner).\n\nOther stuff - you will probably spend more time looking at numerous references that are hidden withing the game. I really liked book on the table. Get the game (it's not that expensive, especially when you see the amount of content and educational value of it. Really, educational games can be damn good and this one is the example of it) and see it.\n\nBUT - every rose has its thorns. It took me some time to get used to controls. You can switch in this game between TPP and FPP modes, but when in FPP zooming in has to be with mouse wheel instead of good ol' FPS right-click (it is assigned for different function). Apart from getting to know controls, rest is good. Even tutorial (you can skip it and get to know controls by yourself - not suggested).\n\nTo sum up, I loved that game since 10 minutes after launching it. And I actually learned that pillow in japaneese is "makura".And yeah, this thing is definitely worth getting.\n\nRating: 9+/10 - grab it, grab it while it's hot!","September 25, 2014","true","3.3"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","43","59","0","6"

Yes! For pretty much every noun, you eventually unlock an adjective, adverb, verb, etc. that goes along with it, giving you context to use your new words in! Now you know how to call your television stupid or a book interesting. (Sentences are not given, though, just to clarify that.) More than one adjective is given to plenty of nouns, so there are more words to learn that you think at first. There's also fun with the treasure hunt element to it as far as some of the words/items go, like finding slippers under the bed.\n\nWhile I would happily recommend this to a complete beginner, I've been learning Russian for about eight months and I still found this game to be incredibly useful. Each way of testing yourself comes with simple and useful options. Don't know the Cyrillic alphabet yet? You can choose for the Russian words to be in Latin characters/Romanized. (I am guessing this would ring true for other language options.) You can choose to be tested on the words with or without audio, with or without sound, and with or without your native language translation. (Having all enabled is the default, of course.)\n\nAlso, the voice is a pleasant female one, if that matters to you.\n\nThe option to test your vocabulary words being given only the audio and not the text has helped me a lot, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their listening/recognition skills.\n\nIt also helps that for each test, there are repeat items in each room, so when you're doing kitchen vocabulary, you can click on the book in the kitchen without having to go into another room, and you don't need to walk over to the bathroom just so you can click on soap, since both also exist in the kitchen. So there is a lot of unnecessary moving around avoided.\n\nI had to reconfigure the trackpad on my MacBook to be able to enable the right-click options (which are important, since they open doors, shelves and whatnot) but it was quite simple. The game also is very clever and you can click on things very easily, even if you're at a weird angle. You don't need to be close to click on things, which is nice when you want to click on the magnet in the other room.\n\nLike other people said it's not something you'd use to learn the entire language. It doesn't go into grammar. But if there was a language-learning food pyramid, this could definitely be your хлеб.","January 20, 2015","true","9.7"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","82","28","34","18","0"

Be warned, though: Influent is only about words. Forget the detailed explanation and examples given by Duolingo. Influent only tells us the gender of the words, their writing and their pronunciation.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing as the interaction with objects (image association) greatly helps learn all the words. The very early on unlocked "Time Attack" mode tests our knowledge by randomly picking objects we've already found. Well, random is not a must but it is best not to test our short-term memory so let Influent pick from the entire list as it sees fit! Naturally, the more words we add to our vocabulary the greater challenge it will be to remember them.\n\nTo make it harder we can hide the text and force ourselves to listen closely to the recorded audio. Adjectives and verbs are not available at the beginning; by successfully completing the challenges we earn stars - these can then be spent to unlock the related words. Note that some of the objects are tricky to find: by pressing ctrl we can look at objects in a more detailed way. For instance, looking at the bed only yields us the word bed itself but by pressing ctrl the words mattress, bed frame, pillow and cover sheet can, too, be learned. This child-parent relationship adds extra fun to the exploration. The computer on the guy's desk is another example: pressing ctrl makes the keyboard, mouse, speaker and display available.\n\nPros:\n\n--- A great way to help us learn a new language or improve upon our existing knowledge.\n--- Objects are many and varied: thanks to Influent I'll surely remember the word stapler in French. :)\n\nCons:\n\n--- Only 420 words... the apartment is nice but we could go elsewhere. For instance, we could visit the parents at their house which would allow us to see the garden. A house also has a cellar and a loft thereby allowing us to learn more. Not to mention the added pets or other animals as in the flat we only have a cat.\n--- Expensive. I find 10 euros a bit much for one language pack. Duolingo is free which lacks this image association technique with the interactive gameplay but greatly makes up for it with more topics and - most of all - grammar.\n\nStill, Influent is a great concept and hopefully it'll be expanded upon with new words & places to visit!","May 3, 2015","true","8.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.\n-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.\n-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.\n-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.\n-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.\n\nAnd here's some tips for Japanese:\n-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.\n-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.\n-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.\n\nOther than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:\nIt makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.","December 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

It's nice to be able to point at anything and find out the word.\nAs others have mentioned, this game is not going to teach you to speak a foreign language, it's just a way to learn some vocabulary. It's unlikely in my opinion that anyone would be content with learning a few nouns and have no understanding of how the language works so you definitely won't learn to speak a new language from scratch with this software.\n\nI had this in mind when I chose the language to install. Since I speak Spanish pretty fluently I knew there wouldn't be much point there. Instead I chose to install the French version as I have a basic understanding of French. Now, I loved the point at anything and learn how to say it concept, the problem for me is that the things you can point at are household objects that, if you are learning a language, you are likely to have learnt elsewhere.\n\nI found the environment to be really claustrophobic, it's a small flat with only a lounge, a kitchen, a bathroom (which I initially missed as the door's shut) and a bedroom.\nI was disappointed that you can't go outside. You can't even see out of the windows. There could have been all kinds of interesting vocabulary to learn if you could. Different environments would really help here. The key would be to expose the player to environments with vocabulary unlikely to be covered in textbooks or other forms of study. It would also make it more exciting. What if the game took place on an aircraft, or in a castle? That may sound strange but how many people learn to say lifejacket or moat when studying a language? I'm not saying it isn't practical to start in a house as that is more useful, I'm just saying if someone is really trying, chances are they will have learnt those words elsewhere. This could be a great way to learn less familiar vocab with new environments as DLC. They wouldn't even need to be big, think of the possibilities involved in naming all of the parts of a car, for example.\nThere also need to be more minigames to memorize new words, in my opinion. The my Spanish coach DS game had good ideas here that the developer could ape perhaps.\nBottom line, great idea with good potential but not quite there yet.","November 9, 2014","false","0.3"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

I've been learning German with Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and German television shows for a few months, but wanted something that I could sit down and play when I want to change up my learning style.\n\nThis game should not be purchased if you want to learn grammar or phrases.  In the German version you learn mostly vocabulary words (I say mostly because I still haven't found every word, and who knows... maybe there's something else out there).\n\nNow, one of the most important things for learning words in a foreign language is having a memory to place with the word.  A game like this provides this SIGNIFICANTLY better than a memory based card game.  Why?  Because you're remembering a word based on not only its graphic visualisation, but you're remembering it within the context of the home.  In this game, if you have to find the "pfeffer", you not only have to remember the word for pepper, but WHERE the pepper is.  It's helped me remember words extremely easily.\n\nDon't buy this as your primary way to learn a language.  Buy it as a way to help you build vocabulary alongside a few other language learning classes or programs.  That's what I bought it for, and that's what it does best.\n\nIf duolingo ever releases bulgarian, I'll definitely be picking up another version of this game.

But since I have to choose, I'll choose "no'.\n\nI got so excited to see a sleek-looking language game on sale that I proceeded to purchase it without looking more closely at the reviews. Being somewhat of a language nerd, I must say I was disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, the title, with its cute and clever pun, is pretty much misleading. This is just a (limited) vocabulary game. Nothing "fluent" about learning a language here.\n\nThis game's approach to learning a foreign language comes down to pointing at objects and listening to how they are called. Then you can play some games, such as looking for specific objects around the apartment as fast as you can. It seems like most of the effort was put into the graphics and other aspects of the gameplay. There is no method or theory behind the language learning. Did they do the game in collaboration with a specialist? I highly doubt so. I know this game was Kickstarted, but it's wrong to make a language game if you're only a game developer and then hint at "fluency" when you try to come up with the title. Learning a language is a process which requires the application of various methods, some of which the developers should have explored, in my opinion. For all I care, the game could be 2D and less shiny and pretty, but with more meaningful and diverse activities.\n\nYes, this game has its good sides, it looks pretty and it teaches you words in a logical context. It can help you expand your vocabulary a little. But that's it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/274980/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1455 products in account","Influent is sold as a “Language Learning Game” focusing on vocabulary and and pronunciation. I was the lucky winner of the Japanese pack and I’ve played around with it for quite a while, so let’s explore it a little, shall we?\n\nI already had (a very low) background in learning Japanese when I got this game, so my experiences may vary from someone who has never touched the language before.\n\nBelieve it or not, Influent has a sort of ‘story’ behind it. It’s not overly… special, but a story is something you don’t necessarily expect in something like a Language Learning software - game or not.\nIn Influent you take the role of Andrew Cross. He’s spent three years developing a device that would allow people to interact with their surroundings by providing them the item’s names in different languages. However, this device is stolen and sold under the thieves’ branding, and so Andrew’s response to this was to improve on the device and launch a campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to prove how evil those thieves are.\n\nJust how precisely that works, I have no idea. The story makes no sense, hence it gets a low rating, however, the fact that they even thought as far as to give it a bit of a backstory besides “randomly get words in another language” deserves cookie points in my book.\n\nThe graphics aren’t out of this world, but I think they’re sufficiently good in their cartoonish way, and fit the quirky story of the game. I actually really like the art and the style of it. It’s simple, it does the job, and, more importantly, it makes it more approachable as you don’t need a super computer to run it.\n\nThat said, I don’t feel this is neither a language learning software, nor all it could be. Don’t get me wrong, I do love this game, but it lacks something. Before I get into that, though, let’s get on with the more technical aspects:\n\nYou can play this in first or third person. All of the game (so far) happens inside Andrew’s apartment, so it’s a tad limited in that sense, however, there is good depth of detail on the words you can learn; for instance, you can point at the door to get that word in Japanese, but if you point at the door frame, you will actually get “door frame” and not just “door”. You can open things (drawers, closets and cabinets, fridge, etc) and look at the things inside.\n\nBasically, you move around the house and press a button to have the name of the item you’re looking (pointing with the mouse) at appear in the target language. The user interface is already available in various languages, and there are several target language DLCs you can choose from, in my case, since it was Japanese, you got all the necessary information: romaji, kana and kanji (along with pronunciation). You can select which of all this to see, you can see alternate words for the item, you can choose to add it to lists, and as you progress through your lists achievements you will be able to unlock more things: you start with simple words for objects, then you move on to adjectives and the like.\n\nYou have various lists, all of 10 items, which you can then test yourself on. When you play this mini-game, you will be given or told a word, and you will have to find the item and press a button again to mark it. Depending on how fast you are, you might even earn stars. Complete enough lists or achieve a certain speed and you will start ticking off achievements in the game. It also has small goals with their corresponding achievements.\n\nNow, here we reach part 1 of what bothers me: This isn’t really so much a Language Learning game as just a tool to aid in Language Learning. There is a difference, as with a language learning programs you can expect to get some basic structure so that you can start speaking with, at the very least, short, broken sentences; Influent, however, only gives you words. There are no connectors, no real actions (even in you have some verbs), and no further information on how to put a sentence together. That’s fine, but it’s what makes it only an aid tool. It’s basically just an interactive flashcard system and a great help to expand on your basic and not so basic everyday vocabulary, but it’s not the only tool you’ll need if you actually want to learn the language.\nIt can, however, also be used as a starting point to gain some vocabulary before you go into basic sentences.\n\nThe second thing that… not so much bothers me, but just disappoints me, is how limited it is. Since everything happens within his house, then that is all you get to learn about. I would really, truly adore to see the game be expanded on (as default, and not as DLCs!) by include the outside world. The idea of being able to take my character out into the world and see the items at a park, or buildings, or houses, enter a shop and see what they sell… it could be so much more, and it feels like the game doesn’t reach its full potential. I feel like they could even include very basic dialogue with NPCs (for instance, talking to a neighbor and saying “Nice weather” or entering a shop, picking an item, and being able to choose between “how much is this” and “I’ll take 5 of this”). So at the end of the day, it feels rather bland.\n\nThe game controls aren’t too difficult, but they aren’t overly comfortable either. The replayability is both high and non-existent depending on your level with the target language. it’s high while you’re learning and reinforcing the basics, but once you’re past the basic household items level, you really have nothing else to do with the game other than an occasional revision.\n\nAll in all, Influent is a very nice tool to help with your language learning, and I would highly recommend it as that, but I don’t think I would recommend it if you’ve never touched the language before OR are way past beginner level.","July 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

An Interesting Edutainment Idea, But Not Fleshed Out Enough.Genre: 1st/3rd Person Language Teaching Edutainment Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Rob Howland & Three Flip Studios\nPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and Linux\nBusiness Model: Multiple DLCs that unlock their respective language. Player only needs to buy the languages they want. The rest can be ignored.\nA Press Key Was Provided Free of Charge Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nInfluent is an edutainment title where it’s trying to expand your vocabulary of a particular language. It attempts to accomplish this by giving you 420 words to learn through visual learning, memorization and matching words with the right objects in time attack quizzes. In my case, I mostly focused on the Spanish & English Languages while poking in the other languages to hear what they sounded like. The only story in this game is the opening cutscene with some guy rambling on about his not-Kickstarter project for an object called the SanjigenJiten. A device that can apparently translate the name of any every-day object into the desired language. It’s a cute cutscene but it’s completely unnecessary due to the complete lack of story after it.\n\nThe general mechanic of the game is that you click on objects to hear the name spoken out loud and displayed on the screen. You then save ten objects to a list which is then used for a time-attack quiz. The time attack quiz has you matching the spoken/displayed word to the correct object as quickly as you can. Do it correctly three times and you’ll have “mastered” the word according to Influent. There’s also a “fly-by” mode where you do the same name-to-object matching except you fly around in a small toy plane that can shoot lasers. This is my big problem point with Influent.\n\nFor a visual learner like myself, a game like Influent would be a godsend if I were to learn a new language. Having the ability to see an item, put a word to it in a foreign language and practice that multiple times sounds like a good idea. But even as I sit here, I’m having trouble remembering any of the words I so-called “mastered” in Influent. There’s a lot of visual showing but there’s not a lot of educational mechanics to make it stick. I think even going so far as to add descriptions to items or using them in a sentence would have be a good idea. But the game just doesn’t really explore educating through experience or through interaction with the objects. There isn’t even other types of quizzes or mini-games to break up the experience either. It’s monotonous and I really don’t think it should be. The fly-by mode only exacerbates the other problem this game has: it’s too crowded in this small apartment. Flying around should be fun but it’s far too easy to run into the wall while you’re trying to shoot at the “target”. It also points out just how small this world is that you can look around. You can’t go or even see outside. I think that’s where they should have focused on, if they didn’t want to come up with new teaching mechanics, is expanding the world so you can walk around more. Instead, you’re restricted to a small apartment with a bedroom, living room, bathroom and kitchen. It’s a bit disappointing.\n\nLooking at the Business Model and Voice Quality\nInfluent’s business model is a bit weird but it breaks down to you buying the language version that you primarily want for $10 and $5 for every subsequent language. I don’t disagree with it because I don’t see a lot of people learning more than a few languages. If you can/are willing to, I think you’ll be able to pay for it. That being said, I’m not convinced that the value is there. A lot of the different voice actors sound like they’re speaking through very cheap mics, rushing their lines and/or don’t sound very uninterested in what they’re doing. I get it. Saying ~400 words just by themselves without any sentences to go along with them isn’t the most exciting prospect for a voice actor/actress. But hearing them drone on in the same monotone voice gets old after 20-30mins. It doesn’t help that the voice volume isn’t always consistent and sometimes that volume will peak.\n\nPC Settings\nThis game is lacking a lot of settings for a PC-based title. Your only options are resolution choices, windowed/fullscreen, anti-aliasing up to 8X and V-sync on/off. For some strange reason, Influent allows the framerate to go up to 300FPS and “maximum”. Not entirely sure what the benefit of that setting is (because the most that monitors can show is 144FPS) but it's there. The game’s engine also seems to detect your aspect ratio and display only the resolution options relevant to that ratio. In my case, I couldn’t see any 16:9 resolutions (I run 1680x1050p) but I checked with someone else and they were able to run the game in 16:9 options as well as 4:3. It’s odd. What you’ll notice missing as far as visuals go are shadows, texture quality and other detail sliders. You probably won’t miss them as this game isn’t that great of a looker (and I don’t think the game uses shadows much) but it’s absence is significant.\n\nOne thing I have to point out: music sliders and a mute button for the music/sound effects are missing from the options menu. Look, the music is good. I enjoy Lifeformed’s work and it fits pretty well in Influent. But considering you’re only using a few of his tracks and they repeat quite a bit, I’d like to have the ability to play something else in the background. Additionally, the UI is a mess, often being unintuitive. With elements hidden off the screen and being uncertain about what we’re supposed to be doing. The tip guide helps to a degree but it feels like some more attention should have been put here. .\n\nFinal Thoughts\nInfluent was designed to give the player an expanded vocabulary in the particular language they’re learning. It does accomplish that….to a small degree. Regardless of what language you pick, you’ll be able to pick up words for objects from this game. However, there isn’t much to this game outside of pointing at objects, having their name read to you and then having to try to memorize that name. It’s a lot of information dumping without context or reason to learn these words. Well, outside of the fact that you’re stuck in this place and you’ve got nothing better to do. For a visual learner like myself, it’s a neat idea. Really, it’s too bad that you’re stuck in such a small place. A much more open game would have been far more interesting to explore and learn the language. Admittedly, that would have also been more expensive to make.\n\nWithout a larger world, well, then I have to look at what we have and what we have here isn’t enough for me to recommend Influent. All it is, is looking around a very tiny apartment at static objects. Where all I can do is open doors and participate in two slight variations of a time-attack quiz. That isn’t enough. I definitely feel there should have been more ideas implemented. Different ways to quiz players on what they learned to make sure that the words stick in their head. Expecting a word to be “mastered” simply because I pointed my mouse cursor at it three times isn’t enough. Influent is a neat idea, but there needs to be something more underneath it than pretty graphics and a fairly one-dimensional test.\n\nRead this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","July 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Gender is VERY important to speak proper German as it modifies many other words in a sentence (mein, meine, meinen...etc.) While the game DOES give the gender via text when selecting the word, it does not speak the gender in the audio or when doing the games. I would much prefer if it included that, since the games are meant to bolster your vocabulary it should include gender in spoken audio.\n\nONLY TEACHES VOCAB: If you want a program focused on creating sentences and communicating with others, try Rosetta Stone. This is first and foremost vocab software. Go elsewhere to learn how to employ verbs correctly.\n\nGOOD VOCAB, BUT MISSING ELEMENTS: The list of vocabulary words consists of "around the house" items. While useful, it does not cover things like ordering in a restaurant, traveling, etc.\n\nA GOOD COMPONENT TO LANGUAGE LEARNING, BUT NOT A COMPLETE PROGRAM: This software is excellent and fun for learning basic vocabulary, but limited in many ways. My dream language program is similar to this in 3D/FPS style, but including many places like restaurants, train stations, work, and with NPCs whom you can interact with and "discuss" topics, such as your boss, a waitperson, a buddy at the bar ("Kneiper"), a date, a hotel staffer...sort of a Rosetta Stone meets Second Life. Literally a 3D immersion in the other culture. This is not it.\n\nThe final word,\n\nKNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO: This is a vocab program. Basic, but good, and fun to boot. But at the moment it can only be a component to a more comprehensive language program, not the foundation.\n\n(For those that know/care, I would gauge this as a level A1 program under the Common European Framework.)","March 22, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But if you know how to conjugate a verb and what articles to use for which nouns, then it's a pretty o.k. tool for an incredibly limited amount of words.

What people need to understand is that there is no magic, effortless, lazy-oriented utility to help you learn all of a language. Language is very complicated and if you want to thoroughly learn one you need to put in a lot of effort to memorize and pound grammar (that is sometimes completely illogical at that) into your head. I really don't understand the notion from people that this game isn't worth it just because it only teaches vocabulary. Do they know that is the hardest part of a language? Vocabulary is endless hours of memorization and usage.\nWith that being said, I will say that if you are actually trying to learn the language and not just doing this for fun or because you like memorization games (kinda like me, mainly why I'm learning a new language) this game is best used in conjunction with some self study of the grammar or a class to learn the grammar and boulster your confidence in the language. This game will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your usage of the language because vocabulary is key to being able to express yourself. Grammar is important, but if you use the wrong conjugation or maybe even tense because you are not quite fine tuned with the grammar most native speakers will still be able to understand you.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is one of my favorite. There is so many languages you can learn. If you like memorization as much as I do (ALOT), like learning languages, and enjoy simple games, this is the game for you. I think this game is one of the best I have ever played. I just bought it last night and already finished Russian, gonna practice some more and then move to German or Chinese.","November 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It gives you pinyin, 簡體 (简体 - simplified)，and 繁體 (traditional) readings.  The speaker is NOT from Beijing (for once, a learning tool for Westerners without the Beijing dialect!).  He has some sort of dialect but I can't pinpoint where.  It pretty much does as advertised -- gives you words in 3 different writing systems and has a (male) native speaker say the words.  It doesn't give measure words, which I think is sorely, sorely, sorely needed, even if they aren't voiced (like German).  Definitely worth the $5 (DLC Price).\n\nKorean -\nAgain a good tool.  You have a choice between Romaja and Hangeul.  But WAY too many loan words.  Overall, though, a great tool.  Especially with a language like Korean, where pronunciation is very difficult for an English speaker.  As a non-tonal language, it truly is just difficult pronunciation, and not tones (like Chinese) that gets us.  Plus, it's great practice with the alphabet seeing the writing and being able to look at the Romaja and listen to a speaker.  Female-voiced. Worth the $5 (DLC Price).\n\nGerman -\nOkay tool.  Very few loan words.  Some are blatantly just.... wrong... It does give item genders, but does not voice them.  They seriously need to be voiced.  It's actually rather annoying.

If they could make this game about maybe not just in a apartment, maybe add more variety, like an office, or maybe some mall or park or something with NPCs that are dressed up like workers would be really nice to see. Maybe in the future though.","March 21, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You may also remember the scores of educational video games designed to teach spelling, math, history, and/or hygene; most not particularly fun or memorable.\nInfluent is the bad-♥♥♥ nephew of the old educational games that used to put us to sleep in 4th grade. The gameplay is super-straightforward, click your way around a five room apartment and click on objects to hear the names pronounced in a different language than you are used to. After a while of doing this, you'll assemble a vocabulary list, and you can set yourself up to go back through the apartment and match the words with the objects.\nSomething important to understand going in; Influent is not actually a *language* tutor, tt's a vocabulary tutor. It does teach parts of speech, offer synonyms, pronounce words, and if the language in question has multiple alphabets, it can be toggled between them. You'll be able to associate the words with a picture, and since the apartment is pretty well organized (No spare set of sneakers in the fridge,) you'll be able to form easier or harder vocab lists by choosing from different kinds of items. (A very easy one might include only items in the bathroom, while a hard one will have you running all over the apartment.)\nInfluent won't actually teach sentence structure, detail word usage, or explain phrasing. As such, this is probably best used with a language that you speak a little of, but need to improve fluency with. (As opposed one you don't know anything about at all.)\nIt's sort of like video flash cards on horse steroids, and as far as that goes, it accomplishes it pretty damn well.","March 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As said in other reviews, this is basically an interactive flashcard program. Everything is very high-quality, but it needs more substance. Had I checked the reviews, I would gladly have paid $5 for this someday.\n\nIt's very well-made, and a lot of work must have gone towards acquiring the very good audio samples (I tried it in Russian). The developer has replied to some of the more popular (and angsty) reviews, but I hope he/she can respond to the more constructive ones as well. One assumes when looking at a "language game" that it will help build their language skills, rather than just vocabulary. I don't think there's very much demand for that, however.\n\nI sincerely hope they can rework this game to be more about building functionality for players, allowing them gain at least a basic sense of sentence structure and grammar so that they can put these words to use. I had hoped to find something more along the lines of a gameified Rosetta Stone. As a former ESL teacher, I had hoped that someone did what I would like to do some day--find a way to teach foreign languages in a gaming setting. These guys have taken a great first step, but all I can do is find myself hoping for something more.\n\nI realize that restructuring this game to be a more comprehensive language tool would mean a *LOT* of work. For a game that did what most negative reviewers (and I) hoped, I would happily pay more like $20-$30. Currently toying with the idea of asking for a refund, but I may let them keep my $10 unhindered in the hope that the game will see radical updates someday.","March 30","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even then, most of the shortcomings are pretty small and menial. As in, the controls (keyboard and mouse) are a bit clunky and floaty; I found myself misclicking a lot when I first started. There are really only two or so songs in the entire game, while they are pretty catchy it does get a bit annoying. Lastly, there isn't that much in the game; while it seems large to begin with only having 420 words is sorta small and with no expansions (yet?)

BE WARNED you will NOT learn how to speak fluently from this game! That said, I absolutely love every aspect of this. This is as close to immersion as you can get, in terms of objects, without having to travel. The music is nice, the enviorment is nice, the game runs smoothly, there isn't much to critize this about. Even then, most of the shortcomings are pretty small and menial. As in, the controls (keyboard and mouse) are a bit clunky and floaty; I found myself misclicking a lot when I first started. There are really only two or so songs in the entire game, while they are pretty catchy it does get a bit annoying. Lastly, there isn't that much in the game; while it seems large to begin with only having 420 words is sorta small and with no expansions (yet?) I will probably find myself without any new conent in the future. Now for my absolute FAVORITE part, THE. GODDAM. FLYBY MODE. It is absolute GENIUS, it is very fun and  controls exceptionally well. I LOVE flying through the apartement shooting the objects, so good!\n\nFinal word: Is it worth the 10 dollars? ABSOLUTELY, even more so if you can get it on sale!

You wander around a house looking at objects, and the game tells you how to pronounce them in your language of choice.  Then later you're asked to find the object of the given name.  It's just flash-cards disguised as a 3D application, which makes it much more tedious since you have to rummage through a messy house trying to figure out where you saw that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wristwatch.\n\nSo though I really *really* wanted to like this game, I have to give it a thumbs-down.

Although it can’t teach an entire language, it does allow the opportunity to pick up a few words from any of the available languages.\n\nI selected Japanese upon opening the game, as I’m interested in learning the language, and I can say, I had a great time with the game. Don’t expect to learn the language from the game, but instead, a couple hundred words and their pronunciations (given time). And yes, I’m still terrible at pronouncing Japanese words, even with this game as a guide.\n\nBasically, you’re placed into an apartment with various objects scattered around. You can click on anything, anything, and the word for said object will be displayed and pronounced for you. It’s a pretty cool experience, being able to click on the obscurest of objects (try “ketchup”).\n\nThere’s also a few minigames to aid in the memorization of sets of words. After hearing a word, you have the opportunity to add it to a personal dictionary of sorts, which can then be used to initiate minigames. One of these games being a “time attack”-ish mode, in which you’re tasked with finding and clicking on objects in sets of ten from your personal dictionary.\n\nOverall, Influent is a solid, educational game. It does a great job of teaching some basic words from whatever language is selected and has some pretty nifty minigames.","May 12, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I should also note that I purchased the German version of Influent, so my review is based entirely on that.\n\nEffectiveness\nPros  Handles nouns well\nInteractivity\nCons  Handles neither adjectives nor verbs well\nControls can be clunky and fustrating\nManaging vocab lists can be time consuming\nHandles articles and gender very poorly.\nDoes not provide plural version of nouns\nThe thing that separates Influent from other language learning tools is its interactivity. Being able to walk around a virtual room and interact with the environment is a major perk, especially for more "hands on" learners. Unfortunately, the controls can be very clunky at times; this, however, is not game breaking and its something that the player can get used to after awhile. The fly-by mode that gets activated later in the game is funny at first, but it gets old fast and thankfully is something that isn't a necessary part of gameplay.\n\nBesides the interactivity, the other major gameplay feature in Influent is the vocabularly lists. As words are acquired through interacting with the environment, they are added to a word bank and vocabularly lists are automatically formed based on the order in which the words were originally acquired. The words can be rearranged in the word bank to create custom lists, but this is an arduous process: You have to manually click and drag each word, which can be fustrating when sorting through a large word bank.\n\nAfter compiling vocabularly lists, the player can test themselves with a time attack mode. The problem is that the player can only do ten words at a time. A random mode can also be selected, where a random vocabularly list is selected for time attack mode. This gameplay feature is sorely limited by the fact that the random mode randomizes vocabularly lists, rather than creating new lists by randomizing words. This means that the arduous process of creating vocabularly lists is largely unavoidable, because the player will get very little out of Influent unless they take the time to organize the word bank.\n\nInfluent handles nouns well, and it also includes the article for each noun (der, die, das); Influent, however, only plays an audio recording for the noun and not for the article. When learning German, it's vital to learn the article with the word, because the article is crucial for sentence structure, grammar, and meaning. Learning the word without the article places the learner at a significant disadvantage. This is why the importance of placing emphasis on the article cannot be understated. Influent does a disservice to those learning German by not playing a recording of the article along with the word.\n\nInfluent handles adjectives and verbs so poorly that it'd be better off not including them at all. The first problem is that these words are acquired by clicking on nouns in the word bank, which can be a huge pain; furthermore, acquiring them through the word bank robs the player of the ability to acquire them through interaction with the environment, which is the selling point for Influent. A translation for adjectives and verbs is not provided to the player until they pop up during time attack mode, which is extremely fustrating.\n\nMore importantly, in German the adjectives and verbs change based on the article and on the context, but there is no indication of this in the game. I'll use an example here to illustrate the problem. One verb that pops up in the word bank is ignorieren," which is the verb "to ignore." During time attack mode, the player will need to click on a newspaper when this verb pops up. When clicking on the newspaper, it'll say that it's correct and then it will provide the following translation: Ignore(The Newspaper). Likewise, it will do the same with verbs. For example: Neu, which is "new" will pop up in the translator as "new(Newspaper)." The problem is that these word change based on the article! This game would give one the impression that it's correct to say, "Ich ignorieren die neu Zeitung," when it's actually, "Ich ignoriere die neue Zeitung."\n\nInfluent is ineffective as a vocabularly acquistion tool, because it can potentially mislead learners. The interactivity piece is all Influent has going for it, but this piece has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the before mentioned problems reduce Influent to the status of being a language learning supplement to other language learning tools that do a better job at teaching vocabularly. Influent simply fails at what it sets out to do.\n\nThe Price\nThe question is whether or not Influent is worth $10. I'd say that $5 would be more reasonable, because of all the before mentioned problems. The current price tag isn't too bad though, especially when one considers the cost of other language learning materials. When buying Influent you're really just paying for the interactivity, because there are other language programs out there that blow Influent out of the water as vocabularly acquistion tools.\n\nVerdict\nI do not recommend Influent at the current price. I think that Influent would benefit more if the creator focused on increasing the quality of each language, rather than on providing more languages. If Influent is on sale, however, it may be worth buying (especially if it's in the $3-5 range).","February 21","false","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The diversity of the vocabulary is really nice, and on a lot of words there are bonus words to unlock which are usually verbs or adjectives associated with those words.

It's gameplay is a bit.... lacking, but it has some really good achievements. It has very humourous parts to it, as well as it's storyline.\n\nThere are few language learning games on Steam, and to be fair, this isn't really much of a 'language learning' game, sure it's a good aid for learning language, but it doesn't ahve anything to do with grammar or phrases, more of a vocabulary game. Don't get this game if you expect it to teach you an entire language, to learn a language, it's best to have many different sources, and this is a very useful source, although it is nothing on it's own. If you have started learning a language and need help with vocabulary, it's good for you, or even if you have not learnt a spot of the language, it's an okay starting point, to help you get used to the language.\n\nThe gameplay in this is limited, as you are locked in a house, and cannot escape. This is kind of a 'bottle episode' in that respect. You can go into first person and third person, you cannot jump, and you can open doors with the right mouse button (although the only door you can't open is the front door, believe me, I have tried), as well as being able to interact with other things. Being locked inside your house, with no indication of the passing of time, and with the only dislogue being you saying the names of objects to yourself, it makes it a pretty surreal game to play. You have to walk around and collect nouns, adjectives and verbs of your choosen language. There are quite a few words to collect, and it's half impossible to get them all, as there will always be something you miss. There are some pretty good achievements for this game as well, which is great incentive to learn more words. When you collect ten words you can do a quick quiz, where you can walk around while a word is on screen, and you need to find it in the room.\n\nThe story of this excuses it to not teaching you about grammar or phrases. It is about a guy who made a device that tells you what an object's name is in another language, but the idea is pirated and patented by someone else, and you need to prove that you made the device, and only you know how the device works, so if you can collect 400 words and master them, then you can prove that you made the device. I don't know if anything happens after you collect all the words, as I have one word left, and I cannot find it, but I expect that it has a funny ending, either that or nothing happens, wither way, it's worth it.\n\nIf you are learning a language or not I'd recommend this game, as it is a useful resource for learning a language, but it's also good if you're not learning one, as it never hurts to know more about other languages, it doesn't hurt to know other words for things in other languages. If you are learning a language I'd suggest you use other sites as well, such as  Duolingo [www.duolingo.com] ,  Memrise [www.memrise.com] or  Babbel	[www.babbel.com] , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game. This games helps very much to give you a visual, an audio and a written of the words.","February 24","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/recommended/274980/","Maddyline","Combined Syndicates of America","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/","112 products in account","Influent is a simple application for learning household vocabulary for the languages it sports, there are many languages available, such as Korean, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Norwegian, Finnish, Latin, and so on. The game sees you take control of Andrew Cross, an inventor who, after getting his invented handheld language device's prototype stolen, decides to prove it was his all along by learning 100 words from a foreign language. In the game, you play as Cross and learn common household words using the device in the languages provided as DLC. That's Influent, and while there are more than 100 words in each of the languages, there's a few things you should know.\n\n1:\n\nThis isn't Duolingo or Memrise, this isn't a full language-learning application as much as it is a vocabulary aid, you aren't going to learn grammar in this game, so don't buy, say, the Bulgarian language pack and expect to be be able to get into intense ideological debates in Burgas come the next week or month, Influent serves to normalize household worlds to people already learning the language. For example, I'm taking a Latin class outside of my using of Influent to help me with my Latin, Influent doesn't teach grammar, it helps teach and normalize common household objects and on occasion those objects' adjectives depending on the object, getting you to more easily learn vocabulary.\n\nAnd 2:\n\nThe in-game user interface is only available in English, Japanese, Russian, German, Swedish, French, Spanish, Italian, European Portuguese, and Brazilian Portuguese. What this means is if you speak, say, French, there will be an option for you in any of the language packs to boot up and play the game in French, even if you're planning to learn Latin or Korean. You'll learn the languages but the in-game interface (mostly text and menus) will be in French, save of course for the languages you're planning on sharpening up on.\n\n\n\nNow that those three points are out of the way, I'll go deeper into the review.\n\n\nSo Influent is, as described above, a language application/game to help you with household vocab for a foreign language, literally, as the game takes place in Cross' apartment, complete with hundreds of objects and their names to learn. The game can be played in first or third person, the former locking the mouse to the reticule. You go around Cross' apartment collecting words to be put on a future vocab test, tests you get every 10 new objects/objects' adjectives or otherwise you find, the tests will then see you moving around the apartment to find the objects as the game tells you their names in the language you're learning, with a total score out of ten at the end. If you get a word wrong, the game tells you the correct answer and you have to take the test again in order to have incorrect words "mastered",\n"mastered" words being words that you don't have difficulty remembering anymore, and the game's algorithm for determining if you truly know the word isn't butchered or half-♥♥♥♥♥, it serves as a great language learning vocab app and does its job damn well. The game isn't limited to objects lying around the main space of Cross' room, either, the map, although small, can mostly entirely be interacted with, you can open doors, closets, your fridge, and select objects in the rooms, closets, and your fridge to be on the next vocab test, from milk in Cross' fridge to the conditioner in his shower.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. It's a great language aid and a great tool to help learn basic vocabulary for a foreign language, it does its job amazingly and smoothly, and is overall a great application for foreign language vocab.","October 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

I was playing for only about an hour and I could already walk around the apartment and 100% a time attack challenge for my first vocab list in Swedish. However it's not going to teach you a language. It doesn't teach you sentence structure or grammar, it doesn't explain inflections or even usage in a pre-built sentence.\n\nThis game is purely a game of memory. See an item, learn the word for that item, with no additional context. It would be excellent for a person trying to sharpen up their vocabulary recollection on a language they're already at least partially familiar with, but as a tool for teaching you a whole new language it's absolutely not an option.\n\nClearly a lot of hard work has gone into this game and hopefully it continues to receive updates to make it more useful, broaden the scope of its teaching and address some issues with spelling in some of the other language packs. For now I think I need to go and find an actual teacher to learn this new language and at best I'll use this to help me along the way once I've already grasped the basics.","June 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'm a few hours into two languages with which I'm pretty familiar, for context.  It's essentially a creative and fun way to practice vocabulary.  If you're a beginner, or want to brush up on your household vocab this is great, but don't expect more than that.  The aesthetic is great, the music is nice, the controls are mostly good.  The "fly-by" mode could be a bit easier to control.  I find myself spending more energy trying to control the plane than remembering the words, but then if you don't want that the regular time-attack mode suffices.  I have found a number of places where the controls give me trouble clicking on smaller objects (ie: answer is "wrench" but I fail time after time because the mouse selects the toolbox instead)\n\nOn the language side of things, this game is wonderful.  The fact that it keeps the lists, keeps track of your answers, and has a randomize function is amazing.  Additionally, it does non-roman scripts very well.  Japanese is presented in 3 options (Kanji, Kana, or Romaji) and there are multiple options for Chinese and Russian as well for those starting off on vocabulary, but who haven't mastered the related scripts quite yet.  I'm 50/50 on the issue of articles.  The game DOES have them.  When you select a word and bring up its details the gender is listed underneath the word.  But those pronouns (el/la, der/die/das, etc...) are not in the spoken notes, so you have to remind yourself of them on your own.  (ie: the audio is "Computer", but the text is "Computer - [Masc]").  Those spoken demonstrations of vocabulary have been in my experience mostly good, but ocassionally not of the best quality.\n\nAll in all, well done.  I hope this game develops further in the future.  That front door is just begging for me to master x number of words and be allowed through it and out into the big wide world full of fun vocab to practice.","March 30, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OPLoner/recommended/274980/","OPLoner","GGLoner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OPLoner/","1047 products in account","Within the first hour or so of gameplay, you will likely have found out everything there is to do in the game (with the exception of perhaps finding all 420 words). The question I guess is "Is it worth it?"\n\nI bought the Japanese DLC as I wanted another resource/option when it came to learning the language and had NO EXPECTATIONS apart from obviously being able to learn something.\n\nSUMMARIZING THE EXPERIENCE : It is an interactive way of learning basic words ( Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives ) and perhaps that is what it is meant for - Learning SOME basic words.\n\nSpoiler below contains elaboration\n\nAs many others have and will point out - The game (as both a game and/or interactive learning/educational software) is very stale in its options. The entire game revolves around memorizing 10 words (either random or your selection) at a time and contains 2 modes of doing so - Either walk around and click on objects to learn how to say them in the language you wish to study or do so while piloting a toy plane (as shown in the trailer).\n\n\nThe game is also extremely simple to the point where certain parts are confusing and others quite redundant :\n\nFor example, having two ways of saying 'Book' - ほん (hon) and しょせき (shoseki) where after googling, according to wiki "The former term only indicates bound books, and does not include scrolls. The latter is used for printed matter only. The most general term is 書物 (shomotsu), which means all written or printed matter that has been collected into a single unit, regardless of construction." Whereas the game only says [This] & [That] = Book.\n\nAnother example is when clicking on a 'Door' and going to 'Verb', it tells me しめる (shimeru) and ひらく (hiraku) means 'Open' (as in to open the door) when the first actually means 'to close/shut'.\n\n\nAt the end of the day however, do I recommend this game for $10 USD (or the price according to region) for what it offers?\n\n...If you asked me that in a nutshell, I would say No because to any beginner trying to learn a language, chances are it might do more harm than good. ( Yes, you learn words but having googled to confirm the definitions I am skeptical as to what I learn is indeed what is translated in-game. )\n\n\nHowever if given the chance to elaborate and tell people "Look, this is what you're going to get and a lot of things require confirmation on the internet." then yes. Mainly because, this is another resource that can interest and provocate people to stop procrastinating and start learning a language (although it definitely can be improved in many ways). For me, that is good enough because I know motivation and determination are one of the hardest things to muster.\n\nMaybe people were looking for something better but thinking about it, how one would go about explaining all the parts of the language from sentence structure to specifics on the language (in a game) might make it too complex for a beginner and confuse them even further.","April 1, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is a bit of a misnomer; it is not a language-learning game but a vocabulary-learning game. In that respect it's a great tool to supplement actual language learning. In fact it goes really well with Duolingo, which is much stronger on grammar but weak on a lot of very basic, everyday vocabulary that is present here. It's also a little bit less of a game than a gamified study tool, because how well you do really depends on how much you put into it. If you just fly through the time attacks and gather up words, your retention won't be that good. If you have the patience to limit yourself to, say, 20 words per session, 10 nouns and 10 verbs/adjectives, and replay the Time Attacks with various options on and off, it's a great way to learn the vocabulary in a visual context.","June 24, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was playing for only about an hour and I could already walk around the apartment and 100% a time attack challenge for my first vocab list in Swedish. However it's not going to teach you a language. It doesn't teach you sentence structure or grammar, it doesn't explain inflections or even usage in a pre-built sentence.\n\nThis game is purely a game of memory. See an item, learn the word for that item, with no additional context. It would be excellent for a person trying to sharpen up their vocabulary recollection on a language they're already at least partially familiar with, but as a tool for teaching you a whole new language it's absolutely not an option.\n\nClearly a lot of hard work has gone into this game and hopefully it continues to receive updates to make it more useful, broaden the scope of its teaching and address some issues with spelling in some of the other language packs.

For the great, low price of about $10 you can start a really fun way of learning a language. If you decide you want to try to learn these same words in other languages, then the DLC option is an inexpensive and incredibly affordable way of learning.\nThe retail price point on this software (currently $10 for a base language and $5 or less for another language) is very fair for what it is and does. I hope the developer expands the four room "house" to include some outdoor items one day, but that is a large venture when they plan to support so many languages.\n\nCONS: The words have only one speed of pronunciation, and sometimes the recorded audio has some volume problems that is not baseline with the rest of the audio files. Also, there are a lot of other "common life" items that could/should have been included; for example, instead of a just a "photo", the creator could have had a photo, and next to that a "family photo" with a "man"/"father", "woman"/"mother"...etc.\n\nOverall, I'd really recommend the software if you are looking to dive in and gain some rot memorization skills in a language. Don't expect to read, write, or speak a sentence with this, and you will be happy with the gameplay and results of you learning some new words in another language.","March 23, 2014","true","1.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Check it out if you’d rather hear this review than read it!\nFormal Review:\nInfluent is an original, language-learning, interactive game. With the ability to learn words at your own leisure, mix and match words to create your OWN vocab quiz, and a large selection of words to get to know as if they were your native language makes this game outstanding. "Influent was originally developed as part of a research project at the Entertainment Computing Laboratory at the University of Tsukuba in Japan ... Influent successfully passed Steam Greenlight in January 2014, following the full release on March 20, 2014 on the Steam Store and Humble Store." The fact that this game has not been released a full year is surprising, yet evident. With a full release, many updates would have been made if there weren’t financial issues. With $28,086 out of the pledged $12,000 goal set on Kickstarter, $2000 was appointed to a Unity Pro license, and $500 for the shipping, shirts, and other fun items for the backers; although, some of the prices were updated. These would be the $1500 plan to go mobile, the $8000 dedicated to publishing the game, and $1500 was put toward a better computer to create a game masterpiece. Two people paired together in Japan to create a Kickstarter that placed a game on the market. The game has only been updated on Steam three times since the official release. These updates included (but are not limited to) fixing minor errors such as audio pronunciations, German and French words, volume levels, Vocab list major malfunctions, and improved texture in 1.3, German Language Pack mistakes, lag, windowed mode, and text errors in 1.4, and finally text and GUI element errors in 1.5. These updates do not include the rush to add more languages - currently there are 12 Language Packs for sale.\nPersonal Review:\nThe love I feel for this game in the past week is exceptionally strong. Personally, I have trouble remembering things such as object names, and to be able to run through a list as many times as I need is blissful. The idea of circling around your character’s apartment-like home and collecting the names of items that may include synonyms, verbs, and adjectives is clever and just what I’ve been looking for in my life. Influent plus a little more studying on articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and other grammar mechanics of the desired language for (at least) $10 versus $500 for a normally-priced Rosetta Stone Software for 5 users… I think Influent wins. Regarding the accuracy of the languages, I have yet to test it out against my German or Russian or Korean friends (no offence to any translator but it’s a necessity). Last but not least, graphics. I’m a graphics junkie, but the fact that this game is so simple-themed revert the player’s mind to focus on the learning, not the mechanics, graphics, or errors of the game.\nNote to the Creator:\nI understand that it’s been less than a year and there’s still a lot of progress to be made, but I would like to offer some ideas. There could be a separate “scene” or “level” the character could play on. Once the player succeeds in mastering the 420 words of the apartment home, there could be another level, as in a park setting, a city setting, or an office/school setting. These levels could even be more of mini-maps if necessary! At the end of each level, the player must pass “The Official Vocab Test” in order to proceed. Once all stages are complete, there could be a lesson on grammar mechanics, sentence parts, conjunctions, and spelling. Have you thought of introducing this to schools? Middle school/junior high foreign language classes would be absolutely thrilled to find a class assistant like this. That brings me back to “Leveling Up”. In a regular foreign language class, a student must first learn the basics – objects, which is majority of what Influent provides. The next step in class is verbs and adjectives – many of which are provided by Influent. The typical class ends with articles and phrases – this is where Influent is lacking. That’s why I think it would be best for middle school/junior high students. If there was a difficulty setting in the game, I would recommend it to high school students, but the game in its current state is too young, too simple, and lacking content. I think the age suggestion would be 10-15 years old. There is a lot of potential in this game and I don’t want to see it fail. I can’t really back this game financially, but I can certainly back it by suggesting it to many teachers and friends.\nThank you so much for reading this – if you did – and let's watch this game grow into something bigger!\n","October 16, 2014","true","14.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Although learning 420 common words used within a home (more specifically an apartment in which you are locked inside), this game fails to teach how to connect the words into sentences, how to conjugate and literally locks you inside  one room to have you learn only nouns, Verbs and Adjectives. This game is great for High School students for about a quarter of a Semester: when they are just learning the words.  Adding an Air plane to help you explode into the objects in the room sure does bring a twist to the game though, as it is the only feature that brings action in the game. If Developers were to open this game up to the Steam Community for Map ideas, I am positive that the community would help in making sure the learning experience is not in the small space that it currently is in. Researching and adding new languages is great, only that with each new language the players has to go through the same monotonous room to find 420 words. As unique as it is, the game needs more originality, some action to keep the players interested in the game while teaching languages /fluently/. The idea of such a game is amazing, but it just needs more work before it could reach the full potential.","February 14, 2015","false","6.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","4"

I've tried various programs and sites in the past, but they either didn't have the option for Finnish or they just didn't help me progress at my speed. I'm really happy that I found this game, even things like reading signs or labels in shops when I visit Finland has been so much easier. (So far I've 310 words in!)\n\nTo give you a general idea of the game: you play as a guy who walks around his apartment and he introduces you to items in the language you're learning. You hit the spacebar to remember the word, and every ten words you get a little quiz where the word appears on screen and you find it. It's very much a game which goes at your pace: you select the words and you decide when to test yourself. There's no grammar, just nouns, adjectives and verbs to help you first get to grips with the language.\n\nThe quiz can also be tailored to fit you. Something which I found out about myself when I was playing this was how often I relied on seeing the word for the item that I needed to find. So, I decided to change that and see if I can do it without any visual help, and just by hearing the words. That much harder to do and the options for the quizzes really help you become familiar with the language. Once you're familiar with a word, you receive a gold star next to it. If you're struggling with a specific item, the game will make a mark next to it, informing you that it's one that you may need to revise.\n\nI've also bought this game, as well as the English and German language packs, for my friend's kid as she's learning those in school.\n\nI would love to see the developers expand further with the game, perhaps having the character walk around an office, or a shop. That would be really useful!","December 28, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Don't get it if you are expecting to learn how to speak a language, this is mainly a tool to help build your vocabulary. In no way does this teach you any grammar rules or how to put together sentences.\n\nOne thing that I did appreciate was that, (for at least the Spanish version), it gave you the option to choose a synonym for the translation of the chosen term rather than the one the game uses by default, this was helpful because certain terms I had already known by other translations.\n\nI bought the game on sale for $2, and I feel like I've got enough out of it for that price. I don't think I would have purchased it for its original price-point of $10 though.\n\nThere are alternative free options out there for learning languages, such as Duolingo. But I enjoyed the fact that this provided a 3D rendering of an apartment and had you move around finding the objects in a quiz-like manner. Actually seeing and searching for the items on a 3-dimensional plane helped me remember certain terms better than just using notecards or an alternate method.","January 12","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Got it right? in case you didn't its : Kan-el-bu-lle , sorry about that xD if you're wondering what "Kanel" means in english it's actually : Cinnamon and "Bulle" means "bun".

Anyways...moving on...i bought the Chinese version of Influent and also later bought the Norwegian language DLC because who doesn't love (some) Norwegian words that just sounds so funny like "Gulrot" which pretty similiarly in swedish translates to Morot or in english : Carrot. I bought this game because i wanted to learn chinese as my 2nd language of choice but in this game you can just learn (some) words in the available languages and not entire sentences.

It mostly makes it such a pain to play it. And there's not much more that the character itself can DO, than walking. So I would have worked more on that part.\n[ Example: when I open a lower drawer by rightclicking on it, then walk towards it, the camera automatically swings back up. Even if I hold it down with the mousecursor, that has no effect at all. It gets so annoying, like when you are looking for clues in the tiny bathroom, you want to keep your "head" faced down to look, but as soon as you move, the camera swings back up! Why?? ].\n\nWhat else is really sad, is that there's just this one playmode you can use to learn the vocabulary. You could have done so much more with this concept. Sad, because it makes the game become boring very, very quickly. Which it shouldn't.\n[ Add more minigames, more playmodes to practice whole sentences for example. ]\n\nAlso I agree with other reviewers, that adding an open world would greatly benefit the game. But that could come out as an addon anytime, so I'm fine with it for now.\n\nIn general, the game has so much unused potential.\n\nIf they worked on those things mentioned, it could become mega super awesome in the future. For now, I'll give it a 6/10 for the concept itself, the execution could have been better.","August 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I, however, purchased the Japanese version. Don't buy the Japanese version.\nHere's a simplified version of how the game works: Walk around a house and look at things. Learn how to read and speak these things. Increase your vocabulary for your language of choice. You'd be surprised just how many words you can learn by walking around an ordinary house pointing at things and saying "What's that?"\nHere's the problem though; the house is the same in each language. So when you go into the Japanese version, for instance, and see...let's say a bed, you learn that a bed is called...a bed (technically bedo) in Japanese. So essentially you're just walking around a house learning how to pronounce things you already know with kana.\nMaybe further down the line they will release some DLC that provides a more personalized environment for each language; but as it stands, this is a big problem.\nDo I recommend it? Yes....if you are studying a language without many borrowed words/cognates.

It's not full of grammar lessons or anything, but vocab. It's cool because you can discover words and memorize them by having to find them instead of typing everything out, filling in blanks, clicking a mouse. It's still clicking a mouse, but it tests your memory skill. I usually use the random vocab list option so I really have to run around. I don't really get the controls for the toy jet, but besides that, it's a cool concept. You can challenge yourself by changing the lesson settings (voice, vocab words, hints). Before this program, I used (and still use) Memrise, Duolingo, and Livemocha, but this is pretty cool compared to those less-interactive sources.\n\nOne thing though. I practiced kana way before I even knew this game existed, so it'd be a little challenging for complete beginners. I suggest using Kana Invaders (a web app similar to Galaga, but with spelling kana). Also, if you want to practice typing kana, add hiragana and katakana to your platform/device's keyboard. It sounds like a roundabout way, but I'd be lying if I encouraged others to play the Japanese version and say it's pretty easy. It wouldn't be so easy for me if I didn't know how to read it before buying it. I don't know kanji that well, which is okay because you can switch the way you can read the vocab.\n\nThe controls are a little complicated with navigation and clicking on stuff in FP, but it's fine as long as you take your time. I always play in third person to avoid giving myself a seizure from the camera sensitivity in FP.

The only other living things with him being his cat who never wakes from her slumber, and a few plants, one of which is neglected through lack of watering. A quick look at the clock in the kitchen reveals that time stands still. It becomes apparent that you're stuck in some sort of time loop, or that time has somehow frozen. The outside tempts you through pictures of the protagonist and a young woman whom I assume is his girlfriend. Various posters and books strewn around tease the existence of a world outside. Forms of communication like your computer and television do nothing. The television looping the same video over and over, the "portatil" and "ordenador" stuck on the same webpage, a phamplet pushed through a mail slot...it's all a reminder to his predicament.\n\nStuck, the young man does what any sane person would do. Learn a new language. There are 420 words to be learned, and you must help him learn them. Lindo, Techo, Muro, he learns these new words. Portatil, pelota; the man keeps going. You know its all futile in the end, but you must keep going. I'm about 100 words away from 420 (great reference there BTW), but I fear I might think "now what..." when I get there.\n\nThere's a silver lining to all this for you the player. In alternate versions, you learn new words like: "cama", "寝床", and "lit." Words you can use with the beautiful women of this world (warning: you might get slapped). That said, this is a WONDERFUL language reference in my opinion. Team it up with a good education, the "Duolingo" app, or a nice girlfriend (or bf, or both) if you're into multicultrual dating. It's a great supplement to your language learning arsenal. I try to keep my PC library efficent by getting rid of games I've finished, and files I don't need any longer. But this "game" Influent...It's going to stay on my hardrive for a loong time.\n\nMy version is Spanish, and any additional version is USD 4,99. Unless you're Jason Bourne, a linguistic professor, or a robot, I would not recommend buying more than a few in a short time span. The price tag of USD 9.99 is very well worth it IMHO.

You are placed into a room, walking around and clicking on things, 'collecting words'.  Apparently at some point they test you on these words, but they don't show you HOW to learn a word!  This game is basically a test to see if you are good enough to continue learning new words, but if you don't know how to speak the language at all, this is useless.\n\nIf I got the German or French version I would probably have a different opinion (and I might get those versions at some point because they seem more useful to me) since they use 'english/latin' characters I am familiar with.  I can see the text "der film" and figure out that it is a movie, and I can say that word and learn by saying it and memorizing it.\n\nThe Japanese version though is not for me.  I click on something and a bunch of Japanese letters pop up on the screen.  How do I read this language without any training?  I literally need to go elsewhere, learn the entire language, and then start to play Influent to learn a few extra words.  Also, they have a voice actor speak the words as I click on things.  While that may seem helpful, it isn't.  It just sounds like randomness.  However, instead of showing me that 'movie' is '映画', it should also say the english phonetically compatible version of 'Eiga', which would be infinitely more useful but still doesn't help in showing me why 'Eiga' is '映画', but it would be a good start.\n\nSo basically this software is only an accessory to someone who knows mostly everything and wants to sharpen their skills a little bit, but don't expect to learn a lot by using it.","December 13, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

Everything that can reasonably be in a flat is in it. Most of those are really everyday-vocabulary that is useful to know but you also get things like 'coat rack' which might not be something you need in your early everyday-conversations. On the other hand e.g. stuff like 'car' or most animal are missing. Still I'd say that overall the large majority is really useful vocabulary\n- if you're practising nouns it's obvious how it works: it asks for table and you click on the table but adjectives and verbs it's different: you get them via nouns that have a connection with them. A plant grows, you wash laundry etc. That can get difficult when there is more than one association you can make. A poster might be beautiful but in this game it's only associated with a painting...\n- you can either practise a list of 10 words that you made or a random list of 10 words. There is no possibility to limit this random list to just those you don't know well, yet. I know that Russian 'banan' means 'banana' by now. I don't need to go over at again and again. A possibility to stop asking for vocabulary you have already mastered would have been nice.\n\nFor me those are only minor issues and I still think it's a great vocabulary-game.","November 2, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It boasts the ability to teach up to 420 words in whichever language you choose. Yes, you could find all of the words online, but Influent has the element of interactivity. It is unbelievably convenient and useful to be able to actually see the things related to what you are learning. There is a very noticeable and evident difference between learning a word and (perhaps) seeing a picture, and learning a word in an interactive space. Seeing a word in an interactive space makes, truly, all the difference.\n\nThe downsides to the game include a limited gameplay space, and thus limited word choice. A certain 'word bias', I suppose (there is a cat, but no dog, and a cactus but no flower, for example). It would be greatly appreciated if, later on, there was some world expansion DLC that included a new place to explore --- if the developers are reading this, I'm recommending a small store or shop, that would be nice.\n\nOverall, it is certainly a good game, and it is worth CAD 10.99. I would recommend this game to people who have learned or are learning the grammar to their chosen language and who are looking to expand their vocabulary.","October 31, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

What stood out the most to me was the ability within the game to actually choose from a bank of words lying around the typical home, rather than have the game set those words for you. By enabling the user to decides their own words (and which adjectives and verbs to tack on) Influent allows them to study at whatever pace they'd like, and focus on whichever areas they desire. Whether it be trying to figure out the masculine/feminine states of certain pieces of furniture, or memorizing the different parts of a bed, Influent has got you covered.\n\n\nFor 10 bucks, it's a definate buy.","March 22, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seems pretty cool so far, though I've only spent about a half hour in this. You interact with things in your environment and learn their names in your chosen language, and when you've picked up enough words, you can review them in minigames.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this to a total beginner to French. This might be something that comes up later in the game, but I was confused to see that the game omits the proper gender articles for a given word. For instance, the word for "book" is "livre", which the game tells you is "masculine". That's correct, but then the game doesn't tell you what that means.\n\nThe minigames could use a little bit of work. Time Attack was my favorite one, where you're given a word and you have to run around and find the object the word corresponds to. So if you're given "mur", you have to go and double click on a "wall". It's easy enough, but things get stressful when you have to click very precisely on a really small or skinny object and you're trying to do it as fast as possible to get a good score. I wish the hitboxes had been bigger on these objects, because even if I turn up mouse sensitivity, a stylo is SO MUCH SMALLER than the bureau, and it can be a pain getting my cursors to line up with a tiny object. The sluggish walk controls don't help much either.\n\nThe other minigame I tried out let you take control of a model plane and zoom around the room shooting objects that match up to a given word. Thing is, you have to shoot several times at an object (presumably to tell the game you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY do know the meaning of that word, even though the repetition isn't a feature of the other minigame) and your plane is constantly moving towards whatever point in space you're focusing on. This means that you have to sometimes turn around to get more breathing room to fire on the object until the game finally tells you you're correct, and THIS is an issue because the plane controls rather sluggishly, and also explodes upon touching just about anything.\n\nStill, it was a good refresher for some vocabulary I'd forgotten. I could see this being useful as a side tool for a more in-depth language course.","March 22, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the second greatest language learning program ever created!!!\n\nAs a disclosure--I do not know the developers.  I have never met them.  I was not part of the kickstarter.  Literally the first I ever heard of this program was when it was in a Humble Bundle this week.  I had all the other software, but this program/game interested me.  When I found it on sale in Steam, I pounced.\n\nI purchased the base "game" for Spanish, and the add-ons for Mandarin, Japanese, Russian, Korean and Latin.  I would have purchased at least 2 more (Dutch and Gaelic) had they been available.  At $2.50/per language, why would you not?\n\nI have now played a touch with each language, and I have to say that it is amazing.  It is a brilliant idea, and it is wonderfully executed.  Click an object, hear it's name.  Double click and see how it's written.\n\nThis software will NOT teach you a language.  You wil HAVE to augment it with some other form of learning.  What it will do (at least according to a few minutes of testing) is give you a larger vocabulary of nouns.  While not all that you need, nouns are a big part of what you will use.\n\nBUY IT!!!!","October 27, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What stood out the most to me was the ability within the game to actually choose from a bank of words lying around the typical home, rather than have the game set those words for you. By enabling the user to decides their own words (and which adjectives and verbs to tack on) Influent allows them to study at whatever pace they'd like, and focus on whichever areas they desire. Whether it be trying to figure out the masculine/feminine states of certain pieces of furniture, or memorizing the different parts of a bed, Influent has got you covered.\n\n\nFor 10 bucks, it's a definate buy.","March 22, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seems pretty cool so far, though I've only spent about a half hour in this. You interact with things in your environment and learn their names in your chosen language, and when you've picked up enough words, you can review them in minigames.\n\nI'm not sure I'd recommend this to a total beginner to French. This might be something that comes up later in the game, but I was confused to see that the game omits the proper gender articles for a given word. For instance, the word for "book" is "livre", which the game tells you is "masculine". That's correct, but then the game doesn't tell you what that means.\n\nThe minigames could use a little bit of work. Time Attack was my favorite one, where you're given a word and you have to run around and find the object the word corresponds to. So if you're given "mur", you have to go and double click on a "wall". It's easy enough, but things get stressful when you have to click very precisely on a really small or skinny object and you're trying to do it as fast as possible to get a good score. I wish the hitboxes had been bigger on these objects, because even if I turn up mouse sensitivity, a stylo is SO MUCH SMALLER than the bureau, and it can be a pain getting my cursors to line up with a tiny object. The sluggish walk controls don't help much either.\n\nThe other minigame I tried out let you take control of a model plane and zoom around the room shooting objects that match up to a given word. Thing is, you have to shoot several times at an object (presumably to tell the game you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY do know the meaning of that word, even though the repetition isn't a feature of the other minigame) and your plane is constantly moving towards whatever point in space you're focusing on. This means that you have to sometimes turn around to get more breathing room to fire on the object until the game finally tells you you're correct, and THIS is an issue because the plane controls rather sluggishly, and also explodes upon touching just about anything.\n\nStill, it was a good refresher for some vocabulary I'd forgotten. I could see this being useful as a side tool for a more in-depth language course.","March 22, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll get you started and keep you interested as opposed to trying to learn from scratch with websites. With those, the second you get burnt out, you're more likely to quit and put it off for some unknown future date.

I'm impressed that there's a Latin version, which is what I bought. I've studied Latin for years yet never learned any neo-latin words (as many modern household items don't have names in classical latin). Gameplay is simple: click on an object and see/hear the translation.\n\nHowever I wish the game also displayed the name of the item alongside the translated name, as many of the Latin names for items end up being noun - adjective combinations. Doube clicking on an object provides a little extra info, but for Latin it's really only the gender of the noun. Including the principal parts or declension could really improve the usefulness of this tool.\n\n\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew about that game for a long time, but with the recent humble bundle, I spent a buck to find out. This is what I think:\n\n- I can hardly call this a game. While I really like the "intro-story", the game doesn't build up on the story at all. The whole "game" consists of you running around in your flat and clicking things. Your character isn't talking at all and the only objectives are getting the achievements and/or completing an ingame todo list, which groups certain words thematically. While the latter kept me motivated for a while, but also got me frustrated, since the list contains the "to be learned"-words in target language. So you have no real clue what to look for\n\n- You only learn vocabulary. While I'm not a big fan of grammar rules in the form of equations or conjugation tables, this game doesn't contain a single sentence! Only words! Mainly nouns, but later on adjectives and verbs as well. But no sentences!\n\n- You don't really learn any vocabulary. I have to major issues. First, the game tells you that you "mastered" a word after several successful training units. However the game doesn't contain any concept about long-term memory. After you learn words in a language, you have to repeat them in growing intervals. Repeat after 1 minute, 15 minutes, an hour, 5 hours, a day, 5 days, a month and so on... this game thinks you "mastered" a word in 3 min. That is not how memory works :( Second: The way the game teaches you is: it shows or tells you a word and you have to find the corresponding object in your flat and click it. However this only builds your passive vocabulary. If you were given a word in your mother tongue and you should translate it to the language you are learning, this game won't really help you\n\nSo all in all the "TL:DR summary" is very black and white (in this case black). This software gives you some motivation to learn/repeat words and you might indeed learn a thing or two. If you are just planning to fool around with some vocabulary of a language and spend 2 or 3 hours, this game is fine. For anything else it is really ill fitted. You definetely won't learn a language and I can hardly believe that anyone will build a real vocabulary with this. Rather pick up memrise.com courses or get anki for vocab training,","February 28, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can see the game expanding into explorations outside of the small aparment and into the world with further exploration of items.  Then expanding further to have the user build sentences to interact with the environment or even order food at restaurants.

Everything that can reasonably be in a flat is in it. Most of those are really everyday-vocabulary that is useful to know but you also get things like 'coat rack' which might not be something you need in your early everyday-conversations. On the other hand e.g. stuff like 'car' or most animal are missing. Still I'd say that overall the large majority is really useful vocabulary\n- if you're practising nouns it's obvious how it works: it asks for table and you click on the table but adjectives and verbs it's different: you get them via nouns that have a connection with them. A plant grows, you wash laundry etc. That can get difficult when there is more than one association you can make. A poster might be beautiful but in this game it's only associated with a painting...\n- you can either practise a list of 10 words that you made or a random list of 10 words. There is no possibility to limit this random list to just those you don't know well, yet. I know that Russian 'banan' means 'banana' by now. I don't need to go over at again and again. A possibility to stop asking for vocabulary you have already mastered would have been nice.\n\nFor me those are only minor issues and I still think it's a great vocabulary-game.","November 2, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It boasts the ability to teach up to 420 words in whichever language you choose. Yes, you could find all of the words online, but Influent has the element of interactivity. It is unbelievably convenient and useful to be able to actually see the things related to what you are learning. There is a very noticeable and evident difference between learning a word and (perhaps) seeing a picture, and learning a word in an interactive space. Seeing a word in an interactive space makes, truly, all the difference.\n\nThe downsides to the game include a limited gameplay space, and thus limited word choice. A certain 'word bias', I suppose (there is a cat, but no dog, and a cactus but no flower, for example). It would be greatly appreciated if, later on, there was some world expansion DLC that included a new place to explore --- if the developers are reading this, I'm recommending a small store or shop, that would be nice.\n\nOverall, it is certainly a good game, and it is worth CAD 10.99. I would recommend this game to people who have learned or are learning the grammar to their chosen language and who are looking to expand their vocabulary.","October 31, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Don't expect something like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone, which if you don't know are interactive applications which, if used regularly, will essentially provide a sufficiently structured learning plan to allow you to become functionally proficient (IE, able to carry on a simple conversation) in another language.\n\nAll this game allows you to do is learn basic vocabulary. That's it. You walk around inside a little apartment and click on objects, and the game tells you the name of the object in the language you've chosen, frequently alongside relevant adjectives and verbs (EG, clicking on a candle will tell you the word for "candle" as well as the word for the verb "light"). Then you can create vocabulary lists that will allow you to test your knowledge of these words.\n\nIt's very good for that, for learning some basic vocabulary in a new language. But it will not do anything else. It won't teach you any sort of grammar; you won't so much as learn how to put together a sentence properly in the subject language.\n\nBut if you're just learning the basics of a new language, or would like to, then this is good for that. It will help you quickly master a basic vocabulary list which will help you start listening to dialogue or reading or taking a class or doing any of the other things that will help you actually learn a new language.","January 19","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This means that it does NOT teach grammar. I see this game as a suppliment to your normal learning. The primary game is to pick out some words you want to learn by clicking the object and pressing space. Afterwards you get to play a 'time attack' game where you're told the word and must go around the house trying to find it, or an example of it.\n\nSome problems I find are that some objects in some places are hard to click while in first person mode, e.g. eggs or butter. The game also has only one looping song, and although it's rather nice I can see it getting boring after a while. The game space may also seem very small and crowded, especially in 3rd person. You are also only able to time attack 10 words at a time.\n\nYou'll want to note that when you buy the game, you'll essentially be given one of the DLC for free to start out with.","January 20","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So even when you're not playing, you can look around your room and try to recall or speak out the words you've been practicing.\n\nThis is slightly more advantageous then drilling a set list of vocab words in a 101 book, or from a class. As those list are fixed to a lesson plan, and it's a bit harder to grasp as you are relying more on flash cards rather than visual associations to the object or action.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to increase their elementary vocabulary of a language while learning a new language.

That is not what this game is supposed to do. This game will not teach you a language from scratch and it doesn`t have to.\nIf you only want to learn a language by using only one source than this would definately not be your kind of game.\nBut let´s be serious guys. I think we all should know that learning a language requires far more different materials and takes a ♥♥♥♥ load of time.\nThis game is just for Vocabs and therefore should be used as additional tool beside your other study methods.\nOf course you will have to learn grammer and sentence structure seperately by using books or taking courses but that is to be expected.\nLong story short. This game mainly serves as a Vocabulary trainer. You have to think for yourself if it´s worth buying "just" for that. But I for myself consider it way more fun to actively learn the vocabs than to read them of some flash cards. (which for japanese easily cost double the price/ Kanji readings ect.)\n\nLastly a little review specially for the japanese pack:\n\nPro\n- The voice is good\n- it has many words for everday use\n- switchable between Hiragana, Kanji and romaji\n- you feel succesfull\n- more translations for the same word\n\nCon\n- Just household items\n- just a flat to move in\n- many english words in a japanese manner (can be avoided by taking another word with same meaning)\n\n\n5/7  would recommend.\n","April 2","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't expect something like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone, which if you don't know are interactive applications which, if used regularly, will essentially provide a sufficiently structured learning plan to allow you to become functionally proficient (IE, able to carry on a simple conversation) in another language.\n\nAll this game allows you to do is learn basic vocabulary. That's it. You walk around inside a little apartment and click on objects, and the game tells you the name of the object in the language you've chosen, frequently alongside relevant adjectives and verbs (EG, clicking on a candle will tell you the word for "candle" as well as the word for the verb "light"). Then you can create vocabulary lists that will allow you to test your knowledge of these words.\n\nIt's very good for that, for learning some basic vocabulary in a new language. But it will not do anything else. It won't teach you any sort of grammar; you won't so much as learn how to put together a sentence properly in the subject language.\n\nBut if you're just learning the basics of a new language, or would like to, then this is good for that. It will help you quickly master a basic vocabulary list which will help you start listening to dialogue or reading or taking a class or doing any of the other things that will help you actually learn a new language.","January 19","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However this game is probably useful if you already know the basics of the language.\n\nI rate this game a 5/10","August 3, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While not a comprehensive course, Influent presents a truly impressive model for the gamification of acquiring basic vocabulary. Players find themselves navigating a 3D home with hundreds of objects to interact with. As you explore, vocab sheets are created which you can later test your knowledge of by associating objects with presented words (unfortunately the opposite has not be implemented). With over 400 nouns, adjectives, and verbs, players can use the game as a jumping off point for learning a new language. When you combine with something like Duolingo, it becomes apparent how wonderful the digital age is for those of us who love to learn!\n","July 13, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My Spanish is OK but I never knew the word for stapler... until now!\n\nAs a tool for actually learning the language, it's useless. You can wander around someone's house and tell them how to say "light switch", but then when they ask you about literally anything outside the home, you won't even know how to say "what?"\n\nWhile this is a nice idea for immersive learning, and it's fairly well put together, it's really not the "Language Learning Game" that it advertises as, because language learning is about so much more than vocabulary. Put it this way: in the Spanish version, it's optional whether or not to include noun genders. You can't learn Spanish without knowing the gender system. So it doesn't teach you the language. It teaches you some words. That's it.\n\nGet DuoLingo if you are a beginner. It's free and a million times better.","January 13","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts great, discovering new words and practicing. It has good graphics, it's really cheap, and the sound quality it's very good.\n\nThe problem is after the first hour or two, it's not a game to finish in one setting, but the more you play the more boring it gets. There is some of the points I'd like to mention.\n\n-The music is great, but there are only 2 tracks, and this is a spaced repetition method, so, after a while of repetitions, it becames dull.\n-There is a story in the trailer, and you expect to visit all those cool locations to help Andrew Cross with his invention, but in the end nothing happen, maybe he is a NEET and that's why he is intented to solve his case sorely in his house.\n-There are not recorded articles (like "la" or "el" in spanish) with the words, which it's very important to remember when learning gender nouns in languages like Spanish, French or German.\n-The plane mode is useless, maybe in an open space would rock.\n-There are some western words that maybe you wont need in your target language, and there are a lot of words that are common in one country but there's no sign here.\n-Dlc is more like a traduction than a localization. Same content for all languages.\n\nIf you plan to learn a new language, try it with another method, it's good for some vocabulary.\n\n---\nA note for developers: Why not put more areas instead of more languages. A lot of people think the product is "incomplete", because the trailer makes you think there's more to discover. It feels like you are milking the same assets. If you decide to improved the content I'd gladly change my review.\n---\n\nAlso I made a workshop for the program Controller Companion for this game, so you can use your gamepad, Check it out.","March 31","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a 3D environment, a house, you freely interact with items to know their word, pronounciation and others. You can add them to your learning word-list whenever you want and in the order you want. When you are ready you can choose a page of 10 words to begin learning them. You can set up everything including pronounciation and word display. Then you need to find and click on the related item randomly chosen in the 10 word-list, the timer is also here to show you if you're good enough or not. The aim of the game is to master every word, 420 in total, including nouns, adjectives and verbs from items to child's items. The game also immerse you in the real enrvironment as your native's translation of each items is hidden but you can always see it in your word list by clicking on the red eye.\n\nWhen you start a game you choose the language you want to learn, so there is an independent save for each language and you can create several save for a same language I guess. Also for the asian languages you can choose to learn with PINYIN or ideogram, after the choice made you can't switch it in game so you need to make two game sessions.","March 2","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As for actually learning conversational Russian... not so much. Also it doesn't break down letters or syllabuls to ensure proper reading (I can only imagine how difficult this would be if you were trying to learn a far eastern language).\nAnother thing I noticed is they use selective words over general words in some cases. For example: Шляпа (Shlyapa) does mean 'hat' but it refers to a certain kind of hat like a fedora - the general term for 'hat' is actually Шапка (Shapka). I saw this again with the shirts. Each shirt in this game was Рубашка (Roobashka) which is more of a dress shirt or collared shirt - you would use Футболка (Footbolka) for T-shirt.\n\nI could see this game having a LOT of potential if it were to go in the right direction.","May 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
