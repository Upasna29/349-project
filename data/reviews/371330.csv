Don't expect anything else, you won't get it. :)\n\nPositives:- Good idea for a logic game.\n\nNeutrals:- Achievements are gained only for level solving (with exception of one), there aren't any especially hard ones.\n\nNegatives:- 250 levels might sound great, though you might feel really bored after few tens of levels. It's just still the same without any innovation or perceptible gameplay change.\n- Mouse control could be made more special for PC, not just quickly ported from smartphones and tablets. Why do we have to double-click if we can use left X right mouse button?

A great game where you use your addition skills to add a combination or partial combination of a set of nine numbers so that you have two of the same number to solve the puzzle.  For example if the set included 22 and 17  and 33 and 6 you would have two 39's to solve the puzzle.  It sounds a bit more confusing than it actually is.

Two Digits is a solid but simple math puzzler. And a sequel named "Three Digits" is already out there, too. I just complain about the implementation.\n\n250 levels which turn into boring after a while. Why is that so? I guess it's the lack of slowly raising difficulty. The levels seem totally mixedup in difficulty and solution category. Tho it's always the 3x3 matrix some puzzles intermediate have solutions like x = a + b (+ c). Even the last 3 levels are ridiculous easy. The dev should figure out what makes a puzzle easy or what makes it more challenging. And then bring them in a new order. It mustn't be that mass of levels.

Mostly, my verdict was based on (a complete lack of) difficulty. It was disappointing, because I like number puzzles, and conceptually this sounded like a fun idea. But after breezing through 250 levels in 2 hours, I was worried that the entire concept might be too easy... it's just basic addition after all. $4 can find a thrifty Steam shopper much more than 2 hours of enjoyment.\n\nHowever! With the latest update, all of the levels have been remade, with easy solutions removed. While individual puzzles still won't take very long, they at least require actual thought now. Perhaps more importantly, this also shows that the developer is paying attention to community feedback and actively (and quickly) updating the game.\n\nIn the future, assuming additional levels are added, this will be an easy recommendation for those who enjoy this kind of game. For now, my "Yes" is a vote of confidence in the developer and the concept.","May 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Expect an up-to-date review once all the levels have been replaced.\n\n[s]I really want to like this game. I'm a puzzle fan, and quite enjoy math puzzles in particular. I think this game could be good. That said, the level design of this game has too many problems, as the game stands, for me to recommend this as is.\n\nThe goal of this game is, given 9 numbers, to find two groups with the same sum. Simple sounding. I think the intent is for this to be "harder than it seems," except that far too many of these puzzles has one number in the set which is the sum of 2 other numbers. It's slightly hard to find this sometimes, but too many levels can be solved immediately like this.\n\nIf that fails, finding any two pairs of numbers with the same difference (5, 7, 33, 35, for example) also solves a puzzle.\n\nAnd then there's puzzles where two of the numbers are the same. At least 3 of them, if I remember right. One duplicate, other duplicate in different groups is a solution.\n\nThere's really no difficulty ramp-up at all in this game, as a result. I found the "all numbers are odd" part of the game far and away most enjoyable, since the sum of two odd numbers can never be an odd number, so they tended to require harder solution.\n\nI guess that the problem is that anyone who actually wants a mathematical puzzle game is going to find this far too easy, and anyone who will find this challenging wouldn't want this game. If there were settings to possibly make the game harder, like requiring at least 2 numbers in both sets in a solution, or better crafting of levels to prevent x+y=z (and x=x) type levels, I can see myself being able to recommend this. As it stands, though, the puzzle design is too simplistic for me to give a thumbs up.[/s]\n\nPS: As of the time I posted this, the last 3 achievements are broken. I've completed this game, but they don't load. Also, the ultimate puzzle's solve animation seems broken.

I guess there are just a lot of simple people out there.\n\nWhen you brainstorm ideas for making a game, some you keep and some you throw out because they don't go anywhere. This game idea should've been thrown out.\n\nHere's the idea behind this game: You have nine numbers. Pick two groups of those numbers that add up to the same amount. That's it. The gameplay does not get any deeper. Level 1 is literally the same as level 100, just with different numbers. With good game ideas, you find the gameplay expanding as the game goes on. This is just rote repetition. I can't imagine anyone enjoying it. If you do, you have an exciting career ahead of you as a cashier.\n\nSome reviews say this game is educational, which I also don't understand. I'm not sure what these people could be learning. Did they not know how to tell if two numbers are equal before playing this? That could be it.\n\nBottom line, if you are 8 and need to practice your addition, or if you want to get into accounting for the thrills, buy this game.

There are a LOT of levels. Normally, I'm not one to complain about too much content, but the additional levels do not add anything of value on top of normal game play. 250 levels is too many to justify individual selection and 'progress'. Levels should indicate a distinct progression: new mechanisms, bigger puzzles, etc. Levels here mean nothing in terms of playstyle. An example of what good level progression would be HexCells, where new worlds either introduce a new mechanic, or increase the difficulty of the puzzles. In Two Digits, the progression means nothing.\n\n2. Poor PC porting. To anybody who has played this game or watched the trailers or screen shots, it's obvious this game was developed with touch screen in mind. If a game that is made on a different platform is ported to a new platform, the controls (or at least the options for controls) should reflect the new platform. In this case, it was minimally done. I see potential for left/right clicking to switch between states, but it was never addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, calling this a puzzle is a bit of a stretch. At the very least, it has puzzle elements, but this plays more like a math education game than your standard puzzle. For an educational game, it wouldn't be that bad (I could see a style of this game being extended to other operations and potentially being a great tool for educators), but as a puzzle game on Steam, it might be hitting the wrong core demographic.

I don't mean in an abstract yes-this-concept-appeals-to-me sense, I mean do you love adding and subtracting ♥♥♥♥? If you can honestly answer yes, then Two Digits might very well be a game for you. The premise is as simple as you can get: You get nine numbers, and you have to pick two sets of numbers that equal each other when added. That might mean finding two numbers that add up to a third, or that might mean summing dozens of combinations until you hit upon one that works. It's a great game for taxing your brain, because you need to work out systems to identify potential equals. Looking for numbers one digit apart or ones that sum to others will save you a lot of headaches, so if you're good at coming up with math shortcuts, you'll be well prepared for this.\n\nThat's it. Literally it. You have several hundred puzzles of what I just described. There are no additional systems, gimmicks, unlocks, or features.

Chalk up another lazy programmer jacking up the Steam price even though it was the afterthought platform.\n\nSecondly, this thing is an unoptimized mess. So you need to pick a number to be in bucket 1 or bucket 2 to make them match. Logically, right click = bucket 1, left click = bucket 2? Nope. This is a tablet game so you press a number twice to get it to bucket 2. So ok, I play this on my windows tablet and it glitches out where you can't scroll down on the level screen after using it for a bit, forcing a restart every once in awhile. For the Steam achievements, they don't unlock until you restart the game.\n\nBottom line is that the game is ok, but as a PC gamer you just can't support lazy, overpriced ports like this or it will be all we get. If you like puzzle games, I suggest some alternative choices (some of which are also ports - but aren't lazy messes like this game), like Hexcells, Strata, Cubot, Unium, etc.","November 4, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe more levels will be added later, but they don't really have a hand-crafted feel to them anyway, and you might just as well play the random generator.
