It's a perfect example of what an Indie game should be.\nMade with a short budget (Its Indie, dah), this game isn't focused in showing great realistic graphics, nor revolutionizing the Point & Click genre with innovative gameplay, but using a fantastic and different humour, with a scent of its own. Its the best, but also the riskiest feature of the game. Why? Made in Portugal, this game lives from its portuguese and humor jokes, from the beginning through the end, and was designed to be that way, and some people (non-portuguese) may not understand them all, although the creators changed those jokes in the english version.\nThe story takes action in Portugal, in a fictional place totally inspired by Lisbon and Porto, so, if you never went there, here's a perfect way to visit it... In a cartoonish and pixeled way!\n\nIf you like Point & Click games, specially humurous P&C like Monkey island, here's a game you can't miss!\n\n9/10","July 17, 2014","true","0.6"," 54 of 71 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","54","71","0","5"

But for Portuguese people it's a landmark in our national gaming industry. Being one of the first Portuguese games on Steam, this one is more special because it portrayts many Portuguese stereotypes and gives a general satyrical view on late 80s/early 90s Lisbon. You play as José Justino (more commonly called Zé, Case in the English translation), a private investigator that gets a robot as part of the heritage form a recently pasted-away relative. This robot, which Zé decides to call "Clown" because of the bad jokes he's always saying, form a dysfunctional pair that will try to solve the huge mystery that surrounds the strange murder of a guy in his room in Hotel Lisbon. The gameplay is the usual in this type of game, and has a few bugs. The artwork and the sound are rather good, and are, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets of this game. The story is not bad at all, it has a fairly good plot-twist and it only sins for being too short. However, there are 3 sidequests that are honestly interesting and a stand-up comedy show, that has some good jokes (but some very bad ones) and that is a bit of a problem due to the great ammount of bugs it presents. Now, where the game really shines: the dialogues. Filled with little jokes, references and details that only the Portuguese people can get, this is a tribute to our tricky language and to our exquisite culture and way of living. Many of these elements were probably lost in the English translation, so I think it's undeniable that whoever plays this in English will not have a complete experience. Therefore, I believe that this game deserves two different scores: for the Portuguese version I'll give it a score of 86 out of 100. A must play game that hasn't a higher grade because of the bugs and the fact that it's a quick game (3 to 4 hours with everything done). For the English version, the score should be quite a bit lower. I haven't played the English version, but I bet it would be something around the 70s out of 100. Concluding: if you're Portuguese, this is mandatory. If you aren't, well, it doesn't hurt to give it a try, but don't expect a extraordinary game.","December 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","2"

With a pixelated artstyle, slightly mature dialogue and humor, and unique world to explore, this game is great for fans of the genre. There are a few issues playing through that you may pick up on, such as a notable amount of typos and a good bit of crashing. In the game you'll be finding clues to a murder and then using them to interrogate different citizens. While this idea is unique, it's one of the only few mechanics that you could regard as "new" in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bansexual/recommended/297290/","bansexual","Bansexual","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bansexual/","152 products in account","I think a lot of this game was lost in translation. At the very least, it was hurt by it. There are so many typos. So many. The pacing is slow. Moving around in the game is clunky, and there is so much back and forth, since there are very few actual locations in the game. Six hours, including the mini-game, across 5 streets with only a building or two apiece on average. It's just way too much repetition.\n\nPlus, the game forces a linear progression in some respects, but allows you to do other things out of order, in the most obnoxious way. For instance, the first time I called Stephanie to my office, I went to meet her, only to have her repeat the same line over and over again about how she got there so quick, not knowing that the game expected me to have another item before I interrogated her. Why did I call her to my office if I didn't have everything I needed? Other times, the game insisted that I had all the evidence needed to interrogate someone, but it wasn't clear from the story or the interrogation questions which items those were. And the interrogation questions themselves are poorly written, or at least, poorly translated. Many times several of the questions say exactly the same thing with little discernible change in tone, leaving you to guess which one is the "right" choice. Plus, coming from a history of games that let you develop your character through dialog, I found it annoying that the dialog options that I found more amusing and entertaining were "wrong" and caused you to fail the interrogation. I mean, not that I didn't know not to select them, but it was annoying to not be able to.\n\nThe artwork was... okay. As far as pixel art game go, I've certainly seen better. But I've seen worse.\n\nI think the thing that annoyed me the most was that the taxi would drive through buildings to pick you up. And not in a forgivable, cartoony, over-the-top way. Just a normal taxi driving through normal walls.\n\nOne of the other annoyances is where the game fails to respond to mouse clicks, because you're either too close to something, or too far away, or seemingly at random. It's a point and click. If I click, the character moves. That's how it's supposed to work. If the game doesn't respond at all, then it's failing at the only thing it had to get right.\n\nThe humor didn't impress me in the beginning, and then it wore me down until I enjoyed it, and then it got so repetitive that I lost interest again.\n\nAnd then there was the ♥♥♥♥-shaming. And potshots at crossdressers.\n\nDon't get me wrong. If you give me a misogynistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like Jayne Cobb, I will totally believe him as a character. I will hate him and love him for all of the right reasons. But if you give me a one-dimensional female character, and then have all the major male characters, including both of the main protagonists, call her a ♥♥♥♥ over and over again, it's no longer about what that character is like and what his flaws are. He isn't the misogynistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the developers are.\n\nNot to mention the developers begging for money INSIDE of a game that I PAID for. ♥♥♥♥ you.","January 27, 2015","false","6.2"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

All the references and resemblences of my city in a pixelated art style is just amazing to see. A lot of the portuguese culture is shown in this game, and that's why I loved it so much. Even the tiniest things may be referenced, and that's what makes this a huge gem to have on anyone who loves and/or lives in Portugal. The game itself was fun too, the case was entertaining, not very confusing, but kept me going and going until I was actually done with it. I completed the game in one sitting, for about 4 hours.\n\nThe soundtrack is AMAZING, the jazzy sound had me hooked, and there's even a Fado song, one of our own genres of music!\n\nI believe that the humour may be completely different for each language because there's a lot of puns in the version I played, so those are pretty hard to translate, if not impossible, hence why some foreigners feel like it fails at humour, but that's because you're not experiencing the best version of it, sadly the only way to play the best version is if foreigners learned Portuguese!\n\nAll in all, again I do say, a must-have gem for Portuguese speakers, sadly I don't think people "from the outside" will appreciate it as much as we do! 8/10","January 27","true","5.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/297290/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Point and clicks are a crowded market and now reaching out to a new audience thanks in part to Telltale's highly sucessful Walking Dead. Knowing this, it is hard to tell new point and clickers that this game rivals Walking Dead, because it does not. This is not a heart wrenching, emoitonal trip that makes you sick to your stomach. Instead Hotel Lisbon is a lighthearted game that follows a questionably capable detective and his robot sidekick/ unfunny comedian.\n\nHotel Lisbon is dripping with style: the color choices, retro style, and music all come together to deliver a very pleasing aesthetic. The animations and characters feel classic in design, but still very refreshing. The setting is filled with nice little details and feels well structured. On top of all this, the music fits well through the game.\n\nThe humor in the game is more hits than misses. Some of the humor comes from poking at unfunny things (laugh track included), being legitimately funny, and sometimes just being silly or breaking the fourth wall. Sometimes I feel like the humor went right over me, but mostly I enjoyed it.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat detective like. You are tasked with solving cases by finding evidence, which never feels too\nhard and is usually done by finding highlightable items throughout different environments. After gathering your evidence you then have to interview/interrogate suspects as Clown Bot or Detective Case by making three accusations. You have to choose the accusations from a small list and then match that up to evidence. One choice is obviously wrong and unrelated to evidence and the others are related to evidence. However, this is where the game can begin to stretch out and lose its charm.\n\nSometimes the wording of the "right" accusation to make can seem strange. The suspect seems to get angry when I insult them, but all of the choices seem to be insulting. The other major issue with interviewing is that sometimes suspects will only crack when they are being interrogated by Clown Bot or Detective Case, so even if you get all your questions right you might have to redo the whole interview with the other character. To make this problem worse, upon failing the interview, either character will suggest trying the interview instead. So you could potentially be stuck in the same interview for too long before it starts to eat away at you. All of these issues can lead to interviews becoming tedious and tiring. However, the game will not lead you into an impossible interrogation because you need to have sufficient evidence in order to start one.\n\nIn addition to the main cases there are a few side cases (with more promised) and a mini game featuring Clown Bot. The side cases run like the main cases (with the exception of the lost video tapes, which involves combing the environment). The mini game has Clown Bot telling jokes and you delivering the punchline in multiple choice format. You get a few tries before having to restart and speed factors into your score, but it is a nice little distraction.\n\nThe wording of questions and punchlines seem to be a bit strange (probably due to translation), but that is only a minor setback for this game. The style and humor make this a fun experience, as long as the interviews don't overstay their welcome. None of the puzzles or sleuthing will leave you scratching your head, but this short point and click adventure is full of charm and character.","February 3, 2015","true","16.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

It looks good, the music is nice, there's some funny moments. In fact, I enjoyed most of it, up until near the end of the game. It's not bad, but the problems are big enough that I find it difficult to recommend the game. If what you want is a game that has the look and feel of a classic adventure game, this is a good purchase. If you want more than that, including the classic adventure GAMEPLAY, there are some problems.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the game is filled with typos, awkward phrasing and errors. This becomes more and more apparent as the game goes on. Adventure games like this rely a lot on the writing. When there are issues, at the most minor it's distracting and on the major end it effects gameplay (specifically, the interview questions and the Stand Up Clown mini-game).\n\nAnother problem is that there's not a lot of game in this game. Sometimes that's how a game works, it's more about the experience and story than then gameplay. There's two issues with this: the above mentioned writing issues and that it gets boring if you're expecting old school gameplay to go along with the old school look. There aren't really puzzles in this game. What you do is collect items, then when you have enough you can interview people. In interviews, you pick a question and match it with an item and present it to the person. And that's it. It's a nice system, it's different, but that's most of the game. It gets old after awhile without anything else to support it. Classic adventure games are chock full of puzzles to solve. With this, I didn't feel like I did much by the end.\n\nAlso, all the old school adventure games we loved had decent stories. Maybe not the greatest, but they were coherent and thought out. This game has that up until near the end when the plot kind of just gets thrown in the trash.\n\nThere are some other issues. At least twice, I was not given important information about items that I needed for the interviews. It's possible I missed them being mentioned in dialogue, but important info should be in the item description. The humor can get repetitive. A good bit of it revolves around Case getting people's names wrong and, later, calling a woman a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAgain, it's not a bad game. It does very well with tone, style and sound and the interview system is a good idea. There's just not enough polish on the game and the interview system isn't enough to support the whole of the gameplay.","September 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

It really is, and it is such a shame about the rest of the game.\n\nThe music is good, but just not very good at being video game music. It gets repetitious very fast. I find it hard to believe that they could have played the game with audio turned on and thought it sounded fine.\n\nBut the thing that completely kills it for me is the writing. It's painful. English isn't their first language and it shows in every way it can.  Either I don't get their sense of humor or they don't really have one. This is one actual conversation:\n\nCase: I still haven't been paid yet\nSecretary: Ok sign here and here\nCase: HAHAHAHA\nClown-Bot: Beep Boop\n\n* Cue laugh track *\n\n... Wait what? Is this supposed to be funny? Some sort of anti-humor about misplaced laugh tracks? Is them being poor supposed to be some sort of running joke? Many other "jokes" are built out of casual disrespect towards each other or women in general and this is supposed to somehow be funny? It actually stoops so low to as to try to be self aware about how unfunny it is as if that is supposed to make it acceptable. When you reach that point you have failed.\n\nEven this "humor" aside, the rest of the plot is entirely composed of the most generic low effort tropes. It's clear that nobody there cared about writing, which makes it baffling then why they made an adventure game.\n\nNot to mention the poor implementation of conversations in this game. The writing can best be described as verbose word vomit. And so naturally the only thing  you could do to make this worse is to get stuck in 30+ long unskippable dialogue line conversations that are the same each time because you accidentally clicked on the same thing twice.\n\nI couldn't even power through it knowing it was likely pretty short.","January 11","false","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The aim of the game is to solve a recent murder and any other mysteries that appear as you make your way through the game.\n\nOn paper this game sounds like it has potential, while Point-and-Click games are generally lacking in compelling gameplay or stellar graphics, they often make up for it with good storytelling, witty humour, or even sometimes heart wrenching tragedy or drama. However Detective Case and Clown Bot fails on all these fronts, the murder is incredibly straightforward to solve and the humour isn’t so much delivered as forced down your throat to the point of becoming painful. With only 5 areas in the game you find yourself backtracking to and fro, picking up objects that will later be used as evidence and interviewing potential culprits.\n\nThe interviews are really the core of this game’s “gameplay”, you ask each suspect 3 questions, linking a speech option to an item in your inventory until they crack and spill the beans. However there are no repercussions for failing an interview other than the annoyance of restarting it, something you will find yourself doing repeatedly as the speech options given to you are all phrased incredibly similarly, but only one is the correct question to ask.\n\nIn short the game has a linear, predictable plot, uninteresting characters, forced humour, tiresome gameplay, and a world too small to “explore”. Perhaps the only saving grace of this game is that achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s- cough cough –I mean achievement hunters like myself can find solace in being able to perfect the game in under 5 hours.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Point-and-Click adventure game why not rather look into Telltale Game’s modern rendition on the genre like the Walking Dead Season One and Two and Game of Thrones, or just Google “Good old Point-and-Click adventure games”, look I’ll even do it for you: http://bfy.tw/24r1 , just don’t waste $7 on this game, you’ll regret it.\n","October 1, 2015","false","5.4"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","0"

Does that name ring a bell? No? Well then, you should play this game. Even if you know what it means, you should play it. Why? First of all, because it’s a fun game, and that’s what games are all about. I laughed a lot with this point and click and had a great time solving the mystery. Second, you will get a complete murder mystery story full of funny portuguese quirks and plot twists and turns. You’ll get to listen to fado music, for instance. Don’t know what it is? Look it up! You get your noir-ish detective, and a stand-up comedian/robot sidekick that can tell jokes, save your game and call the cab. You get your femme fatale, a whole bunch of suspects in wigs, three fun sidequests and future add-ons the creators announced, with new story content! Not enough? Well, here’s another reason to get this game: you’ll help the developers and, in turn, they’ll make our world a better place with more portuguese games.","October 2, 2014","true","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Recognizing those references doesn't prevent you from enjoying the game, however it adds value to the experience to know them.\n\nThis is probably the only game I have ever played that promises to be funny and actually achieves it. In almost every dialog situation, there is a joke that made me at least smile. The humor doesn't feel forced and any repetition of jokes doesn't go beyond the point where they stop being funny. That being said, I actually didn't finish the game in English, so I can't tell yet if the humor holds on with the translation from the Portuguese original but from my initial 5 minutes of English gameplay, I would say that at least the initial jokes were handled well.\n\nThe other great aspect of the game is the music which blends perfectly with the environment. Sometimes it reminded me of final fantasy 7.\n\nGameplay is simple and intuitive and there is no omnipresent UI to distract from the beautifully drawn scenarios which makes it a good fit for newcomers to the genre.\n\nThe only bad thing about the game (as of now) is that when you leave the game it doesn't prompt a reminder for you to save the game. After playing for about half an hour, I accidentally left the game without saving.","July 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What it lacks in pixels it makes up for in charm. It doesn't overstay its welcome (4 hours to do main and sidequests, with lots of running around) and there's a bit of an overload of bad puns (not too bad considering English is a transalation here) and "4th wall breaking" jokes because the robot (and sometime other characters) knows it's in a game.\n\nAn honest little game, not pretending to be anything it is not, nice to play through.\n\nHey it even has a laugh track and a popup crowd poping up from time to time that worked for me ;-)\n\nOne sour note: the linux version needs a bit of work (a symlink for the steam library) to have achievements working. Considering the amount of time since release, should have been patched up a long time ago even from a tiny dev team.","November 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/297290/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In Detective Case and the Clown Bot: Murder at Hotel Lisbon, by Nerd Monkey, you take on the role of Detective Case, and soon after the start of the game Clown Bot. In this game you are approached by an old police colleague that seems to have quite the mystery on his hands. Apparently a man has committed suicide by stabbing himself in the back 14 times. Now of course he wants a second opinion on this situation, but I think its pretty clear that something fishy is going on.\n\nGraphically this game is a throwback type of game, it kind of feels like it could easily be on a handheld device, but as I'm reviewing it for the PC, you can see the pixels, and the datedness of the game. Not that that is a bad thing when it comes to the theme and subject matter of the game. I think the style used in the game definitely fits, and the over exaggerating characters are perfect for the type of game this turned out to be. Even with the limited graphical look the majority of the items that you need to pick up in the game are easy to spot, or if they are not by hovering your cursor over objects it becomes very plain if the object is meant to be interacted with.\n\nThe music of the game kind of gave me an old school fake French cartoon vibe. You know the one with the skunk, Pepe Le Pew. There is no voice work in this game, but that continues to fit the theme and style that the developers were going for.\n\nThe controls are really straightforward, you are going to be using the mouse, and the left mouse button. Sometimes when you select an object or a character you will be given several options of actions you can take, but you will always be using the left mouse button. I do want to warn those out there with dual monitors if you are clicking near the edge of the game you might cause the game to minimize.\n\nAlright so you are this detective, who apparently once upon a time was a great detective, but cigarettes and booze has done him in. If it wasn't for his friend who has risen up the ranks in the police department, he would have never gotten the chance to show everyone that he's still got what it takes to get to the bottom of a mystery. You are going to basically interact with six different buildings in the game, but there is always a need to return to them to seek out more clues or pump someone for more information. It was actually surprising that even in this little town there was so much to do. Sure there was a ton of backtracking in the game, but the taxi cab that can show up ANYWHERE to pick you up makes life a little bit more enjoyable.\n\nThere are definitely points in the game where I was totally lost and had to resort to returning to almost every location and click on everything I could think of to get that one item that I was missing, but in the end the story was good, the characters' reactions during interrogation were entertaining, and I think that I would definitely be up for another chapter involving Detective Case and Clown Bot. Oh that reminds me, probably the one glitch about the game is that the exe file is named CaseBot, which triggered my anti-virus a couple of times and caused the game to stop working upon loading.\n\nAll that being said you are looking at a game that is about 3 and a half hours long, and it probably is a bit shorter of a game, but I feel like I got enough of a game that, like I said before, I would definitely want to check out another game by this group, featuring at least the Detective and Clown Bot. So to get to the point, this game gets an 8.4 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Dialogue is a fun read, and an average point n' click player can get through the main story easily. Advanced players were accounted for with tougher side quests that require a bit more noodle-usage. The humor in the game ranges from fourth-wall breaking gags to more mature, subtle quips.\n\nCONS: Case and Clownbot admittedly have too close of a dynamic to Sam & Max. Portuguese translations lead to some spelling errors and syntax. This shows horribly in the stand-up minigame where you need to guess the answers to jokes; English-speaking players will not understand some of these jokes, as they're based on a culture and language different from our own.\n\nOVERALL:  If you want to see our beloved genre continue into the future, Nerd Monkeys are definitely one of the groups of devs to support. The case, while a bit contrived, is a fun journey and evidence that these guys will be moving on to do even bigger and better things.\n\nSCORE: 8/10","February 9, 2015","true","15.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Davidson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/R_C_Davidson/","111 products in account","This is actually a hard decision for me since I have mixed feelings on the game.  This game tries to be like a combination of L.A. Noire with the interrogations and Sam & Max with the humor, and the two main characters in some ways, but most of the humor felt flat to me, and that was the one reason I was curious in it.  Most of the good humor is usually from seeing the sights, like (SPOILER ALERT!!!) the hazmet team taking pictures at the crime scene, Clown Bot breaking the fourth wall, or just talking about "the player," with everybody else calling him "broken," and some of the outrageous interogation animations, which the bartender is probably my favorite, but other than that, most of the jokes just weren't working for me, so I don't see what the audience thinks is funny, and yes, there is, in fact, an audience watching the whole thing.  I though this was game, not a bad sitcom.  As far as the story goes, on the other hand, it's actually decent once you get past the bad jokes.  Heck, I even kept thinking and second guessing on some parts of the game.  I haven't seen too many bugs, but it's best to be careful with this game, as there was one part where, no matter what I did, I can't control the character, though exiting out of the game and restarting it did the trick.  There's also a mini-game where, and I'm not making this up at all, Clown Bot does stand up comedy.  If you tell the joke right, you can catch the flowers the audience throws to you for extra points, but tell the joke poorly or freeze on stage, you have to dodge the tomatoes, or beer bottles, or toilets, or people flying towards you, so you won't lose points.  Ironically, since some of the jokes are still kinda stale, this mode is actually pretty hilarious just seeing what people will throw at Clown Bot.  So in the end of the day, I would give this game a 3 out of 5, that is if Steam did a star system other than a recommendation "Yes-or-No" system, but for now, I wouldn't get this game expecting a good laugh, like I did.","October 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's not hard to get through the game because there are no puzzles (you just need to collect items for interrogations and speak to the right people to progress). Separate from the main mode, there's also a minigame mode where you complete lots of puns (timed multiple choice), if that's your type of thing.\n\nMost of the game is light-hearted and relatively child-friendly but later on there are some words and name-calling that you might not want children to learn, and some sexual implications you might not want to explain if they're not old enough.\n\nIf you like quick and simple adventure games with humor, this might give you a couple hours of entertainment.","May 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the original point and click adventure companies, they made their bread and butter in the early years over series like King’s Quest and Leisure Suit Larry.  I would spend hours playing King’s Quest 5 or Conquests of the Longbow, hunting and clicking, talking with random people, and trying to find that one clickable person that would move my adventure on.  I ate up that stuff, primarily because as a youth, I felt the writing was brilliant.  It should come as no surprise then that I am still fond of these sorts of games, though honestly I play fewer now that I have less time to devote to games.  Therefore I was somewhat pleased when another point and click adventure game came up on the randomizer.  After playing for around 45 minutes, though, I remember why I stopped playing these sorts of games; the return on investment in terms of time is rather low.\n\nNow, this is not really a criticism of the game.  Indeed, behind the very clunky pixelated graphics and overly simple point and click interface lies the makings of a great game.  The humor is varied and entertaining enough to keep me interested, and the underlying murder mystery seems just interesting enough to be worth seeing through.  Even the addition of a sort of interview mechanic was interesting to me.  Unfortunately, after playing through as long as I did, I barely felt like I moved the story along.  This inevitably is the folly of gaming as you age: when you are young, you can waste away the hours playing games without consequence, however the older gamers must balance their gameplay time with work schedules, relationships, and other such real life things.  I find myself wanting for more before realizing that if I dont get to bed there is no way Im going to be able to drive eight hours tomorrow, and that sucks, because it means that I am old.  Enough about me though.  I love this game, it's cute, if not entirely put together, and everything about it makes me want to invest far more time than I have into it.  Hopefully you’ll find the same.\n\nGame’s Fate: Uninstalled.  It's not that I’m not interested, I just have too many point and click adventure games I want to get to first.  Maybe later, when I have the time to spend on games as opposed to writing reviews about them\nBuy/No Buy: Buy, especially now, but even after the sale ends, if you enjoy point and click adventure games.\n","February 11","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
