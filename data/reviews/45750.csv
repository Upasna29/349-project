I heavily advise people not to buy this game in its current state.\n\nLost Planet 2 was a guilty pleasure of mine on consoles, holding over 100+ hours of my personal time. I would easily give this game a thumbs up. However, as you can see, this is not the case sadly... In short, Lost Planet 2 is a wonderful game plagued by terrible DRM. This issue affects many but not all of Windows 10 users. If you have Windows 10, do not waste your money until these technical issues are fixed. Also, be weary if you have Windows 8.1, since this issue plagues some users that have this OS as well.\n\nAs of the time of this review, under normal circumstances, it is impossible to play this game for many due to Games For Windows Live (GFWL) on Windows 10 and 8.1. GFWL has immense compatibility issues on Windows 10 currently. Starting the game up in Direct x9 or x11 results in an instant crash. Starting up the game in compatibility mode does not work. Installing the GFWL client is also a dead end. The programs freezes up when attempting to log in. It is also worth mentioning that several other GFWL titles have similar issues.\n\nUnfortunately, these issues have completely rendered the game unplayable. I do hope that GFWL is removed from this game, or at the very least some fix is made available. I will be contacting Microsoft support regarding this. I suggest that others do so as well, for the sake of this game and others. Until this issue is resolved, I highly recommend looking elsewhere.\n\nA possible fix for both Windows 8.1 and 10!\nAfter doing some research and spending some time messing around with various theories, I have been able to find a possib;e temporary fix!\n\nDespite this fix, I strongly advise people not to buy this game in its current state. Please due note that this fix may not work for everyone, so caution is still heavily advised for people who plan to buy this. If you do buy this title, I advise not going over the 2 week/1 hours of gameplay limit for returning games! This is so that you can return the game if it still fails to properly play. Also, this issue affects many but not all Windows 10 users, as well as Windows 8.1 users.\n\nFor Windows 10 usersFor Windows 8.1 users, skip below these steps to "For WIndows 8.1 users" for a possibly simpler, faster fix.\n\n1. Go to Programs and Features and see if you have "Microsoft Games For Windows Marketplace" and/or "Microsoft Games For Windows - LIVE Redistributable" installed.\n2. If you do, uninstall them and restart your computer. If you don't have them installed, simply proceed to the next step.\n3. Go to the official Microsoft website and download (but DO NOT install) the latest version of Games For Windows Live. The download link is found here: http://www.xbox.com/en-IE/Live/PC/DownloadClient\n4. Right click on the GFWL install file and go to Properties. From there, turn compatibility mode on to Windows 7, and check off so that it will always run on administration mode.\n5. Activate the GFWL install file and complete the installation. However, do not boot up GFWL after it is installed.\n6. Boot up Lost Planet 2. Picking Directx 9 or 11 does not matter. At this point, instead of the game crashing instantly, it should actually start to boot up now, bringing you to the main menu.\n7. After setting your resolution, press "Start Game" to prompt a login to your Microsoft account. Enter your information and sign in. It will take several minutes of loading before anything happens. You should see a spinning circle as it loads.\n8. After it loads, enter your unique key for Lost Planet 2.\n9. From here, it will state that GFWL needs to update. Confirm the update and close the game a few seconds later. Make sure to confirm any installs that pop up. You may need to do this 2-3 times or so before everything is properly installed.\n10. Once everything is successfully installed, you should be able to finally log in and be prompted to create a new save file.\n\nFor WIndows 8.1 Users\nFor Windows 8.1 users, complete step 1 and 2. Then skip the rest and complete the following: See if you can install GFWL normally (without backwards compatibility mode). Attempt to boot up GFWL (the program itself) and sign in directly there. Whether you are able to sign in or not, try booting up Lost Planet 2. If the game will still not play, then go back to step one (make sure to uninstall GFWL) and instead attempt the Windows 10 method.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI cannot recommend this game enough on console. However, for PC, I honestly cannot recommend this title in its current state. My rating for the game will not change for now, since it is ridiculous that all of this strain and effort must be put out simply to get this game working. I hope that this is able to help some people out there that are having issues with this game as well.\n\nAlso, as a side note, you can skip signing in once you have GFWL installed by simply clicking on the red "X" in the corner of the GFWL login overlay. However, if you do, you will be unable to save your game or access online play.","February 7","false","3.1"," 313 of 350 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","313","350","9","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysisa/recommended/45750/","dysisa","dys?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysisa/","698 products in account","I remember back in 2007 when a game called Lost Planet came out for the Xbox 360. I was immediately impressed by the Vital Suits (big robots you jump into and steer) and the Akrids (giant bugs) you fight using your VS. Unfortunately however, the original Lost Planet was a rather dull game despite these things. So when I heard it was getting a sequel, I didn't really pay it any attention for the longest time. What a mistake that was.\n\nLost Planet 2 takes the strengths of the original game and develops them even further. It gets rid of weaknesses like actually taking itself seriously and the uninspired levels. I'll get this out of the way already now though, Lost Planet 2 is not a game meant to be played in singleplayer. It of course can be, but it would be the equivalent of playing a Borderlands game solo. Where the game truly shines is in the co-op campaign, which is possibly one of the best experiences I've ever had in a video game.\n\nThe game is a third person shooter, a very Japanese one at that, with some rather heavy weight to it's control scheme. The controls are very tight, even though the default control scheme on PC is, to put it lightly, very lacking. In the campaign, you and up to three of your friends are given the very simple task of shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of all the Akrids that have come to mess up your planet. Simple as that. At your disposal you have a wide variety of weapons, various Vital Suits and a grappling hook. The Vital Suits of Lost Planet 2 have been, to put it simply, taken to the next level. Some suits require several players to properly operate, some can transform, there's one for every need basically. As you play through the game you'll be able to unlock ridiculous amounts of weapons, titles, emotes and costumes, as well.\n\nThe game has very good replayability with several levels featuring secret routes and the silly things the game encourages and rewards you for doing, like entering the stomach of one of the bosses among other things. It features four different difficulty settings, ranging from easy to extreme, so you won't have to worry about difficulty being too easy or too hard. There's a full training mode which works fairly well too, if needed. If you and your friends die too many times and start arguing, there's a PVP multiplayer as well with plenty of game modes to mess around in.\n\nBut to get back more to the meat of the matter, as I mentioned earlier what really sets the game apart is the cooperative campaign. You won't get an experience like this anywhere else. In a time when cooperative campaigns have been more and more getting discarded, it's a wonderful thing to see a game like this. Just how many other games let you have several players controlling the same robot together and using it to mow down giant alien bugs? I know I can't think of anything at least. I really can't possibly emphasize enough just how much simple stupid fun this game is. I know I've tried with this review, but the only way to truly convey what a joy this game is, is by getting people to play it.","November 14, 2015","true","29.0"," 118 of 131 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","118","131","5","7"

Because DAMN did I lost the fun!\n\nA third-person shooter with Keiji Inafune's seal. This should speak volumes, I mean, what kind of game you'd expect from the father of Megaman? Unfortunately, that didn't panned out for the antecessor, the first Lost Planet. But LP2 redeemed it big time, at least in my opinion.\n\nThe problem with LP1? Bad narrative, choppy storytelling. In a game built mostly around the singleplayer, that's a serious issue. Graphics were good though, and the playability was solid. Still didn't helped, however, to add this title to my list of games to finish-and-forget .\n\nBut here's the funny part: those two complaints weren't solved in LP2. Instead, the series retooled its flaws into a workable and actually enjoyable storyline. And how do you do that with choppy sequences, lack of details and a great potential of development not being throughly harvested? Multiple protagonists, and multiple storylines seemingly disconnected one from another, until a certain part, that's how. And it worked marvelously.\n\nBut even so I doubt you'd think of this as the greatest point of this game. You'll feel like you're playing the surrogate child of Battlefied - career levels, loadouts, and five profiles denoting each PC - with Borderlands  - alien planet where everything in it is big, mean, carnivorous, tough-hided and spiky, with a corrupt megacorp trying its best to hog the motherload and trample everyone in the way... Heck there's even a group of stupid wasteland bandits with scrapyard-level gear! XD\n\nJust play it. It's a great co-op TPS, even if dated and with Lost Planet 3 around for almost a year. The fact that there's online players rolling since four years and counting should hint you about its quality.","May 18, 2014","true","114.9"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","63","68","0","6"

And one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life. Don't look at steam playing hours, I bought it here because I lost my old GFWL-based key.\n\nGameplay-wise it's a pinnacle of japanese TPS, e.g. alien planet, twisted story, global conflict, evil (or, of course, not so evil) megacorporation, tons of weapons, mecha war machines (not just to look at, to ride!), adrenaline-packed boss fights with enormous bosses, 4 player co-op for all this meat(!!!).\n\nMusic-wise... I have no words. Ah, wait no. I have some. Gorgeous. One of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to, performed by full-blown symphonic orchestra.\n\nHow comes it's so underestimated then, you ask me? Blame GFWL (Games for Windows Live), the platform always was a puddle of mud and it still ruins some nerve cells (because it's still in the game so you should technically activate your game twice using notorious Miscrosoft user-friendliness, good luck with that). Also blame ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Capcom PR campaign for PCs at the time.\n\nAh, but anyway, I am so jealous about you guys who never played it and will do this for the first time.

I've gotten everything from the in-game slot machine. And it is glorious. This game is a solid arcade-style shooter like Binary Domain or Vanquish and gives you a veritable arsenal of weapons to fight off a large variety of enemies. The dialogue is somewhat cheesy, but it fits the tone of the game since it doesn't try to be a "war is hell" shooter ot take itself too seriously. C'mon, you can even set a variety of emotes like waving, dancing, or even crotch thrusts! Most everything the enemies do or characters in the cutscenes can do, you can do.\n\nWant to grapple on to a giant arthropod and shoot its glowing spot for massive damage? You can do that.\nWant to use a VS [basically mechs] that you saw a boss use? You can use it at some point in the story.\nWant to shoot a giant spider in the face with a laser? You can do that too.\nWant to fuse two VSes together to make a super-VS to kill everyone around you? You can do that.\nWant to use VS weapons while on foot to blow someone across the room? You guessed it, you can do that!\n\nThe game gives you a set of default weapons, and you unlock more through an in-game slot machine using in-game currency. If you don't want to do that, then you can unlock a number of weapons, character parts, and items through levelling up your character in Campaign. You have a variety of game mechanics at your disposal to fight your enemies. You've got a grappling anchor you can use to latch on to enemies and you aren't only able to use it in a single stage, but rather it's available throughout the game in every stage. You can shoot grenades to blow them up in a larger explosion, or just use another type of grenade like the Gum [sticky] grenade to fight your foes off.\n\nMost of your foes are large insects and invertebrates called Akrid. They also happen to have giant glowing points along their bodies, such as their limbs and abdomens. The first large Akrid you meet in the campaign has weak spots on its arms that you can use to blow them off. The Akrid will regenerate their limbs over time, but I reccomend just blowing them off again! On other occasions, you get to shoot people in the face.\n\nThe human enemies have access to most of the same primary weapons as you do, like the Energy Gun and the variants of the machine gun. They'll also occasionally use VS weapons, in which case they will probably become one of your primary targets.\n\nWhile you can't pick up a dead enemy's weapon, there are a variety of weapons scattered throughout the level. All of these weapons match what you've selected in your character customisation, which helps when you want a particular style of weapon. If you happen to play the co-op, then the items appear as whatever items the host has set in customisation. The game keeps up a constant flow of action by continuously throwing pre-placed enemies that will run around the area in a futile attempt to survive. While their durability varies based upon which of the three pre-unlocked difficulty settings, so do the weapon and armor placements. For example, I played the first few stages on Normal and found the usual VSes and weapons, but playing it on Easy scattered a number of suits of power armor that you could use around the early levels.\n\nAll of this helps to show the level of work put into making this game enjoyable, and in my opinion, they succeeded at making a good, engaging game. I'd wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone looking for a good shooter that you can jump in and out of if you're busy or play in co-op with someone else.","September 19, 2014","true","36.4"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","42","43","6","0"

DON'T BUY IT... This game is better in many ways, let me point it out:\nChapter Select screen: + (Not in LP3)\nBig variety of enemies and entertaining/Epic monsters: + (Not in LP3, you only fight "Akrid"(Aliens) and NEVEC soldiers in this game (SPOILER, SORRY))\nBig variety of weapons and Vital Suits (Robot suits): + (Not in LP3, Why do I ONLY HAVE 8 DIFFERENT WEAPONS?!)\nTeamwork and Co-op campaign: + (Not in LP3, LP3 is based on a singleplayer campaign.)\nLaser/Plasma weapons and Rocket Launchers: + (Not in LP3, Why the hell not?!)\nCharacter Customization, and the ability to use them in multiplayer and co-op/singleplayer: + (Not in LP3)\nFree traversal of Environment with Grapplehook: + (Not in LP3, How do you restrict A GRAPPLEHOOK?!)\nA great point system that counts your deaths, points and kills. Then gives a Devil May Cry styled Letter score from S to D. (S, A, B, C, D, from best to worst)\n(Also, not in LP3. All these great features are stripped from the 3rd game, which gives a too linear experience.)\n\nApart from that, the gameplay is an Instant classic, it's not too advanced, and easy to learn. The graphics are great on max settings, not the worst I've seen even though they're a little dated. The teamwork works splendid, there is in-game voicechat but is mostly used in Multiplayer battles, not so much in co-op. The weapons range from the single Handgun to a VS Artillery Barrage, yes, you can take it off the VS and carry it around...! All in all, this is one of my Favorite 3rd person shooters of all time. Sad it went the way of Max Payne with the first 2 games being good, and the 3rd being a so-so. But atleast we still have the 2 first games. This was kind of 2 reviews in one, but I hope it changed your mind on LP2 and LP3.\n\n-EDIT: I Completed Lost Planet 3 and the story improves a lot down the line, but the gameplay does not. The story is just as Epic as in Lost Planet 1, so if you still consider getting the 3rd game, do it for the story and you will not be disappointed.

Story isn't deep but if you're in the cheesy b-movie it's incredibly entertaining. Voice acting is good again in that B-movie feel.  The sound effects are top notch, especially those gun sound effects. The Music is well fantastic gives the game a very epic feel to it.\n\nThe gameplay is just as good, actually forget that it's better. Shooting feels rewarding with lots of varying  guns from hand cannons,revolvers, to a gunsword (yes that exists in the game). Vital Suits add another layer of variety and are a blast to use especially the PTX. Lots of levels with mutliple objectives in them that Give the game Variety. And then there is the awesomeness that is the co-op playing with 3 other players hell even with one other it's still really fun. there is also competative multiplayer, but no where near as good as co-op.\n\nI have 2 issues with this gamone of which is just for the pc version of this. First off games for windows live and because the pc version uses it, no one plays it, so you're better off getting the other versions or just buy an extra copy for friends. 2nd one is that, you can't drop in a game, You have to wait until the party is done completing a level, I have no idea who though this was a legitamet good idea.

There is also public matchmaking if you don't have anyone to play with. However, the game's population has dwindled since long ago. Capcom seem to be hesitant to put a sale on the game.

Don't believe anyone that says the service has been shut down.  It still works and you CAN still play online.

A large variety of weapons to choose from.  The loadout system takes a new spin on the old pickup based gameplay that allows you to choose what specific weapon you want out of any given weapon types.  Co-op campaign is the main draw for a lot of people here.  Fight with three friends to take down massive bosses across a several environments, including space.  There is a lack of story but it more than makes up for it with fantastic gunplay and movement system.  There is also a huge amount of customization options, including emotes all without the fear of paying microtransactions like a lot of modern titles do.

Recently I picked it up again, on PC this time though. I remember whn I first played it, I thought it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. Coming back to it now a few years later, I see some of its flaws, but does that mean that ths game is terrible? No, not in the slightest. But I will leave that choice to you, the reader.\n\nThis is just giving personal experince from what I have seen in my time of getting it again:\n\nFlaws:\nAt first glance the game seems quite solid. Good textures, good voice acting (Most of the time) but one thing the game at times struggles to hold up is combat. This is very bad considering this is a combat based game. Is the worst I have ever seen? Not at all, but it definetly needed to be checked again. At points in the game I would try to shoot at an NPC and instead of where I was aiming it would aim to the bottom left corner of where I was aiming nowhere near where they were. Also at points (I'm not sure if other people have seen this or not.) the weapons would be showing that they are firing due the clip number going down, but nothing actually was being fired. Another thing is with at least one of the bosses from my own experince has a broken atack from what I've seen. This boss is called Akrid X. The attack I am refering to s a charging attack you have to escape otherwise it will do massive to you. Most times though, with the map design trying to indicate to go into these little crevaces in the ground, you can't escape it. I may be wrong here and it instead has an incredibly large splash radius for the attack, i'm not sure. There are other things to talk about, but i'll wrap it up with the character models. The problem with them was that not all blended together. I don't mean by the different colors, but the fact that there are jagged textures of other pieces of armor sticking out if you decided to have different pieces of armor on. Another problem on that same thing was the face models. These are smalls details. but they are important details. To some they might not notice, but to others, it miht ruin they enitre sense of immersion. I felt at some times they characters were beingmade to move just to move. Their arms would move around very oddly, making it difficult to understand there emotions sometimes. They only way for them to be understood at some points was due to the voice actors. On the face models that weren't covered, it was quite terrible. It didn't matter about if their voice needed to fit the character in this case, but they should have at least be able to move there mouths. In my opinion, that's quite lazy. Those same models also needed a texture touch up as well due their faces looked slightly meshed.\n\nPositives:\n\nThough its shown this game has its flaws, it also has it positives. One such one is co-op. When you are able to get a whole group of your friends together for a big game, it can be one hell of a ball. This is definetly one of the game bi things is teamwork. Granted, you can play game by yourself, but most times its either much lengthier or much harder. If you like working as a team and have friends to play with or you just want to play with anyone really, this is a game for you. Though I complained about the characters, I was mostly referring to the different model problems and meshing of "unfinished faces" as I should say. Here though it's about the designs of the models themselves (without combining different ones). Their ow designs I thought were amazing. Some were slightly off from one another to give a sense of being in an army and showing that they come from the same group, while others were just in their own in creativity. The different personality of the different characters overall managed to keep on the positive side due to a few iconic characters. Many of the characters were good, but they felt like they were practically everywhere, making them seem bland in that sense. There were a select few though that made me love them. The Waysiders were a beautiful group to me as well as the Vagabundos and the NEVEC Clones, at times anyway. Each of them had their own flare that made them stick out as their unit saying, "Hey! Here I am, as I am!" Finally the best part of this game to me, is the music. In some of the tracks they are short nd loop, but regardless they are beautiful. It's due to the soundtrack that I even came back to the game for the most part. I must say Jamie Christopherson did a fantastic job here and I will even later on.\n\n\nFinal Verdict (Reviewers Verdict):\n\n7.5/ 10\n\nThough I may have gone into detail about the different problems the Lost Planet 2 has it is still a very nice game. I it the best? No. Is it fun? Yes, indeed. If you know someone that owns it or if you want to buy it your self, it doesn't matter, you need to at least try it. This kind of game isn't for everyone, but you may be one of the people that does like it.\n\nSo though you have it. Take it however you please, but remember, this is the review of someone else, not you. You are the ultimate decider, so make your choice. Hopefully I'll see some of you on the planet of E.D.N.

The movement is fluid, the weapons pack a punch and the replay value is very high.  Due to the coop focus of the game, the story can be difficult to follow and the map transitions/ playing as different factions don't initially make a lot of sense.\nFighting akrid aliens is the absolute highlight of this game.  The bosses are gigantic and take a good beating.  The variety of boss akrid is great too, from a lumbering giant salamander to fast giant lizards.\n\nThe only letdowns in this game are the somewhat minigame feel of a few of the levels, lack of space to really play around in the vehicles properly, and having a more open style map level or freeroam would have been welcome.\n\nThe customization options are plentiful, for weapons, outfits and even emotes.  The destruction is abound in this game.\nOverall, this game is brilliant for jumping into a coop session with friends or randoms, with each mission lasting not more than 20mins usually.  It's great to pick up and play, shoot the heck out of everything, and then go unlock some more gear.  There is a multiplayer deathmatch mode that I was not interested in, but it seems quite good if you like vs mode.","October 15, 2014","true","1.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Problem with buying this game is that it requires "Games For Windows Live". so basically you need to use your xbox live account, for me it was a huge hassle trying to get the damn game to work since I had no idea it needed GFWL, also need to make sure that you agree to another Terms of Use doc. GFWL will NOT tell you that it needs to be done, if you can't get your profile to work, that's why. This game doesn't really work with Steam and I guess thats the only problem I had with this game.  Other than that this game has huge boss monster fights, loads of guns and grenades, MECHAS, and character customization, what's not to love?

Lost Planet 2 is the second entry into the Lost Planet franchise.\nPROS:\n-lengthy campaign. For those of us casuals who like long single player campaigns, this game does not disappoint. The levels are intense and gripping, and actually fairly difficult.\n-sound effects are on-point. I love the sound of the machine gun firing. I could listen to it all day. The weapon sound effects are spot-on. the grappling sound is perfect. Just in general, this game has audio nailed down.\n-combat is intense. You will blaze through levels, shooting up anything that comes in your path. The boss fights take actual skill and strategy to work (most of the time), though there are the occasional few that you can just hammer with an RPG launcher until they die. Combat system works well, and doesn't need much improvement. AI isn't half bad. Could be better, but not embarrassing.\n*I don't have much knowledge about multiplayer, seeing as how I only recently got this, and need to completely set up my Windows Live account to play online. Sorry*\nCONS:\n-Windows Live. Unless you want to spend a bit of time finnagling Windows Live stuff, you will be unable to save progress in this game. I know that other reviews tell you how to set up a functioning Windows Live account, and I am in the process of doing so myself. If you do take the time to set one up, it's certainly worth it :)\n\nThat's all I can think of for pros and cons. The game itself is surprisingly well-polished, and I enjoy the feel of combat a lot. Boss battles are engaging, but don't generally take more than 20-30 minutes at most (as far as I've played). Game doesn't look poor, or run badly, or anything like that. All in all, an excellent shooter game, that I would recommend to anyone. All you gotta do is take the time to set up a Windows Live account, and you're golden!\n(PLEASE NOTE: I PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER, SO MY OPIONION ON THE CONTROLS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.

Totally original game, not another Gears of War clone. Everything's different from Gears this time, even the engine and approach to level design!\n\nPlaying the game is fun. The balance was improved in comparison with Lost Planet 1 - you're not invincible anymore if you have lots of T-ENG, that change removed boredom from the gameplay.\n\nThe environments are beautiful and various, the cutscenes are stunning. Design of different enemy creatures is very imaginative. In addition to main campaign and multiplayer modes (even including single player matches with well-done bots!), interesting time trial challenges are available, which will require some thinking to find ways to complete obstacle course in time or be effective enough in deathmatch with bots.\n\nLooks like there is also hidden depth in the game, certain elements that will open only to seasoned players. I played coop once, and saw some heavy airstrike that required teamwork in order to call. Pretty rewarding.\n\nSo it's a very enjoyable game overall, and you won't regret it if you get it.

In moments the outcry against GFWL has flooded the forums.  I say keep it up.   The game can be updated, and it's going to take you un installing your old Windows Live, Re installing what is NOW CALLED something WIndows MarketPlace, but it IS what you need, and you will need to update more than once. Even after a PC restart once it seems. But even I was able to get it to work.   You shouldn't have to go through this, but it's possible.   I'd like to see people come home, follow the guides, and get in on LP2 and try to occupy the online space as much as possible.  Let Capcom see we're not playing the falling short SFV as of this writing, and while waiting for it to hopefully become something, show them that LP2 was their last great Lost Planet we want to see fixed, and even MORE of.\n\nI hope to see a chunk of you garner together to hit the snow, jungle, sands, and surly your Vital Suits as we attempt to show a company that after all this time, and even after all this frustration, we want our true LP experience back, and hopefully another. Not like Lost Planet 3, who's developer SPARK is now six feet under, but a TRUE LOST PLANET tittle.\n\nHope to see you out there. We might even have some matches where we do less fighting, and simply exploring all the fine details of what the mechs and weapons can do that have been forgotten by many.  It may be a pipe dream, but I plan on giving it a shot. I hope you will too......]] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere has been a whole lot of negative press about this game, witch is odd because it was one of the last times CAPCOM really did a bunch of things right.\n\n\nTake what you loved about the first one, add some faster running and pacing, a whole lotta things to unlock including weapons and emotes. Even a perk system where you should think about your role out there in the wild from having a lil advantage with a a certain weapon, or a lot with a certain weapon ammo type or type of weapon. You can even make your T Enge consumption a chunk lot less, or sacrafice it all on a load out that when you get yourself a mech, aka a VS, you don't spend ANY fuel. Sound broken? the ballance is in the other draw backs if you don't have what ya got, and you're still far from invincible.\n\nDifferent load outs will work for different people, and there is a whole lot to try. Some of your charachter branches you can even work up in the story experience that sends you through several different groups of EDN III and see how the new incident unfolds before the eyes of them all.\n\n\nYou have your weapons of choice, and you find ammo catagories on the ground for what you've already chosen. So you're going to get what you WANT to play with and ammo for at least two or three in any givin mission or match, VS weapons that you can mount onto or OFF the mechs you find in the field. Just like the modern war machines of today have some basic pull from chopper and use packages. Something that we oddly don't see in modern warfare games. The mechs themselves are diverse, a couple even combind with other mechs!\n\n\nSo what are the cons? Sadly a whole lot less people playing it last time I checked. But then again that was right after LP3 came out. Do I think the multi player or the LP3 experience is better? Hell just about nobody does.\n\n\nPick this one up, epsecialy if it hits a sale as I see it right now it's just bloody five bucks. Some people are even using the LP games as training for the Titanfall experience they look forward too as of this writing. For some the game is faster and a whole lot of carnage can go down.\n\n\nThe worst I really found with this game? Just that, not enough players, but I'll check back soon. Other past issues is that the frame work for the online play was sketchy for multi player, asking more bandwidth than some people had for a real good experience. But now a days we live with a lot more faster connection plans.\n\n\nIf this game can work right now, and people get back involved, it's one of the few mech fests that truly show even non mech finatics they can do plenty in or out of the cockpit. The signature grapling hook game play to hang onto mechs, walls, hang about, even wheel yourself down to pop a friend in the head and slowly wheel yourself back up for a fun moment of comedy, it's all do able. Zip up, shoot something in the face, and back flip off the wall to continue your fight.\n\n\nThis one was worth supporting, as said above it's one of the last time Capcom did things right. Not just in a good set of concepts, but it's actually a time a sci fi, mech including, inovative game poped out from the actual Capcom Developers when they were still with the company AND they were letting their fans and community shape it instead of just themselves.\n\n\nI suggest picking it up, the pros out weight the cons. Especialy now that the price tag is less than even most indie titles where the work here was put in for a true AAA attempt.","December 21, 2013","true","121.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BladeHenge/recommended/45750/","BladeHenge","BladeHenge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BladeHenge/","104 products in account","I really cannot reccomend this game enough. It holds up well for a game made almost 6 years ago, both visually and mechanics/gameplay wise. The Combat both on foot and in Mechs is fun and promotes strong team-play. The mech designs are varied and really promote learning the secret functions (yes, each mech has it own individual secret functions) and promote learning the weak points of each mech so you can effectively take them down while on-foot. The campaign is a little bit of a departure from the first games story with one main character to focuing on 5 individual groups from different backgrounds. I feel this gives the game a terriffic focus of not one group nor several individuals, but the story of the planet, EDN III, and the population dwelling on it as a whole. The bosses in the game do a really good job of varying the tactics needed to beat them and the bosses in episodes 4 and 5 are GREAT in particular! I've played through the campaign at LEAST a dozen times on my old Xbox 360 copy and S-ranked around 95% of the levels. The campaign length is about 6-8 hours but there's tons of replay value as you unlock new guns and can customize your arsenal to your specific playstyle. Each playthrough can be something new, unique and fun if you play with friends and Capcoms signature hilarity shines through in every chapter of the game. For even $20 bucks this is a steal and even more so when it's on sale.","January 1","true","32.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only downside to it is that it does require you to use Games for Windows Live, which can be a pain in the neck to configure.

A bit more annoying than 1 because you will take a lot of dmg and possibly die a lot because your squad mates are as dumb as can be, but there are respawn points and you should have plenty of T-energy. Team members in this game are dumber than hell so expect to be a one-man army. The graphics are awesome and hold up well even by today's standards. The game runs pretty smoothly and combat is great. The worst thing though about the game is that when you fire your view rises up so you need to correct it often which is horribly annoying. Actually the worst part of the game is that mouse control feels horrible because of its delayed reaction feeling. I would say do not bother unless you have a gamepad. I use my xbox 360 pad and it works fine. The cut scenes are enjoyable and the voice acting is pretty good. Definitely worth it on sale for a solid once-through.

The majority of the best things this game has to offer is with a full team of players on the harder difficulties, otherwise the real challenge may not be there.\n\nThat being said, sadly the game is long since past its heyday and there's not that frequent of people who are usually playing online. And the game is one of the few remaining Capcom titles which have not migrated to SteamWorks - Capcom have not detailed plans to change this either, which is a shame because a return to LP2 could respark interest in an otherwise solid game.\n\nIf you can ignore GFWL's limitations, forgive the quickness of the earlier missions, randomised 'slot-machine' rewards (from which is the only way to obtain newer types of weapons), this game is worth a look.\n\n+Great Cooperative action\n+Fun Missions (ignoring earlier chapter 1)\n+Features some mech combat\n+Lots of unlockables and extra game modes.\n\n-GFWL\n-Otherwise rather inactive community.\n-BYO dedicated friends","November 18, 2015","true","57.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Got all the skins, weapons, emotes, and abilities.  Got all the 'slots'.  All characters are level 50 or over.\n\nFIRST OF ALL, this will be a REAL UNBIAS PLAYER REVIEW AND NOT A QUICK WHINEY TEMPERMENTAL FIT FROM SOMEONE WITH 0.5HRS OF "PLAYTIME".  Because you know, it's NEVER you and ALWAYS the game right people!?  With that being said, I didn't like it at first either, I did experience the frustrating GFWL account issues and the initial 'feel' that you can only play this game with friends definitely left a pessimistic aspect in me. I absolutely LOVED the first one and years ago when I sparked LP2 up I was very discouraged at how much it 'seemed' to change. BUT I started playing it for real last week and cannot stop myself from playing it more now. I pre-ordered The Division and want to play it but can't put this game down at the moment.  My advice is to let go of your pride and beat it on Easy first mostly to get acquainted or reacquainted with the game, but mostly so that you can wear the many different skins on multiplayer instead of the 1 default skin. Since beating it on Easy, I breezed past Normal, and am now on Hard in the Campaign mode. At first, I thought it was broken because I couldn't find out how to get past Episode 1 lol, since every Episode is divided into Chapters and then the Chapters are divided into Missions.  There are 6 Episodes in the Campaign mode consisting of 3-5 Chapters each.  MAKE SURE YOU FINISH A CHAPTER before turning off the game or stop playing, or you'll have to do that whole chapter again from the start.  The gameplay itself is very similar to the first Lost Planet.  I first tried to play with a xbox 360 controller but shortly reverted back to mouse & keyboard which instantly improved my aiming capabilities.  My first initial thoughts of the game when I first started it up was how absolutely stunning the graphics were (this was back in 2010), how fluid the gameplay was (the game comes with a benchmark tool to gauge if your computer can handle the gameplay), and the overwhelming (at first) menu screen.  Like most true gamers, I said forget reading the instruction booklet, and only took around 30 minutes of fiddling to fully understand it.  The port seemed very polished to me.  My only challenge now is finding friends who will play the multiplayer co op with me.  The community is pretty much dead (except for campaign play sometimes), but you will find a few people once in a while who will jump in your game.  Personally, to me, it's actually annoying when someone I don't know joins my game since there is no kick option.  But most of the time it's much better to have actual people play with you.  Since there is no kick option, you will either have to deal with them until the chapter is done, or recreate the game session again.  You can also set private slots to 3/3 so no one can join your game as well.  But I have met a couple people recently who aren't "rushers".  Now a days Steam, GMG, Gamersgate, etc has this game on sale for $5 which is an ABSOLUTE STEAL if you have the patience to actually do a little research on how to get it to play properly.  It is a console port after all.  I guarantee you will not regret it!!!!!  I am looking to put AT LEAST a couple hundred hours into this game.\n\nEDIT: I've completed Hard and am working on Extreme now.  I still play the other difficulties because I love playing this game.  My views of others playing with me has changed too since I've been thru the story mode so many repeated times.  So I actually like the run & gun people now :P  But if you're new to the story mode and game, then you should heed the original stand points.\n\nRating:  8/10","March 29, 2012","true","169.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

There are simple fixes for Win 10 too, just look at the forums.\n\nLP2 has lots of replayability because of the different weapons you unlock ingame and GJ awards to obtain. The community is still allive just head over to the Official LP group wich is dedicated to LP1 colonies , LP2 and 3.\nUnlike Left for dead or other similar 4 player co op games there are more possible co op atacks interactions and strategies to be used to take down huge akrid bosses, play a team deathmatch or just to make it throught certain parts of the game on extreme difficulty.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

That being said, Lost Planet 1 is a much superior game. The problem is they focused so much on the multiplayer aspect that it leaves the game lacking. First of all, you can't play it without windows live which sucks. I hate having to download and use a system in order to play a game. I even don't like Uplay or Origin so Live sucks too. Plus the game is good but not great. The story is all over the place and your AI suck. It was meant to be co op but the game is so old that the community is pretty much dead. If the map is big your AI wander around doing nothing. Plus the game has the lost planet 1 problem in that there is no running. You go everywhere at a leisurely pace. Also the game does not nearly have enough mech combat which is what made the first game such a major success. I don't think this game was worth the 5 bucks I spent but at least the game has some good length with a 10 hour campaign. The problem is because it’s a multiplayer co op game; you can't save the game until you finish the entire mission. Worse, you can't even pause it! This means you have to devote a half an hour to an hour to the game without stopping. Also you can't get the really good weapons unless you get lucky in their lame slot machine. Now don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun playing it. I think it was a major letdown from the first game and they could have done better. In its prime this was probably a great game but now it’s just a relic. Honestly, I didn't want to pay five bucks but that was a cheap as it would go and I want to play the whole franchise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/recommended/45750/","m_friebe","m_friebe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/m_friebe/","650 products in account","NOTE: This review is only evaluating the game concerning its single-player merits.\n\nYou know that scene from the movies, right? Where the new kid in school gets introduced in front of the class, and everyone looks at him/her with a mild mixture of disinterest and disdain? That’s how I felt when I started up Lost Planet for the first time. The game is all like „Oooh, look at our multiplayer content! Shiny! Now grab some friends and play this game how we want you to, DAMMIT!“ My reply: „But… I want to play a single-player campaign. Is this possible, too?“ The game averts its gaze, annoyed: „Yeah, I guess… freak.“\n\nThe game constantly hits you over your head with the fact that it’s really meant to be played in multi-player. For single-player fans, this makes things awkward. Where do I start? What about the AI stand-ins that accompany you, with silly “gamertag” names over their heads all the time? The “Battle Gauge” system, which is basically a multi-player “army strength” system? A system that respawns you right back into the running game without resetting to a checkpoint, complete with a respawn countdown? The team zones at the end of the levels, which are red boxes that all players – human and AI – have to be inside to complete the mission? Or that the game rewards you for using gestures in these team zones? I could go on and on, but you get the point. For single-player modes, immersion is key, and this game’s insistence on its multi-player infrastructure is a major immersion-killer.\n\nBut even if you are able to ignore this, there are still the absence of a noteworthy story and the jarring transitions. As you are a part of an actually-meant-for-multiplayer squad, there is no real protagonist, a detriment which is exasperated by the fact that you switch back and forth through multiple squads belonging to different parties during the course of the campaign. This wouldn’t be bad if each squad was somehow distinct, but this isn't the case. They are all faceless soldiers. No, literally, they are all wearing masks or helmets all the time! Then, there are the transitions, a problem which was already present in the first game. Episodes which should be one consistent sequence of levels connected by cutscenes are always broken up into artificial “missions”. And it gets worse: A tense shootout against enemy dropships ends in the middle of combat because an arbitrary “energy bar” hit zero – with ships still in the air!\n\nAll these things amount to the game’s greatest sin: Its clumsy and wasteful handling of its setpieces. Here’s where I have something positive to say about the game: Lost Planet 2 features a collection of stunning setpieces. Really, they are as epic as you can get. If they had been used by someone who knows how to craft a good single-player game, this could have been an action blockbuster for the ages. However, the dire reality is that without a meaningful story and an immersive presentation, these setpieces remain fragments without significance or emotional impact.\n\nIf you’re looking for an opinion about the multi-player component of Lost Planet 2, please consult a review addressing this aspect. However, if you look for a great single-player experience, stay away. It’s sadly not worth the effort.","May 7","false","9.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But only for people coming from monster hunter or expecting that type of experience throughout. I'll tell you why.\n\nFirstly, It's too hard to swallow. Skipping videos after two to 10 minutes of gameplay is not really enough to make it feel like any other co-op shooting experience in the sense that there is enough to do or even enough to see. You'll be turning pages more than you'll be reading. It's too much to be repeated without noticing and being fatigued by it.\n\nNext, Anyone who has faith in the game itself can see the amount of love and care that went into the mechanics of the game, this grenade can be shot to explode, this one has a delay, this gun does stun damage, this one freeezes them, you can reload and throw grenades while on a zipline, THERE'S A FREAKING ZIPLINE, and it's useful. Everything You can see, You can get for yourself. You level up enough, You can wear it all.\n\nThen, there's the customization system, Which is actually pretty cool, But after you find out that it's easier to beat missions and dash fr credits than it is to actually level characters, and that there's no real point outside of getting full customization, You'll have an empty victory pulling the slot machine.\n\nFinally, It's too short. In games with massive levels like halo, you'll notice a lot of goofing off mid mission and places where you go, hey screw it, I'm going to throw a sticky at my bro. Yes, you can do it here, but honestly, there's not too much content to get you outside of a heavy grind for parts, and then a heavier grind for the full customization perk. I don't even know If I am going to go after that. This is the type of game that needed DLC Badly. There's a lot of effort and ideas swirling around a toilet sized game, and the way it's designed, everyone is trained to flush past the cutscenes and then it's kind of over. Great for couch co-op I guess.\n\nWell\n\nAS A NOT MONSTER HUNTER RELATED GAME.\n\nIt's a different, fully featured unique shooting experience that changes at a moments notice. Someone joins your group and you've been using energy gear, it gets a sheer cost boost, enemies get harder and your harmonizer does a whole lot less to help. Watching as you have to change strategy completely on a hair is something that is usually not influenced by people, So when your non co op friend finally decides to get a homie to play with, the game has changed, and becomes more team based rather than a hoarde for energy.\n\nIt's very easy to get into and play, and there is lots of room for error. Simple remedies to enemies attacks like... jump, could be integral to surviving and not wasting thousands in energy. There is a very rock paper scissors type of loadout system that will help in different situations, as well as save your friends if need be. Which is pretty amazing.\n\nPeople who came from the first title could probably see the difference and either hate it or love it. Personally taking it in is a mixed bag because there is actually bigger maps and much more exploration required as well as a more solid story in the older title, and those that were like me going, It's not co-op!? get a fun sized treat from capcom that shows us we were pretty much right that it could have been co-op.\n\nPersonally, they could totally address the 50 year gap that the first character faced in extreme condition... Where they take it is up to them, but a survival styled heat based adventure could be cool, make your own weapons, perks whatever, run around empty areas and fighting akrid is pretty spot on with the game as well as finding NEVEC areas and destroying  them. Obviously a time sink, however, it would be a way to stuff all of the mechanics they bothered to make into a suitable game. Things like the crossing story could be thrown in, where people who are playing on NEVEC could cross paths with other players and ruin their progress. But that's what lost planet was anyway at first, a great idea that could be beaten to hell, the vigoroth of lost planet, in terms of pokemon.","July 7, 2015","true","48.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, for my taste, that is. It's a third person co-op shooter in which you work together with a team to take down monsters and other enemies in a detailed jungle. Though the acting is pretty awkward with the dubbing and the gameplay can sometimes be repetitive, Lost Planet 2 is a pretty enjoyable game with a variety of missions.

Just horrible in all aspects. The campaign isn't really a campaign, it's mini-levels that are placed in order so you and some co-op buddies can kill things without thinking. But for some reason, even if you're playing solo- there needs to be a 10 second countdown at the end of each chapter...Why? The story attempts to explain something about jungle pirates fighting your team (who are all nameless and generic) and along the way you kill the monsters of the planet. But the story isn't really where this game fails; it's everything else. It fails as PC port (from customizable controls), from a controls aspect (aiming with the mouse), from an objective aspect (if you're playing solo, the 4 AI characters that play with you can do 100% of the work. From turning on the waypoints, to killing enemies, you can basically spring from the start of the level to the end without lifting a finger. It's just not a well polished product. The only redeeming quality of Lost Planet 2 is the monster design.

It amazes me how a modern game like this doesn't have a simple and intuitive button layout.\nDidn't like the gameplay also. It just seemed to mechanic with the character being stuck in animations most of times. (It would made sense to have the possibility to interrupt a reload animation to dodge an incoming attack and try the reload again after.)\nThe sound appeared to have some issues. The volume would decrease randomly. Could have been something to do with my hardware. Not sure.\n\nI guess the only positive thing I have to say is about the visuals.

It's the result of Capcom trying to design a western-style game, so it's full of explosions, forced co-op, giant monsters, scripted nonsense, and not even a hint of balance or well-designed gameplay mechanics. The bosses are all giant impressive monsters that are all utterly boring to fight without the tells or tough but fair balance of MonHun, which this game tries to pretend it apes with all the heavy movement and plodding animations.\n\nIs it worth it? Probably.

The lush forests, infinite deserts, rocky shores and meteor filled locations in the game give the different story campaigns an identity. Different campaigns and locations bring a bit of fun with physics, namely some underwater and in outer space where your movement is altered due to lower gravity.\n\nLost Planet 2 plays great on my PC, I run with an AMD 8350 processor with an HD 7950 GPU. I get constant 60 frames per second, which would be higer with Vsync disabled.\n\nDespite GFWL going down, the game does feature LAN connectivity for co-op and multiplayer, which can be emulated over the internet with programs like Evolve, so there is no reason to not go through the campaign after GFWL servers go down.","June 21, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are complicated at the beginning so I would advise to play with a gamepad. Weakest points of this game are it's story, control scheme and most of the time linear levels ( well, there are levels where you can choose path to go but once you've played through them twice it gets a bit boring ).\n\nI don't really care much about the story in the games but rather I enjoy atmosphere and immersion. This game does this right. I really enjoy riding giant mechs, harsh enviroments and alien enemies. On top of that this game feels very "Japanese"... just like Binary Domain and Yakuza series on Ps3 ( which to me it's a good thing :).\n\nOriginally I have played this and finished it on xbox 360 and later on Ps3 and I have to say this game is one of my all times favorites.\n\nReally fun co-op experience which rely on strategy and working together to achieve mission goal ( hunting huge bosses, stealth missions etc. ) immersion is great and awesome customisation options! Seriously there is a lot of guns, perks and clothing styles to choose from... If you enjoy third person shooters then give it a try .\n\nOne more thing. Be aware that PvP multiplayer is unfair and unbalanced. People who played the game and have unlocked a lot of guns and perks will have upper hand. However as a Co Op experience its unique.

The lush forests, infinite deserts, rocky shores and meteor filled locations in the game give the different story campaigns an identity. Different campaigns and locations bring a bit of fun with physics, namely some underwater and in outer space where your movement is altered due to lower gravity.\n\nLost Planet 2 plays great on my PC, I run with an AMD 8350 processor with an HD 7950 GPU. I get constant 60 frames per second, which would be higer with Vsync disabled.\n\nDespite GFWL going down, the game does feature LAN connectivity for co-op and multiplayer, which can be emulated over the internet with programs like Evolve, so there is no reason to not go through the campaign after GFWL servers go down.","June 21, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's co-op campaign is lengthy and incredibily fun, easily replayable too. The boss fights are fun and each has it's own mechanic, not just "shoot weakspot until dead". While I never really played the VS. Multiplayer from what I remember it was just as fun. If I had to think of cons for this game, the only major one would be it uses GFWL.

Stop! This game uses GamesForWindowsLive. Another dumb ♥♥♥ piece of useless bloatware that you must install and sign up for just to play this.  This game has no carry over characters from LP1 & even less of a coherent story. No quirky or lovable characters - just bland unsympathetic ones - the "protagonist/s" are not particularly likable, nor do you care what happens to them. New modes and character customization are added this time around- and it needs more of them, otherwise same again.\nAll game progress and customization is handled by GFWL so forget trying to back-up your savegame.

Even playing with complete strangers is a fun experience. Suffers noticably in single player though. Plus GFWL makes the game unplayable for some.\n\n+Levels consisting of Episodes, broken into chapters, which in turn are broken into missions (in which weapons carry over from one to another) lends itself extremely well to co-op play and play sessions of varying length.\n+Satisfying weapon feedback\n+Large variety of vehicles that all handle differently. Many of which have 'secret' moves\n+Huge variety of environments; making each mission feel different from the last.\n+Large variety of abilities and weapons adds replay value and variety in play-styles.\n+Eight key-bound emotes, along with a huge pool of usable ones (some being more communicative, others being silly) can make characters feel alive if used liberally\n+Gunplay is not twitchy, making the game more accessible to those not as good at aiming. Positioning and cover is important in combat as well.\n+Giant monster fights. A must for kaiju fans.\n\n~Hammy, B-movie story and characters\n~Movement system along with non-standard keybind locations (I highly reccomend you don't change the Grenade/Shoot binds) can take some getting used-to\n~World does not feel "built for the player", but rather "built for the character". Many environments feel claustrophobic due to the distant third-person camera. Eyesight is also important as enemies are not immediately distingiushable from the environment in some levels. But this also means that levels feel 'natural' despite their linearity.\n\n-RNG-based unlock system (although not as bad as you might think, because it works from a limited pool; once you get all the boring stuff like name-tags out the way, you can get weapons and abilities en-masse because they're all thats left)\n-Weak single-player experience.\n-Games For Windows Live, which gives many people trouble (I didn't have any, but there's many reports of it)","November 28, 2015","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Now it's time for anyone who hasn't already bought it to get it. This is a great coop game. The story is complete, utter, garbage, but let's be honest here... You're not playing for the story, you're playing so you can beat the game and unlock the ability to dress up as a girl with 3 of your buddies and kill giant monsters. Yes, you have to deal with GfWL, but it's so worth it to put up with GfWL just to enjoy this one single game.\n\nThere are QTEs sprinkled throughout the game, and failure can mean a hillarious death for yourself while your friends laugh about the mine collapsing on you. Everything is VERY Japanese and VERY over-the-top. I've played this with a buddies who have accidently activated the self-destruct sequence on their vehicles several times over as if they've forgotten it every time.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, running off of Capcom's proprietary in-house engine MT Framework, the same engine they've been updating release after release. The akrid you fight in this game get so huge, it almost looks like you're playing Monster Hunter half the time. I mean the controls are so terrible that you might as well be playing Monster Hunter. The maps in the campaign have multiple exits which can lead to different spawn locations and areas in the follwoing maps where you can find weapons or vehicles that can give you an edge against an upcoming boss fight. The story makes absolutely no sense for the majority of the game because each episode tells a different faction's story until it all comes together in the final episode where everything finally makes sense (sort of), but before you tackle the final mission, you get to play as the Space Mexicans in easily the best and/or most frustrating missions. Those missions will be frustrating at first due to controls but you will get used to it after multiple playthroughs. Yes, this game is worth multiple playthroughs because you are buying this game to play with your friends and shoot giant monsters together. Do NOT buy this game if you intend to play with the AI only. As mentioned before, some levels are going to be frustrating and that frustration is multiplied by how many terrible AI partners you have to deal with. This game, at version 1.0 needed a patch so that AI deaths didn't count against your own death count, they are that bad. If you are stubborn enough to deal with the AI, or you've played through the game enough, you'll get used to it.\n\nFantastic game. I bought it on 360 and PC. Shame the PC version doesn't get Marcus Fenix and Dom from Gears of War. Seeing Dom do the Here Kitty Kitty emote was worth the price of entry.","December 22, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are really weird, but servicable. Player movement is slow, but feels responsive. What really trips me up is how this game doesn't play to its' own strengths. The most fun things in this game are fighting monsters, and piloting mechs. But you really rarely get to do either of those in this game, and in some cases when you do, there are usually different elements that get in the way or change the gameplay temporarily. For instance, after a long campaign of shooting up other soldiers, you have to fight this giant monster along side a train, but you fight it by loading and firing a giant gun. Its tedious. I wanna jump and run around the monster and fight on its back and junk! Its just not very creative or fun doing the same process of loading the canon, charging the bullet, and waiting for an opening on the monsters weak point (especially without co op partners). There's also this really interesting tool called the anchor, which is basically a grappling hook, that's really fun in theory but not polished enough to be very useful. You can anchor and mount on some enemies (monsters, mechs) and stick grenades to them or shoot them point blank. Its super cool! But there's not enough of it! This game came so close to beeing a cooler/different monster hunter, but blunders because of its focus on human enemies.","January 1","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The poor rating is hugely misleading and I'm unaware as to why. It's a solid 3rd person shooter. To be fair, if you're looking for any kind of game with depth, it's a Capcom game. Then again, if you're looking for a game with depth, why are you looking at a Capcom game? Voice acting is actually solid for a such a foreign game, and the plot line is interesting enough. The visuals are gloriously fantastic and not too demanding. Overall, great game, if you're considering, it's for the right reasons. Buy it, don't expect a Saving Private Ryan esque plot, and get ready for a fun pure shooter.","December 27, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Stick with it, and you'll get into a well drawn game that isn't really as complex or enthralling as you'd wish.  Episodal, dip in and out here and there, has its very own quirks, and a fair few of them too, so if you're expecting Mass Effect, you won't get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nolfinkol/recommended/45750/","Nolfinkol","Nol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nolfinkol/","87 products in account","I played the crap out of this game with a friend when it released on Xbox 360. It's packed full of content and engaging gameplay to keep you occupied for hours. Essentially it's Monster Hunter but with the focus being on guns over melee (except for the one and only gunblade in the game) and a large variety of giant mechs to drive around. I'd say it's easier by comparison but that doesn't mean it's any less fun.\n\nLet me list off a few things about this game:\n\n* Giant creatures to shoot at\n* Not quite as giant mechs to pilot, repair, and swap mech weapons found on the map  (some mechs even require multiple players to pilot efficiently)\n* Tons of various guns, character skins you can mix and match (once you beat the game once), titles, and emotes to give all of the players thumbs ups and silly dances\n* Huge focus on multiplayer modes (you can play by yourself with AI bots but it's not nearly as helpful or fun as online)\n* Grappling hooks for climbing and closing in on giant enemies weakpoints\n\nThe main things lacking in this game is a better written story as it does a decent job but feels like something is missing or it could have been better executed. The dialogue and events are good but not presented in a way where the majority of the scenes are memorable because they involve characters you'll soon forget as you switch perspectives to another team throughout the campaign. However, despite the story leaving more to be desired, the game itself is still a blast if you have at least one friend to play it with. There's plenty of unlockables to discover and show off between you and certain gameplay features do better with friends to amplify the experience. If you don't mind playing with strangers through the campaign matchmaking then more power to you!\n\nSome people complain that you have to log in to the game through Games for Windows Live but I have yet to see what's so bad about it. After remembering the login info for my Xbox Live account I was playing in no time.

To this day, the game still holds up.  The graphics, gameplay, and fun-factor (whatever that means) is still holding up.  Graphics still looks very good to this day, the monsters(or Akrid) are still fun to fight.  Story is, like usual, very simple and weak, but very understandable.  Mechas are still awesome to use:  There are also new variants added to the game.\n\nEven now, there are still things I could do that I didn't know.  For example you can Combine VS (the spider-tank thing and one of the standard VS, forgot the name) and that if your team-mates are carrying that giant laser cannon thing, you can combine them together like some power-ranger/super-sentai thing.  This game is obviously made for Co-op.  Before this game was released, I had some doubts on why they made this game Co-op focused, I can see why.  ITS F*CKING FUN!  gameplay has been revamped and they added a sprint or dash feature: very helpful since some of the maps are big.\n\nDownside?  Not a lot of people playing.  Well there was the sale for Lost Planet franchise few days ago that brought in a lot of new players and some veterans back, but the population for the game is practically dead.  Campaign Online is alive though, thats the good thing.  Multiplayer is dead, don't bother with it. The game is still using GFWL (Don't really have much of a problem with it personally, but it was a pain trying to get the game to launch thanks to it).","March 4","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You travel across 4-5 places on the planet (desert, tundra, jungle, etc) and take control of different characters with different situation, motives, friends and climate, but one same goal : killing those creatures! Gameplay is simple : shoot the orange thingy, or headshot. Run, grapple, pilot a mech or vehicule. Grab nasty bigass weapons or play it human scale.\n\nThe only thing I can blame on this game is that characters feel heavy to control, even with sprint. Moving in the levels sometime is boring and the fov isn't great neither. But if you handle the game how it is, you will have a great time.","May 29","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
