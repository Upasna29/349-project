Most topics on the community hub are a few days old too. Not a good sign.\n\n**Almost 5 hours played and I seem to get bored after an hour or 2. I tried both what seems to be the easiest setting and "normal"; however I am not hitting that "lose yourself" in the gameplay mood I have with other strategy/sims. **Dev communication is on point -They released information for possible additions on 2/29/2016, however there are no set patch dates or any kind of ETA on when we could see more content. They had some bug fixes roll out but nothing game changing.\n\nThe game is enjoyable overall and I feel that with strong updates the game could become something great (and well worth $16 or more even)... just as it is now I would wait and see what the developers do within the coming weeks. Feels like a beta more than a release.\n\nPros:\n>>Strong Survival/Strategy/Sim potential.\n>>Game has a rough charm and systems that could work well if they were more polished/in-depth.\n>>The multiple layers system allows for many possibilities when designing a bunk.\n\nCons:\n>>Research can be completed almost too easily (especially if you have more than 1 scientist).\n>>Bunk residents are generally annoying – They don’t seem to manage their jobs and personal affairs very well.\n>>Older residents and children are completely useless in terms of gameplay (maybe add a classroom function for children(unlocks 1 additional random job choice or something) and add in some chore style jobs for elderly(teaching children, maybe only elderly can do research even)).\n\nTip if you buy:\n>> Play on 1 or 2 speed (> or >>) ... Playing on 3 is fine but you will zip though the game pretty fast to cycle 50. **You don't have to end at 50 but it seems to be the soft end game goal.\n\nFor now I will vote “Negative” and update as I play throughout the month of March. I really WANT to like the game more and hopefully some updates will help.\n\nTL:DR - Game seems like an Early Access rather than a released game. For an easy, norm, hard playthough stopping at 50 cycle you may get about 10-12 hours of gameplay out of it. Not horrible for $16.","February 26","false","4.8"," 129 of 157 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","129","157","7","5"

LiB puts you in the role of Warden of a bunker right after the somewhat ambiguous events that have forced you underground (there is a little intro cutscene but it’s not clear what it actually shows). Starting with only the bare minimum you’ll need to quickly begin expansions in your bunker in order to meet the needs of your starting group of ten inhabitants. Your bunker’s habitants will of course need the basics such as oxygen, food and water but they’ll also need entertainment and ways of exercising in the bunker so they can stay happy and healthy. Meeting their needs is no easy feat though, you’ll often find yourself dangerously close to catastrophe!\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developers.\n\nLiB’s low poly graphics look good and fit the game well, even on the game’s lowest graphics settings (though I’m not convinced that there is actually a difference between the different graphic presets, I certainly can’t tell if there is). The UI is well designed for the game and easy to navigate, particularly the building menus.\n\nThe aim of the game is to keep your bunker going for 50 cycles (500 years) at which point the massive bunker door will unlock and you’re humans can return to the surface, this is the game’s win condition. However, you don’t have to leave at this point and you can continue playing for as long as you like though the devs have said in the forums that they plan to add a proper endless mode to the game at some point soon. 50 cycles is the equivalent of around four generations which means that you’ll need a steady flow of new humans so that once your first ten inhabitants become too old to work you’re not left with a gaping hole in your work force. Luckily for you there’s an incubator which you can use to ‘grow’ humans, when they’re born they’ll be children but one cycle later they’ll be old enough to work. Every human has certain jobs that they are capable of doing and these are randomly chosen. However, you can spend research points to ensure that the babies will be capable of a specific job, more on research later.\n\nThe meat and potatoes of the game is designing and building your bunker. You’ll have to get your workers to clear the dirt and rock away so that you can use the game’s simple building system to set up everything your humans could ever need. All you have to do is mark what you want removed and your workers will get busy, the same applies to building, you simply decide where you want something and it’ll be built as soon as your workers are available. There are upgrades to improve the speed of destroying and building things too and these are unlocked using research points. Research points are earned by having a scientist at a research station (it’s worth mentioning you can have as many as you like) and they’ll earn you points over time which can then be spent on unlocking new objects or upgrading current ones/the capabilities of your workers. Sounds pretty easy so far, the real challenge comes from effectively managing your resources and planning ahead. You do start off with plenty of building materials and food but your supplies will be quickly depleted and so it’s incredibly important to set up ways of getting more of these very early on. While food is obviously very important, it’s actually a lot easier to run out of building materials just when you need them most. Life support objects require a huge amount of building materials and if you run out just when you need more life support you’re going to be well and truly stuffed, hence planning ahead for such situations is important. Anyway, you can get more building materials by using ore converters which will take the ore you mine from deposits and convert them into building materials. This is quite a slow process but thankfully the speed of the mining machine and the converter can be upgraded.\n\nWhile the first level of your bunker is quite small and has few resources (unless you set the map size to large) you can expand your bunker vertically, not just horizontally. With four levels for you to work with you actually end up with a huge amount of space and, honestly, it’s rather daunting. That’s not to say it’s a bad thing, it most certainly isn’t, but expanding into a new level is pretty challenging and requires a lot of stored resources. Not only will you need a lift to the new level (requiring a lot of building materials), you’ll also need a power, oxygen and water supply for the level as you can’t build cables and pipes vertically and the lift is sealed so your oxygen won’t make it down either. Once you’re down on the level you will have a little bit of oxygen to work with but you’ll need to get those suppliers set up quickly if you want your workers to actually work and not just asphyxiate.\n\nLiB may be focused on the building side of things but that doesn’t mean there’s not an element of danger in the game. As well as the obvious problems associated with running out of food or water, you’re also faced with cave-ins and molemen. I haven’t actually seen a human get killed or injured during a cave-in but I’d guess that if debris falls on top of them it won’t do them much good. Cave-ins can be prevented by building floors as when you build floors your workers also build ceilings which will prevent dirt and rocks from falling on you. Molemen appear to be mutated humans that have mole-like qualities. They’ll sometimes dig up into your bunker and start attacking your inhabitants, even kill them if they become overpowered by the molemen. Thankfully these pesky little so-and-so’s can also be stopped by building floors on top of the dirt floor as this will prevent them from digging up into your bunker. Your inhabitants can also get ill but as long as you have enough infirmaries to handle all of them (infirmaries are also staffed by scientists) these illnesses shouldn’t be too much cause for concern. Then again, there will sometimes be outbreaks of illness and disease which will put serious pressure on your infirmaries and not dealing with these outbreaks effectively can be fatal.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is how the AI works. Even if a bunch of stuff breaks down, putting the entire bunker at risk, the engineers will just carry on with their life until it’s their time to work. When there’s no food the cooks won’t bother cooking more until it’s their time to work etc. For the most part, this isn’t really an issue, but when these situations do arise it’s a huge problem and I’ve had this kind of thing lead to what is effectively a complete failure of the bunker, it’s pretty damn frustrating. The other problem with the AI, while less pressing, is more frequent, your inhabitants will often leave a job without finishing it. Seeing a worker walk from one side of the bunker to the other just to do 20% of a job is again, rather frustrating.\n\nVerdict\nLife in Bunker is an enjoyable strategy simulation game that adds a new and interesting scenario to the city/colony building genre. Whether you’re incredibly good at these kinds of games or, like myself, you’re not too good at keeping fictional humans alive, you’re going to have fun with this game.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 25","true","8.5"," 114 of 157 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","114","157","6","7"

But it has two major flaws i find so big, that it drags the rest of the experience down with it.\n\nLets break it down.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xWR6Azn58o\n\n\n\nGraphically the game isn't insane or amazing. The stylized graphics are mostly nice to look at in pastel coloring, but the low-poly citizens are not great with animations that are sub par. The various icons and UI though are spot on - no confusion at all and convey all they need at a glance.\n\nSound wise the game there is nothing remarkable about it, which often means that sound is okay....which is the case here as well. Sounds do the job and the options menu for\nsounds is phenomenal.\n\nPerformance is fine, FPS sticks above 100 at all times on my system (GTX780) and can be capped if you so desire, though i've noticed no screen tearing to speak of.\n\nBut...it's a sim game, and those thrive on two things: Progressions and pacing, and here the flaws come in.\nProgression wise the games goal is to last 50 "cycles", but the game doesn't allow progression to that point. By cycle 20, you are done with all your building / research options.\nYou can put the game on, mostly, auto-play and walk away until you win. This also ties into the Ore & Mining system with finite resources that you will run out of and be\nunable to progress forward in your settlement.\n\nWhile i'm sure the idea here is to force decisions on you, it makes for a sub par sim experience as you simply stop being able to do... anything.\n\nWhich ties into pacing.\n\nThe game throws you in, and lets you start rapidly building your bunker, you have to manage a dozen needs and requirements and juggle available materials everywhere.\nThe game shines at this point where you are forced to pick between a variety of food or a better leisure environment, or more babies or etc... pretty good.\nbut as soon as you stabilize around cycle 5... there is no further decision making, everything turns linear and only boils down to "how long before i run out of mining resources".\n\nSo i'm conflicted... the game starts great and has all the tools it needs... but then falls flat on it's face at the midway point.","February 25","true","37.9"," 71 of 100 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","71","100","2","1"

Once during my gameplay, the water pump broke and the engineer did absolutely nothing to resolve. He was perfectly healthy and the servicing priority was set to ten. That was the only time I was legitimately frustrated with the AI.\n\nDespite the faults it has, they can be easily fixed. I hope the developers really try their hardest to make this game the best it can. As I am writing this, they are currently working on a big update so I'm looking forward to that.

The idea that everyone in the bunker has to chip in comes through quickly, and it does shine when you've got to really micro-manage your resources, switching roles around to deal with a certain crisis. But when I mean “a great game is really trying to break out”, I'm talking about the fact that the implementation falls apart in terms of execution. A lack of control over certain actions of your residents is a major problem in a game that asks for so much finite precision, that you'll wonder what you really could have done to stop the latest issue, even if you focused entirely on it. It's a game that doesn't understand how to complement it's core gameplay, as clunky menus and a lack of hotkeys make it more troublesome then it needs to be. And once you've got the main set of buildings up, it's really just waiting around for the end, as the mid/late game needs a LOT more variety. In the end, Life is Bunker is for the hardcore simulator fans wanting a challenge, but those who get frustrated easily and want a little more of a walkthrough before diving in will find a game that's really going to kick your ♥♥♥, and not apologize for it.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nCore simulation aspects do work, and I like the balance that you have to achieve within your bunker. You can't specialize in this game: everyone's important, and I like the fact that the janitor can be as important as the scientist.\nLike the idea that multiple types of food give you bonuses when your cooks go at it.\nDifficult and Brutal, but I like it for that. It doesn't mess around, and trying to figure out what exactly you need to do to pull yourself out of a tail spin is nice. I like the fact that the death of your bunker is slow, it's not sudden. It forces you to think about what you did to get it to that point.\nLike the fact that the game rewards you for redundant systems, as things can break. Putting down another set of electrical lines can be rather important.\nLike the emphasis on people being a resource, and that research points can be used to make a specific person.\nThe music selection is solid for a smaller game like this.\nNegatives:\nAI. In a god type game where you're controlling everyone, you need absolute control so you can maximize what's going on, but you don't have it here. You'll have to step through plans as opposed to working them out as your workers will do what they want a good amount of the time.\nAnd that's if the AI doesn't do something completely stupid, like build itself into a closed off environment.\nExpect to restart several times during the first few hours. The game doesn't hold your hand: and that will lead to a bunch of failed runs, as you overspend resources and can't recover, or just have a bad case of luck.\nLacks a connection to your bunker in terms of purpose. You don't really connect to your residents, even when you can name them, as the story wise element of things just don't really do it.\nThe molemen aka enemies really didn't cause me problems.\nNeeded more buildings/research options for the long haul to a certain extent. Will lose that mid/late game variety as you're really just building the same stuff over and over again.\nWhen playing through the tutorial puts you in a bad situation to succeed: yeah that may be a sign that you need to help the user a little better during it.\nImplementation wise, it's all over the place. It's a game that's got its core concepts down, but a lot of the small details regarding submenus and status information placement makes me question if a lot of focus testing or real gameplay testing was done over the long haul.\nLack of purpose and integrated story telling.\nTo extend that last point, more hotkeys for certain submenus would have been really nice to have here. You've got a key for playing the next trap, but not a key for bringing up the research menu specifically? That seems strange.\nSeveral important pieces of information are buried in sub menu screens that they don't need to be.","March 10","false","6.0"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","28","41","4","0"

Your job is to keep a few dozen plates spinning until the timer runs out, carefully trying to guide your bunker society toward a sustainable balance. This is kept challenging thanks to a scarcity of resources and a crush of demands that ensure you have to stay on your toes (expand too fast and you won't be able to maintain what you have and risk attack from molemen, expand too slowly and your people will start to suffer from starvation and sickness).

There are little UI tweaks that would help (a bit of simplification - for example to build a bunker wall you must go into a menu, then clock a submenu, and then click on the wall, which would make sense if there was more than one type of wall to build, maybe hotkeys? - and making it easier to tell how things are going at a glance). I'm also worried about replayability, since once you've "solved" the game then it doesn't offer any other modes or challenges.\n\nBut overall it's a good little game in an underserved genre that deserves some attention.","February 28","true","4.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

You will design the entire bunker yourself, you'll assign Professions to the people of your bunker, you will manage your resources and you will make babies (in Incubators!)The various Professions all perform tasks essential to the survival of their fellow bunkmates, such as being Janitors, Workers, Farmers, Cooks, Scientists, etc. You will be responsible for creating the living quarters, work areas, rest areas, kitchens, restroom facilities and even maintain enough Power and Water supply to keep your bunker functioning properly. Also, Beware of the Molemen......\n\nPositives:\n+ Great Concept and Idea\n+ Easy to Learn\n+ The Developer Appears to be Incredibly Active\n\n\nNegatives:\n- Too pricey for the lack of depth. It seems rather shallow as of right now.\n- Small buggy stuff, like a power/water supply bug that appears to resolve itself if you exit/restart the game.\n- No "interaction" between objects. Put whatever, wherever, with some rare exceptions as to floor tile it must be on. Otherwise, feel free to construct that KitcheBathroom you've always dreamed of. IOW, there is no planning needed. Plop toilets next to beds, showers in the kitchen. Rooms are mere concepts, man. I reject them entirely.\n\nAll in all, I admit to being disappointed. I was really looking forward to this title, as I have long been a fan of city-building games, resource management games, etc. THis game was too shallow to really feel enjoyable. I quite literally tried 6 different times to get into it, and just felt like I was going through the motions moreso than actually enjoying the gameplay. The most fun I had is when I tried to see how I could kill off the bunker using the game mechanics (removing toilets, allowing the Molemen to run free when all that was left were children, etc.). I feel like I could give it a solid recommendation IF it were an Early Access game and this was just the beginning of a much deeper experience. I do like the fact that the Dev has been incredibly receptive to feedback and genuinley wants to make a great game the clicks with his audience. Unfortunately, I think the expectation was that it would be a depeer, longer game that what we've gotten so far.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI cannot go higher than a 3/10 and would strongly suggest that you wait for a good sale that slashes the price down to about $5. Fans of similar types of games might be able to squeeze a good $5 of fun out of it.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n\n(Thanks again to the awesome Manic Ado and The Hidden Levels Team!)","March 5","false","7.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

I can't recommend it unless you get it on sale.\n\nLife in Bunker reminds me about my Dungeon Keeper childhood. But in a different setting, one where you're surviving underground long enough to ascend to the surface. What it does, it does well. It doesn't impress visually though. And I can't stop myself from thinking they could have done more. Things like scenarios with objectives. Reach 100% happiness for 10 min. Grow 50 residents. Build X of this. Objectives like that to create a more solid all around game. As it is it might feel a bit shallow.

(maybe add in some more upgrade features?)\nThere are a few drawbacks in the game play, as well as the tutorial! The 2 big issues I have (and hope that might be updated in the future!) are\nYou can't drag out rectangular/Square shapes when destroying and building (open rooms with walls and closed shapes with floors and destroying).\nThe other thing is the tutorial. It is created in a good way that explains everything however even though the way it takes you is good it also seems that between the length of it and the cost of going through those things first, it almost forces the player into a corner. This doesn't happen usually when you play the game without the tutorial but following it to a T will corner you I have found. So perhaps an update in there somewhere would be nice.\n--Enjoyment-- Overall I really enjoyed this game and will continue to play it. It's on the relaxing side, while a nice refreshing take on the strategy simulator/survival genre.\nI definitely recommend this game, and for those of you who would enjoy seeing my play-through feel free to check out my let's play video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXijUmwvNpU\n\nThanks!","March 8","true","8.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

I was hovering between 7 and 8 because frankly, while not the deepest game in its genre, it's still quite good. The gameplay is simple yet has the possibility to be challenging, the application itself is stable (and is receiving the proper amount of developer attention) and most importantly, it has the potential to expand into a game on-par with some of the best city/dungeon/whathaveyou builder games out there.\n\nIt still has its shortcomings, as I said before, depth being one of them: once you've calculated and conquered the proper build sequence, most encounters do become slightly procedural (I will say that this is starting to change a little with the addition of some things like sandbox mode).\nThere are always the typical AI artifacts you find in this genre, like workers building themselves out of bunkers, etc but really those only knocked a point off in my mind. The other two came from lack of depth.\n\nAll in all, a solid purchase when it's on sale, easy to learn, casual to play but enough variability to make you play it again.","May 5","true","8.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I just had a game where my power was low, so a bunch of things shut down, including my water pumps. This is fine, except my resources panel showed no lack of power, it showed a lack of water. This would lead one to believe they need to build more water pumps, when in fact you need more power.\n\nDisasters happen far too frquently, especially on low. I played through with normal and low disasters and noticed no difference. I would applaud an off option for disasters as well.\n\nGrowing people with limited life spans is a little redundant. You are constantly checking to make sure your people are assigned to a job. This needs a little more automation. Perhaps at the very least give a default job upon reaching adulthood and allow us to simply change them where we see fit? Starting them with no job at all makes no sense, especially during busy disaster periods when you accidently miss a few people reaching adulthood. Also life spans need to be a little longer.\n\nMake the notification for reaching adulthood and retiring different please! I am busy trying to manage things and get excited when I think I can assign a new worker, only to find out I lost one instead to old age. Why is the icon the same for these things?\n\nMy people just don't feel like they want to live. The AI is just awful. They battle molemen with no regard for self preservation.

All science upgrades are just stat boosts/different buildings that do the same thing.\nNo reason to expand or build. Only requirement is to survive 50 years, nothing to find or explore even in the deep levels of the underground.\nRequirements for survival are barebones, nothing outside of food is required.

No story or missions beyond the tutorial.Life in Bunker is crippled by its bad AI and lack of any meaningful progression. As you spend time trying to survive underground you quickly begin to realize that the best strategy to reaching the 50 cycle mark and escaping the bunker is to simply sustain your population. The game does nothing to reward expansion; in fact the only way you will probably ever lose is by expanding too much and watching the AI struggle to build things any distance away from the start point. While most games in this genre don’t have a central goal, they reward and naturally push players to expand their cities, and this being absent in Life in Bunker shows a critical misunderstanding of the genre by the developers. Tack on a generic fallout shelter theme and you have a recipe a for a mediocre and boring management game.","March 7","false","12.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Those coming to this game hoping for a Dungeon Keeper style campaign may be disappointed. You have one mission and that is to create a livable bunker and survive through multiple generations until the lands above are habitble. That isn't to say there isn't variety though. When creating your bunker you have several options you can tweak to change paramters in your game which in turn will have an impact on how that particular bunker plays out. This combined with the fact that each map is randomly generated means there is real incentive for multiple playthroughs.\n\nThere are a few reviews that raise issue with the tutorial or the UI or the difficulty. Personally I've had no issue with the game in any of these regards. The tutorial is well thought out and gives you a firm grasp of the mechanics, it also guides you around the UI which (to my mind at least) is very functional and easy to navigate. In regards to the difficulty, there is a learning curve when adressing resource management and things like timing the next generation of dwellers but it's a fun challenge and it's very satisfying when you work these things out and start getting your bunker in to a smooth well oiled rhythm.\n\nThis game in my opinion is currently absolutely worth the asking price and will soon leap in to being an absolute steal when more features and community suggestions start coming in.","February 29","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Once you've gotten over the steep learning curve, it a pleasure to play.\nAfter playing through the full 500yrs there was a couple of features, I wish was included however.\n\nNotable the function recycler; although an expediant way of getting rid of all the trash that my little humies created. It ould had been better, had it generated a small amount of building material. Even if the ratio was 10 trash to 1 build piece, it would have gotten me out of a hole I found myself in mid game. Running out of ore to mine and lacking the build pieces need to construct a new drill & power it; it saw me ripping up half the base just to get the required resources.\n\nResearch points however, it seems I couldn't get rid of fast enough. By the end of my 2rd play through, I had amased around 2k's worth; so It definatly needs an extra use for them.\n\nThe mole men, in the end, turned out to be no trouble at all. Simply keep a plot of the cave visable but unused and wall them in. They can roam round to their heart's content, while barely effecting my little humies at all. So long that is, that the rest of the living space was floored, which prevent the little blighters from poping up inside my bunker and bringing my humies's lives to a swift end, as was the case with my first bunker.

You take control of a bunker and have to figure out a way to keep people alive for 500 years so you can rise to the surface, repopulate and rebuild the world\n\nPrice: 15.99\n\nGraphics: Poly Bright colors but with a creative twist. 8/10\n\nSound: sound reminds me a little of the sims with them having there own made up language. As for the rest of the game the sounds are clear but simple. Making the game easy on your ears. 7/10\n\nMusic: the music has a nice melody going for it kinda soft but can be eery. Keeping you in Depth to the game but not over powering the sounds and pushing you away from the experience 9/10\n\nBugs: With the play through that I have done. I have not really run into any game reaking bugs that make me hate my life. The game seems to be well thought out and coded so that the game runs smooth and keeps going. 9/10\n\nFun: This game is really fun from the start when you are dropped into your own bunker and told here you go. The Devs have made it even easier for new to the game people with the in game tutorals that walk you into the start of the game. This hand holding will show you everything you need to know. You can also op to skip the tuts if you have already played the game or are feeling brave. 7/10\n\nreplay Value: The games replay Value im going to have to say is rather high cause if you rush the game you will lose, making you start another bunker and get farther then before. With many levels you can buld on and endless Illness and molemen to fight. The game keeps you on your toes on what to do next. Also when you start anew it ramdom gens you a new bunker and level to dig in. this game reminds me of Dungen Keeper on how you build and expand but in this one you are not a Demon fighting off Knights. 9/10\n\nStory: I feel that the sory is lacking due to the fact that it consists of a comet hitting earth and then you are in a bunker. This leaves no real room to role play what is happening. But as it stands you are a bunker keeper and you must keep people alive.  5/10\n\nPrice: The price for life in bunker I believe is fair priced at preorder of $14.39 with a Release price of 15.99 on steam. 8/10\n\nwith all this new found knowing of the game I Award it a Total Score of 7.75 Meaning that if you Like bunker Sims this one would be worth the money spent on it.","February 28","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think re-balancing the tech tree, or the rate at which research points are accrued, may help with this.\n\nLife in Bunker shows a lot of promise, and I am looking forward to seeing it improve.

You can build on four levels, just use lifts on rifts! Search out ore for building material. Fight off invaders (just molemen).\nEvil Genius - Manage happiness and efficiency with housing items.

Farming a sustained amount of food while having cooks prepare it.\nSBDF9 - Manage waste, power, water and oxygen.

I have been hyping it for months, even before it got greenlit on Steam. I have always wanted Fallout Shelter, but for the PC since I am a PC gamer and don't want anything to do with my laggy, outdated iPhone 4S, even though this game is different in so many ways from Fallout Shelter. When I heard of this game, I could do nothing but hope for the best. Man was I relieved when I got this game.\nThe tutorial made the game easy to understand, and the great optimization and "easy to look at graphics" made the game easy to play.\nPros:\n-Very well optimized\n-Quite neat art style\n-Very smooth\n-Interfaces are easy to understand and use\n-Had an easy to understand tutorial that walked you through the game, and waited for you to do what it said before continuing.\n-Family friendly gameplay, avoided mature content to keep it this way. Used things like incubators to accomplish this.\nCons:\n-Feels a bit shallow gameplay wise, but I have not gotten far enough to judge.\n-Developers did not seem to keep the community well updated before release, but we will see how they handle what is to come.\n-Various game changing glitches such as water pumps not functioning due to no power, although there is plentiful power creation and multiple direct power line connections.\n-AI would sometimes get stuck behind objects such as walls, unable to re-enter the bunker.\nOverall I would say this game, if done right, could turn into a massive success. Fixing some of the main glitches this game experiences within the first week of release will really prove whether Flox Studios is capable of caring about their players, and keeping the community up to date with their most recent updates will most greatly benefit the ones who plan to document the changes, such as through Youtube. We must just all hope for the best. I believe.\n","February 25","true","6.3"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

Ability to smooth existing floor might be nice.\n- No ability to upgrade or move already built objects such as the Reactor (maybe this would be OP?)\n- No actual Breeding and/or Relationship System other than basic social interaction pleasure\n- Only one enemy type.\n- Skill Tree for Residents is very simplistic. I would like to see at least some basic leveling of certain job types - Level 1, 2, or 3 Researcher for Example. This would give spesific Residents more value, though they do die off pretty quickly.\n\nI've played through the game 3 times now, working on my 4th. It is more challenging than one might expect from the demo and there are a lot of elements to keep an eye on and manage. I do wish there was more uniqueness to random events, and more enemies but I believe those will be coming with future updates. As of now, your dwellers get injured, sick, old and useless, young and useless, and can be killed by Molemen, the only direct enemy of the game. Your people also get significantly slower at completing objectives if you let certain necessities slack, food, air, water, and so forth. I'm finding it highly replayable. Each launch of the game you get a different starter bunker plus some uniqueness to what foods you start out with. I'm really looking forward to what this game will have to offer content wise with a few more updates.\n\nThe 'breeding' system is also rather interesting as in your peeps don't have babies but you can program in the kind of children you want in incubators, and any combination of job skills but at higher research point costs (which is the currency of the game).\n\nTips for a player just starting.\n\nGet Researching Pronto\nGet A Refinery Pronto and soon after a escavator on a ore deposit\nGet a Kitchen/Sit n' Eat Place Pronto (you start with some food).\n\nNext get Beds, showers, toliets and start to work on some Food Production.\n\nKeep an eye on your critical resources like water/power/air and ensure you never get to critical points on these as it can be hard to fix them in time.\n\nGood Luck Wardens!\n\nhttps://qubetubers.com/articles/oxid95/qa-with-alex-satori/\n\nI was honored to get a copy of this game about a week before it released on steam and my gaming community QubeTubers showcased it during our Indieweekend event. Alex, one of the developers is a great guy who spoke with us at length about his passions in game making.  I highly encourage anyone who enjoys games such as Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria to give this a try.

It is easy to get in to, and you will find you play for hours without noticing that time has even passed. You will find it does lack a little in terms of content and challenge, but if you're looking for a game to relax and pass some time, this is a good choice. From what I've played it's been bug/glitch free, although there are some poor decisions on the part of the AI (Buidling themselves OUT of the bunker, or letting molemen spawn in caves outside the bunker that can't be opened as there's 20 enemies in there)\n\nI'd like to see a whole ton of content in the form of rooms and enemies added as it can feel a little light in this area, and perhaps a more indepth combat system and cosmetic additions. No doubt this will come later though, and for now, the game is worth the $15 price tag. If you want a casual Dungeon Keeper game in a more modern setting, this is for you.

They do a good job at explaining the game, but I felt like there was just too much to read and remember and being overwhelmed is never a good thing. (it could have been presented in a different way, narrated, or presented in smaller chunks)\n- The "camera angle" controls are not great. I really wanted to rotate and zoom in the camera to get a very close up shot at what my people were doing ro building, but you can hardly change the angle or position of the camera.\n\n[Side Note: I'm not sure if this game was inspired by Fallout, but I absolutely love the idea, my favorite memory in Fallout 3 was being in the Vault and seeing how they operated and thought it would be so cool if I could have been the Warden]","February 27","true","1.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

The most obvious compare for me is actually EVIL GENIUS.\nUnfortunately there was not as much love put into this one I am afraid.\n\nAfter about 4 hours I discovered everything. So far I don't see a reason to play it again. At first Life In Bunker is quite tough but it gets easy incredibly fast. There should be at least kind of a campaign. But right now the only play mode is not really offering a lot.\n\nI am really not particular on spending money for games, but this one is not yet worth the price tag. I hope there will be features added or there will be mods.","March 11","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In my video that I will post shortly I had to check to make sure it is a full release. This game is already lacking in content and I am just an HOUR in. The animations are bleh, the features are meh and the overall game just makes me go Ugh.\n\nSo why do I recommend it?\n\nBecause it is fun and sucks you in immediately. I planned for a 15 minute video, ended up at 45 mins due to the amount of focus I had. It def. has a way of making you not want to stop. Though, this may because things take a long time. I often find myself fast fowarding on max just to speed up processes. The game is also not difficult at the moment as things are quite easy to build while resources are abundant.\n\nOn NORMAL settings I don't feel any urgency or fear that if I don't hurry I will die. 4 days into the game, still didn't have a kitchen, everyone was peachy. The core game is great....just needs massive amounts of content.\n\n--WILL UPDATE AFTER MORE GAME TIME--","February 26","true","1.0"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Basically very simliar to idea of Sheltered game. This one is more 3D than Shelter only 2D. Also it remind me of old game called Dungeon Keeper 2. But Dungeon Keeper 2 you could walk around in dungeon. This Life in Bunker dont. SAD! But, It's pretty good game in my opinion. I named my bunker "VAULT 79" Because I'm big fan of fallout game. Also I born in 1979 So... Vault 79.\n\nIf they asked me to recommend this game. I will not just tell everyone about it. Unless they're fallout fan and shelter fan. I would told them about this game. If anyone asked me about this game. I would say yes it's good.

Even when trying to keep the population at a even level I end up with the first generation simply filling up the level doing nothing but taking up resources. Which as a gimmick is pretty clever as you have to take into account that at some point they will either keel over or stick around being the water/air suckers that they will be.\n\nHowever a nice feature would be maybe some service bots or something that can override a persons ability to retire. It might seem evil but your a bunch of hairless apes trying to survive in a mountain whilst the world above recovers. Its not time for choccy bikkies and fluffy slippers granpa, there’s a leak in the generator and the embryos are starting to defrost.\n\nThere are clear similarities with Dungeon Keeper in the movement and controls (although its missing the very missed "pick up minion" feature that would REALLY be useful).\n\nSeveral times I’ve had my little AI just sit in a corner and ♥♥♥♥ in their pants whilst I’m frantically trying to get them to go fix the oxygen and water generators. With no way to force them to a position your left to just watch as they look at a wall and defecate into their underwear.\n\nIts one however you do want to go back too to try out again and again, even with the steep curve it throws you once the first Gen start to become obsolete.\n\nWorth a try but be prepared to micro manage the crap out of everything.\n","February 27","true","6.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Very mixed.  I gave it a thumbs down at the end of the day because I feel it is a very niche game that does not appeal to everyone and is below average expectations of something in this genre.  Basically if you aren't here for the concept, you won't like it.\n\nPros:\nThey seem to have thought of everything to simulate life in a growing bunker\nYou have to do research just to start moving forward\nIt has some personality to it but not really enough\n\nCons\nIt's very basic\nNo Story/Campaign just sandbox\nOne play through and you're kind of threw with it\nThe Ratmen make no sense to have in the game\nThe game doesn't have a set speed, it either plays really slow or suddenly extremely fast\nEvents are too frequent even on the lowest setting\nEngineers don't work unless you have a lot of them! Stuff still constantly breaks\nYou lack direct control over anything, you give orders and it happens but not necessarily in the order or way you want\n\nOverall rating: 2.4/5\nRage Factor: 2.5/5\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcSKNnw6SJs","March 7","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I had to place one tile at a time in order to get them to work. Seems like a technical issue.  I tagged a section of wall to dig through and the bunker citizens just wouldnt do it, no explaination why.\n\nI also got a near constant stream of enemies while trying to mine a new section.\n\nI went ahead and requested a refund.","February 28","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Life in Bunker has its charms, but they are few. As a base building simulator, the game presents players with few challenges. It's a short lived game, with few surprises. There's little incentive to build a 4 story hamster city of survivors. In our in depth review we cover many aspects that could have been added, or altered, that would have made the game more challenging. The plus side is the developers listened to feedback and correct many bugs before release. It's possible Life In Bunker could be evolved into the a more entertaining and challenging game.\n\nPro's- Charming music\n- Beating molemen with axes.\n\nCon's- Short, easily beaten in 5-7 hours\n- Occassionally people will build themselves into a corner\n- Dull, boring, repetitive\n- Where's the challenge?","February 29","false","16.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
