The sounds are atrocious, though the operatic soundtrack isn't bad. Combat just runs without any input from you. Your units hop up and down in clumsy drawn-out All-my-guys-go then all-your-guys-go rounds. It's impossible to recommened this game based on the way it looks or sounds. If you crave lots of colorful, well executed feedback and fireworks then this game isn't for you.\n\nIf, however, you enjoy truly diverse factions, random maps, tons of monsters, spells and items, executable at a reasonably fast pace, then you will find much to like about Conquest of Elysium.\n\nRather than attempting to describe the many factions or the different eras that you can play in, as well as the many ways to go about engineering total domination, I'd rather relate an impromptu story that I discovered while playing.\n\nI'd started as the Troll King for no other reason than that I relish having a giant with which to roam the landscape from the very first turn of the game.\n\nWell into the run I'd developed a sizable squad of armored, regenerating trolls that had been the front line for a vast army of goblin archers. While there were enough trolls with enough hit points and armor to absorb serious frontal assaults, they couldn't protect my numerous, but vulnerable, archers from the spells of an enemy Pyromancer that I'd stumbled into.\n\nMy trolls didn't care for immolation but they were tough enough to survive the blaze. All my goblin archers, except one lone fellow, were incinerated.\n\nI was momentarily amused by my single tiny camp follower for my troll army and figured I'd eventually make it back to a city where I could recruit more archers. It was not to be, however, because I found myself pushing farther and farther into enemy territory: even without the support of sixty screaming goblin sharpshooters, my trolls were laying waste.\n\nFight after fight, I marched across the map, more than a dozen armored trolls accompanying the Troll King with this one goblin who hung around in the back.\n\nPerhaps an hour into this Sherman's March, I began noticing that the goblin was comically ineffective. All the trolls would attack and then this one sad goblin would shoot a single arrow, never hitting anything.\n\nAfter several battles, I finally clicked on the little guy and was amazed by what I saw.\n\nThis one goblin had maxed out his level, lost both eyes (which explained all the missing), lost one arm (which doesn't explain how he still managed to shoot his bow), was lamed and had a chest injury that reduced his hit points to the level that a fairy farting at him would have put him in the ground.\n\nI was astounded at how this guy kept kicking along in the company of a massive troll army, fighting devils and hordes of undead, dragons and wizards. Not only had he survived, but he'd become the ultimate veteran. I couldn't help but to imagine this poor wrecked creature and wonder: how does he manage?\n\nI decided that he was sort of a mascot to the trolls, a seemingly immortal mystery that they largely ignored. They allowed him to follow along as a curiosity, feeding him tidbits and saving him from wandering into holes and what not, if only to see how many more battles he could survive, one-armed, lamed and blind.\n\nMy imagination went so far as to picture some of his stray shots hitting his troll allies in the back, but that they were so ineffective that the only response to getting shot by the goblin was the laughter and pointing of your troll comrades-in-slaughter.\n\nI'd never have made up that little story if there weren't so many status effects, magic items, buffs and curses and so very many enemy types available to mix and match. By keeping track of individual unit's injuries in such detail and allowing them to accumulate scars and  skills makes them into characters.\n\nIf you can look past the presentational limitations, there is a ton of content and gameplay, supporting many different styles, for anyone looking for a fast-paced turn-based (is that even possible?) strategy game. Should the high fantasy genre appeal, then this one provides all the grist a fertile imagination requires.","July 16, 2015","true","140.2"," 92 of 92 people (100%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","100","92","92","43","4"

Not like any other game that I am aware of!\n-each game plays out completely different\n-Equip looted items to unit(s) of your choice\n-units gain experience/levels and get better at everything they do (new spells unlock!)\n-plenty of personal style choices\n-as complicated or simple as you want\n-ancient/medieval-fantasy theme is well done\n\nCons: (these are minor & mods may help some)\n-graphics are ... simple\n-ui interface could be easier to learn\n-neutral animals are a bit more aggressive than is realistic imo.\n-I wish there was a way to convert/recruit neutral units into your army, particularly ones that are unique to your faction/class, instead of always being forced to fight/kill neutrals.\n\nShort description:\nUnique, turn-based fantasy army building & broad-strategy, map domination.  Game mechanics take a bit to get used to, but are elegantly balanced, with scaling-complexity, and replayability.\n\nLonger description:\n-Pick one of 6 different "societies" (time-periods which adjust the map generation parameters, making certain map tiles more or less common).\n-Choose one of 18 different "classes" (army factions), each with unique combinations of units (each has unique units but many have some common units as well) to battle against the other "players"\n-(the ai has 10 difficulty levels!).\n-At least 9 different types of resources make "money" handling slightly different based on which class/faction you play (it's simpler than it sounds)\n-Build your armies, assign leaders to move them around; explore, conquer, and fight your way to victory.\n--Almost every unit has lots of item slots, and items are sufficiently rare as to be extremely exciting when found and generally only equipped to your best units (leaders usually).\n--Magic users have their own well-crafted system to them with many schools of magic and various spell ingredients/mana used to power them (see resources like sacrifices, herbs, fungus, and gems)\n---Combat is automated and runs in real-time with several speed settings, including "skip to the end", which may seem crazy at first but is quite well done.\n--unit capabilities & stats are fairly easy to grasp and analyze. Be sure to note your magic users' spells; learn which spells will effect ALL UNITS on the battlefield (including your own!), as you'll likely want to disable the use of those spells most of the time.","September 6, 2014","true","346.5"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","63","67","3","0"

In simple terms the game is about raising armies to defeat your opponenets. At the start of each game you select a class to play which determines how you go about raising your armies or what your fighting style is. An example is the enchanter class, at the start most of your army is composed of generic soldiers until you get resources to summon powerful constructs and golems in the mid to late game.\n\nPros:\n-There are 18 different classes to pick from each having cool special abilities and playstyles unique to them.\n-There are many cool units and magic spells to mess with.\n-Games play quickly and end faster than most strategy games.\n-Random generated maps allow for endless play.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics are rather lacking.\n-The unit animations are also rather lacking.\n-Lots of unit stats to sift through.\n-Some matches are doomed from the start due to bad spawn areas.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you enjoy a strategy game where everytime you play you learn something new this game is for you. If you are short on time a lot but you love to play complex strategy games this is for you as well. If you are a person who cares about graphics do not pick this up, likewise if you are not willing to (possibly) read a manual sometimes then do not pick this up either. Illwinter has made many improvements from Conquest of Elysium 2 and at the cheap price of ten dollars it could be argued that this game beats many modern strategy games in terms of features and replayability.","December 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","0"

In lieu of a review, here's some very early impressions:\n\n- ♥♥♥♥. Why did i buy this?\n- I SO don't want to play this game.\n- I don't even. All these stats... And the clunky menus.\n- Allright lets get her holy high highnessness out there a-conquering. A cannibal camp... Oh well, gets me a ritual sacrifice bonus.\n- Crap, you front line spearmen need to stay alive.\n- Hahaha, suck on 3rd degree incineration spells hob.. er, half.. er. gn... whatever the hell you are, hahaha!\n- Damn you and the planes you spawned on, and all other untis that show up to be recruited for 50 gold when i have 49! Still, with cheap summoning i get lots of fresh units. Mostly tiny rats and spiders. :\ Ooh o.O Giant Spider! That's more like it!\n- Aw, crapdamn! Lost a town to 4 wolves. 4. Wolves. 4! C'mon town! Mmkay whatever, i'll just have this caster with leadership take a few archers and summoned monsters go and take it back. They can stop by the capital to pick up new recruits as well.\n- Wait did my rookie summonamancer just blindly luck into summoning a demigod stronker than 3-4 of my combined armies???! Oooh, and he's a front row melee attacker, sweet!\n- Damn these cheap summoning rituals, i'm up to my ascots in rats and scorpions. At least they soak damage really well.\n- That... that giant moose is honestly too big. I heard of not seeing the forest from the trees but never a forest from a moose. Seriously.\n\nAt this point i have 4 stacks of mixed melee/archers/casters stomping things, leveling up, collecting shiny swords and boots of flight, and generally spreading peace, love and understanding of the Cult of the mad blood god whose return shall end the world in pools of pizza sauce.\n\nThe game is relatively straightforwad even if it takes a bit of figuring out. Time wasting features are thrown right out and all that is left aims to streamline fantasy flavored, turn based conquering. Might sound featureless but the unit type and terrain diversity, not to mention hosts of spells and artifacts, season changes and random events all keep your campaign interesting. Plus even mooks get item slots, so you will find plenty of uses for shiny loot.\n\nI can't accurately appraise this game. Not at this time. Ok maybe i can. It's a victory of substance over generic shinied sparkly baubleness. You might wonder why a prettier game wouldn't ever have decent, simple and honest fun mechanics, but the anwser is in the question. If you have a VERY shiny wrapper, then you'd be a fool to put anything better than a turd in it. Final Fantasy says hello.\n\n"I stomped things!"\nThe menus are a teeny bit clunky and take a few minutes to figure out but the rest is:\n9000/9001","December 21, 2014","true","8.4"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","84","38","45","27","0"

All factions have unique and highly individualized play styles that will keep you going for potentially hundreds of hours. On top of the various factions the world itself is full of danger. Bandits, monsters and the ghosts that rise from the fields of battles present plenty of danger in their own right.

CoE3 is a nicely put together Turn-Based Stradegy game.  It reminds me a lot of Master of Magic.  There is no control in combat, and the game does not focus on research or city building, but instead, the acquisition of units and capture of cities/towns/villages/mines/outposts/towers/etc.  With each capture, you increase your income, build your army, and set out to explore the map and find and conquer your enemies.\n\nThere are numberous races in this game, and most of them play differently.  It's enough to keep me interested to keep playing and learning how they each work.  There are a massive number of unique units, there are magic items you can find and equip, and random world events which can be good or bad... losing a town due to a meteor is never fun, but it sure keeps it interesting!\n\nThe game has multiplayer as well.  My friend and I play all the time, and I can say after numerous games, that this is a stable, polished, and enjoyable game to play, either single-player or multiplayer.  If you are into the turn-based world domination, my army is bigger than yours but not necessarily better type games, which offer randomly generated maps, exploration, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff, I'd highly recommend this one.\n\nThe learning curve for CoE3 is a bit steep, but most of the information you can find in the games manual.

I've generally found them too bogged-down in micromanagement and strict formulaic approaches to really be interesting.  That's a personal taste, so I hold my ambivalence to the whole genre a bit in reserve.\n\nThis game... doesn't exactly escape from micromangement, (what micromanagement it lacks, it's becuase the whole city-management aspect of 4X games was completely gutted from the game, not because it was automated to give players only the interesting choices,) but it does manage to bring a lot of new ideas to the table to make it at least more interesting, and cities and towns are just resource generation points.  What makes it interesting is that those aren't the only resource-spawning locations.  Each faction has access to different kinds of special resources gained from different terrain tiles, meaning that forests are useless to dwarves or priest-kings, but witches can farm them for fungi they use to summon more units, making controlling them critical when a witch is in play, but pointless when they are not.  This makes the value of different landscapes fluctuate based upon who's in play, unlike a game like Civilization, where all cities are operated in basically the same way, so stealing one is always both a positive to you and a negative to your opponents.\n\nThat said, most factions let you summon monsters randomly from a table you have no access to, and because battles are random and uncontrollable, as well, this means that you have randomly created troops filling out uncontrolled lines of battle to fight random battles you can't control with randomly generated enemies to take up random landscapes whose composition you have little control over.  Strategy goes where?\n\nThis game winds up using that classic of turn-based (especially 4X) combat models I call "Stack Mashing", because all you do is make a giant stack of troops, and then blithely ram it into everyone else's stacks until you run out of stack and need a new one.  In 4X games, this can generally be forgivable because the point of the game isn't some strategic maneuvering, it's building up the infrastructure to field that giant army in the first place.  In this game, however, you really don't have an infrastructure, you just have resource-generation tiles.\n\nThe graphics are "I could do better, oh, look, it lets you mod the graphics, so I CAN do better," and the music can be muted so you can play your own, which is generally what I wind up doing with most games that take a long time to play, anyway, since no game comes with enough music variety to last you a 100-hour game.\n\nI've also only played single player, and I'm not sure how well this game works over the Internet with random nobodies.\n\nIt's interesting and has some novel ideas, and so I recommend it to strategy gamers for that reason alone.  Maybe you'll love it, but I think it's worth buying on sale just to play for a couple hours to understand what it does differently, then carry it with you next time you see a bland space 4X do the same thing a billionth time.","November 24, 2015","true","14.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

I might even enjoy this better, because it seems faster paced and less serious.  You don't need much time investment to the starting game settings like in Dominions.  Instead it's more of a rogue-like (I wanted to use this term rogue-like in an earlier review and thought "no all the rogue-like fans will get all over me about that" - but then saw another review using the term "rogue-like 4x" - yes that describes this game very well).\n\nIt's a rogue-like 4x with game saves!  SAVES!  Okay?  All you rogue-like developer nutso's - think about adding game-saves to your rogue-likes - because I for one welcome our rogue-like game-saving not so much punsih the player when he makes a mistake overlords.\n\nOkay.. so what else can I tell you?\n\nThe variety that's in Dominions still seems to be here - or most of it anyways.  It's just buried under the hood.  If I had a choice and could only buy one game between Dominions and Conquest of Elysium - I think I would pick this, just because it's a little more fun and not as taxing to play.\n\nThe game is so fast-paced (for a 4x) that several games can be played in succession.  Yet it still has very much a Civilization 1 feeling to it.\n\nLastly, the sound effects (I know.. right?) - the sound effects are pleasant and not overbearing, if simplistic.  One of those details they got right.  That, and building a whole universe of interactions.  :)","January 21, 2015","true","57.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

It deserves your attention. It's a little gem, a modern Master of Magic, streamlined and simpler but with a richness that stems from the vast treasure-trove of creatures, spells and unique races already made by Illwinter. While you may be familiar with many creatures from playing Dominions, Conquest of Elysium builds on the familiar and adds twists that make it a very different experience. Dominions is for the grand strategy, long turns and slow pace with lots of planning even before the game begins. Elysium is fast, smooth, clean and streamlined. It has a lot of depth without ever overwhelming you with it. The creatures have a massive collection of traits (all with icons) that make them much more than cosmetically different. Your magical resources are only seen by those able to use them - so you're never overwhelmed by having to keep track of gems/herbs/weeds/hands of glory...etc. If you have someone who can use a new resource then you're able to see it on the map, if you don't then you can't see or claim it. It's one of the little things that helps new players. It's simple, elegant and eases you into the game gently.\n\nSimple, yes. But that isn't to say the game is easy. It's easy to lose and tricky to win. Early mistakes can end the game, losing all your commanders and castles ends the game so there's always some risk from stealthy bandits and animals capturing your castle or some invulnerable creeping doom rolling over your army. At the end of the game, the streamlined options makes the AI smarter and stronger than I've come to expect from many 'modern' games. Even on the default 'jester' difficulty setting the AI can have large armies that are quite happy to attack your towns and castles and use all the magic they have available.\n\nI've not played as every race yet, but I'm looking forward to doing so. I'm looking forward to team games, trying the different map sizes, the different ages of the world and to seeing what other hidden gems I'll find. I hope you get a chance to do all that too.\nSo...

It's like what many reviewers are saying, that it is deeper than it first appears.  It's kind of like master of magic except you can't go into your town and build buildings and stuff.  It's more like Heroes of might and magic where you explore the map, fight battles, and gain control of strategic locations that increase your resources.  The resources are then used to increase your army strength.\n\nBe aware that the battles are automatic.  No battle tactics, only tactics on the strategic map.\n\nKeep in mind, there is no town/castle management.  Also it is not very pretty.  There is no tutorial or even anything to read on how to play.  There is a list of keyboard controls that you can bring up.  By continuously bringing that list up and experimenting I was able to figure out how to play after 3 or 4 little test games.\n\nThere is 10 or so different leaders to start out with and they are pretty different.  Some use magic and can summon guys  to fight.  Others might only be able to recruit guys with money you earn.  It's worth the money just not real nice to look at.\n\nWorking just fine in Linux Ubuntu 14.04.  Goes full screen.  Playing it on the living room TV.

If you like turn-based strategy games at all, this game will be very fun and addictive.(Some of it isnt very intuitive though, and there are no pop-up tips for new players. So either skim the manual, keep it open in a side window, or be patient until you figure the interface/mechanics out. Or catch a youtube getting started video) The other descriptions say it is very similar to the Civilization games, but it is far more similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (there is no technology research or diplomacy or city/town improvements to build.) Armies can only move when a "hero" type unit is leading it. Heroes are the only way to claim the resource generating nodes on the map. The map is far more active than in Heroes of M&M though, with monsters being generated very frequently from "neutral camps" like ancient forests and brigand camps, until you take a hero and go clear them out and claim them, and there are random spawn events that happen to keep you from getting too comfortable. The animals will randomly wander and make you lose control of things they move over, while brigands are evil and smart and will go directly for capturing towns and villages away from you and will garrison them and they are stealthy about it.(essentially they are stealthed or cloaked and cant be seen except by running over them by accident or by bringing a stealth-detecting unit with your army, etc.)\n\nThe game really shines in the strategy department. Unlike Civilization or Heroes of M&M, the class type you choose will have HUGE implications for how strategies will work (instead of minor differences), it decides what heroes you will have access to, what armies you will be able to create with heroes via magic(if any), what unit types you will be able to purchase at towns you control, bonuses with certain terrain types, weaknesses and strengths with the general types of units you have acess to, etc. Unlike most competivite strategy games the resources themselves are varied and can only be collected by the appropriate hero types. For instance a witch will claim forests and swamps to get an income of fungus to use for making magical brews to summon nature spirits for their armies. A demonologist will want to claim towns and villages in order to get an income of 'sacrifices' to summon demons for their armies. And this is just a piece of the differences.\n\nThe combat itself is automated, which was annoying at first, but then I saw why later. You get so many random fights, and some fights with hero vs hero where both sides have 100+ units each, it would burn anyone out to try to control that turn by turn, unit by unit through a combat. In fact, dont miss out on the combat speed control in the upper gith hand corner of the battle screen. You will eventually tire of watching every combat play out at regular speed and will want to be able to speed it up using those controls. Also note that for your heroes and armies that can cast spells, you can inspect them outside combat to choose what spells they have ready for combat.(you dont want a frost demon to blast every creature on the battlefield with a frost attack if you have troops that could get hurt from it on your side, or you dont want to go into a fight with fire spells memorized if you know the enemy hero has tons of fire immune creatures, etc.) Also, it pays to take note of the magical items you find in your travels and from killing enemy heroes. You can trade them around between heroes, and even with your individual army members. (aka - one of your heroes finds a weapon but has one equipped already? if one of your armies he is leading could use it, they will pick it up and use it instead of it going to waste.)","May 27, 2014","true","34.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you're curious but don't want to commit to cash quite yet I recommend you check out CoE2 available for free from Illwinter's site as a free download. It's a lot more limited than this version of the game, but will give you a pretty good feel for how it handles.\n\nOn the good side, if you're looking for a streamlined fantasy 4X that offers a unique collection of races and play mechanics, this might be your games (I especially enjoyed Illwinter's take on why you never see any female dwarfs). It's really satisfying to finally round up enough innocents to summon demon lords, or to finally complete the necromantic ritual which will turn you into an immortal vampire in an old, abandoned castle.\n\nOn the bad side, Illwinter doesn't really care that much about UI. In the Dominions series (which has gotten a lot better on this front) it was the price of admission for a really unique strategy game. With the stripped down CoE approach, the lapses in UI design feel a lot less forgivable. For example, there's no smooth way to start a new game without exiting and launching the game again. Unit moves can't be cued, so you spend a lot of time babysitting commanders on there way back to grab reinforcements.\n\nPast the interface, the abundance of unfriendly fauna can get rather obnoxious. While it's cool that you need to be careful early on, by mid game marauding bands of deer taking unprotected farms just gets annoying. Commanders are a limited resource in the game, so keeping them on hand for pest control can get frustrating. Plus I'm unaware of any kind of "major events" summary, so I spend a lot of time at the beginning of each turn checking my domain and making sure Bambi isn't stirring up any trouble. Then on larger maps you can have to cross fields covered with unthreatening but still annoying spawns.\n\nFinally, there's side balance. As is the case with any game that has 17 truly unique sides it's a nightmare. Necromancer's can be unstoppable in the Fallen Empire period, or they can get screwed by their early game position. Playing a side that relies on mines? Hope you start near some, because while your capital normally counts as one, there might not be any others nearby.","May 28, 2015","false","33.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This game fits that bill, in spades.\n\nThe genius of this game is that the interesting choices start on Turn 1 of this turn based strategy game, and they never let up. There is no down time. Do you go for that coal mine, even though that will leave you far from your home base? Do you even have an army that can win, if you do decide to attack? Should you wait a couple turns to summon more creatures, even though you really, really, really need that gold? Did you leave enough defenders at your home base? Shold I save up my Druid herbs to upgrade my apprentice, or should I spend them now to better go on the offensive? The interesting choices never stop, all through the game.\n\nHowever...\n\nIf you just fire it up and click Start New Game, you won't know how to do anything, you'll think the game is stupid, the graphics are ugly, the UI is unintuitive (actually, this part is kinda true) and never play it again. This happened to me, in fact. This is an old fashioned game. You gotta use the manual, I won't say read the manual, but use it. Leave it open while you play and Alt-Tab.

Made by the developers of Domnions, it's a different take on the genre from the Dominions series or anything else out there.  It is faster paced and more about combat than most games of this type.\n\nYou choose from a roster of unique leaders (from Necromancers to Troll Kings to the CoE equivalent of Hobbits), and start on a single fortress unique to your leader.  You can capture farms, towns, cities, fortresses, and magical sites.  Each turn is a month and the seasons matter - winter will slow your troops to a crawl and cut your income.  Combat is non-interactive - you can set the spells you want your casters to draw from before battle but that's about it.  There is no diplomacy - everyone is at war unless they are on your team from the start.  The interface is quite intuitive and right-clicking on just about anything will bring up an explanation.\n\nThe best part of this game is how uniquely each of the 18 leader classes plays.  They each have different magical resource requirements, spells, units, methods of recruiting units and progression paths.  For instance, as a Demonologist, you will need people to sacrifice to summon demons and upgrade your casters.  That makes controlling towns and cities important.  In contrast, the Witch powers her summoning spells and upgrades from fungi gathered in forests and swamps - settlements are far less important to her.  I think this is absolutely brilliant game design and the most fun in the game is had by learning each class and struggling to stay alive in the first 50 turns while fighting neutrals and other computer players.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws and frustrations.  The graphics are charming but primitive.  The lack of control over combat can be frustrating - you can lose battles you should win because your idiot spellcasters won't pick the correct spell.  It is difficult to hold territory because your captured settlements don't generate any militia (except for a few leader classes).  You can and do often lose a key city or mine to a rampaging group of 3 small snakes.   The map generator tends to make somewhat wonky maps - each terrain tile seems to be independent of its neighbors so you are unlikely to see a large forest or mountain range.  Instead you'll find randomly clumped tiles that don't look like realistic geography.  And after you've survived the difficult but enjoyable early game, the mid and late game tend to drag on.  It's too bad you can't develop any of the settlements or fortresses (or even build roads to quicken the horrendously slow pace of your armies).  That might add an empire building aspect to the game that would keep it interesting beyond the first 50 turns.  More rituals for each class would also be nice.  As it stands, most classes basically have a weak summon, medium summon, and strong summon spell.  Rituals affecting the world would add a lot to the game.  For instance, if I could blast those aforementioned 3 snakes with a fireball or cast the world into eternal darkness, the mid and late-game would be a lot more fun.   Let's hope CoE 4 adds more depth to the mid and late game.\n\nHowever, as it stands the game's advantages heavily outweigh its shortcomings.  I found it to be a breath of fresh air and greatly enjoyed playing a game with each of the 18 leader classes.  If you like fantasy TBS games and are not turned off by the primitive graphics, you'll find it to be a treat.\n\n","June 14, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The tactical battles are not interactive. The interface is workable, although it's easy to notice details that could be smoother. The soundscape is middling to fair, mostly due to the soundtrack and not the effects.\n\nBut the gameplay is great. The variety in factions and how they play is great. You have 17 factions. None of them are all that good. The 'holy church of El' wants to break the seals and release the apocalypse. The deep ones... yeah. Necromancers, Demonologist, and a Troll King. Holy Priestess? Nope, worshipping a demon god. There are a few that are not intrinsically evil, I think that's about as far as you can stretch it in the alignment scale. Still, to illustrate the factional differences.. the Troll King is awesome in battle. He can lay waste to armies on his own. (And at start, that's what you have to do). But after a while, an overly critical mum sends a cauldron of gold because you're not doign so well. That helps a lot, you can finally buy a few units... and then suddenly the dread message: Mum is coming over to take over because her bumbling son is an idiot. New unit spawns in the HQ: Mom. Which is a troll witch of considerable skill, and a definite gamechanger.\n\nYou don't get high price games that try to pull all the wacky, wonderful, or scary stuff going around here. It is described as a 'strategy rogue-like', a surprisingly apt description. Your grand armies can be destroyed in moments and your empire reduced to crumbling ruins by a bad choice, it is fast-paced and light-hearted. I can highly recommend this to anyone who want a novel take on the fantasy wargame genre... and at the price*? It's a no-brainer.\n\n* Steam sale, at time of writing.","March 12, 2014","true","50.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would a deer wandering into a village really bring production to a halt???\n\nI'd recommend "lairs", where a large concentration of one type of creature lives and which spawns mobs until cleared out.

First let me start off by saying, this game was NOT rushed in the development.  The developer accomplished a completely functional game that pulls off the hybrid mix of Turn-based strategy games like Civilization (very much like the original Sid Meir's Civilization), and many of your favorite old school role-playing games, without redundant menus, complicated interfaces and pointless cosmetic displays.  It's a simple game, that somehow manages to get it all right, perfectly!  Everything you need to know is right on the main window, or a couple of right and left mouse clicks away.  The factions are incredibly diverse, not like most games today, which is merely a "re-skinning" of a generic faction, but each faction seemlessly plays by its own "logical" rules in a fantasy world.  It plays like an adventure, set in a strategy fantasy world of conquest.   Non-linear, journey, exploring a constantly evolving world, and shaping it to your own character's specialized needs and strengths.

The factions are very different, but the ugly, automatic combat really drags down the game. You have NO control over combat. You don't even get to choose a basic strategy for the combat, like in King of Dragon Pass. And big fights can involve HUNDREDS of individual units! You can fast forward the fight or even just skip to the end, but it's jarring to be just presented with the end result ("Wait, how did Bob the Sorceror die???"). There isn't even a combat results screen listing deaths and injuries. About injuries - have you read the funny review for this game by the guy who was using goblin archers, and they all died except for one, who turned out to be missing all his shots because he was blind in both eyes? That's a funny story, but it's a HUGE nuisance that the game doesn't indicate that a unit has been crippled unless you manually check EACH one. (The developers are planning to add tactical combat to the next game in the series, but the early screenshots show that it's still an ugly mess with too many units).\n\nResource management is also a pain, because there are WAY TOO MANY resource nodes. This is especially bad with classes such as the Troll King that can and should control EVERY SINGLE FOREST TILE, but every class has to capture tons of tiny little villages and such to get a coin or two of income. And because there's tons of random wildlife running around, you need to either leave a decent number of units behind at each resource node, or a rampaging deer will somehow "conquer" the town and make them stop sending tribute, so you'll have to send someone to RE-conquer it.\n\nI can deal with the graphics being worse than games from 20 years ago, but I can't tolerate that the GAMEPLAY is worse than ancient games like Master of Magic.\n\nThe guys who make this game are like the Wachowskis - they've got some really great ideas, but they desperately need an editor, which in this case means selling out to a company who uses their creativity but doesn't tolerate bloated game design.","July 17, 2015","false","7.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You just go with logic and you'll be fine (soldiers are better than militia for example).\n\nBut with that primary feature in a turn-based game missing, thumbs down for these guys who do half games.","May 10","false","1.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

They have become more micromanaged, and these complexicites have provided more immerisive levels of game play.  However Conquest of Elysium 3 provides a simplified experience that is great in its own way.  Each class of hero (from which there are 16) the player has to choose from has a very different style of gameplay from the other classes.  This includes classes that are seeming similar, however you will find each play through, according to the class will be very different according to what could seem to be small nuiances.  If random maps and events are your thing there is no shortage here (not to mention moding options that can increase the factions and randomness).  Other than that you pick units to purchase with gold, and according to your class your unique resource (herbs, Sacrifices, Crystals; etc.) that allow you to purchase unique units or spells.  Combat is automatic; the only control you have is spells memorized by casters and the units entering the battle.  This is a great game and I caught it on a steam sale for a couple bucks, and I definitely recommend Conquest of Elysium 3 without reservations.","February 1, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

COE3 doesn't really have a story; all you need to know is that you have to destroy the capital city of the other players. COE is a turn based 4X game which means that you really have to think through you moves. You can assign armies and those armies can move around freely across the map. If you move one a tile that provides any sort of resources you’ll conquer that tile. If enemies are on such a tile you have to fight the opponent’s army before conquering the tile. With your new resources you can build more troops and with those new troops you can repeat the process. Compared to other 4X games COE3 is rather easy and doesn't acquire a lot of learning although a tutorial is completely missing. I got all the information i needed to play the game through the manual. It sucks that there is no tutorial because I think every game should have some explanation on how it works. But that's actually the only coplaint I have. Another great feature are the races you can play as. They all have different abilities and that spices the game up. I would recommend COE3 to everyone who likes 4X games.","March 1, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of content is fantastic and the variety of units and heros makes for many happy hours of fantasy wars.\n\nOne small con is that user interface isn't super friendly so watching a how to or game-play video on CoE3 would be a good way to quickly learn the ins and outs of how to manage your army.\n\nPros include: Huge variety of units and artifacts; I ran into a super powerful ring for the first time after playing for 70+ hours. Random maps; so no two games play out the same. Random events, sometimes a aspiring dark mage will "accidentally” open a gate to the neither world and demons will come rushing out to terrorize the nearby country side.\n\nThe last and perhaps best part about this game, is that each race plays out very different from eachother and yet very close to what you would expect in popular lore. When you play a necromancer, you can raise incredibly large armies in a single turn, these troops, while vast in numbers, are really slow and have no range, but the feeling of impending doom when fighting them as the raise more and more troops is loads of fun! This is a very different feel from playing another school of magic such as the enchanter. With the enchanter you enchant massive Golums to do your bidding or perhaps create Necrotods (snake that will bewitch your enemies troops into fighting for you.)\n\nRegardless of who you play, and there are 17 classes to choose from, each race has a very different feel and style that keeps the CoE3 fresh and fun for many, many hours. I watched someone play it on you tube for 30 minutes before I purchased it. So when I started I had a good grasp of how to play. I would recommend doing this so that you do not get frustrated with the slightly unintuitive interface.\n","August 13, 2014","true","103.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No frills, the graphics and gameplay are pretty straightforward -- use resources to buy units and smash armies into each other. The resources are pretty varied though and the variety of units you can have as well as incounter is pretty vast. One of the best elements I can mention is that you can pick all sorts of different empire types and they all TRULY play differently. Want to be romans will a booming economy and conventional warfare? Pick the Senator. Want to be a hideous monster that can take out towns single-handedly and not depend on armies so much? Take a troll king. Don't mind being weak to start with but able to summon vast armies of deep ones near water? Pick a cultist. or Necromancer, or demonologist. or witch. You get the point. They are all different and have their own nuances. Game can take a while if you play a big map, or just give you a quick fix with large or smaller maps. Recommended if you know what you're getting into and don't mind the first impression on looks alone.

It plays like the old Civilization games, but there's no building of cities - instead you conquer what's out there.  It makes for a faster paced start instead of waiting 15 turns to pop out a settler to expand.\n\nThe varied races play *very* differently which is a pleasant change from most of these games where it's just cosmetic differences between factions.  The Senator (Rome) is a simple faction based around building legions of troops to overwhelm your opponents.  Other factions instead rely on summoning a few super powerful monsters to obliterate the enemy.\n\nThe only negative is that the user interface leaves something to be desired.","September 9, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever played a Civilization game and thought "this is nice, but it's just lacking -something-, feels like it's too aesthetic-heavy, and I really wish it didn't take four days non-stop to play one game"? Try this. The pacing is excellent, each 'race' plays totally differently instead of just having one or two unique units availible only at a certain point in the game and feel fairly well-balanced in spite of it, it only takes a couple of hours to play a game through, you'll continue to have that feeling of exploration and conquest through the game instead of only at the beginning, and it even feels more like you're building an empire than Civ games because NPCs will actually put up a fight, and be genuinely lethal if you let your guard down.\n\nSo, if you'd like a 4X strategy game in an interesting fantasy setting with excellent pacing and very well executed RPG elements, give Conquest of Elysium a try, but only if you can get over games with weak graphics, sound, and interface. Great for classic roguelike players who are used to ASCII graphics and perplexing interfaces.\n\nIf you -don't- like 4X strategy games or are thinking of getting into them and looking for a springboard, just walk away now, this is not the place to start.","March 27, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A very worthwhile way to spend your time if you enjoy strategy turn-based games. Note: I've got hundreds of hours logged with COE3 on Desura.","March 25, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a great game for that price.\n\nLots of options and a lot packed into this game.  Good time killer, but only reccommended if you've played similar games like this before.","May 13","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
