Don't be the only Mech the enemy sees.\n\nOne Life to Live:\nIn standard "Quick Play" game you drop in one Mech, after you die, you will have to wait until that game is finished before you can play that Mech again. In Faction Play (Clan Warfare) you get to drop with 4 Mechs.\n\nThis is a "slow" paced shooter:\n--- Movement and turn speeds are based on the Mech you are in, not the speed you set your mouse to.\n\nVariation:\n---The speed difference alone between the fastest and slowest Mech is over 100kph, leading to huge variations in play style. Aside from this, Lasers, Ballistics/PPCs, Long Range Missiles (LRMs), and Short Range Missiles (SRMs) all have different methods to success.\n\nLocation based damage:\n---  If you "spray and pray", you will get damage in, but fail to kill your opponent. Targeting vital spots is key to putting the enemy down. Let your lasers burn the whole duration into your opponent to get full damage. The opposite is true if you are getting shot, make sure to turn your torso to spread damage.\n\nHeat management is very important:\n--- Almost all weapons create heat on use, and if not managed will put you into a shutdown state, or if you override the shutdown, do extreme internal damage.\n\nCustomization:\n--- Setting your Mech up with weapons and armor of your choosing is the one of the best parts of the game, but you don't get to do that until you buy your own Mech. This does not mean you have to spend real money however, as they give you large bonuses for the first 20 or so matches. Do make your first choice wisely, the forums are a good place to get suggestions.\n\nCost:\n--- You can get a lot out of this game for free. The way you earn money (C-bills) to buy Mechs is by playing more matches, so I can't really consider it a grind. You do need to have Mech Bays in order to buy Mechs however, and these cost MC, which is real money currency.  If you are patient PGI does give away MC and Mech Bays during special events for participation, and task competition. Some Mechs, called Hero Mechs can only be purchased with MC, the only thing that makes them worthwhile is a bonus to C-bill earning, otherwise they are mostly just novelty paint, on a somewhat unique loadout, however never really better than what you can buy normally. If you do want to spend money, I suggest buying MC in a quantity that gets a good discount and buying Mech Bays when they go on sale.\n\n\nCompetitive:\n--- The Match Maker works fairly well, though it is population dependent. If you are new, you will start at the bottom "Tier" which is 5. As you move up, not only does individual skill ramp up, but so does group cooperation.\n\nNGNG has a good youtube channel if you want to see some gameplay.","December 21, 2015","true","228.8"," 447 of 500 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","447","500","7","2"

It's probs because I'm playing on a high end computer so if you have one of these, the game will run flawless for you.\n-Graphics is up to a really good standard, it you want to be picky, the only thing it's laking in is that your surroundings isnt really real enough-not including the fact that you nock trees down when walking through them because thats including real features\n-able to customize the weapons,skins,engine,armour and skills of your mechs, skills is more for your piloting of the mech\n-when you start, you get a lot of bills (which is the mechwarrior earnable currency) which quckly gets you what ever mech you want early, just make sure you save up\n-There are trial mechs for you that rotate all the time so you can try out different mech styles\n\nThere arn't any major cons but there are some minior ones(not so good)\n-it's sort of a unnecessarily hard grind but it's kinda not there when your have so much fun on the game\n-no close combat action because mech warrior is more a fps with mechs\n-It's a little pay to win but this is not a big factor due to the fact that they have trial mechs that you can use until the rotation of the trial mech change. this trial mechs can have some of the strongest battle configurations.\nIf you played League of Legends, the trial system is basicly the same as that\n\nPlease give me a thumbs up if this review is helpful in anyway, please do because this is my first review","December 19, 2015","true","52.5"," 312 of 390 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","312","390","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/porgon/recommended/342200/","porgon","Porgon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/porgon/","399 products in account","Soon I'm sure you'll see a flood of reviews, highlighting the best and worst MechWarrior and Pirrana Games has to offer. On one hand, you'll have people who have played this game for three years and have never had a problem with it. On the other, you'll have people who have felt burned, rightfully so, and still have residual resentment for it. I want to be a slightly more moderate voice, and try my best to review the game as I see it.\n\nI want to start, by saying I find the game fun, and I've been playing it on and off for three years. It's a very niche game, even if it didn't have giant stompy robots which is a niche genre all itself, it's "a thinking man's shooter" which takes a more slow, methodical approach to First Person Shooters. Because of this, it offers a very unique experience which, if you like that sort of thing like I do, it's very hard to find another game that quite scratches the same itch.\n\nThe game is Free to Play in the same sort of way that Ketchup is a vegetable, it's technically accurate for some value of the term. For the most part, at it's best, the game is Pay2NotGrind and Pay4Vanity. At it's worst, however, you have things like the Stalker Hero "Misery," a $30 dollar reasonably solid 'meta' mech that is only available with cash money.\n\nWhich is actually the real bulk of the problem, the pricing for the game is very, very high for very little. You can take a look for yourself at the "DLC" on this page - each of those Performance Packs are for two mechs, which - minus a boost to the earnable in-game currency - are identical to their earnable with in-game currency counterparts. I'm sure you'll hear about the $500 gold mech packages they offered a year ago, ( technically, still are offering from a year ago ) but that really is a extreme, argueably not entirely PGIs fault since they were still under IGP at the time, and I'd like to believe everyone involved has learned their lession and will never do anything like it again ( although, like I said, the offer is still available. )  The more consistant reality of it is somewhere around $20-30 for a mech, which is still fairly high.\n\nThe good news is, for the most part, nearly all mechs become available with the earnable in-game currency some months after they're released to people who first "pre-ordered" the mechs in early access packs, and after they're released to people for cash money. ( Pay2NotWait? ) Usually this isn't a problem although sometimes the mechs are slightly to very OP and unbalance things, making the game unfun for anyone who didn't pre-order. The only real exception to this are "Hero" mechs which normally are slightly underpowered but gimmicky varriants of a mech, sometimes with ties into lore, but generally aren't the best version of any mech. Usually. There are exceptions.\n\nA lot of the residual resentment I mentioned earlier stems from the previous tendency to remain close-lipped about the direction the game was going, to ignore any real community feedback, and a very slow development cycle. Most of these have been improved upon since PGI got out from under IGPs thumb - Development has severely picked up pace and new things besides mech packs have been added to the game fairly frequently. PGI is much more open about what they're doing / what direction they want to move the game into. Feedback from what I've seen is still somewhat spotty, although from my understanding they decided to not go through with "ghost damage," a mechanic that was nearly universally hated - where in the past they would have just gone through and added it anyway ( looking at you 3rd Person and Ghost Heat ) - so, I suppose that too is improving.\n\nOverall, since I need to select Yes or No to "Do you recommend this game?" I have to say no.\n\nI like the game, I find it fun, but that doens't make it a good game by default. Between shaking off the ghost of IGP past, elements from three years ago which still feel unfinished ( mostly looking at Community Warfare here, which while "still in beta" has been worked on since launch ) and a high cost of premium elements ... It's just not a good game for the everyman.\n\nAdded onto the fact that even if this game was perfect, it would still be kind of a niche game - and some people would just not be able to get into it - it makes those flaws even more hard to overlook when considering a binary "Yes or No" answer.\n\nI would, however, suggest that if you think you might be able to get into it - to at least give it a try and find out. Don't spend any money on it until you're sure you like it, but if you do - like I said, it's a fairly unique experience and hard to find games quite like it.\n\nSmall, Edit :\n\nEverything up until this point is aimed for potential new players, not members of the prexisting userbase. I don't need to explain what's good or bad with the game to you, you already know and have your own opinions, and that's fine, you're more then welcome to make your own review or tell me what you agree or disagree about mine - conversation is good.\n\nBut, this, and only this is specifically for the prexisting userbase - I understand you like this game, I understand being critical of things you enjoy can be hard, but be a little respectful, would you? If you're so concerned about one negative review turning people away then how do you think they're going to react when they read the comment section?","December 10, 2015","false","134.2"," 1,799 of 2,440 people (74%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","74","799","2","81","257"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meauxyesyesyaw/recommended/342200/","meauxyesyesyaw","Department of Dystopian Future","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meauxyesyesyaw/","307 products in account","Edit:\nThere seem to be a lot of people who are eager to downvote reviews for no reason.\nI'm up for criticism, so if you find my review to be not helpful, let me know why.\n\nThe Thing:\nSince it's release I've been coming back to this game and it will very likely remain one of my all time favorites\nDon't let my relatively low play time on Steam fool you. I've been playing this game for a long time before it was on Steam. [hipster]And obviously before it was cool.[/hipster]\n\nThe thing I probably like most about it is it's complexity. It is indeed a rather complex game and it requires time to learn and overcome. If you prefer a more casual approach to a game similar (similar, not the same!) to this, I'd recommend Robocraft.\n(EDIT: I do not recommend Robocraft anymore!)\nBut this here is Robocraft for grown-ups, for people with fully developed breasts and beards.\nI'm serious. You will have to invest time into this game for it to be good. And, if you do, it's going to be really good, that much I can tell you.\n\nWhat to expect:\nVery tactical and very team-oriented games of 12 versus 12 giant robots from the future, armed to the teeth.\n\nMostly extremely customizable mech-loadouts (depending on faction).\nAny mech plays differently, some of them fundamentally differently. Even a single mech can play very differently, if you just change the weapons.\nDo you like to let rockets rain down on your enemies from 1000 meters away? Or do you want to do sustained damage with lasers over medium distances? Maybe you like to just go in and brawl face to face with short range missiles. Maybe you feel like a supporter and want to help your mates by providing visuals on enemies for your team to lock on.\n\nThe four weight classes (light, medium, heavy, assault) are very distinct from one another.\nLights, for instance, are able to easily outmaneuver the rather cumbersome assault mechs. But lights also have very little armor and, of course, not as much firepower as the bigger ones.\nMedium mechs feel like a good allround-weight class, probably best to start with.\nHeavies to me are, well, heavier mediums. That's not meant to sound derogatory. After all, heavies are heavier than mediums, because they have more room for armor and weapons. They're probably as good of a weight class to start out with as mediums.\n\nWithin the game itself there's both a casual approach, as well as a more competetive player base.\nYou can drop (your mech gets deployed by a dropship) in games alone with other loners, who might play well as a team or mess up completely, because they're bad at communicating. These drops are referred to as PUG-drops (Pick Up Group). Or you can form a group of up to 12 players and drop with them.\nThere's faction play, where units (basically the name for the guys with tags in front of their names, in other games usually called 'clans') come together to fight for star systems. They can control star systems and have to defend them against other units, or they will lose control over them.\nThere's also a lot of people role playing, who enjoy lore-based... stuff. I mean, lore-based things, you get the idea. Duels between two mechs for instance, with important things like, I don't know, honor and ♥♥♥♥. Read the books.\n\nThe devs are cool and nice and react and interact and everything. They stream on Twitch on a regular basis where you can watch them work on new content and watch them just generally be in touch with their player base.\n\nThe devs also reward players for playing. There's been customer appreciation reward programs. Within these you'd receive rewards varying from C-Bill-rewards (C-Bills are the ingame currency you earn by playing) just for playing the game. Plus, if you've decided to put money into the game and buy MC (the ingame currency bought for $$$) or one of their mech packs, you usually get a whole bunch of other things (including MECHS!) for free.\n\nThis game has one of the most mature player bases I know. People usually are more respectful and more helpful. After all, there's a high likelihood of them having fully developed breasts and beards.\nYou can easily drop into a game at any time, ask for new friends and what you get is people who want to marry you. There's also a looking for group function in the main menu. This way you can easily group up with strangers from all over the world. It's like OKcupid, but with giant stomping robots, war and explosions. What more could you wish for?\nThere are a few things that shouldn't go unmentioned, though:\nIn the beginning, meaning for your first 25 matches, you will receive very high C-Bill rewards. Same goes for completing the tutorial, which you should play in any case. You'll have a few million C-Bills after completing those first matches and the tutorial. After this, however, progress will be much slower.\nYou have to be aware that sometimes earning C-Bills feels like grinding. Other times it's a lot of fun, because it just happens while playing. After all, there's a certain satisfaction to melting through your enemies' armor and soldering off their arms to cripple their firepower. I mean it. This is something I haven't experienced in any other game so far.\n\nIt is after your 25 first matches and after the completion of the tutorial when you should start looking for which mech you want to buy first. For this you'll have to read into the meta a little, at least that's what I'd recommend. There are some helpful videos on the Tubes of You, too.\nSearch for mechs that are good, avoid mechs that really are bad (not many, but they do exist at the moment).\nAnd if at first you don't like the mech you purchased, don't worry. It might just take some time to get used to it and figure out the way it's played best. This really does take some time with any mech, especially if you're just starting out. So take your time, don't get frustrated too easily.\nIf after a while you still don't like your first mech, try different builds on it. If you still don't like it, try a mech of another weight class.\n\nYou will have to use trial mechs for your first games. These mechs are being interchanged every now and then, so people can try out different ones.\nThere are 4 mechs free to use in every weight class. 2 of each belong to one of the two factions: The Inner Sphere or the invading Clans.\n\nThe game is not pay to win.\nYes, certain mechs are only available for MC. But they are not superior. Some (few!) of them happen to be within higher tiers of the current meta, but they are surrounded and outnumbered by mechs for C-Bills. Others are only available for real $$$ over a period of time, before getting released for the purchase with C-Bills.\nSome of the things you can buy for MC include premium time and cosmetic items, such as paint jobs for your mech or cockpit items.\nBy the way, there are lots of events that let you earn cosmetic items, mech bays or even mechs, simply by participating.\n\nYou will need free mech bays in order to park new mechs.\nIn the beginning you have a few free mech bays. Once they are full, you obviously need new ones. Mech bays can only be bought for MC OR have to be earned by participating in events. If you really, really don't want to invest any money whatsoever in this game, you can do so. But then you should make sure to participate in most of the events. Otherwise you won't have enough free bays to park your mechs at some point.\ntl;dr\nWow. This was a long review.\nUnfortunately there is no way for me make this short. It is a complex game that deserves a long review. I recommend you read the whole thing.\nUltimately I recommend you play the game.","May 8","true","242.5"," 135 of 163 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","135","163","16","6"

If you don't care about the background skip to the pros and cons!\nKeep in mind when reading MWO Steam reviews that there is a huge community schism regarding MWO.  Many old players (sometimes called 'Islanders') are justifyably frustrated by PGI's handling of the game.  Others (the 'white-knights') believe that the game is finally in a good place and is getting better, and that PGI is therefore forgiven for past transgressions.  Most probably fall somewhere in-between.  I would like to imagine I fall somewhere into the third camp.\n\nNow for the bad news.  As many things as MechWarrior Online does right, there are still so many things wrong with it I cannot in good conscience recommend it to new players.\n\nI will skip the diatribe about PGI's terrible history with community relations (I was a Legendary Founder which means I paid way too much money during alpha for a product that fell short of almost all of its design goals) and focus on the pros and cons of the game as it stands now.  Other reviews adequately cover the game's rocky history.\n\nWhat I like-Very graphically appealing\n-Sound is immersive\n-Combat feels visceral and intense.  Inflicting and recieving damage involves a lot of sparks, explosions and camera shake\n-Battlemechs have never felt stompier!\n-Matches are generally fast and tight\n-Weapons feel thematic (Lasers travel instantaneously and 'burn' for an extended duration, missiles are fired in swarms, ballistics throw sparks on impact and cause the victim's cockpit to jerk)\n-Is fairly simple to learn and play without lacking strategic depth\n-Teamwork is paramount and rewarded through play\n-The community can be great\n-A number of people have correctly pointed out that new players get a number of c-bill injections to help them outfit their first mech or two.  It's a nice touch, as long as new players are careful about what they spend this cash on\n\nWhat I don't-The grind is obscene.  There are people who will tell you otherwise.  They play a lot more than you and have the skills, equipment and chassis to rack up those c-bills.  As a new player, you won't have this luxury, so expect an uphill battle to afford even one properly equipped chassis with double heat sinks, endo-steel structure, an engine that doesn't suck and a loadout that won't overheat after one alpha this isn't entirely true anymore, new players will likely be able to afford their first chassis relatively quickly but will suffer from a rapid dropoff of income once their rookie bonus runs out\n-Related to the above, PGI prices content like mechs higher than any other F2P game I've ever played.  Hearthstone and League of Legends both require far less time and money to 'max out' an account on, and many complain about the grind in those games\n-The metagame is somewhat rigid and PGI hasn't done a great job of balancing it\n-There is a serious lack of variety in terms of maps and modes - while it is not as bad as it used to be pretty much there are only two things to do, competitive community warfare matches (meh) and random queue brawls (this is almost all of what you'll be doing)\n-Grind\n-New players aren't given any freebies, they have to play with garbage trial mechs that use stock configurations from the tabletop game until they can afford to invest in one of their own It has been brought to my attention this is no longer the case.  The trial mechs are far better designed than they used to be, I might even pilot a few tonight!\n-While the bonus cash for new accounts is nice, the falloff afterwards can be pretty staggering.  Especially since you still need to skill 3 variants of a mech in order to unlock the elite skills\n-The community can suck\n-Did I mention the grind?\n\nConclusionI usually don't review games on steam, but I felt compelled to in this case.  MWO is very close to being the great game it always had the potential to be, but PGI needs to seriously reconsider their pricing model as well as the pacing of in-game rewards if they don't want to drive away most of their new Steam players.\n\nAs a prospective player, my recommendation would be that you play the game and find out for yourself.  It costs you nothing but the time it takes to download and play it, so unless you're an impulsive spender it can't really hurt to see if it appeals to you.  There isn't really anything else like it on the market.\n\nEdit: for those who don't understand why I gave this game a negative review despite its merits, there is no option between 'recommend' or 'not recommend'.  For the time being my opinion leans towards the latter.","December 11, 2015","false","8.6"," 768 of 1,134 people (68%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","68","768","1","36","74"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameaholicExtraordinaire/recommended/342200/","GameaholicExtraordinaire","Blackloch°","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameaholicExtraordinaire/","429 products in account","How can I sum up something so great as Mechwarrior Online into a short, readable review that won't sink too deep in analysing the techical aspects of the game?\n\nLet's start by explaning what this game is all about...\nMechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe (1984), where different clans fight from planets and resources. You play 12 vs. 12 matches in various game modes and maps. Fighting, winning, and getting more money according to your combat performance has a great role in the game, but tinkering and customizing your 'Mechs is also a HUGE part of MWO (Mechwarrior Online).\n\n'Mechs\nSo what are Mechwarriors then? Mechwarriors are the brave pilots of these huge lumbering mechanical tanks that have evolved from the basic battletank design into more efficient walking weapon platforms, 'Mechs.\n\n'Mechs are divided into different categories according to their chassis weight: Light Mechs (35 tons), Medium Mechs (55 tons), Heavy Mechs (75 tons) and Assault Mechs (100 tons).\n\nLights are commonly used as scouts and intel 'Mechs, but they're also very efficient at taking down bigger assault mechs due to their great mobility. A pack of fast moving Light Mechs can easily swarm a bigger, slower 'Mech punching holes into the armors, tearing down weapons and limbs, eventually destroying it. And that can happen very fast if you're stranded too far from your team members.\n\nMedium and Heavy Mechs are bit bigger, slower, carry more armaments and armor and can take up more beating than Light Mechs.\n\nAssault Mechs are the biggest, slowest heavy hitters that you can see on the battlefield. A good Assault pilot will wreck everything coming it's way - but do not think that more weapons always means more success in combat. There are so many factors that you have to think during combat.\n\n'Mech Loadouts\nEvery new 'Mech you buy comes with a stock loadout. Every 'Mech has 3-7 variants, which means the chassis of the 'Mech is pretty much the same, but the weapon hardpoints are different. One chassis might be more suitable for missile focused loadouts and other might have only hardpoints for energy weapons. On top of that, every chassis has Quirks, that give bonuses for movement, torso rotation speed, laser range, missile cooldowns etc. As I'm writing this review (Jan, 2016) there's been some rumours about the Quirks system going away somewhere in future, but I can't verify it at the moment. Personally I've always like the Quirk system, as it makes even the "crappiest" 'Mechs still good when compared to the best of the best Clan 'Mechs.\n\nThe great thing in MWO is that you aren't limited into certain builds on every 'Mech. Once you select a 'Mech and open the loadout screen, you can fine tune pretty much everything from it and these all have advantages/disadvantages on battlefield. For example engines: you are free to tear down that small engine and replace it with a bigger, more faster engine. That'll make your 'Mech jog around faster, but bigger engine always means more weight too. More engine weight means less free tonnages available for weapon systems and other equipment. You can replace the normal STD-engines with lighter XL-engines. XL-engine weights less, but takes more space - and every 'Mech has a certain amount of free slots for equipment. On top of that the XL engine takes up space from both sides of torso too (Normal STD engine only uses center torso), so if someone punches a hole into your side torso, the engine is destroyed immediately. Destroyed engine means, blood, tears and game over.\n\nTo combat the tonnage limit of every 'Mech, you can modify the chassis by replacing the stock structures with more lighter Endosteel structure. This will free up some more tonnages for armaments, but once again, takes up more space. When juggling for a balanced build for your new ultimate 'Mech, you should keep in mind that all weapons create heat too. The constant shooting of lasers for example can overheat the systems, which causes the 'Mech to shutdown. You can disable this overheat protection manually in tight spots, which basically means you can strain the system longer, keep on shooting and let your 'Mech take some punishment. If you overheat too much, it could lead into ammo explosion inside torso, which equals a wrecked 'Mech - or the weapons in your arms might explode, which usually means the losing of that arm.\n\nThe possibilities are quite endless and I don't want this review turn into a full 'Mech building guide. I'm just trying to give you an idea how vast the 'Mech customizing options are. There are lots of advanced guides available in the Internet about 'Mech builds, module usage and group tactics. Some of the biggest clans also help train their pilots.\n\nEverything you do on the battlefield gains you points. This means doing damage to enemy 'Mechs, making the final killshot, assisting other with target painters, UAV drones, protecting your fellow Mechwarriors with ECM blanket etc. These points gain you pilot AND Mech experience (XP). These XP-points can be then used to unlock new modules and perks for your 'Mechs - making you better equipped and more skilled in combat. The list of the skills, modules and one-shot consumbales is quite vast, so there's no point of me listing them here.\n\nBut you'll probably get the picture now. You can fine tune and micro manage alot of things in your 'Mechs. But this doesn't mean you have to. The basic loadouts are decent and there are Trial 'Mechs available for new pilots. These Trial 'Mechs change from time to time and they are a good way to give you a feeling what might work best for you.\n\nFree tip\nIf you're interested in the game and want to give it a spin, I'll higly recommend you first go through the tutorials. Not because "we don't like noobs in the battlefield". Well, we do hate it - but completing the tutorials give you a generous amount of starting capital for your first own 'Mech. And as a new player your get cadet bonus from your first 25 games, so if you go there with no idea how to play the game, you just probably f*ck up your first 10 games, get sucky points, gain less money and cadet bonus on top of that.\n\nBe a valuable asset to your team - get more points - earn more money - earn more Cadet Bonus. That'll be enough to give you a good amount of money to buy a decent 'Mech with a custom loadout. Oh, and don't accept every opinion you read as the only "truth". There are many ways to play this game and if some 'Mech is especially good in one thing, it doesn't mean you HAVE TO play it like that.\n\nF2P? P2WIN? C-Bill? MC?\nLike any other Free-To-Play game these days, MWO also has micro transactions for cosmetic stuff like colors, camo patterns, cockpit items etc. If you feel like supporting the game - or just want to save time - you can also buy 'Mech packs or MC (Mechwarrior Credits) with real money too. MC is the premium currency that you use for cosmetic purchases, but you can also unlock 'Mechs with it. On top of that, you can speed up your personal progress by buying some Premium Time, which means more XP and credits after every match. Nothing game breaking in my opinion since it still keeps the battlefield even and everything in-game can be obtained just by playing the game too. (Excluding the Hero-Mechs that offer a +30% money boost)\n\nI've been playing this game before it came into Steam around 400+hrs and that's just counting the hours in a fight. There's no telling how many hours I've been sitting in the loadout screen, fiddling with the next setup. So, it's easy to say I'm pretty addicted to this game. Mechwarrior Online is one of my long time favorites and I'll heavily recommend it to anyone who loves fictive combat simulators with a good amount of realism on the background. It takes some learning to understand the game mechanics, but it's definitely worth it!","January 14","true","118.8"," 95 of 122 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","95","122","2","0"

To qualify that: I was one of the first 500 invited into the closed beta in 2012. I have also played community warfare (CW) with some of the best players in the game since that game mode was added over a year ago.\n\nIn 2011 I bought a 60 (Canadian) dollar founders pack for this game, because I feel that is a sane and reasonable limit to spend for a quality videogame product. And, despite the thumbs down on this review, at the time I was completely happy with my purchase. That 60 dollar founders pack came with an exclusive mech, 30 days of premium time, and 20 000 MC (the paid for currency of this game).\n\nToday to buy the same collection of things in mechwarrior will cost you over 100 American dollars, and brings up the real issue I have with this game: The fun you will have is a byproduct of a gaming experience that has been designed from the ground up to take from you.\n\nIf you decide to play this game, you will face an extremely punishing grind. "Mastering" a mech involves grinding out three tiers of skills with xp, which unlocks various bonuses that are straight upgrades. If you want that 7.5% faster run speed (huge) you will need to basic out all the elite skills on 3 mechs of the same chassis, essentially slightly different versions of the same mech. This is assuming that you have ground out enough cash to purchase the 3 mechs, and outfit them with good weapons, and upgrade them properly. It goes without saying that all of this takes a significant amount of time.\n\nThe classic rebuttal to this is the argument that this is a free to play game, and people are free to pay to bypass the grind. That fails to denude the fact that this game will either take a lot of your time, or a lot of your money, or sometimes both (you can't buy those mastery skills but you can buy premium to help you grind faster). The carrot of mech stomping laser blasting fun lies at the top of a steep greasy hill, and the people on that hill will be firing at you the whole time you're climbing up.\n\nThis is the price you are expected to pay as a new player, and it is why I cannot recommend this game to any of my friends or you.\n\n"review the game play" - Man in comments section\n\nThe basic controls and movement in MWO are actually pretty solid, it's probably the thing this game does the best. You feel like a big heavy mech, your arm weapons can track different target than your torso weapons, you get stuck on tiny rocks a LOT. That last item was sarcasm. You will constantly be clipping up against small pieces of terrain that don't really serve a purpose and can't be destroyed or crushed like a proper mech should be able to do. Also, as a related issue, there are problems with the hitboxes on a lot of terrain. You will often see your lasers and autocanons impact a rock that is visually several feet to the side. Also, there are no targets in this game other than enemy mechs. There are no tanks, vehicles, helicopters, or infantry to give you a sense of scale to undercut how much psychotic power you should be feeling while driving a multi story killing machine. The hitboxes on mechs also suffer a lot of problems related to their geometry. You can take damage on your back armour when being shot from the front sometimes for no reason.\n\nThe weapon balance in this game is atrocious, but I'm not going to be able to talk about balance in this game without incurring a LOT of vitriol from old timey mechwarrior fans who's deluded iron grip on a tabletop game that ceased to be relevant 20 years ago turns every rational discussion about balance in this game into a horde of mewling cries of "th th thats not like the tabletop!" So I expect to have a lot of fun with the comments section after this edit.\n\nThe battletech tabletop game doesn't let players control which part of the enemy mech they shoot, it's decided with 2d6 instead. In the land of first person shooters, you get to decide how you want to click on the screen, which is something a lot of the diehard tabletop crew isn't very good at and doesn't understand. In MWO, the best builds are the ones that do a ton of alpha damage to a concentrated specific part of the enemy mech, usually center torso or legs. That is just objectively the fastest way to kill someone. The best weapons for this are lasers, because they are hitscan, have decent range, and also weigh much less than their counterparts, ballistic and missile weapons. For the most part, there is no reason to use anything else. On the other end of the spectrum, you have long range missiles (LRMs) which are laughably useless. They require a target lock, and then you need to wait for a long arcing travel time while maintaining that lock for the missiles to connect. They hit in a spread pattern which doesn't synergize with the whole "kill them quickly" plan. They also have a minimum range, where the missiles just impact and do nothing. Also, the expensive and costly "target deprivation" pilot module breaks target lock as soon as you break line of sight. Experienced players who know how to position themselves almost never get hit.\n\nClan vs Inner Sphere is also a big problem. In Battletech lore, the clans are a seperate faction of militant space facists who show up halfway into the timeline so FASA could make some more money. Clan mechs run faster, carry more weapons for less weight, have improved cooling, carry more armour, and take more internal damage before being destroyed. They also have the only mechs in the game with MASC at the moment, which is basically a sprint button. The developers initially added clans into the game with the same values they had on the tabletop without really any balance considerations. Whoever had spent real money on a clan mech was god for several months. The developers tried to bring Inner Sphere mechs up to par by giving them "quirks" internal perks that are bound to specific chassis that do things like increase heat dissipation or decrease cooldown on specific types of weapons. This system works but only for a small handful inner sphere mechs out of hundreds of possible choices, the rest of them have mostly useless quirks, like increased range on anti missile systems (nobody uses these).\n\nThe reality of this is mostly ignored by a huge section of the community. You will rarely see good builds, even at the highest matchmaking tier. You will also run into a lot of people who call themselves "support players" which is just another way of saying that they will be the last on your team to die hiding behind a hill because they only brought LRMs. If you ask for advice, most of the time that advice will be wrong. I can honestly say that this is one of the most fanatically ignorant gaming communities that I have ever born witness to.\n\nIf you plan to play with anything less than 11 other friends this game is miserable to play from a team co-ordination perspective. Most solo que matches involve teams milling around aimlessly until one of them is dead. If you que up with a buddy, you will end up in the group que with a bunch of other small un-cordinated teams usually sided against a full 12 man most of the time. If you que up for CW by yourself things only get worse, because those games take longer, usually end up more lopsided, and have no actual matchmaking to determine who plays who.\n\nThis game is basically the video game interpretation of the malebolge from Dante's Inferno.","December 12, 2015","false","35.3"," 881 of 1,337 people (66%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","66","881","1","88","72"

And as a new player I notice that this game gets a lot of hate for the product it used to be, rather than what it is.\n\nAs it stands, the game is generally very stable. I've been disconnected twice at the time of writing this and once was because of an earthquake at their server locations. It's a deep, tactical shooter with a lot of customization available. If you value positioning, constant map reassessment, tactics, and precision over snap accuracy then you should try MWO.\n\nThe F2P model is reasonable enough, and the game is not P2W. Within the first couple dozen games, anyone can afford a top tier mech layout. I don't know if MWO is going to continue with the frequent events they've been doing, but with them the grind is much less noticable with things like mech credits (paid currency), c-bills (in game currency), and premium time all being given out for free. I'd actually say the rate at which you get new stuff is about right with these events, so it may be too slow without them.\n\nThere is a little bit of an extra grind to get to the top which is with modules. Modules require global XP to learn the skills to use them and the modules cost a lot of c-bills (like as much as a new mech without being outfitted). Because of the ELO system in the game, Pilot Skill Rating (PSR), you won't really being playing against people with this gear in quick play. You will, however, be playing against these people in Community Warfare (CW).\n\nCW is a fun mode that's a nice alternative to quickplay as the objectives are no longer symmetrical. It's meant to act as the global scale war that fits in with the lore of MechWarrior. It's not fully fleshed out yet though, and the main benefit for participating is ranking up with the various factions which do have some unique rewards. But the feeling of making a true impact isn't there yet. It's also not completely balanced between the factions.\n\nCustomer service has been good so far. I had an account issue that they resolved quickly, even with the holiday hours.\n\nBottom line: MWO is fun to play, offers a good freemium model, and the company seems to have changed their mentality in running this game for the better.","December 30, 2015","true","96.9"," 114 of 154 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","114","154","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chayf/recommended/342200/","Chayf","Sho ga nai, the science guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chayf/","253 products in account","There's little more for me to say when so many other reviews have aptly described the issues with this game, so I'll be blunt:\n\nTry it if you really, really want to. There's no loss involved. But expect to be punished unless you're a veteran coming back or you've already spent money on the game.\n\nSince other users have already thoroughly warned you about PGI's track record (and if you haven't seen that yet, you should glance through a few negative reviews, because they're valid,) I'll focus instead on warning you on what you, as a new player, should expect to see starting out.\n\nThe community is insular. They'll go on for hours and hours about how they want to be inviting and friendly, but their behavior and conduct don't reflect this. Teamplay is important, so pugs are referred to disparagingly by even the most polite of players. Most people still playing are still playing because they have intimate ties to the Battletech or Mechwarrior licenses; the game preys on their nostalgia and they in turn feed the machine and defend it from disparaging remarks. If you play other video games, expect to hear players lamenting about the "call of duty" crowd or other such stupid garbage - further distancing themselves from the general community of online PC gamers at large.\n\nThe grind is deceptively monumental: you get a massive boost in cbills (ingame currency) via your first 25 matches and by completing the tutorial, which is generally enough to purchase (though not properly outfit) a single inner sphere mech. If you want to be on even remotely even footing with anyone else, you will need to do this three times: purchase three variants of a single mech, outfit those three variants so they're viable enough to play (stock builds are enormous garbage,) and then play them until you rack up enough experience points to grind out all their "basic skills," which are flat percentage increases to your mech's performance (reduced heat generation, increased acceleration and deceleration, the works.) This will allow you access to a chassis' "elite skills," which are even more powerful advantages afforded to you for greater XP cost (including increased top speed.) Unlocking all four on a variant will literally double all bonuses conferred from basic skills. Yes, you read that right. Grinding obscene amounts of experience into a mech makes it infinitely superior to the same variant, same build, piloted by a new player, regardless of player skill.\n\nAfter your cadet bonuses are gone, your average income per match as a new player may run anywhere from 50,000 cbills (on a loss) to 300,000 cbills (on a well-played win. You will not see this much money as a new player, as the game's mechanics are relatively complicated, poorly explained, and map design is extremely unforgiving to inexperienced players.) You can probably expect about 100k to 150k per match if you're new. Mech prices vary wildly depending on tonnage, stock loadout, and technology (a clan heavy omnimech with a gauss rifle is going to be much more expensive than an inner sphere light mech with medium lasers and machine guns.) You can expect a decent IS heavy to run you about 7-8 million cbills, then outfitting it with decent weapons, upgraded systems (endo-steel and double heat sinks are generally a must) and a good engine may cost you as much as 7 million more. You can expect a decent clan mech (the stormcrow and timber wolf, both clan mechs, are still bar-none the best vehicles in the game) to run you anywhere from 10 million to 14 million cbills, but luckily there's less to upgrade. Sure hope you know what actually performs well, though, because if you ♥♥♥♥ up and build something ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you'll be selling it back for a fraction of what it cost you.\n\nWeapon balance is comical. There exist entire weapons systems in the game that are completely useless, including machineguns and flamers. No one will tell you this, because A) PGI doesn't understand their own game and balances around a meta they know nothing about, B) the game is loaded with whales who believe themselves to be experts on the game's balance who will tout that you can pilot anything and perform well, as long as you know what you're doing (they don't.) and C) knowledge is steeply guarded by anyone who actually knows how to play the game. "Comp" teams are fiercely protective of their strategies and aren't about to share tips and tricks with every Tom, ♥♥♥♥, and Harry fresh off of steam. There was a line from the old Battletech cartoon that the players think is a hilarious meme: "Information is ammunition." Well it's true, and ammunition is both in shortage and at a premium.\n\nSuffice it to say that lasers are almost universally better than any other weapon.\n\nMap design and the existence of 12v12 matches also have a massive impact on weapon balance, and very few players seem to understand this. Small arenas defined by chokepoints, DotA lanes, massive sight lines, and confusing geometry are the order of the day. Scale is confusing and map geometry frequently makes little sense (why are there rocks in the middle of river city if they offer poor protection from literally any angle? Why is forest colony so huge when there's no objective but to head straight for the middle and fight with the enemy?) Because teams are composed of 12 mechs, the key to victory is focusing targets. Even a premade composed of 12 clown-shoed morons like NKVA can stomp all over the game's population (which is likely to include you, new steam user.) The community will frequently lament the TTK (time to kill) being much too fast, blaming this on the weapons systems and completely disregarding that despite the game's glacial pace for an arena shooter, their woes can be attributed to the fact that the Smart Strategy is to move in a big blob and shoot the same target. These are the same people who sarcastically remark that "teamwork is OP" if you try to bring up disparities in the weapon and technology balance department.\n\nTL;DR the game is stupid, the devs are stupid, and the community is either stupid or uninterested in sharing with you how to get good. The game is enormously rewarding to those who have invested ungodly hours into it, and severely punishing of those who have not. The players and devs alike are confused at how this formula continues to drive away new blood, which the game desperately needs to survive, and don't understand why it leads to a mind-bogglingly steep pricing scheme, like paying 120 US dollars for a mech pack. But they totally want you to come revitalize their game. Because it is their game, after all. Not yours.","December 12, 2015","false","38.4"," 717 of 1,130 people (63%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","63","717","1","77","66"

I see alot of complaints about this and I don't agree. Here are my reasons:\n\n-You start out with 4 trial mechs from each weight class (trial as in they're set loadouts, you can't customize them, that's it). So in other words, you start out with 16 mechs to try out. That's plenty for me to start with personally.\n\n-Secondly, you can purchase and customize mechs with c-bills you earn from matches.  It's not too bad really, Ten 8 minute matches got me a good mech that I was able to deck out and start getting more kills with during matches.\n\n-You really could not spend a dime and get a fulfilled mechwarrior experience from this game. I know I did for the first few weeks without spending anything. You can earn everything you need pretty quickly to get a handful of decent to good mechs going, and the game starts you out with some c-bills and some premium time. I only spent money because I started really getting into the game and decided I wanted to get some premium time going and to purchase a champion mech pack at some point. Plus, I honestly felt like the developers earned my money because the gameplay is that good.\n\nOK, let's talk about the heart of the game.  How is the actual gameplay you say?  Well, as a pretty big Battletech fan and someone who played Mechcommander and Mechwarrior 3 & 4... IT'S EFFING FANTASTIC.  God, this is the best part of the game for sure.  I love the gameplay, the visuals effects, the sound effects, the tactics and potential for teamwork, everything.  The battles are how I would imaging actual Mech Combat. The autocannons roar, lasers tear, missiles swarm.  It's so good, I love it.  Even if you're not into battletech, I think most people can appreciate the realistic feel of the mechs, and the roles of the weightclasses: assault mechs brawling, heavy mechs dishing it out, and medium and light mechs supporting. It's beautiful.  I thought Piranha Games nailed mech combat.  Also, customization is awesome and relatively balanced as far as I can tell so far. I will give a fair warning that you have to use a little patience and thought when starting out.  This isn't CoD, you don't charge in and kill.  You have to stick with your team, use cover and try to use hit and run tactics.  Also, try not to drive an Assault mech first thing, you need to work up to that to utilize it properly.  If you're not a Battletech fan, I definitely recommend this game.  If you're a Battletech fan, you have to play this game!!\n\nAlright, so I'll telly you what I think the downsides are.  The quickplay matches are a little repetitive. Not as bad as some people are saying, in my opinion the gameplay more than makes up for it.  That said, there are about 8 or so maps currently, and 3 game modes (assault, conquest, and team deathmatch). It could use a little spicing up for sure. Games typically last 5 to 15 minutes.  However - this is only the quickplay version of the game.\nThe main feature of the game takes place in the form of faction play, which I'm only beginning to get into and understand.  This gameplay takes place in the form of territory conquest in via assault and defence of planets.  This form of gameplay definitely has some more meat to it.  For instance one game mode takes place in the form of defending a base with friendly defense turrets and gates at the front (highly reminiscent of mechcommander i thought) which was awesome.  This is pretty cool, but my problem with faction play so far is it seems more than a little elitist (tons of premades and clans steamrolling PUGs) and not only that but it seems very difficult to break into. Like, it feels like in order to get serious about faction play, I have to prove I'm good enough to join some group that meets every Sunday, etc. Don't like that, a little too reminiscent of WoW or some other mmo for me.  This part of the game is probably a little more pay to win, or, invest a ton of time and reading online forums to win.  I don't like that too much.  The game doesn't explain the faction play very well at all, and the interface is kind of a mess and overloading the player with options.  You have to look it all up online to learn anything.\n\nAnyways, despite a few things I don't care for, I think this game is great.  I'd give it a solid 9/10 to anyone interested in picking this game up.","December 27, 2015","true","315.2"," 67 of 97 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","67","97","3","1"

I played this daily for 2 years, clocking in a ridiculously large amount of time and Mech collection. I watched whole clans come and go as a community spiked up over the hype then died off when the game didn't deliver. It spiral downwards since it was created. We used to talk about it coming to Steam back then, and now, only out of desperation to save this doomed product, has it finally come. This is now the THIRD release for this game.

This is for you PGI. I still haven't forgotten the times you wiped my CBILLS bank for not liking one of my Mech builds and unnecessarily suspending me off the official forums. As I said back then, you can't censor Metacritic. That applies to Steam as well.\n\nMechWarrior Online, August 18, 2014, from my Metacritic.\nPGI is a horrible developer; one of the worst I've seen. They go back on every promise. They miss every deadline. They make fake pipedream promises that'll never come. They censor or ignore their own community. They totally wreck things that were already working fine beforehand. They put in garbage no one wanted like ECM, ghost heat, 3PV, and UI 2.0. These things only hurt the game, not help. But any attempt to tell them this is met with a ban hammer, assuming you get read at all. MechWarrior Online as a whole has only gotten worse since closed beta, not better. Despite being a huge fan of the MechWarrior franchise and old games, I'm not one of the many fanboys that are going to stick up for this crap of a game or developer.\n\nThe most pathetic part of this game is the money grubbing. This isn't just incompetence of "not" knowing how to do... well... anything properly, it's shameless greed. Originally promised with no hero mechs/variants, no consumables, they did exactly that as soon as Founders refund period ended, basically saying "shove it" to everyone that supported them. They then made the cash shop their # 1 priority, filling it out every month with stuff to sell while features the game actually needs continue to go long over due. The stuff they did waste their time on was stuff no one wanted, like 3PV. They'd waste half a year of Dev time for 3PV. Ya, thanks, that worthless feature that shouldn't be in the game that no one wanted nor supported at any point. You wasted all that time just to shove it down everyone's throat. They didn't even deliver it with the option to queue without it as promised. They went back on a big promise by putting in something they originally promised they'd NEVER do, made a new one to do it a certain way, then didn't even bother to deliver on that one either. It also took them well over a YEAR just to put in a no-base TDM. That should have been a day 1 release mode. All that time just to copy/paste a previous mode and take the bases out. That's the level of talent we're talking about here.\n\n"Community Warfare" is slowly becoming just an obvious pipedream. It's like being on a ship and the captain promises you that he knows where he's going and will soon hit land. Surprise, there's no land coming. It's just an inevitable sinking ship. Instead of deliver on promised features, they just make more Mech packages to milk this dying cow for all its worth before it sinks. They now offer 500$ Mech skins. Not even League of Legends did this when they made that ridiculous Ezreal skin. Blizzard doesn't even charge this much for mounts or pets. How much is the newest Blizzard title with all DLCs/optional paid content? Not 500$. You could build a gaming computer with that. The only "Community Warfare" for this game was on the forums, where everyone voiced their complaints to the betrayals, but was met only with deaf ears or ban hammers. During the Founder period, PGI pretended to give a crap about its community and its feedback, but as soon as the refund period ended, they stopped acting, and very obviously so. Well, unfortunately for them, they can't censor Metacritic.\n\nPlease do not support this game. I'm honestly asking you because I'm a true MechWarrior fan, and this game is just one big slap in the face to us. It's an insult and abuse of the license. Worse yet is that for as long as it remains active; the longer we'll have to wait to get a true MechWarrior game again. If you support this game, you're hurting the franchise and every real fan of the series. Please let the game go bust, the sooner the better, so that the long wait for the next MechWarrior game won't be as long. PGI is a terrible company that I can only hope gets shutdown as they deserve. They belong at a Mcdonalds flipping burgers, not trying to make video games. They flat out scammed everyone and continue to try to leech as much as they can from this license's rotting corpse. This was not the revival anyone was hoping for, not even close. The license was better off in retirement. I'd rather it remain dormant and continue waiting for the next game than have a parasite dig it up just to feed on it like a vulture while ripping everyone off in the progress.\n\nI leave you with these articles if you want more evidence as to just why you shouldn't even consider giving these shameless people money.

Personally I think MWO is a great game. I have spent, and will continue to spend, many hours playing it. I've been a player for over 2 years now. It takes a little bit of getting used to it because of the learning curve, but if you want a first person, big, stompy 'mech battle with different types of weapons, then you should try out this game.\n\nYou can drop in quick play for a 12v12 match or go into community warefare with longer matches and more 'mechs. Teamwork is a top priority. Take time to outfit your 'mechs with the right equipment for your playstyle as you go, and unlock skills with your experience points, to improve as a pilot.\n\nPros:\n-Big stompy 'mechs\n-Good graphics and sound\n-Dedicated playerbase from before the Steam launch, but even more players with it\n-Free to play and not pay to win\n\nCons:\n-Steep learning curve (I stongly recommend completing the tutorial)\n-Technical loadouts for 'mechs can be time consuming to research or build, including the grind to get enough in-game money to purchase equipment and unlock skills (though you don't have to go too hardcore)\n\nOverall I say if you're unsure give it a try as it is free, and see if you like it yourself, because everyone is different.

The next third is build said mechs, the mech lab and coming up with builds is one of the best parts of the game. It isn't like most other games, you can make terrible mechs if you don't know what you are doing, but if you know your strengths you can make amazing mechs. The final third of the game is the people, I didn't enjoy MWO initially because I was playing on my own. I connected to the Comstar NA team speak channel and just met people who also play MWO and had a great time. I also lurked and eventually contributed to the forums at http://www.mechspecs.com and I enjoyed the game even more.\n\nYou can drop some real money in the game to buy mechs, and I recommend you do to support the game, but you don't have to because there is no "Pay To Win" aspect of the game.\n\nI've spent more time playing MWO than any game I have ever owned and I still keep coming back for more.

After playing for all this time, I can easily say that MWO has had better staying power than nearly any other computer game I've ever played. I also, for the most part, like the MWO community. I've met some great friends and have a lot of fun playing with them. Although, you don't have to join a group to have fun. I've had hundreds of great games playing solo.\n\nThe ability to customize your mech to fit your chosen game style is great. Scout, brawler, sniper, missile boat, leader or follower. Fast mechs, slow mechs, big mechs or small mechs. Lasers, canons, missiles, or support roles like NARC, ECM, and tag. The game has some real depth to it, and the developers continually work to make it better. My experience with the support team has been good (and I really have had to work with them on some connection issues).\n\nIt's not like most shooters, where your life span is measured in seconds. In games like Halo and COD, I always disliked that the average life span seemed to be 10 seconds or less. In MWO you can live for several minutes while taking fire and get into some insane brawls with opposing mechs. Minor mistakes can be overcome (provided your mistake isn't walking smack into the middle of the opposing team) and you can really make a difference to your side's success even after half your mech is blown off.\n\nHaving said that, the game does have a learning curve. There can be real depth to the gameplay. Teamwork is very key. You have to watch your position relative to your team, your enemy, and the map itself. Some locations on the maps are better than others, and you'll have to discover them. You have to pay attention to your heat, your mechs armor and internal structure, your weapon status, and to be a good player you also have to pay close attention to your opponents status and aim with precision at where they are weakest; all the while maneuvering as best you can to absorb incoming fire while delivering your own.\n\nThe tutorial is pretty good and a must for new players. Several of the existing player groups will also welcome new players and help you learn. I know mine will. If you can, get into one of the teamspeak rooms and ask around, or look at the gaming fourms in the faction groups. Most players are helpful in answering honest questions.\n\nI would recommend premium time at a minimum if you're serious about playing. The 50% boost to Cbills and expierence really add a great deal over time and let you customize your mechs in a relatively short time. I would also recommend you find what kind of mech you like and then give a Hero Mech a try. The Hero Mechs give Cbill and experience bonuses that stack with the premium time. Make money with a Hero Mech and you can purchase and kit out your garage nicely without having to pay a dime more. I have way over a hundred mechs, and most of them were purchased for free, with Cbills earned in the game (or even given away by the developers during special weekend events!).\n\nOf course, some mechs are better than others, and there's always going to be "meta" mechs and builds that are at the top, but the developers really have done a pretty good job of balancing the mechs. The game is definitely NOT pay to win. The Hero Mechs and Premium time ease the grind, but they are not an "I win button." I love that it doesn't matter so much if you are in a light, heavy, or assault mech, if you are a good pilot and play it right, you can beat your opponent regardless of what they are driving. So long as you don't take yourself too seriously (remember, it's a game!) you can have fun with all of the mechs, and there are a ton of them to choose from.\n\nSo what don't I like? I wish the game had better visuals and sound effects for internal ammo explosions (basically the MWO version of a critical hit where ammunication inside a mech starts to explode). I wish some of the original iconic mechs, like the capapult, looked and played like they did in closed Beta (give me back that torso twist and the monster PPC barrels!). I also wish that scouting and support roles gave more rewards than they do now. Oh, and I hate how the gauss rifle works. Other than that, I'd say I'm extremely satisfied in my experience with the game.\n\nOne other point to add is that this game is pretty sanitary for a young person if you are a parent and concerned about your kids watching and/or playing violent games. There's no blood; no humans with guns killing other humans with guns (or worse). It's giant stompy robots blowing up other giant stompy robots, so the sense of human on human violence is much less than other first person shooters.\n\nSo, if you like first person shooters and are looking for a game with great gameplay, good graphics and more than the ten second life-span of HALO and COD, the game is one you should give a chance. It's free to try, so you have nothing to lose, and alot to gain. Good luck, and see you in the next drop!","December 13, 2015","true","223.9"," 127 of 204 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","127","204","4","0"

Your skill matters, but so do your choices regarding what weapons and equipment to put on your battlemech. Instead of being able to respawn, you have a durable giant stompy robot. Armor protects your internal structures (legs, arms, torsos, head) and components, and 'mechs are often able to stay in the fight with multiple destroyed sections. There are a variety of weapon systems, covering short & long range, and burst or steady damage -- with a cooldown & heat management system to keep you from firing all the weapons all the time. Battle awareness and communication play are crucial, as you work with 11 other players to encounter and destroy a roughly even opposing force of 12 rival pilots.

I have logged thousands of matches and have spent a few hundred bucks on the game.\n\nThat said, you'd think I could offer up a recommendation for this game, but I cant really do that. It's literally only the fact that it is a Battletech related game that has kept me involved and willing to deal with the multitude of issues MWO has.\n\nThe most prominent of these is the developer, PGI itself. Much of their more malicious and disengenuous history can be atrributed to the earlier years with IGP calling shots ($500 mech packs for just a golden skin spring to mind) but the absolute glacial progress MWO shows is the most grevious. Its been 3 years and MWO is still just an arena shooter, with next to no actual lore involved in regular gameplay beyond the mechs themselves.\n\nCommunity Warfare attempts to simulate the actual struggle between the IS and Clan forces, but its shortcomings are vast. The game mode itself is extremely limited with extremely unrealistic (an illogical) goals in place in each round. It allows no seperation between solo players and united 12 man groups, something you'd be hard pressed to encounter in any decent online game.\n\nAbsolute miniscule, extremely necessary changes take weeks, even months to be implemented or corrected. PGI has a now legendary history of being completely incapable of small tweaks to balance. Instead, large and sweeping changes are made despite extremely vocal player feedback in test servers. The users who frequent the MWO forums often provide spreadsheets and their own data collection, with reasoned and well versed feedback as to how to make MWO balance better and fair, and it falls on deaf ears.\n\nI dont want to include PGI's pricing scheme in this review, as Im sure it will be mentioned over and over. At the end of the day, I dont think the value even begins to approach what you get, especially when it seems like so little progress gets made. In no exaggerated terms, as someone who has played from the very beginning, MWO is different now after three years of progress: There are more mechs, more (but not many) maps, far worse graphics, more Cockpit novelty items, and a broken community warfare module. It's primary mode of play is still arena shooter, despite having three different ways of calling it (Assault, skirmish, conquest). There is no depth to any of these modes, and no attempt has been made to fix that after all these years.\n\nDespite all of these shortcomings, I continue to play because Ive played Mechwarrior games since 1995. As soon as someone else is given the chance to make a Mechwarrior game, I will wholeheartedly jump ship, because I have a hard time imagining another company could do so little with so much time with the Mechwarrior license.","December 11, 2015","false","55.5"," 374 of 639 people (59%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","59","374","639","20","4"

Very little room for cooling.\n\nA medium mech with balanced armor, slightly more fire power, good speed, and lesser to great maneuverability. Some times has jump jets, has a good balance for adding heat sinks and pretty mech any equipment you may need.\n\nA heavy mech, the back bone of mech warrior arsenal, great armor, slower movement, and low to lesser maneuverability. Fewer heavy mechs have jump jets. You will have to decide what is more important. A higher alpha stike with higher heat spikes, or better sustained fire with very balanced heat.\n\nAn assault mech can have the most fire power, the highest armor, slowest speed, and poor to very poor maneuverability. Very rare to use jump jets in an assault. Heating a cooling on these mechs is completly custom and up to the user.\n\nRoles\n\nLight mechs often are the tie breaker of any match. If you take out the enemy light lance you have almost full control over the battlefield during the course of any match. Lights are the bane of assault mechs. Light mechs are the scouts and the ace in pocket for advanced users.\n\nMedium mech are great for support. They can take a few more hits than the lights and are well balanced to fullfil almost any role long range or short, scouting, sniping, anti air. You name it there is a meduim mech that can do it, they just make poor tanks.\n\nHeavy mechs are the real bread n butter of battle tech. Not too slowed down by a massive amount of armor and the can carry enough fire power to topple almost any mech in seconds 1v1. Heavy mechs also are some of the hottest mechs in the game, so beware of cooling issues.\n\nThe assault mech is more than a tank. If built right, an assault mech can wipe out an entire lance quickly, but their slower speed and poor maneuverability make them prime targets for enemy light mechs and lrms. Do not chase the squirrels in an assault mech it will always end badly for you. If you have a squirrel climbing up your leg, call out to your team for assistance, or you better pray a snap shot can take dispatch them quickly, otherwise your SOL.\n\nVery immportant words,, STAY WITH YOUR TEAM or die alone.\n\nAny first time player should stick with Inner Sphere medium or light mechs for the best playable experiance, they dont cost much but the equipment to add to them does cost a lot.\nPlus the Inner Sphere light have the most customization and max speed of all mechs.\nThen work your way into a medium, heavy, or better, or even Clan mechs. The bigger the mech the slower it is and the bigger target you are for the other team. Light and fast is what I enjoy the most.\n\nI can not recommend Clan mechs for new players. The clan mech are so gimped on tonnage for custom equipment because you can not change your engine, and the heat build up is sky high. They do have better range and more custom hard points, but the heat build up is soo high, you can not balance max fire power with max cooling. The max cooling is never enough for a Clan mech. The Origin ii c mechs trade omni pods (custom hardpoints) for the ability to change engines. They actually work quite well and can be cooled very well.\n\nHope this post was helpful, and do remember to torso twist.","April 20","true","4.8"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","33","45","0","0"

These are big slow stompy deathbots that will get hit by hundreds of missiles, get annoyed and fire back.  Fast kills are rare, instant kills are extremely rare.\n\nA battlemech is a 20-100 ton battle machine.  Each section of the mech has it's own independant health, and you can lose most of them without dying.  For example, if you are running a standard type engine you can lose both arms, one leg, your left torso and your right torso and still keep fighting.\n\nYou get to customize everything.  We're not talking putting skins on your guns, we're talking what guns do you want to carry where, how many rounds for each, how many heat sinks to keep the machine from getting to hot?  What size engine?  How much armor on your left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm, head, left torso, right torso, center torso, left tear torso, right rear torso, center rear torso?  - oh yeah, you get to paint everything too if you still care.\n\nTeamwork is the deciding factor in matches, the nature of the machines and how they move and take damage means that even the most skilled player can't overcome a team that abandons them to the enemy.  Putting your team in a bad spot will lose the match even if you are better shots than they are.  This is chess with more layers of complexity.\n\nPlay intergalactic war.  There are 10 factions vying for control of the universe, pick one and start claiming entire planets in their name as you fight your way across the galaxy.\n\nNow that you have the basics, here's the details on how this game has been.  I joined in closed beta and have been an active player the entire time, including all the massive meltdowns caused by actions of the publisher.  These incidents are incrediby public and easy to look up.  Yes, they earned a bad rep.\nHowever, the game itself is quite fun.  It is not pay to win - the cash only mechs are not inherently better.  Different, but not better than the ones you can get for free.  If anything this game is only pay not to grind, which is fine.\n\nHonest final recommendation?  If you are tired of fast action, actually want to see who is shooting you, and want to actually fight the other guy give this a shot.  If you like it, then put in a few bucks for a pack of mechs, skip a ton of grinding and enjoy yourself.  Also, join a team.  If you don't join a team, you will get constantly stomped in the community warfare mode.

Forget that Hawken junk.\n\n'Mech Warrior Online is set in the battletech universe and as such brings 30 years worth of history and lore with it, though admittedly most of is left on the table and instead you're given a solid, action packed shooter that focuses on what matters: The 'Mechs. And it pulls the combat off excellently. No absured spotting mechanic that plagues these kind of games, no stupid dice rolls and 24% deviance on impact, no sloping and facing that unrealistically bounces shots (Thoug this skill is replaces with your own skills at spreading damage) and of course, no Russian Bias.\n\nBALANCE, as with most shooters is a hard thing to talk about. It's constantly in flux and tryhards always use the current meta builds that weild the most damage in a single strike and nothing else. However saying that, balance is in the best place it's ever been for a long long time. Sure there are still some usless weapons (Flame throwerers) but now it's more about what works on your 'Mech rather than how many of weapon X you can squeeze on. I have never once found a death in MWO to be annoying or 'cheap' in MWO. Something I don't think any other game can claim.\n\n'Mechs themselves are also generally well balanced however there are 'Mechs that are simply better than others in certain weight catagories. They usually have tradeoffs, and many of the "Worse" Inner Sphere 'Mechs have "Quirks" to make them more appealing, like better refire rate on a weapon, more range, more damage, etc. You'll never disregard a 'Mech as fodder when it runs at you, but there are certainly others you'll back away from while calling to your team for help.\n\nMAPS are generally all good in the regular queue. The maps that the community dislikes are being remade with new features added to them and old design issues ironed out and the rest of the maps are for the most part perfectly fine. Everyone has their own favorites but there are no maps that are beyond unplayable and straight up unfair . You'll never find yourself spawning in and thinking "Oh no I'm at this side of the map" at least.\n\nAnd the big one: MICRO TRANSACTIONS\PAY WAL. Long and short there ain't one. It can be a bit grindy to get up to speed, it can feel like a chore to master a 'Mech you've grown to dislike and it can feel like you're so far away from earning that next 'Mech, but it certainly achivable and easily done for free. I have been playing this as a Legendary Founder since day 1 with a friend, who has never every, beyond that first payment put a further penny into the game and he currently has around 80+ 'Mechs.\n\nIf you do pay, it's going to make your life easier, wether it be getting 'Mechs from packs or enjoying the benifits of premium time or perhaps a hero 'Mech (A middling 'Mech on a partcular chassis, only used because they generate 30% more C-bills.) but there are no guns or 'Mechs that you can never have sooner or later.\n\nPay responsibly!\n\nAnd now a little newbie guide:\n\nA new player should hop in the tutorial and complete that, trying to score gold in the movement challenge before moving on to the main game. In the game you'll now get 25 matches that will grant bonus C-Bills known as a cadet bonus. Use these 25 games to get a feel for movment, positioning and managing heat in a range of chassis weights but do not spend a penny of your C-Bills until you get all 25 games done. You should come out with between 15-19 million depending on how well you did. This will let you get pretty much anything you like and I personally would recommend either the Timberwolf or Stormcrow, two very forgiving and powerful units.\n\nA new player should stay _far_ away from Assault 'Mechs and should really really think about if they can handle a light before jumping on it. From here you can now customise your 'Mechs though it's likely going to take a handful of games to earn enough money to do that. Be sure to spend your 'Mech XP in the Skills tab after each game and then use that 'Mech to build up a large stockpile of cash, once you've got three of the same Chassis (But different Mechs, so like TBR-Prime, TBR-C and TBR-D) all skilled up you'll be able to do the Elite catagory of skills and from here you should be able to fend for yourself.\n\nNow find a unit!\n\nGood luck, 'Mech Warriors!","December 14, 2015","true","91.4"," 90 of 149 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","90","149","2","0"

As of this year a new tutorial system has finally been implemented which helps players with movement, shooting, and controls but there still no in-game tutorial on how to navigate the MechLab (where you spend a good deal of time and build/customize 'Mechs). You're at the whims of the community on this one and will need to spend time reading guides and researching player suggested builds, which may be outdated or include biases. Since the MechLab is where you spend money (in-game and real), there's a good chance as a new player that you may spend money on the wrong thing and waste your time and money.\n\nThe overall gameplay once you get past the customization is shallow. In closed beta it was quickly found that the most optimal strategy was to ball up as a team and have everyone target one enemy 'Mech at a time as this would kill them quicker. This creates a snowball where once one team suffers one or two losses it's very hard to bounce back. This is the extent of strategy and tactics years later. It becomes quite repetitive.\n\nEven though there are several game modes they all just devolve into team deathmatch, and some people even get real mad if you decide to play to the game mode objectives instead of just fighting.\n\nCommunity Warfare, which sounds like it would be the main draw to the game, is just an afterthought. It's a bland Attack/Defend gamemode that, like the other modes, devolves into a deathmatch. Objectives are usually ignored. It has such a low population that it's tough to find matches at certain hours, and the matchmaking system has pretty much been stripped out and geared towards 'hardcore' players, which means if you decide to play some matches you'll be going up against veterans with years of experience and hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of kit.\n\nVisually the game used to look better. There was better damage modeling, the animation was better, and much of that deteriorated or was actively removed from the game in patches for some unknown reason. Some of it I'm sure was for performance reasons, but some of the changes over the years were baffling.\n\nOverall, it's a disappointing game when you compare it to what it used to be and what it could have been.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially with so many other great games on Steam.","December 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 290 of 507 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","290","507","11","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackattk/recommended/342200/","zackattk","Knives","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackattk/","206 products in account","Introduction\nI started this game 100% fresh to MechWarrior and BattleTech in general and am loving every minute of it. I don't feel as though it's pay to win, I'm no stranger to tactical shooters so maybe that helps.\n\nAfter my first 25 Cadet games I had ~20 mill C-bills which seemed to be enough to get either a few IS mechs or a single clan mech and completely kit them out with a custom loadout. Which may not seem like alot, considering the vast variety of mech choices there are, but for the most part it's a solid starting point.\n\nFree to Play model\nI will argue that c-bill gain without premium time after those 25 cadet games can be very slow, but just like any similar game to this (World of Tanks, War Thunder, etc) it's just a grind, and for the most part the mechs are fairly well balanced at the moment. Some mechs are argueably just flat out worse than others, but if you learn the game mechanics and play properly any mech can work in the right pilots hands. So far I've spent very little money on this game and I have played it for a solid 2-4 hours minimum per day since I downloaded it and it's still a blast. I personally do not consider this game to be pay2win by any means.\n\nCommunity\nSo far I have had very little problems with the community, the occasional salty teammate in chat, but what game doesn't have that. Not alot of people use the in game VOIP which is relatively disappointing considering the game revolves aren't alot of focus firing and communication, but it hasn't seemed to dictate the overall results of my matches (though the matches go much smoother when communication is present). There is tons of useful information for new and verteran players alike on the forums, pretty much anything I've wanted to learn about the game has been readily available via a simple google search.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nBeing new to MechWarrior the gameplay mechanics at first were a little overwhelming but even the most average of gamers can readily grasp how to play the game and even more advanced mechanics like shielding and such. The introduction tutorial isn't anything incredible but it does give a fairly solid overview of the basics of the game such as targetting components, firegroups, and mech movement. For a little fun shoot the captain a few times after you finish the intial tutorial and are at the MechWarrior Academy.\n\nOverall Verdit\nI would 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters in general, especially tactical team based shooters such as Arma or most Tom Clancy games. Team play is pretty key to success, very rarely does a lone wolf accomplish much in a match of MechWarrior, but even when your team doesn't communicate via chat or VOIP as long as you pay attention and try to focus targets down with your teammates the game doesn't feel like a complete landslide.\n\nAs for a number rating for those who enjoy those silly things, I would say somewhere around 8/10, definitely a game you can get very involved in and play every single day for extended sessions, or even the type of game you can just hop on for a couple matches every once in a while.","December 21, 2015","true","489.1"," 48 of 75 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","48","75","0","0"

Rebalancing will always be an issue, nothing will ever be perfect, this is the nature of an ever changing game.  They have been adding more and more content and attempting to make Community Warfare something that we can all enjoy.  just take the game slowly, it is a bit of a grind to get heavier mechs, but it will be worth it if you are patient.\n\nAlso if you have issues piloting your mech, drive it like a tank, its the same concept.","December 11, 2015","true","203.9"," 109 of 184 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","109","184","3","0"

During that period it would be fair to say that the game has seen some ups and downs. However, over the last year or so, the game has got noticably better and it seems this trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe things are like about it are\n*The combat is extremely deep, and tactical. The ability to specifically target different components to destroy or disable a mech is absolutely brilliantly done\n*The building of mechs. You can totally customise every single mech to your playstyle and liking\n*Balance. This game was horribly unbalanced between Clan Mechs and IS for a long time, but its better than it has ever been before currently\n*Strategy and teamwork. This game rewards intelligence and teamwork over quick reflexes and lone wolfing.\n\nThe things I think could use some work are:\n*Maps. I'd like to see more maps\n*Community Warfare. Currently is too complicated and takes too long to find a game for casuals\n*The graphics. Some parts of the game look great, some like dire. Needs more polish overall.\n*There are still some terrible bugs that need fixing (like the stairs on Viridian bog)\n\nBut overall, the game is great fun, and probably my most consistantly played game of the last few years.

There hasn't been a real Mechwarrior PC game since year 2000, so when the MW:O was announced, hype was real and genuine. The developers of Mechwarrior Online, PGI, stated that MW:O is going to be a credible representation of the rich Battletech universe, with tactical combat, simulator experience of piloting a battlemech, including a large, community driven territory expansion and character development ecosystem, combined with real-time lore timeline progression. PGI called their game “thinking man's shooter”, due to how deep the battlemech customization, information warfare and combat roles are compared to any other arena shooters in the market.\n\nThey weren't entirely wrong, but MWO left a lot of things to be desired. Game has been available for 3 years, however many of the promised features are not in the game, will never be implemented, or are bare bone functional.\n\nMWO offers  two game modes, available to any player. First mode, called “Quick Play”, is an arena game team deathmatch mode, where a matchmaker puts you on a random map of 13, with random people within your skill pool. There is nothing particularly worth mentioning, it is a Team Deathmatch of 12 players per team with no respawns. A quick, straightforward game mode, with high ingame currency and experience gain ratio. It is a recommended game mode for new players, until they grasp the basics of the game, then maybe join a clan and select their faction.\nSecond game mode is called “Faction Play”, previously known as Community Warfare. This is an advanced game mode, meant for intermediate players. You can play it as a novice, but you will be severely handicapped by doing that. FP/CW is a team deathmatch with objectives, where a team has to defend or destroy a mission objectives on the map to win the match. It is a slightly deeper in regards to tactics and drop preparation, since you can take up to 4 battlemechs in a match, however it is more time consuming and less currency friendly than Quick Play. This is meant to be the main game mode, but is currently in BETA 2, which is a PGI term for not complete. It should receive a  significant updates in the future, but is severely lacking currently.\n\n\nMechwarrior Online is a game that is really unique in this genre. It is the only mech combat simulator on the market, and the feeling of piloting a giant combat machine is really outstanding. This is the thing PGI got right. Unfortunately not many other things are on the same level. Once you make through very basic new player experience, you will have a limited amount of really good experience exploring new maps, battlemechs and different strategies, but once the dust settles, MWO is only a mediocre team deathmatch arena shooter with mechs, played on a seriously flawed maps, lacking the promised combat roles and information warfare. Severely lackluster game modes, combined with slow content release cycle and non-evolving balance due negligence of developers leaves little hope for the future of the game.\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","17.7"," 298 of 528 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","298","528","9","11"

Im a causal player who only plays a 1-2hrs a day tops, maybe more on the weekends/days off from work.\n\nIn total ive only spent 160$ on the game over the last few yrs, 55 for a "a al crate" MadCat, another 55 for the Mauler that came out not to long ago.. and the rest on MC for PremTime, mechbays, Xp-to-Gxp conversions sales and 2 hero mech when they were 50% off.\n\nThe Only thing you NEED to BUY in this game is MechBays and they are pertty cheap.. I have 41 mechbays maybe 10 were paid for.. the others were won from weekend events/CW rankings.\n\nI own 36 mechs, 8 were paid for with real money (Mauler 55$ = 3mechs, Madcat 55$ = 3mech, and 2Hero mechs) the reast are all earned with cbills.

Find a mech or weight class you enjoy and focus on that.\n\nWARNING:\nMWO is not a P2W game, more like pay-2-get-ahead... as in you dont have to play a bunch of games to earn cbills to buy mechs u can just use real money to get them.. buyin mechs for realy $$ will not give you a advantage.\n\nIf you do feel the need to throw money at the game buy a hero mech when they are on sale, they provide a 30% cbill boost to your end match earnings when playing that mech.\n\nBut i would really sugest that you play for atleast a month befor you do, this should give you enought time to play the trial mechs maybe buy 1-2mechs for cbills, and get an idea of what mech/weight class you enjoy the most.\n\nHope this review is help full.. if you have any questions i highly suggest goin to the NewPlayer section of the forums on the MWO website to get real answers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToGJerot/recommended/342200/","ToGJerot","Jerot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ToGJerot/","579 products in account","TLDR: MWO is a solid Mech combat game that suffers from an Apathetic, minimum viable product developers. It doesn't have the depth of many previous Mechwarrior/Battletech titles but can deliver a decent mech simulator experience with up-to-date graphics for those wanting.\n\nIt's hard to find a game as polarizing as MWO. Some love it, some hate it, but both sides have their points.\n\nThe game is far from new, at the time of this review its a little over 2 years old and just hitting steam now. It launched in 2013 to middling reviews, many can agree the core gameplay is solid. But on launch it only had two gamemodes, and in the two years since they claim to have added 3 more. Though one is Skirmish (Deathmatch) which added nothing new gameplay wise, and Invasion/Invasion Counter Attack (Same mode mirrored).\n\nA vast majority of games will come down to destroying the enemy team, and to do so you have a very wide selection of mechs and loadouts. The meta of which has been evolving over the life of the game. As a Legendary Founder who has played on and off since beta I've seen the rise and fall of OP Alpha-strikes, LRMgeddon, Poptarting, etc. Currently the game revolves around mid-short range brawls, generally playing peakaboo at the line of skirmish until one side finds an edge and pushes through to vitctory. Games tend to play out a little one sided.\n\nAt the core of many arguments is the pricing model of MWO. At launch they offered tiered packs with exclusive mech variants to raise support for the game. While many accepted it as a good way to kickstart the games development, few suspected it would carry on as a common occurance. In 26 months there have been 5 more drives for money including Resistance I and II, and Clan invasion 1, 2, and 3. Not counting pre-order exclusivity to new Mechs for cash only. These typically offer a range of mechs from Light all the way up to Assault in increasingly expensive packs. A common criticism is the option to buy mechs 'a la carte' being much more expensive without offering many of the benefits of the pack. Making heavier mechs arbitrarily cost more as you will either have to pay the fee or suck it up and buy the rest of the lighter mechs bundled together.\n\nAnother criticism is the exclusive variants of mechs marketed as "heroes" for cash only. While they are generally considered on par if not worse than ones available for in-game currency. Many find it distastful to lock potentially gameplay and balance effecting loadouts behind a paywall. In recent months they've began running tournaments which make it possible to earn their premium currency and time without spending money. But you'll be grinding for a long time to catch up on all the mechs they've released since.\n\nMWO is not a pay to win game, but its definitely pay to skip the grind. It can be unfriendly to new players with a steep learning curve (Tutorial has helped somewhat), uncooperative community, and combination of unfriendly game mechanics. To master a mech you will need to own three variants of it, which means you will need to do your research if you don't want to waste your initial cadet bonus C-bills on a mech that you'll abandon down the road. It will also take a fair amount of games in each chassis to reach your maximum potential. Even just maxing out your favorite mech of each weight class will be a large undertaking without shelling out money for a mech with Cbill or Exp boosts and premium time. While not mandatory, it is a competitive PvP game and you're going to want every advantage you can get.\n\nThe developers objectively haven't handled the game very well, they are typically slow to react to the players or occasional controversy such as the backlash surrounding the infamous $500 golden mechs. Their actions, or in-action has lead to the current climate in the community where it seems to be a 50/50 split between die-hard supporters of the franchise who love the game for what it is, and those that are upset with the direction the game has taken and that it doesn't stay true to previous incarnations of the series. At least within the vocal minority, many have silently left or continued to enjoy the game. Which if you intend on playing is my recommended course of action, avoid the forums/subreddits/discussions unless you want to see the toxicity first hand.","December 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 102 of 175 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","102","175","5","1"

(they are not worth it other then the 30% c-bill boost) Most all the free mechs are better than Heros.\n\nSo play the game, have fun... and don't spend real money on anything.

I tried it then, but it failed to catch my interest. I think this was mostly due to the lack of classic mechs from those earlier games, mechs like the: Marauder, Archer, Crusader, Phoenix Hawk, Locust, Wasp, Stinger, Rifleman, and WarHammer.\n\nHere we are a few years later and I decide to give it another chance when I see it become available on Steam. The game play is fun and the graphics are really good. There are strategic and tactical elements to the game. There are advancements for both the pilot and the mechs. Between the large variety of chassis and the numerous variations of each chassis, plus the ability to customize your builds and looks, there are a huge number of options available.\n\nThe one major thing that this game has done to capture my interest this time around is to include classic mechs from the early days of BattleTech. The Locust and Marauder are already in the game. The WarHammer, Rifleman and Archer are all on the release schedule with confirmed delivery dates. I still hope to see other classics like the Phoenix Hawk, Crusader, Wasp and Stinger eventually, but at least they now have some of the most important classic mechs available in the game.\n\nThere is a lot to grind in this game, but that is a good thing. It means you will have plenty of work to keep you motivated for the long haul. You have the option to grind any mech you want in whatever order you want. Nothing is time-gated or level-gated. If you want to pilot an Assault mech from the start you have that option without having to work your way through Light, Medium and Heavy mechs first. The boosters and bonuses you receive during your first 25 missions are more than enough to help any new player get into whatever mech they are interested in. The company also seems to do a lot of promotions offering free in-game currency and gear. I come from War Thunder, where it took me over a year of playing to unlock top tier aircraft and max out aircrews in just one of five countries. The grind in this game seems like nothing compared to that. At least with MWO you have access to everything right from the beginning.\n\nMWO is a free to play game, but like with other such games, they do need a source of revenue. They earn this by selling early access to new content, cosmetic options, subscription time, etc. None of that is mandatory. The early access to new content is for things like new mechs, which everybody gets access to eventually anyways. The cosmetic options are nice to have, but are completely optional, and they let you earn some options during events. The subscription options are actually very beneficial if you are at all bothered by "The Grind", and give you a +50% bonus to XP and C-Bills. If you don't mind grinding content like me then you can just enjoy the journey and feel good when you complete your goals on your own merit.\n\nIn addition to your normal quick-play modes of Capture, Assault and Skirmish on numerous unique maps, there is a more advanced mode called Community Warfare. This is the mode for experienced players that have built up a collection of fully loaded mechs, understand tactics and strategy, and work together in teams. This mode is about capturing and defending planets while fulfilling contracts for the Houses of the Inner Sphere or the invading Clans. The stakes are much greater, but so too are the rewards. It will be quite a while before I am capable of participating in Community Warfare, but this seems like a excellent mode for extending a player's interest in the game. I look forward to getting involved in this mode.\n\nI am very happy with the progress I have seen in this game since I first tried it a few years ago. It is much improved, and definitely worth playing for anybody interested in mech combat or fans of BattleTech.","December 22, 2015","true","778.7"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","41","65","3","0"

Will you like it? Well it really depends on what you expect from a FPS.\nIn here, you will not run like a headless chicken (except if you drive Locusts), you will not instantly kill your opponent with a lucky (or skilled) headshot, you will not respawn, you will not magically heal the damages you took during the fight.\nYou will take care of your team mates, you will run for cover under heavy missiles fire, you will sacrifice part of your Mech just to shield your engine while charging, and you will unleash the power of 20 tons of weapons (or more) against giant walking tanks.\n\n\nPros:\n- Mech building: before you fight, you have to build your Mech. You choose its weapons, its engine, how much armor it has for each part, how much ammunitions, electronics... The Mechlab is a place where you are gonna spend a lot of time, as it determines a  lot of what you will be able to do in a game, but you'll spend Good time on it.\n- Simulation feelings: you are in a huge machine of death, but not a fast Japanese Meka. You're heavy, slow, and the controls feel that way. You have to plan your movements because you can't turn back in the blink of an eye if enemies show up. Then again, you are just driving some kind of a giant tank with arms and legs, so it's not that hard to master.\n- Unique combat style: in MWO, you can shoot with lots of weapons, on the same Mech, all at once... The only thing restraining you from non stop fire is the heat your weapons generate when fired. You have to manage this heat so you don't shutdown from overheating (which means standing still while your Mech cools off - a bad thing). You also have one life per drop, and no healing. Your Mech will lose some parts during a game, and learning how to spread damages as the fight goes on is a key component of being good at MWO.\n- Beautifull visuals: the Mechs are amazing, all of them. Of course, you will love some and hate some, but the redesign are all incredible. Why "re"design? Because next point:\n- A 30 years old universe: yup it's an old license, with lots of famous heros, feared mercenary organisations, long stories for every factions and clans.\n- Continuous development: there is a full team of developers on this game and you can see it. 2 updates per month since  3 years is pretty awesome, as the game is still evolving and switching towards a great balance (which has its Cons).\n- Giant robots!: we all love them, you know it, and there's currently undreds of mechs to choose from.\n- Trully Free-to-Play: All the game is available for free. You can't buy with real money better gear or Mechs. There are Hero Mechs you can't buy with the in-game curency, but they are far from being even "top" (some even far from being good - but that's another story).\n\nCons:\n- Very steep learning curve: This game is hard. It really is. Movement, damage, heat, weapon firing, Mech building, all need a lot of time to be mastered, and you have to re-learn some of those each time you buy a new chassis.\n- It's not CoD: as said before, this is a slow paced game where you need to think. You need patience, teamwork and strategy to avoid getting wrecked.\n- Balance??: MWO comes from a 30y old franchise, ok, but that license has its flaws. Rules from the TableTop games were broken because they were not meant for a real-time FPS, and the MWO team does his best to rebalance everything while not going to much away from the original material, but there is still room for improvements (still, there aren't real "cheezy" Mechs or weapons, just some that are a bit better and some that are useless).\n\nIn the end, the game is really enjoyable if you want a tough game that has nothing to do with any other game on the market so far. The feelings from moving from a cover to another under enemy fire while twisting your torso to spread damage all over your Mech, running and harassing while in a Light Mech- knowing you will die if you get hit-, or being a tower of destruction in an Assault Mech... In MWO, you feel like fighting, and the fight is a 12vs12 brawl. With missiles. And giant lasers.\n\nYou don't need money so give it a try. Maybe you'll stay (I know i did, since 2012).","December 30, 2015","true","164.0"," 43 of 69 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","43","69","3","0"

This game could have been so much more than it is and to make matters worse, the devs have largely lost the trust of the community.  So much so that very very few people were willing to fund their followup game(known as transverse).\n\nBut lets get to the positives:\n\n-The art design of the mechs is pretty nice.  Alex Iglesias nails the concept art.\n-Its the only mechwarrior you're going to get that isn't ancient in game industry terms.\n-Lots of mechs and variants to choose from and even more to customize.\n-Good controls for the most part despite the defaults being goofy.  Check the options menu.\n-Community Warfare features are starting to turn into a fairly appealing mode.\n-The clan equipment sound design is top notch.  I wish the IS stuff sounded as nice.\n\n\nAnd then the negatives:\n-The weapon balance is awful and so many little jury rigged fixes have been placed on the system to "fix" the problem.  PGI's gameplay design team is horrid at math and has been since beta.\n-The game is growing more and more poorly optimized and it stutters on systems that used to run it silky smooth with nothing to show for it.  NVidia cards can have serious problems despite the made for nvidia intro vid advert.\n-The player base has largely been chased off by false promises and bad ideas so there aren't a lot of people playing the community warfare.\n-The game is buggy enough to be frustrating.\n-The community mildly toxic but not the worst.\n-Clan tech is implemented as though its 1:1 with IS tech and you'll be matched against it as such.\n-All these assets and no mechwarrior single player campaign...\n-The mechs are horridly out of proportion.  This makes the speed of the mechs feel extra sluggish since you're closer to 20 meters up rather than 12.  Additionally, some mechs are punished a lot more by their size.  The Centurion, for example, is heavy/assault sized despite being half the weight of the Atlas.  Mechs should be in the 8-12 meter range not 6-20 meters.  That range is insane.\n\nHopefully you enjoy the game.  I grow quickly frustrated with the choices the design team makes.  Give the game a shot though, it is free to start playing after all.","May 21","false","111.1"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","30","46","0","1"

Resulting in players being cored within seconds of a match. This resulted in lasers and PPC's being suboptimal as they were never buffed after the devs limited how many could be viably equipped relegating them to supplementary weapons because of high heat output, delay between shots on standard lasers or reduced range on pulse lasers.\n\nit doesn't change that the game itself isn't for casual Battletech fans. Especially with mech pack pre-orders in the hundreds of dollars that are withheld as timed exclusives until an arbitrary date after they are released. 'Whales' are willing to pay which is why the pricing structure hasn't changed since the beta.\n\nVirtually everything in the game besides non-hero mechs carry a premium real money price in the form of MC(MechCredits), including literally paint, none of which can be unlocked over time via the in-game currency you accumulate through normal play(c-bills).\n\nOne of the biggest problems is the mechbay gating system. Each mech you own artbitrarily requires an available corresponding mechbay. If you have 10 mechbays and 10 mechs, you cannot unlock an additional mech until you either sell at a loss that you've already spent time leveling up, or you purchase an additional mechbay which can also only be purchased with MC. Effectively, you will always be spending money on the game. It fails as an F2P title because you cannot unlock using time as a currency by simply grinding out enough in-game currency through nomral play.\n\nTL:DR\n\nBottomline, I love Mechwarrior, I've been a fan since the 90's. Even in MWO I love tweaking the mechs, the combat is fun even with the flaws and I like being able setup various weapon groups to control which weapons fire independently of others. It's been proposed in the past that they offer a VIP system where once you've spent a combined minimum total on the game, you would unlock VIP status that would remove the Mechbay system and give you a permanent XP/C-bill bonus and maybe even a permanent 10-15% discount on premium items that would stack with sales promotions, if not also unlock the all the paints. I would gladly spend another $50 or $60 on the game if it granted those benefits. Sadly, however, I cannot recommend the game in its current incarnation. Hopefully we will eventually get a proper Mechwarrior 5.","December 15, 2015","false","8.5"," 56 of 94 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","56","94","0","0"

The large heavy mechs lumber around appropriately.\nMech customisation options are good, and are notable for being true to canon in most cases (MechWarrior is based off the BattleTech board game).\nAfter some false starts, the mech customisation UI is now actually good.\nThe SFX design on the moon base map is great.\nSteep learning curve (this is a good thing).\nCommunity is helpful and friendly.\nCons:\nFaction play mode is very shallow, and badly designed. It is also still unfinished despite having been advertised on numerous occasions, for several years running, as being "90 days away". This genuinely feels like it is borderline fraudulent behaviour, whatever the underlying reasons may have been.\nDespite protestations otherwise, there is clearly a pay-to-win element, and the pricing model is somewhat predatory. One example of pay-to-win influences has been the steadily increasing number of weapon hardpoints for paid "early access" mechs. Overpowered mechs usually get nerfed to a reasonable level only after becoming available for in-game currency.\nThe in-game currency takes a fair amount of work to grind for the average player, even after recent reductions to the amount of grind required.\nMany older maps don't work well with 12 vs 12 teams, and unfortunately the updated larger maps are very amateur.\nAside from being helpful and friendly, the community can also be quite toxic, particularly towards anyone criticising the game (most criticism is perceived to be "unreasonable").\nIn-game, you often get teamed with very stupid teams as well, which is deeply frustrating once you really get into the game.\nNot enough different game modes.\nVerdict:\nThe core game is solid and fairly unique. Driving big mechs around is pretty good. However, the casual skill-level player can expect to have to deal with similar skill-level players driving pay-to-win mechs, and the pricing is predatory. If you really get into it, expect to slap your forehead when trying to figure out some of the developers' "improvements" as they go about upgrading the game. You will also be guaranteed to progress from bewilderment at players raging against their own team on team chat, to being a bitter vet yourself raging at your team of degenerates and miscreants.","December 11, 2015","false","728.0"," 155 of 276 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","155","276","5","3"

I have played previous titles.  I don't normally play Shooters.

They recently reworked 3 that come with some destructible terrain, dropship, and time of day changes)\nMECHLAB: 7/10 (Building a mech itself is as deep as any previous title, but no tutorial and overly complicated at first)\nCOMMUNITY: 7/10 (Most are friendly, some very sour apples...forums at http://mwomercs.com/forums/\nREPLAY VALUE: 8/10 (Enough maps, mechs, weapons, and game modes to replay, but can get repetitive.  At that point might be a good time to switch over to Faction Play)\nPRICE: 9/10.  It is totally F2P. Biggest complaint I've heard is that there are mechs P2W.  Not true.  Can buy any mech except Hero mechs with in-game currency.  Only about 10% of the mechs are Hero and do have different hardpoints, but they are rarely seen on the battlefield because they are not any better than others in the associated chassis.  They do receive a 30% Cbill boost which is why pilots buy them - to earn cash and not to dominate the battlefield.  If you are going to buy a mech I would suggest looking at the in-game store first.  A $14.95 MC package can get you 2 Medium mechs (Cicadas), or it could get you 4 Light mechs (2 Commandos, 2 Locusts).  Obviously Heavies and Assaults are more expensive.\n\nTLDR:  8.5/10.

Got bored after a week and gave it up.\nI've came back 4 months ago, following friends' interest in the game, and this time instead of joining random battles and getting tired of the game, I've read some guides, push-farmed my first Community Warfare drop-deck (4 mechs), joined a big and active unit, and still having a blast so far; making new friends, having fun, actually enjoying the game.\n\nSo, is the game good / interesting / worth a try? Yes.\nIs it a " Battletech lore masterpiece"? Not even close.\nIt's a MMO, based off Battletech universe, with everything that comes with those two things.\n\nThere is a very strong and active community of players, but also a very steep learning curve, with "veteran players" not pulling any punches. And to boot it up - a lot of the active players also very critical of the game, despite playing it. And there are a LOT of bitterness from former players as well.\nSo, both a pro and a con.\n\nDevelopers did introduce various mechanics to ease it up for new players, by making separate match-making ques for solo-players and for groups, and also according to their "mastery rank", which adjusts accordingly with one's experience and how well they play as well.\nThe game is constantly updated, with various changes, not too fast to become a blur of constant instability, but fast enough not to get too stagnated and boring... in theory.\nNew content, and especially events - every week or two.\n\nOn the other hand - most of the new content just cosmetics: new mechs, sometimes redone maps etc. Mechs just recently got re-balanced, and not for the first time, but a lot of people feel, that changes could be far more substantial.\nThe map for the Community Warfare (territorial wars) was reset recently, opening new possibilities etc - but no actual changes to mechanics of the wars there. Which make quite a lot of people sad...\n\nWould I recommend people to try it? Yes... but:\nAfter trying it out, finishing the tutorial and getting some games in various trial-mechs behind your belt and pocketing all the newbie-freebies - read manuals, get some non-trial mechs (remember, that your own mechs you can refit - and for Inner Sphere, green by default, you can change the engines and what kind of armor and structure to use, and for Clan, gray by default, you can change arms/shoulders/legs, to get different weapon-slots and bonuses), learn to play in those, and then look for a unit. The game is fun when you're with a unit, and not fun at all when solo.\nThen the learning curve won't be as brutal. And then you'd be able to judge the game for what it is and if you personally enjoy the game, and not feel frustrated at the starting learning curve and judge the curve instead of the game.\n\nUnlike some other "match-games where one team of armored vehicles fight another team", where they lure you in with easy and fast progression at "low-tiers", and then stomp some huge grind on top of ya on later "tiers", MWO doesn't have vehicle tiers or levels. Mechs differ in classes, but anyone can get any mech they wish at any point. The prices don't change either (it'll cost exactly the same for a newbie as for a veteran). So, they bite when you just start playing, and they are easy when you've been playing for a while.\n\nNew players get it rather hard, because despite the huge tutorial and first-games pays off - it's barely enough to get you some mechs, depending on what you went for and without reading guides - one can easily spoil everything for oneself.\n\nOn the other hand, once you did that first proper drop-deck to go join Community Warfare (I'd recommend mix of mediums and heavies to begin with - lights, despite being extremely fun, require fast reaction and some knowledge of tactics and maps to be good, and assaults... are very situational, despite being brutal in right hands), and manage to find yourself in a team, that accepts new players but also do organized drops that win games - getting new mechs isn't hard. After a while (after 5 weeks of playing in my case) an evening or two worth of playing would get you a heavy mech. That's when getting mech-bays (slots) will become more important, than getting money to buy those mechs =]\n\nP.S. yes, you can play it for free, without paying. Resisting the urge to "boost it up just a bit" may be hard, if you can pay, but if you cannot or just have a strong will combined with patience - it's very playable without any cash put into the game. Especially since often enough various "extras", including premium time, are parts of prizes for various challenges in events, that happen every week or two.","December 11, 2015","true","0.1"," 163 of 299 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","163","299","9","0"

It is difficult the please everybody and they have made quite a few bad balancing decisions in the past, but it seems like they are starting to get more in line with what needs to be done.\n\nSome of the new maps have been focusing more on being pretty and large instead of functional and balanced. The fact that they redid the maps in the first place was a step in the right direction, but I feel like at the time they could have gathered more info from the community as to what needed to be done to make the maps better. They listened to the part where people wanted destructable trees and stuff, but then took it a step further and put so much of it in that it obscures vision. Also the fog needs to GO. Poor visibility does not make things enjoyable. We'll see if the next map the do fixes some of those issues.\n\nThe 3rd party competitive scene is solid, and is only getting better as the community grows.

The weapon effects are nice and some of the artwork is very good.    The game has very good sound design and effects.\n\nNow, for the bad: everything else.\n\nIt is an arena shooter with long queue times, lousy matchmaking, bad netcode, a terrible community, and terrible balance decisions.  It is extremely grindy, the cash shop packs are insanely overpriced, and development on the game has been virtually non-existent for three years now.   Oh, and the game is extremely buggy.  And I can provide examples.\n\nLet's begin with the queue times.  My average wait to get a solo match in the 'public' arena game queue is usually about three minutes.  My average wait to get a group game (groups have an entirely different queue) in my last play session was over five minutes per match.  The average wait to get a community warfare match during peak hours is typically about fifteen minutes.  Sometimes, after waiting for fifteen minutes, you don't even get a real match, but instead you're forced to grind out turrets for minimal reward.\n\nLet's continue with the matchmaking system, which recently ditched ELO in favor of a 'skill tier' system that is actually just a grind.  If you win a match, your skill rating will improve.  If you lose a match, but displayed more activity than a moldy potato, your skill rating will improve.  The game literally rates player skill based on the number of matches someone has played.\n\nThe netcode is bad.  You can play the game and see for yourself, if you don't believe me.  However, suffice it to say that it is entirely normal in this game for shots to simply fail to register on the target at all, or for other weird things to happen, such as taking fire from the front and noticing that the damage registered on your back.\n\n---\n\nThe game is badly balanced, because the designers of the game do not understand their own game.  With every other game update, certain mechs and/or weapon systems will go from being completely worthless to utterly overpowered, and there is absolutely no rhyme or reason to how, when, or why this will happen.  Actually, I take that back; I do know why balance changes happen.  When the lead game designer actually deigns to wade in and play his own game, he is typically embarrassed on account of being awful and not understanding what's going on.  But rest assured, that he will nerf the hell out of whatever killed him, because clearly that must be overpowered.  For instance, look up "Goons Heart Paul" on Youtube and then consider that the mech knockdown mechanic was COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE GAME FOREVER in the patch immediately after that video was recorded.\n\nOh, and there are also two different levels of technology in the game.  Inner Sphere (IS) technology, and the more advanced Clan technology.  Clan mechs are faster, more durable, and hit harder.  They participate in the same matches as IS mechs, and there is no penalty on the player for bringing a Clan mech into battle.  You may have noticed that the Clan mech packages are more expensive than the IS mech packages.  Surprise, that's because they're better!\n\n---\n\nWhen I say the game is grindy, I mean that the game is grindy.  You get a huge cash bonus in your first 25 matches, enough that after playing 25 games, you will be able to afford a mid-sized Inner Sphere battlemech.   Then you have to buy equipment for it.  Double Heat Sinks: 1.5 million c-bills, MANDATORY on all IS mechs.  Endo-Steel structure, MANDATORY, will run you maybe another million c-bills.  That's not counting the weapons and engine you're going to have to buy when you customize your mech, assuming you actually want to run a good build on it so that you can be competitive and kill people.\n\nNote that you have to buy three variants of each chassis (full price!) to "elite" a mech, which is ultimately necessary to be on even footing with veteran players.\n\n---\n\nDevelopment on this game has been dead pretty much since release.  I don't think I need to go into fiascoes such as Transverse (when the developers decided to abandon development of MWO in order to try to kickstart a Star Citizen ripoff) or the $500.00 gold mechs (Google it), but ultimately the development of this game has been nothing but one mech pack grab deal after another, with pretty much no development at all of new gameplay features or content.\n\nThe game is buggy.  The HUD is frequently glitched or displays incorrect information (generator displays were broken for MONTHS in Community Warfare matches), but is also poorly optimized and tanks the game's framerate.  Crash to desktop remains a persistent issue.\n\nI wish I could add more, but the character limit on Steam reviews prevents me from doing so.","December 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 259 of 479 people (54%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","54","259","479","15","13"

If you don't believe me and you're one of the 2 other people who use the Raptr gaming client, go look me up there.\n\nMechwarrior Online is a shooter that brings a lot of unique things to the table, and while I could tote the customizibility and unique feel of each chassis that makes owning over 60 mechs feel insufficient, I'd rather just explain the main reason I love this game so much. Not only is this a "thinking man's shooter", rewarding tactical thought and teamplay to a far greater degree than most others, Mechwarrior Online also has an immense skill-cap. Pilot skill has more to do with the effectiveness of any given build than any other factor. The game is well balanced in the sense that everybody has access to the same tools to make their mech perfectly suit them, and once you find those builds that just feel right, you can take on a 100 ton direwolf in a 35 ton panther with nothing but 4 lasers and come out with a solo kill as long as you know what you're doing. But this game doesn't only reward individual skill: far more valueable is your ability to position and work with your team. That's what makes the release of this game to the broad audience of steam so exciting. Players who are used to voice chatting with random strangers (hint: the current community does not utilize the built-in VOIP at all) and who can breathe some life into this stale yet unusally friendly and passionate community. The learning curve is steep, but at its peak lies a game that you can sink just as many hours into as TF2 and CS:GO only with a kind of gameplay you won't find anywhere else. And ignore those people who complain about "paywalls"; the developers frequently hold challenges where everybody can earn rewards such as the paid currency (in good amounts, too), mechs, mechbays, and colors, as well as a ton of in-game currency. My only advice to new players is: stay behind cover and check your mechs for ghost heat (when you fire too many of the same weapon at once they generate exponential heat). While this game is definitley not for everyone, it's definitley something worth trying to see if it's for you.","December 13, 2015","true","13.8"," 63 of 112 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","63","112","3","0"

Every variant can be customised with a lot of weapons and equipments. You don't need to take "meta" builds and you don't have something like "the OP super cool" 'Mech. More importantly than the meta is, that you find a 'Mech and a fitting, which suits your very own playstile.\nAlthough, of course, some people would disagree: I would say the game is balanced good and you can have a lot of fun with every 'Mech.\n\nThere is absolutly NO need to pay money, if you don't want to.\nYou won't get an advantage ingame, for paying real money. But there are some variants, which can only be achieved via real money (or premium currency won by events). But these 'Mechs (called "Hero" and "Champion" 'Mechs) aren't better than their ingame-currency-variants. They "only" give you the ability to gain more income or more XP from battles (30%).\nReal money can only be used to lessen the "grind", but if you play regularily, you won't need to spend money, you can get enough income over time to afford your own hangar full of 'Mechs :)\n\nThe game is developed further, every two weeks there is an update on tuesday, which provides new content, or updated game aspects.\n\nYou should try MW:O and make a decision for yourself :)\nA happy MechWarrior.","December 18, 2015","true","426.1"," 30 of 51 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","30","51","0","0"

But be warned: the game is very grindy and difficult. Matches will seem unfair to someone new. This game is slow paced, which is different from other shooters.\n\nThis game is also very niche. Even if the game was perfect, most will not like it because it's only fun for certain people.\n\nThe main issue this game faces is the grindy nature of the game. You will spend a lot of time playing to get the end game stuff, which is acceptable. However, you have to specialize in a mech (buying three varients of the same mech) in order to get high-level "masteries." If you make the wrong choice, you could find that you just wasted millions of C-Bills (in-game currency) trying to play.\n\nReal-money prices are also high. So expect to drop serious coin if you want a small advantage. Like with everything in this game, you have to educate yourself before you buy. You might not like that sweet mech you just spent 10 dollars for. Personally, I don't mind throwing a little money here and there to stack up my real-money currency, because it adds up fast. To cut on the grind, you can throw some money for an XP and C-bill boost, which is nice and adds 50% to all earnings. Certain mechs that cost real money also carry a XP or C-BIll bonus when using them. You could be earning upwards to 70% extra money and XP due to these mechs.\n\nOverall, try this game out.

I really loved MW2 experience and seeing the mech lab for the first time and customizing my mechs really brought those feelings back. Then dropping into a match and unleashing destruction upon the enemy is extremely satisfying and cathartic. Good play is often rewarded and you can really see your tactics help. There are rolls from both sides, but there are the games that both teams had something great going for them and it gets down to one or two mechs left dueling it out. Those are such great moments that really keep your on the edge of your seat, especially while spectating after having dropped earlier in the match.\n\nThe faction play is fun, but still has room to grow. There will be a 3rd phase update soon that will hopefully add a lot to the game mode. The faction play is a bit difficult and higher skill level than the normal solo queue or group queue. I highly recommend new players tough it out in those queues before attempting the face-rolling potential of faction warfare.\n\nThis game definitely has my support and I'll still be playing it for years in the future, I think.

I have been playing this game since Beta 2012, so I assure you I have many, many hours logged on this game. More hours logged then all other games I own combined for that matter!\n\nReview:\n\nThis is an excellent game with great potential and a bright future ahead! I recommend this game for anyone looking for more tactical gameplay in their FPS gaming.\n\nLast year, the devs introduced Community Warfar, a gamemode targeted at hardcore players with an entire star map and several factions to fight for. If you decide to give this game a shot, I recommend shying away from this gamemode for the first while until you get a grasp of the main concepts of combat roles and loadouts, and decide this is a game you want to continue with. If you make it to ComWar, you will enjoy increased rewards, frequent events, and the final end-all Battle for Tukayyid Tournament to end each season of ComWar. ComWar is currently in Beta II, with Beta III just around the corner. In Beta III, players will be able to choose from several unique Career paths, vote on planets to attack, pool C-bills for tactical bonuses & ordinance (TACTICAL NUKE CONFIRMED), and perform either full out planetary Assault or planetary Scouting missions to collect intel for additional bonuses.\n\nThe devs are continuously pumping out new content in the form of Battlemechs, Camo, (coming soon) Decals and Maps. They are also dedicated to perfecting player balance as much as possible, so one can expect one or two updates to gameplay mechanics every month, on top of new content updates.\n\nMechWarrior Online got off to a rough start in 2012. Whether you talk to the haters or the lovers, everyone can admit this fact. This was largely due to the now defunct company Infinite Games Publishing (IGP) and its control over the project. The good news is that since its departure, progress on this game has been swift and positive. The game's 'mech concepts are lauded as one of its strongest points, with much of the beautiful 'mech designs now slated for use in the upcoming turn-strategy game Battletech (if you don't know about this game, also worth a look! www.battletechgame.com).\n\nThe game's UI has been improved frequently, but new players will still have some difficulty navigating some tabs. Notably, new players may struggle with customizing loadouts. My best recommendation for this is to visit the game's forums (mwomercs.com/forums/) and get advice from the playerbase, most of whom are very helpful.\n\nThe game's Tutorial zone has been revamped recently! All new players should visit this zone first, because this is not a game that you can simply skip the tutorial unless you are a returning player (the tutorial even has in-game rewards for completing challenges). As a veteran player, I still use this zone to practice with new 'mechs.\n\nSome may get turned off buy the game's MC currency (money purchasable currency) that allows players to skip a lot of the grind and get the good stuff. While this game may seem Pay-To-Win, this is certainly not the case, as virtually all chassis, weapons, equipment and upgrades are purchasable with C-bills (gameplay generated/earned currency). The only things unobtainable without MC are vanity items & a select group of 'Hero' mechs that come with unique camo patterns and weapon hardpoints (which are arguably no better or worse in performance when compared to their standard counterpart). Also purchaseable with MC-only are designated 'Champion' 'mechs, but do not be fooled! These mechs are simply optimized versions of standard C-bill purchasable mechs, they do not differ at all in performance potential!\n\nIn summary, this is a great tactical shooter with very unique gameplay concepts. As such, the learning curve can be rather steep for some, and there are still a few rough spots that require development. The future of this game is bright, however, with constant updates and some really exciting new content lined up for spring. In the words of the game's devs, they are "far from finished" with this game!","December 14, 2015","true","11.3"," 41 of 72 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","41","72","0","0"

None of the load outs will look anything like the Canon mech's which is pretty sad, if you are a real hard core fan of the old lore. Very few close to Canon builds  work in comparrison to what you can  built with the custom system, its sad to see Warhammers, and Marauders, handing in their AC5's SRM's and of couse PPC's, for laser and more lasers.  or warhammers with twin AC20's where the Machine guns went.\n\nThis is I'm afraid from my point of view the big negative, even ignoring the lore and the canon builds, the game has lots of weapon systems but  various  hit detection issues and the use of HSR has made many weapons nonviable and turned the game into a lasers with everything meta, because they are hitscan and can have the beam corrected, as opposed to point of impact damage which can be ducked more easily,  and at times miss because  hit dection is out, so a PPC is a rare sight on Mechwarrior online, and that says a lot, because if there was an Iconic weapon in  the lore it  is the Partical Projection Canon, but sadly  the Laser Aces it in every way.","February 13","true","5.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","1"

Now i know what you're thinking "OMG P2W BLEEEEEEH" i promise you it's nothing like the "World Of" games. The mechs you can access with only premium money are no more or less powerful than any other mech in the game. The only diffrence is a 30% boost to your chasis EXP and C-bills gained from gameplay, and of course a unique paintjob. You CAN buy only a limited amount of mechs before you start needing to buy mechbays, but even these go on sale and are usually only about $2.50 a pop usually. But once again, this game is free.\n\n#2 This game is easy to learn and hard to master. When you boot up the game you get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of information thrown at you unless you play the tutorial, which is about 15 minutes long and explains everything you need to know about the basics of gameplay. BUT there are many high-level tactics such as twisting and jump-jet fluttering you'll need to learn about before you get to tier 1 or 2 play.\n\n#3 This isn't call of duty! This game is a bit slower paced and about tactics and position. Teamwork will make or break you almost 100% of the time, don't expect to get many kills early on, it takes about 25 games before you start getting one or two kills.\n\n#4 Trail mechs. My god do i love the devs for this. Every week or so the free mechs switch, and you never have to buy them, thinking about buying a timberwolf but you're not sure you want to spend 15,000,000 c-bills? play the trail version a few times and see if the mech suits your playstyle.\n\n#5 This game is beutiful, the sound effects, maps, visuals, and mech designs are stunning and you really feel as if you're piloting a 30+ ton war machine. Plus the faction warfare map is awsome to zoom in on and look at all the diffrent planets. The battletech universe is incredibly lore-heavy and the game reflects that.\n\nalltogether i give this game 9/10. the gameplay is amazing, as are the sound effects, but without a group of friends you won't have a whole lot of fun with the grinding.\n\nnow a few tips for new players:\n\nyour first 25 games you will get a "account injection: cadet bonus" this will give you a bunch of c-bills, you'' feel rich and want to buy a mech but take it from me: wait until you know what you're getting into! Outfittting a chassis takes A LOT of in-game cash and can eat your money up if you spend recklessly.\n\nfind yourself a mic and a player who knows a thing or two about this game, listen to what they have to say and you'll start crushing in public games!\n\nDont feel discouraged if you die without getting kills, damage is where new players need to focus, support your team and stay with the group. You can't take on 2 or 3 enemies by yourself!","May 16","true","130.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

I've played MWO since closed beta, stopped playing some time ago. On the PLUS side I have to admit the game looks nice and is mostly fun to play.\n\nOn the other hand the game and its developers have also disappointed severely, never really delivering on the promises. Development is slow and new release sometimes introduced more bugs than it solved. Wild changes in mechanics or effectivenes of individual weapons happened every few months, rendering previously successfull mechs useless. It felt that devs never really listened to the community. The contents (mech packs, camo paints) are incredibly expensive. Progression is non-existent, there is not much to aspire to. It is just a brutal grind to earn XP for one mech, then for another variant of the same chassis, and for the next one......... or grind to earn credits to buy the next chassis.\n\nAnd let's not forget MWLL - the free Mechwarrior-like game that was at least as good as MWO and had to be killed to make room for MWO.","December 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 195 of 364 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","195","364","5","3"

Feels like a slowed down version of Armored core with a harder lock on system.\n\nThat said, this game feels more achin to chess then to Armored Core. You will die from the pawns as a queen, knight, rook whatever, if you are in the wrong spot. Through trial and error or success you'll learn where risky places are and where safe ones are and how to pander to bad situations or simply to know when you've been outclassed. You WILL be outclassed, some people are simply better. Good news is, its not about how quickly you can sight cross hairs on someones head from 100 meters (although you if you get good at that in this game you will wreck) its about awareness and team cohesion.\n\nThe mechs DO look amazing, all the hype about the models is real. They look amazing.\n\nTHe maps are.... interesting. They range from super long range, to super short range, but there is no way to say whether as a short range mech, you get the map you want. I feel that not all the maps have somewhere where every play style shines. I look to TF2 for map design, and feel they did very well. There are tight corners, little nooks, long corridors, hoppable outcrops and cover smattering everywhere; all things, that each seperate class looks for to allow them an advantage. Not quite so in this. Pretty much it plays similarly to real life. Life occasionally hands you lemons and you need to deal with it.\n\nTHe rewards system i would like to see buffed, but as it is, being a heavy brawly mech is the best way to get C-bills *in game currency*\n\nIt is NOT pay to win. Eventually, everything that you can pay for with $$$ you can also pay for with C-bills. *with some exceptions* eg. hero mechs. (which don't break the game, just another variant of existing mechs)\n\nI recommend this game. Its a solid title that will scratch the mech-customization-fps itch some people may have.

MWO is a flawed game on a number of levels, and the development of this game has been troubled.\n\nI mention all of that because it helps to explain why there are such different views of the game.  The game has fans who enjoy it greatly, and yet certain things with PGI in past years have left some people bitter and angry.  That's reflected in the comments, and so you really need to take both sides with a grain of salt. (Ok, a salt mine.)\n\nThat said, for the real "review" part of this.  For all of its flaws, I find the game to be enjoyable, and it's improved greatly in the last 18 months or so.\n\nTo my mind, the fact that I have fun with it is the most important part of the review. It's easy to post lists of flaws and strong points (many of both) and I could certainly add my own list of complaints.  That said, for the flaws, the false starts in development, the game is still fun, and I'm not sure that you can ask any more.","December 15, 2015","true","26.5"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","33","58","0","0"

PGI has made great strides at improving MWO.\n\nNow how is the game itself now? Pretty darn good. The game is easier to get into than say World of Tanks or WarThunder as everyone has access to to pretty much everything from the start. With the playingfield far more level you also do not get oneshotted as easily making MWO far more forgiving to the new player.\n\nWhen trying to learn MWO do the tutorial, do the optional parts of the tutorial not just for the bonus Cbills but also to get a better idea of how mechs handle. Learn how each weapon system handles, look up some guides, and if you are in doubt, suck up the high price tag of clan mechs and get one with your cadet bonus. Trust me it is worth it, use it to learn how heat works, how to torso twist, get yourself a Hunchback, Stormcrow or Timberwolf and go to town.\n\nSeriously go grab a Stormcrow it is one of the most forgiving medium mechs in the game. If you want to get an Inner Sphere mech? Hunchback, any of them, but, best would be the one with the AC/10 which is the Hunchback HBK-4H. The Hunchback and Stormcrow are very, very forgiving and flexible mechs. Also everyone wants to pilot a heavy mech as well, so a medium mech will help with queue times.\n\nAnother advantage of grabbing a clan mech first is that when building your mech you have far less things that you can do wrong, like under-engining your mech and making you an easy target. Get to also know what the various upgrades do for your mechs, get to know how much ammo you use.\n\nReading guides on the meta is a good idea, it will give you an idea of what you will be fighting, it will also give you an idea of the weaknesses of each weapon system is and strengths. You do not, and I stress this, and should not blindly follow the meta, learn why the meta is the way it is so you can tune your mechs to capitalize on how the game works.\n\nMost of all, find what you enjoy to run in your mechs and run it. Also don't forget to find some friends, look up the faction team speak servers and do group queue drops. Trust me, working with friends or just communicating in general will do more for your match score, cbills, and exp gains than any metamech build.\n\nBefore getting into Faction play, otherwise known as Community Warfare you should get a good grasp of how your mechs work and get four of them that add up to 240 tons. Make certain they are all basiced.\n\nMechWarrior's, I look foward to meeting you as friend and foe on the battlefield.","December 14, 2015","true","117.5"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","36","64","4","3"

So there is no mech chassis that is permanently locked behind a paywall.\nPlay the game for yourself and form your own opinion on it.\nGood luck mechwarriors.\n","December 12, 2015","true","60.4"," 72 of 133 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","72","133","4","0"

The gameplay is unique in that you can customize your 'Mechs with a very wide variety of weapons. There are no re-spawns in 2 of the 3 game modes, which forces you to play smart rather than run and gun, like most FPS games. It can be frustrating to die in the first few minutes of a game (solo and group queue matches are a maximum 15 minutes, but usually average about 10 minutes, while Community Warfare matches typically last 20-30 mins).\n\nIf you are an FPS gamer, you will appreciate the higher level of tactical play and it rewards good aim and movement. In fact, the component/hitbox design of the 'Mechs really rewards players who have precision aiming. Headshots (cockpit kills) are extremely difficult, but highly satisfying in this game... more so than any other FPS I have played.\n\nThere are 4 weight classes of'Mechs, ranging from Light through to Assault, and offer you different roles to play within a team and changes your playstyle. Some people specialize in one or 2 roles/weight classes because it suits their playstyle and others are flex players who like variety.\n\nTeam Damage: Yes, it is a real thing and it is annoying as hell to be on the receiving end from trolls (which are few and far between, I might add). Thankfully, you can monitor your team damage at the end of round info screen. Do keep your firing lanes clear and apologize to your teammates if you accidentally shoot them in the back (where there is MUCH less armour and can destroy weapons or even kill them in one full volley of your weapons if placed in one spot). If you are tabbed out of the game and click back in with your mouse, you will fire your weapons, so please alt-tab back into the game instead.\n\nInterface: The out of game user interface in the game has changed a lot over the past couple of years and it still isn't perfect, but it MUCH better than older ones. The lack of customizable UI is understandable, due to the sheer volume of parts that make up the info needed and it still can't all fit on one screen. This is a game that is very complex when played to its fullest potential, yet offers instant action once you become familiar with the ideal builds for each 'Mech. Expect to spend a lot of time initially tinkering with Mechs and unlocking skills and items (modules that enhance your weapons, movement or ability to gather info). The in-game interface is pretty cool and has recently introducted additional info within the cockpit (you can also play in 3rd person view, but it highly affects your aiming for precision shots and people can see you are in 3PV because a drone flies above your Mech... you may get a bit flamed for it, as it can also be a visual cheat due to terrain design).\n\nTeam-Play/Communications: As with any team-based game, you are highly recommended to find a unit and utilize voice comms, but you can play strictly in the solo queue to build your experience, level up your 'Mechs (skill trees take about 30-40 matches to complete for one Mech chassis), or experiment with different weapon loadouts and heat management. Voice comms are available in game, but not used by everyone. You can mute annoying players quite easily. Clans, House Units or Merc Units (aka guilds) are constantly looking for players and have their tag displayed in game next to their name. If you start to see players with a given tag and like your cohesion (and win rate!) with them, I advise you find out their voice comms info and play with them in a group. Just request to join them in chat or add them as a friend and use the in-game messaging feature.\n\nHeat?: Ah yes, heat management... this is a layer of complexity that requires you to really be aware of your heat production caused by weapon use and movement. Learning to squeeze out the most of your Mech takes a lot of time and understanding, but there are some great community resources out there. You eventually can do it by feel, but there are visual and audio cues to help. Overheating causes damage to your internals and you can even blow yourself up by riding in the red too long. In those last ditch attempts to squeeze off a final kill, you can choose to override your auto shutdown when past 100%, but do so wisely! Suiciding due to overheat can still reward the kill to a player shooting at you.\n\nCommunity: there are always toxic players or trolls, but you will find an overall very nurturing community. The game is no doubt a niche game, but has a very, very loyal following with some very big whales who love the BattleTech universe. There is no other multiplayer game on the market quite like this one and it induces a lot of passion within the MWO forums and MWO sub-reddits.\n\neSports: There is a budding attempt to turn MWO into an eSport with a $100K prize pool world tournament starting in Q1 2016. Those in the competitive-minded community hope that enough new players with great skills enter MWO to spawn new teams or revive some old ones that have felt that the competitive scene is stale. Most competitive play is accomplished via community-run leagues (MRBC, RHoD, and a few 8/12/16 team invitationals). The publisher did host one official beta tournament, which brought out a lot of new names to the competitive scene and we hope that will be the case in the near future with the influx of new players from Steam.\n\nPay Model: The game is F2P and used to be very limited in this regard, but has opened up widely since Community Warfare started. Initially you begin with 4 Mech Bays. You had to buy additional ones in the past, but now you can earn them through in-game rewards and special events. There are some Hero and Champion Mechs that are only purchasable with real money (MC), but they are not mandatory to buy. They do offer enhanced XP or C-Bill (in-game currency) bonuses, so it can be a good way to farm cash to buy additional 'Mechs. As with most F2P games, you will end up paying more for this game than a retail box model should you get into it... and there is nothing wrong with that at all! Mech Packs are pricey, but it is more of a pay to early access feature rather than a Pay 2 Play/Win model. There are only a few Hero Mechs that you may want to buy should you wish to get into competitive play. Wait for paid items to go on sale at 50% off to get the best value, which happens often.\n\nMatchmaking: There are 5 skill tiers and that is how the base matchmaker tries to pair up players. Sometimes you will be matched with players a tier higher or lower, but the idea is that both sides are matched as evenly as possible. There are also weight and chassis limits per side, so as to maintain some degree of balance of teams. The past saw some issues with queue times due to lower populations, which has been less of an issue since Steam release. However, the Community Warfare (CW) mode still suffers from a lack of popluation due to lack of real incentives to play that game mode vs time per match. We hope that an increased CW population will reduce the wait times and increases the potential of this game mode. More on CW below.\n\nEnd Game: Community Warfare is the persistent universe game mode and is not based on any matchmaking at all, but a specific weight tolerance of the 4 Mechs you can bring to each match. Yes, this is the only game mode where you have respawns, but you still need to use each Mech wisely, as matches are more prolonged with different phases to the fight. There is a defense and an offense mode to each map and new game modes are going to be introduced to increase playability of CW during off-peak times. Here is where you can unlock in-game rewards and also earn MC, the real money currency that can unlock more Mech Bays (character slots, per say), cosmetic items, or even Champion or Hero Mechs, if you grind it out.","December 14, 2015","true","55.1"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","28","50","0","0"

The balancing was not good the last years since its release as far as i uncovered (there are 2 sides Clan and Inner Sphere which battle each other with different levels of technology), but there was a recent patch in December which seemed to turn everything to the better. I started late December so i cant tell the difference. :)\n\nThe game is not overcrowded in CW and its not adviseable to join those as a random because you will get stomped 9 out of 10 matches by highly organised and trained units, but its easy to get into solo battles and pew pew away.\nIf you want to do more team oriented stuff like CW or the soon to be introduced 4vs4, join a unit.\n\nThere is a skill-matchmaking in place, which has 5 levels.\nYou start with 5, and you can be matched with ppl that are 2 levels up or down.\nThis just grants you to make the first steps in peace, after like 70 hours you come to level 3 and can be matched against the best.\n\nIf you want to play in the long run, you need at least premium time if you want to get new mechs regularly,\nbut unlike WoT you can buy any mech you want immediately and level it.\n\nIts not so easy to get to know the game, since the factions mechs have differences with Omnipod and Quirksystems and the weapons are very different, but if you just use google and read the MWO guide for beginners and the comics, you should be fine to start.\n\nIf you like vehicle combat, just give it a try.","January 13","true","168.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Essentially the game is just an arena combat game using mechs  - there is a Community Warfare mode which seems very unpopular, but really the game is just deathmatch.\n\nHaving played on and off since the original Beta, I can't help but feel that if the developers had put a little more effort into fleshing the game out with a bit more depth and variety it could have been so much more. Essentially the game we have now is little more than the core functionality upon which a game world could have been constructed. Calling it an MMO in its current form is pretty funny really, as there's only the skimpiest of metagames or player interaction.\n\nThis would be fine for a simple FTP game, but as the inheritor of one of Sci-Fi's finest (if cheesiest) franchises, and bearing in mind the frankly incredible amounts of real money demanded for Mechs, it's just not enough. In addition the rich lore and background of the Battletech universe has been largely ignored or contradicted when large parts of it could have been exploited much more cleverly.\n\nIn my view the IP should never have been given to these developers (or indeed their even shadier former publishers) and I'm afraid it seems that they just weren't up to the job of turning out a solid game that's worth the money that so many have already spent on it.","December 10, 2015","false","0.9"," 51 of 95 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","51","95","5","0"

Giant mechs battling eachother with lasers, cannons, and missiles.  Nothing like Hawken or any other mech game out there, it stands in a class of its own as far as I'm concerned.  If you liked the older Mechwarrior games then certainly give this a try.\n\n___\n\nHave been here since the closed beta of this game back in 2012,.  Been playing fairly consistently ever since but I'm not a 7 days a week guy.\n\nAside from Dark Souls games this is my favourite game.  Giant stomping mechs blowing up eachother.  This game is not perfect, but no game is (except Dark Souls :D).  But it is in my opinion an excellent game.\n\nMost important thing would be the game play, it is great.  12 vs 12 teams of giant mechs throwing missiles and lasers at eachother.  Not much else needs to be said.\n\nIt can be tough to learn but once you get the hang of it it is very satisfying.  To help with that they have made it so brand new players won't get matched against the elites, with a tiered system.\n\nNew players get a whack of bonus money in their first bunch of matches, and also some more for completing the tutorial.  And even more through achievements and stuff so you can get started pretty quick.  There are a variety of trial mechs avaialble at first, so here is a tip, play them all, see which ones you like best before you spend your hard earned new player money, cause if you choose one that you end up not liking, the return for selling it is minimal.  Also do the tutorial, and read some of the player made guides out there.\n\nI would say that the community as a whole is very welcoming, in every game you have jerks and trolls but for the most part people are happy to help out or answer questions or let you play with them etc etc.\n\nLots of different mechs to try out and you can customize them all however you want.\n\nPricing can be a little high on the real-$$ items if you want them, but PGI does frequent sales so here's a tip, do like I do and wait for things to go on sale before you buy.  Also if you want MC (the currency bought with real $$) they usually have a sale on that a couple times a year so keep an eye open for it.  Personally I enjoyed this game for almost 2 years before I spent anything, and didn't suffer since all the mechs and stuff are all available for free.  Mostly the $$ stuff is cosmetic, or to boost your earnings (premium time) to lessen the grind, which by the way is not bad anyways.  Also they have events all the time where you can get some stuff (paint jobs, colours, etc, even mechs) just by plaing and earning points over a weekend.\n\nNo pay to win at all.  There are mechs that are only available for MC (purchased for real $$), with special paintjobs, but none of them are really any better than their non-$$ counterparts.  In fact in many cases they are pretty average or even sub-par, haha.  But, you do get some new interesting loadout options on them, and a 30% cbill bonus (cbills are the free currency used to buy mechs and weapons etc).  Champion mechs are also available for MC, but they are not special chassis (IE, you can get the same ones for free), but they just come with a nice build and an XP bonus.\n\nCommunity Warfare, the big galactic conquest game mode can be fun, but right now is pretty stale and in need of a revamp (which I believe is coming).  Also, it is not welcoming for new players.. it is designed for the large units of experienced players, so while you may have some good matches, a lot of the time you will get mercilessly passed around for 30 minutes.\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun if you like the slower pace of giant robots brawling it out.  It has issues for sure but the devs seem to be on a pretty good path now (in the past it was not so much, but since the developers bought out their publisher things have improved greatly.)\n\nHighly recommend at least to give it a shot.  I generally hate free to play games but this is a diamond in the rough I think.","December 13, 2015","true","104.6"," 39 of 72 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","39","72","2","0"

The game has substantially evolved since that time period, from 5 'Mechs and a single map with 8 vs 8 and one game mode (Assault), to 3 Quick Play modes, 2 Faction Play modes, 12 Quick Play maps, 7 Faction Play maps, over 60 'Mech chassis (totalling 300 variants), 12 v 12, and a host of other improvements.\nBut this review isn't about a chronological list of stuff that happened, you wanna know how the game plays, right?\n\nThe new Player Experience is still a little rough. Once you've gone through the MechWarrior Academy (a welcome recent addition), there's no real tutorials on proper teamplay with other players, as well as any information on customizing your own BattleMech. However, the pace that PGI has been going at of late, this stuff may all come soon.\nOnce you've actually learned basic and advanced tactics, it is a proper BattleMech simulator; your 'Mech has a limited pivoting torso, you have loads of weapons on your 'Mech that can make you overheat if you're not careful, and of course, speed is still life. Assault 'Mechs, the biggest of them all, do indeed struggle with much smaller 'Mechs (such as almost all Light 'Mechs, and the Cicada and Ice Ferret), because of the much slower pace of the lumbering giant compared to the relative agility of the gnats surrounding it. This sort of inherent balance, coupled with different scouting mechanics that feel closer to World of Tanks than previous MechWarrior games (a good thing) already makes this feel more balanced and visceral than those earlier MechWarrior games.\nMaps can and do restrict tactics in places, and many  of these maps can also change up the gameplay or make it stale. They're not quite as pretty or realistic as some of today's AAA titles, but I think they're very much sufficient for what they're trying to do, especially for trying to realize BattleTech's universe.\nAll this and I forgot about the pricing model. 'Mechs are EXPENSIVE when paid for with real money. If you want to build a collection, you will have to fork over a little money for MechWarrior Credits [MC] and buy some bays, and if you're not patient enough to accrue C-Bills (keep in mind that your first 25 matches, you get a major bonus to get you your first couple 'Mechs sooner), you can buy 'Mechs with MC, too. Fortunately, PGI runs sales and events rather regularly, so you may be gifted with some scraps of MC or some free 'Mech Bays, and rarely, even a new 'Mech! Keep an eye on their website for more information!\nGive Piranha Games some patience, the greatest has yet to come. They are overhauling Faction Play a bit, and someone's pet project is proper Single Player/Cooperative.\n\nTD;DR: This isn't your father's MechWarrior. It comes with its ups and downs but it is very much worth a play. Just be mindful of your wallet, 'Mechs are not cheap.","December 13, 2015","true","26.4"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

The mech combat is good, possibly some of the best in the series' history. I've played the TT and franchise for over 20 years and can safely say that at its core, MWO is true to the premise of piloting a big battlemech.\n\nThere is an extremely steep learning curve for new players that is not helped by lack of good documentation explaining some of the more important mechanics. The community is really good at filling in the blanks though and most are more than willing to help new players get acclimated.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous and if you are able to play on higher settings the game really shines. Although a bit dated now, you can see that the artwork is top notch.\n\nIt's a very fun game, especially being free and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new game. This isn't your typical shooter though, it tends to move at a much slower pace when it comes to combat and it is heavily team oriented. Those that try to take down the enemy team solo ala CoD will find nothing but frustrating losses.\n\nThat's not to say it is without issues. The gameplay itself is repetitive and most modes equate to stomp forward and kill them all. There are additions in the pipeline to include new modes that should break up the monotony but if you're the type of gamer than enjoys a lot of diversity in modes such as CtF, KoH, etc. this may not be your cup of tea.\n\nThe pathfinding is frustrating, especially when you're stomping along in a 100 ton assault mech and are brought to a complete stop due to a "rock" no higher than your mech's ankle.\n\nThe mech customization is amazing with literally thousands of mech and weapon combinations. It's one of the few F2P games out there that does a very good job of walking that line without getting into P2W territory.    The developers are very responsive and interactive with their community via Twitter which is exceptionally rare in this industry.\n\nOverall I would give it 3 out of 5 stars (which could easily jump depending on what the company does with the recently released Phase 3 of Community Warfare). It's a free game and within a few hours of playing as a free player you can easily accumulate enough cbills (the free currency) to buy and outfit 2-3 mechs.\n\n","January 5","true","139.6"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","17","30","2","2"

Everyone said it's a "thinking player's shooter."  Sounded good, since I'm an old school RTS gamer and I've always prefer games that weren't twitch-based.\n\nSo...I started trying to play a laser mech because they don't run out of ammo.  Lost 5 games out of 6.  Badly.  I decided to try something different, so I bought 2 new Omni slots on a medium mech and outfitted it with 3 LRM10's and decided to play fire support.  Won 3 out of the next 4 matches.  Actually survived 2 of them to the end of the match, too.\n\nSo my review of MWO is basically this: it's a shooter where you CAN be tactical, deliberate, and patient.  You just can't play like that right up in the enemy's face.  If you aren't looking for a twitch shooter, you can still find a home here, but just do yourself - and your team - a favor and switch to a missile mech because that's the only class where someone with slow reflexes (like myself - hey, I admit it) can really be more help than harm.\n\nAnd who knows.  You might get lucky and kill someone with the lone Medium Pulse Laser you have.  Like I did 2 matches ago.  Hey, it happens.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add a little tip.\n\nOnce you die in a match, it's helpful to watch other players and learn how they play, but if you don't want to, you can quit the match.  When you do, your mech will show as "in mission" and you can't play another match until the game finishes.\n\nWhen this happens, switch to another mech and queue for another game.  You will still get credit once the other match finishes, and you can switch back to your other mech for the next match.  In this way, you do not have to sit on your hands for several minutes waiting for the game to end.\n\nAnd if you love one specific mech, you CAN own two of the same mech, too.","February 25","true","27.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","3"

There were several "Do Not Recommend" reviews which complained of a grindy nature, lack of infantry/vehicle targets and a power imbalance due to skills unlockable through regular play which noobs have no access to.  So I was pretty skeptical but DLed anyway to give my friend the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGee, I'm glad I got this game.  Despite there being a fair amount of truth to the negative reviews this game is great fun regardless.\n\nI would like to address those issues from negative reviews mentioned above:\n\nThe game is grindy?  Well, if you call playing a lot of games driving around in giant stompy robots shooting lasers in the faces of other giant stompy robots a grind, I guess it is.  The whole point of the game is to drive around in giant stompy robots and blow ♥♥♥♥ up.  Not to level up those skills.  First: Blow ♥♥♥♥ up, second: gets skills.  Blow ♥♥♥♥ up, it's so much FUN!  When you unload on someone with a bunch of lasers or short range missles and their arm falls off or you cripple their leg, or your first solo kill!  Revel in it.\n\nNo other targets besides giant stompy robots shooting lasers and massive autocannons around the place?  Well, if I was infantry and there were giant stompy robots blowing ♥♥♥♥ up all around me, I wouldn't want to be poking my head out.  And if I was driving a tank around said robots, I'd think it prudent to drive away as fast as posible.  There should be NO other targets both from fluff and gameplay perspectives (though there are infantry and vehicles in the original game and fluff, once the Mechs arrive, the little guys don't really matter anymore).\n\nIMO, anything other than Mechs as opponents would be a pointless distraction.  Any infantry or light vehicles would have to be AI as they would die in droves, no one would want to play them.  The players are there for the giant stompy robots afterall.  That these have been left out of the game serves to keep the gameplay focused on the PvP, robot vs robot theme of the game.\n\nThere is an imbalance between newer and experienced players?  And this doesn't happen in any other game?  When you start out in any new game you'll likely to get your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you a few times.  The learning curve might be a bit steeper in this game as it doesn't play like a typical FPS, thank Google for variety!  Persevere, click on "Spectate" when you get killed, watch how other people are playing, learn and get better.  Games are over pretty short and there are no significant repercussions for dieing in a dozen games, except that you might get a bit better each time.\n\nYes, there are skills that can be unlocked on Mechs which give them small bonuses.  I don't think these are especially unbalancing towards a new player in a trial Mech.  Though it might be if the game was one on one.  It's not, you have 11 other allies backing you up.  In fact, a much more significant factor in whether you survive a game is how well your team co-ordinates together.  And it's also likely that the other team will have as many noobs or vets as your team does.  It balances out.\n\nIf there is anything i would gripe about it is the cost of purchasable packs.  Especially the Steam bundles.  I'm not sure how they have decided on their pricing for these packs but it would be great if they were about 50% cheaper.  But would they sell 50% more packs?  Saying that i've still bought two 3 Mech* bundles.  These are the lowest tier on the purchasable packs and are pretty good value at $20US.  Even better value if you preorder and get early adopter rewards.  There are also periodic sales on various things in the store.  So if you are patient you can make savings.\n\n(*  Three Mechs of the same chassis are required to fully unlock all tiers of skills available and these bundles come with a months premium time which gives extra XP to help you along.  Each chassis also has distinct quirks and weapon hardpoints so you don't have three identical Mechs.  You get decent variety)\n\nThe game also rewards noobs quite generously with bonus in game currency for the first 25 matchs.  After this time you could get virtually any Mech you wanted that is available for cBills.  Buying bundles is not necessary.\n\nSo, in summary:  Yes you grind, if you call game after game of robot battles a grind.  If you don't want to battle giant robots you came to the wrwong game.\nThere are no other targets to shoot at or drive around.  If you want tanks there is a game for that.\nThere are skills.  Your teammates will have a greater influence on the battle than the skills will.  See who plays well in your games and Friend them, then ask to group and learn from them.\nBundles can be expensive but there is some good value in there too.\n\nYour biggest hurdle will be getting past the CoD playstyle and learning to play within the limitations of what sort of mech you are driving.  There is a lot more to this game than running around the map blasting people.\n\nOh yeah, you wont respawn either.","March 30","true","462.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's definitely more of a sim than a shooter, heat management and trigger discipline net you more kills than charging in with guns blazing.\n\nA couple things you should know before you drop in:\n1. Stay with the team - A solo 'Mech gets scrapped in short order, always.\n2. Press 'R' befpre you start shooting at something - Your target lock is shared with all other players on the team, by letting us know what you're shooting, you might get some assistance befor you get scrapped.\n3. Trigger Discipline (this is NOT CoD with robots) - As you fire weapons, your 'Mech begins to heat up, keeping an eye on your heat gauge and knowing how much heat your weapons generate per shot is vital to your success.  If you overheat, your 'Mech shuts down until heat levels are within spec again, leaving you an immobile target in the middle of a battlefield.\n4. Jump into VoIP!  - MWO is a game that heavily emphasises teamwork, grab a headset and coordinate.  Even if you don't have a strategy, you can call out targets that are too far away to target lock, and you can call for help if you get ambushed.

(Its potential was out of this world)\nWhat make me say that?  Gameplay.  Customization of your Mechs. Progression. Teamwork means winning or losing, not how much you paid for your Mech.  To become a great team player and mechwarrior there is a bunch you need to know.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\nThere's a learning curve.  You'll get your butt kicked for about a month straight until you learn the weapons and the mechs.\nBut if you stick with it then you'll start getting kills which is where the fun begins.\nJOIN A GROUP TO PLAY WITH.  The game is infinitely better when played on voice comms on TS with friends.\nGroups will accellerate your learning too as you will be taugh as you play and chat with veterans.\n\nThe future of MWO is friendly... now that its done spinning its wheels in the mud.  I'm eager to see what they do with the new Community Warfare, Faction Warfare, and balancing.\n\nOn the subject of joining groups.. Why not take a look at our group.

I almost didn't give this game a shot because of them, but when I eventually did there were plenty of powerful mechs to play for free and I didn't do bad at all. You get a nice fat bonus for your first matches and you'll be able to buy one powerful fully up-to-scratch best-level mech for yourself. I reccomend choosing carefully. The grind gets real bad after a while (to the point where a second full-power mech is paid DLC), but at least the game itself is fair. You can always use the free mechs if you don't care about the metagame and just want to walk a hulking mech to shoot people. Plus the unleveled versions of mechs are kinda affordable, and they aren't too much worse than top-level mechs.\n\nThe core game is more strategical than most shooters. Because it takes a while to kill someone and you can't easily reposition, the tactics behind your attacks are invaluable. There is strength in groups, because in this game there's no cheap one-shot kills. If someone shoots there will be plenty of time to react for the opponent, because you won't kill anyone with just one shot and going back behind cover takes getting that robot up to speed again. If the guy you shot has 5 friends you'll be shot back way harder. So attacking goes in groups, that way the odds won't be stacked against you. More people is more joy, because if you brought 8 friends along the enemy will have a lot worse of a time. Then of course there's flanking and attack routes to keep in mind, maybe sending 4 guys to flank can be an advantage etc., you get the gist. Shame there's a lot of pubnoobs who don't care for strategy.\n\nThe meta-game is building your mech, which is another collection of strategic decisions I won't go too much into depth on. The basic idea is that you can't have it all, you'll have to choose your strengths and weaknesses. The grind is more important. Basically free players can have 1 mech up to full power, if you want to max level another mech you'll have to buy space and get the mech you want 3 times over. Grinding up the money and premium currency for a second fully powered mech takes so incredibly long I'd actually say it's not possible. For all intents and purposes you get 1 max-level mech, you'll have to pay real money for more or settle for not-max-level-mechs. That sounds really bad, but keep in mind that not-max-level-mechs are pretty decent and usable.","January 13","true","41.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Don't be discouraged in the beginning (you will die) this is a game that takes effort to play well.  Communication and teamwork are important factors in achieving victory - and necessary for Faction Play.  There are Challenges/Events that give rewards (c-bills, MC, mechbays and even mechs) that really helps with the grind.  They also have sales often so taking advantage of them helps too.  Teamwork brings an whole other dimension to the game and many units have their own teamspeak server.  Joining a unit (the Apocalypse Lancers) was for me a major factor in making the game still enjoyabe to play.  Many veteran players are more than willing to help new players get the most fun out of their stompy robots.","February 10","true","392.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

I have to say that I enjoy this game far too much, The thing is, even if you buy things you are getting NO ADVANTAGE. This game's ONLY deciding factors are player skill, luck (Just like anything else luck is a factor) and utilizing the built in communications to coordinate with your team.\n\n\nTIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS :\n1. Turn off the ♥♥♥♥ing 3rd person, there's alittle camera drone behind and above your mech with a flashing red light EVERYONE CAN SEE when you're in 3rd Person, and its actually detrimental to your ability to aim.\n2. Controller support is wonky, and you DO NOT want to use a controller anyway, M&K is going to serve you much better, tracking targets smoothly and quickly is ESSENTIAL in this game.\n3.Never go out alone, you will die faster than you can say "What's going on?!"\n4. Save every C-Bill you earn until you can afford an IS assault or Clan Heavy, then save a few million more to outfit it as best as you can.\n5. USE OUT OF GAME UTILITIES LIKE SMURFY'S MECHLAB AND METAMECHS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\n6. The community has developed a Utility called "Fire Control" it has a weapon toggle feature for things like machineguns and TAG Laser designators, It is not against the game's rules and has other features as well like fire sequencing multiple fire groups instead of MWO's chainfiring mechanic, I only use it for very specific builds that are heavy on constant fire weapons like MGs/Missile boats with a TAG, but it can be used for other things as well.\n\n7/10 This game has its problems, and will continue to have problems, but It's had a great year this past year and with it's deadweight publisher IGP gone since like two years ago IIRC PGI has been making massive strides to regain community trust and has produced an enjoyable if frustrating stompy mech shooty game. Its not battletech, but then again mechwarrior has never been battletech, its just set in the same universe!\n\nServer Disconnections are semi-common for me its kind of annoying but has been getting better lately.\n\nSCREENSHOT! : http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/395552769137893977/105682C1B28BA38BAE6FBF0F31C7C8960EEA272C/","December 10, 2015","true","17.5"," 108 of 209 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","108","209","7","1"

The nice visual effects really add to that as well.\n\nIts more of a shooter that involves more strategy, teamwork and knowledge of your mech and, with experience, the weaknesses of your enemies mechs to succeed.\nTho, having skills like a stready trigger finger and good situational awareness will also get you far... plus it keeps you from being deadz.\n\nThe main thing thats really got me hooked on this game is the in depth customisation of mechs in this game. I've spent hours endlessly customizing and testing them on the battlefeild just to find that sweet spot, only to have my taste of weaponry shift again and again depending on me wanting more pew pew or dakka dakka. Or whether i want to be a "In Your Face" role or a support role. To simply put it, I love it!\n\nThat being said, the customization does look quite intimidating to beginners and new players may be lost at first with all the numbers and different components.\nBut the high amount of detail you can go to customizing your mech, right down to the armor in each limb and type of Missle, Cannon, Laser, Sensors, Engines, makes each mech tailor made to your intended play style.\n\nGlad to say, this game is far from a pay to win kind of game but does allow you to use real money to get what you want right away if your not willing to grind for it. But gives no real edge in combat in the end of the day.\nHowever, the game showers new players with loads of in game money when they start out. Which leads me to the biggest advice i can give to new players.Try the trail mechs first before spending all that c-bill moola.\n\nThe game affectively gives new players the choice of any mech in the beginning due to the extra c-bills players get in their first few matches (first 25). So get a good idea of what matches your play style first THEN buy your dream mech.\n\nLast few words : Stick together and TEAMWORK is king.","January 29","true","188.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I also feel the community back then was mostly just upset about changes that weren’t fair at the time but have been fixed from the game I play today.  So, don't let any of those reviews deter you from trying this fantastic game.\n\nMechWarrior Online is free, worth a bit of your time to try out, and if you enjoy playing it grab a few Mechs to support the continued development of the game, and if not, you paid nothing!\n\nThe game I found is very competitive, fun, and nothing short of amazing.\n\nPS: Use the “Dakka” Dire Wolf mech seen on the “Metamechs” mech building website; it has been my favorite so far!

PGI has brought it up from what it was (not that it was ever bad in my eyes) They continuosly work on fixes, balancing and any other issues that arise, props to PGI for getting it to where it currently is. Will continue to throw money at them. Oh and did I mention... KODIAK coming in may? WINNING!\n\nEDIT: I neglected to mention that they have managed to introduce some of the previously "unseen" battlemechs back into the universe, I know I speak not only for myself in commending them for their efforts on this. The Marauder, Warhammer, Rifleman and Archer are all either back or soon to be released (Archer is yet to come and ships March 15th). The reason this took some guts on their part is due to all legal issues regarding copyrights to their images etc. They redisgned them enough for them to be considered their own designs and thus are able to put them into their game. I myself am no IS fan boy (quite the opposite in fact) but it is undeniable that these mechs are a welcome sight on the field of battle. They even have me wanting to swap to IS now and then to play them in Community Warfare.\n\nTo all new players, my message is this: You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying this out, it will appear grindy at first, and undoubtedly you will be pulverized by those more experienced than yourself. Remember this though, you'll enjoy every second of seeing that Atlas round the corner and lay into your face with it's massive alpha and in turn you will find yourself striving to learn how to avoid and combat such situations.

My opinion is somewhat biased (or not biased at all, as it would push me to scrutinize the game harder) because I have been a long-time fan of the BattleTech/MechWarrior franchise and series. I've played the MechWarrior games since the first, and always enjoyed them.\nAll that said, I found myself pleasantly surprised with MWO. I feel like they have done the franchise justice quite well, and, although I had concern that the Clans weren't getting a lot of love, we have gotten quite a hefty hand of Clanners recently, along with IIC 'Mechs, and more Clanners incoming even.\nIf I have anything to complain about, it's that the 'Mechs don't totally feel like 'Mechs at times. They control a little too... Smoothly? I guess? Smooth is good, but something about it feels 'too' fluid, if you know what I mean. Also, when a 'Mech is destroyed, it feels like there's no real weight behind its descent... But these are minor, minor complaints.

Great F2P game and definitely not pay to win. Player skills and mech load outs are decisive factors in winning. Clan warefare is brutal for newcommers but still playable. All mechs are free, newer ones will be made available in 3-5 months lead times f you have the patience but at the moment there are more than enough mechs to experiment. Earning c-bills is a bit grindy but weekend event prizes and premium times awards will give you the surge in earnings.

The development cycle seems to be dragging at a snails pace, and the community has a shaky history. However If I were to compare it to other free to play games on Steam it comes out on top of a lot of them with really solid gameplay and customization, good graphics and sound, and on top of that probably the best in the big stompy mech genre for now.\n\nThe greatest amount of naysaying you will hear is going to be from the old NBT Hardcore Vets. The real Battletech badasses of a bygone age. This game is not even close to a carbon copy of the good old days of Mechwarrior 4 Mercs some of the most well organized league play I have ever seen. I was very young when I watched my brother's Dad play on Clan Smoke Jaguar, The Jade Falcons, and even The Blazing Aces (of which I was a member of sometime until the MWO went through a period of great stagnation.)\n\nAll in all, if you play these games for fun, you are going to have fun.\n\nIf you play the game wanting to get back in to league play the exact same way you did back in NBT, you are gonna have a bad time.\n\n","February 5","true","35.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I read reports of it feeling incredibly Pay2Win in the early stages. This discouraged me quite a bit until I decided to play just recently. And I have to say, they have fixed this massive issue from my experience so far.\n\nThis game sets you in the seat of any one of dozens of building-sized mechs (with variations for every appetite of carnage) as it pits you against one another in a thought-provoking strategy. Run&Gunners will not like this game, outright, to be successful you need to utilize what you can with your team and weigh strategies. A single mech can turn the tide of battle depending on the game type and the strategy employed.\n\nPROS:\n-High on the thought-provoking based gameplay. (Moves/actions/assaults require tactics)\n-Built-in Voice to assist with this\n-The mech choices feel endless and nearly every style of "approach" can be found in at least one mech\n-Weapon balance is very sold, something you expect from a MW game\n-Builds for any mech can keep even veteran tinkerers happy\n-Maps have variety (even if people only choose a few maps)\n-The game feels organic and very immersive as you are set in the cockpit of a 30-100 ton war machine\n-The smallest mechs have strategies to employ against the largest, and vice versa. Not one mech can truly reign as "king of mechs"\n\nCONS:\n-New players will feel overwhelmed with the amount of options and how to actually build/load a mech\n-The tutorial is nice but not as extensive as the game itself\n-There is no "try before you buy" unless your mech of choice happens to be in the weekly(?) trial mech line-up\n-EXP gain and Credits gain after your first few battles feels molasses in January slow\n-Game requirements may be high for some older PC's\n\nOverall the gameplay is as solid as titanium with a few flaws in regard to resource income. Good visuals, good gameplay, and the community is actually quite friendly for a team-based competitive game. Let's just say I'd rather meet with MWO folk than LoL/DOTA2 folk any day of the week.\n\nSolid 9.5/10\nPromote whoever did the improvements for this game.","February 23","true","17.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I was afraid of P2W, OP mechs not properly balanced by the devs and all that stuff.\n\nAfter a friend convienced me to give it a try, I got addicted. This is the "shooter" I was looking for. Not that focused on reflexes and fast pace movement like CS:GO or similar FPS, but more tactical approach with steady aim and a deep thought in positioning to maximize your damage outpot while staying alive.\n\nAnd the theorycrafting, oh good, I've never thought that you could talk 3 hours about the best loadout for a certain chassis of a mech. But you can. And I friggin' love exactly this kind of depth this game delivers.\n\nPatches are rolled out on a monthly basis. The devs, well, TRY at least to be as much community driven as they can, the playerbase, although you find your foul apple every now and then, is mostly calm and mannered, which is absolutely rare for a F2P-title.\n\nBut, you have to be that honest, there IS a small, but really really small, Pay-2-Win-factor in this game. There are some mechs that you can only buy with real money that have a specialised loadout and weaponry that may seem OP in certain situations. But a mech is still only as good as the pilot and when you suck at piloting, the best mech falls in a few seconds because he doesn't know how to torso twist or how positioning functions.\n\nAs a BattleTech-fanboi, I rate this game a solid 9/10. The one point missing is for maps like Viridian Bog. ♥♥♥♥ Viridian Bog. Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ LRM-Boats on Polar Highlands, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starbomber109/recommended/342200/","starbomber109","starbomber109","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starbomber109/","58 products in account","MWO is an FPS simulation (and yes, I saw that walking simulator tag...sigh) where you drive 35-100 ton death machines around and blow things up.  If this sounds awesome welcome to BATTLETECH, a universe where war is decided by these giant mechs.  Each mech has a ton of customization with the different weapon groups.  Lasers, balistics and missiles.  The game can be daunting for someone new, but it does come with tutorial missions and practice missions to help get new players up to speed.  Of course, you could also jump straight into the action and that's fine as well.\n\nGraphics are good.  It runs off the cryengine which while dated can still put out some good images at the highest settings.  Of course, it's also scaled pretty well, so if you experience performance issues feel free to turn down some settings.  The only gripe I have with the graphics is low-light vision.  Sometimes it gets hard to see enemy mechs, especially on night maps.  There are two vision modes designed to help with that.  Thermal (triggered by pressing H) allows you to see the heat signatures of enemy mechs.  Hot objects glow bright white in this view, but be careful not to use it on the Terra Therma map or you'll go blind.  It can also sometimes be hard to drive with this mode especially in cities as buildings don't show up too well.  The other vision mode is night vison (Triggered by pressing n) which is the same green-screen that you would expect.  It works well most of the time and provides good contrast but it has problems with smoke.\n\nControls are pretty simple but you have to get used to thinking of your mech as a tank.  Comming from World of Tanks and a longtime battletech fan, it wasn't hard for me to get used to this but some people really struggle not being able to strafe side to side.  You have to turn your legs first!  I've tried it with a controller as well and it takes some configuring but you can set it up no problem.\n\nGameplay is awesome.  It's an FPS but mechs have lots of health so you can take a few hits and trade with enemies.  Position and line of sight is also really important, as is TARGETING.  There is a radar screen but only the mechs you and your team target will show up on the map.  There is a lot of info warfare demonstrated in this game and I love it.  There are target painting lasers, beacon rockets that can light up enemy mechs for the world to see, ECM and counter ECM, active probes.  I could go on all day.  There are a lot of really skilled players out there that have written and videoed great guides, or just, had fun!  The game is fairly balanced for the most part but it is very heavy on teamwork and focus fire.  Individual 1v1s are rare, and sometimes they aren't always in your favor as different mechs have different roles, some mechs are superb duelists while some mechs are more long-range fire support.  If a duelist gets in close to a fire support mech that fire support mech is probably dead, that's why this game relys so much on teamplay.\n\nMechwarrior, and battletech, has a lot of fans.  If you love battletech, you'll love this game.  However, I have some tips and warnings for newbies.\n\nA tip: Don't get intimidated!  Battletech has a rich lore and a vast customization system.  Look up metamechs (its a website :P) mess around in smurfy's mechlab, above all else, keep an open mind. This can be a slow game, but it can also be very fast, it all depends on the flow of the match you're in.  Don't listen to people crying about P2W, for the most part, the game is pretty balanced on that front.  It's more, 'pay for convenience' and PGI has a habit of releasing mechs in stages, first stage is like a preorder, then it's available for premium currency, then it's available for C-Bills (The standard currency)\n\nA warning: You need a lot of patience to play this game.  The cadet missions and training missions give out some C bills, but mechs can cost upwards of 9million Cbills when fully decked out.  It will take you some time to get up to speed, but it's worth the wait, as once you have your own mech you can do whatever you want with it.  Fight in community warfare!  Master your mechs!  And have fun!","March 5","true","363.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Very team oriented as a result the solo guys always gonna be the first to die so stay with your lance especially when your first starting out.\n\nOnly real issue i have is no that is multiplayer only but hey in terms of mech combat its still the best imo.

Yes the vast majority of mechs are purchasable with some grinding, and there is a huge in-game-currency bonus for shiny new players; however many mechs one may want cost cold hard cash and are TOO EXPENSIVE.\n\nExperienced players have a huge advantage as there IS a learning curve, and on top of that the bonuses for "working in" mechs and buying "modules", which is really cool and gives motivation for grinding. Some new players may feel intimidated.\n\nPLEASE PLAY THE TUTORIAL.

Want bigass cannons? Go for it. Like EZ aim mode lasers? Pew pew.\n\n>Graphical update in March made this game look amazing. Every mech has 2k textures and the game set to ultra high looks awesome on systems that can run it.\n\n>BIG MECH. Knock over ALL OF THE TREES. RaaaaAAAAAAA.\n\n>Smart play and tactics get rewarded. Idiots that rush in alone die, even if they bought a "pay to win" mech.\n\n>There is no pay2win model here. Most purchases are cosmetic; extra mech bays can be earned thorugh faction warfare (please save this for when you've played lots) and most mechs you see only for sale for real money are later available for in-game currency.\n\n>Your first 25 matches have a HUGE bonus to in game currency earnings. Save it for when you're ready to buy; the 17 million total plus whatever you earn playing will be enough to buy an assault mech.\n\n>Hot damn, the animations are great.\n\n>PGI is somewhat connected to their playerbase and actively tries to improve their game.\n\n>Free to play; if you don't enjoy it, all it costs is time. If you love it and never spend a cent, WOO. Free game!\n\n>Active and helpful community. If you have questions, there's always someone or somewhere you can go to get them answered.\n\n>Supprt is generally helpful and almost always polite yet concise. Even though they have a small team, they are a damn good team at that.\n\n>It FEELS like you're driving a 20 to 100 ton machine of doom. Even the smallet of these things dwarf some of the buildings in this game. The scale is AWESOME.\n\n>Every cockpit of every mech is different. It's awesome.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n>Limited maps in both quick play and faction warfare. You will learn them all fairly quickly.\n\n>If you want to own ALL of the mechs, you will have to pay for them in the long run. For some people, that's fine. Just be aware of what you're buying first. Do research on mechs before you buy. DO RESEARCH. You will hate yourself if you get something you do not enjoy playing.\n\n>Despite the few years this game has been out, not a lot has come out aside from a couple maps here, a UI update there. PGI has a small team; expect the game to evolve somewhat slowly.\n\n>Not every mech is a good one. There are balance issues like in any other online game with player versus player, but it sucks to buy a crap mech. But yes, research. You can avoid this with KNOWLEDGE.\n\n>No single player mode. There is work being done for a PvE campaign, but I don't expect it to be done any time soon.\n\n>Meta play gets to be a bit.. well.. obvious. Just be ready for the occasional tryhard with a 100% optimal build that can three shot you with alpha strikes. Of course, you can always shoot them back.\n\n>In game currency earnings gets really slow after those first 25 matches. Sorry. It'll be grindy to get that second or third mech you want.\n\n>Premium time in-game is used even if you are not actively playing. If you have 3 days of premium, it will be gone in 3 days. Regardless of if you play or not.\n\n>Faction play needs work. I'll not say more. It's fun and all, but it needs work.\n\n>Third person mode sucks. If you despise first person, well.. good luck?\n(who hates first person though lol psh)\n\n>NOT GAMEOAD/JOYSTICK FRIENDLY OMG\nEven with custom inputs it blows. You're stuck with KB&M.\n\nOverall: 9/10 game, would recommend","March 25","true","529.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have ever dreamed of piloting a big giant robot this is the closest you are going to get until someone does a follow up to the Mechwarrior series of games.\n\n1) Controls are simple enough though its recommended to play with a keyboard and mouse rather than a joystick setup as per in game cockpit pilots.\n\n2) Players are refreshingly not toxic like CSGO which has the nastiest creatures around. Yeah once in a while you get a troll but that is exceedingly rare. Beware in PUG not many people speak at all which is a bit weird considering its a team based battle game\n\n3) The in game purchases does reek a bit of a money grab at times with prices that is quite expensive for each pack (DLC) but if you are into the game I guess you will be throwing money at the developers anyway. This game is not Pay to WIn but more of a get items sooner with your cash .\n\n4) Gameplay - I have had epic matches with some battles reminding me of the movies with great set piece battles like the Gladiator and 300. Lots of pincer movements and flanking executed though it is rare that a team is so coordinated.\n\nOverall I would say download the game and enjoy the free to play options that is available. If you wanna get deeper , then purchase a Mastery pack for the Mech you like to play with. Good game!","March 28","true","284.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Needs map awareness and thinking to play well.\n- Kit out your mech\n- Play as a team or lose.\n\nCons\n- Developer has no clue about game mode mechanics\n- Developer has no clue about map design\n- Developer has no clue how to optimise a game engine (DX9 runs better than DX11 here)\n- The game will never be finished. Developer is constantly fiddling around with it.\n- Faction Play (Community Warfare) is a bust\n- Conquest mode\n\nHaving played this for 2-3 years since before Steam release. I have to warn you that the learning curve is fairly steep. There are a lot of things to know about the game, and they will not come quickly.\n\nMost of the guys who have stuck around are hardcore Battletech/Mechwarrior fans who just want to pilot their favourite mechs into battle and blow up other mechs.\n\nThe core gameplay loop is improving how fast you blow up the other guy with well placed shots. But the game modes are standard. Skirmish, Assault, Domination are all just Deathmatches with some twist or none. I personally hate Conquest mode because it simply doesn't work without respawn mechanics.\n\nA lot of this review sounds negative, and that is intended. I would recommend this game, but ONLY if you like the few things it does right, and if you like beautiful mechs.","March 16","true","622.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The game play seems to blend the best part of MW3 and MW4 together, while at the same time eliminating some of the most annoying parts of each.  Gone are the laser bunnies that dominated MW3.  Gone are the crippling customization limitations that made MW4 bad.  While you don't have complete freedom, the game gives you enough to capture a good experience - if you're willing to grind for it.\n\nThe C-bill grind wall is pretty massive after the first 25 games.   You cant just jump in your mech of choice as in past games, you instead have to buy it and you'll farm for quite sometime just to gear out a good sized mech the way you want it.  This kind of sucks.  The games microtransation system is not required at all, but is also not very generous.  If you do want to support the game, be prepared to pay 20$ just for 1 medium sized mech.\n\nAll and all, if you're looking for some old fashion mech action, this game is good.  Just make sure to buy the mech you want in the beginning, otherwise it's going to be a long time until you get it.","March 14","true","189.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

There are a lot of things that I’m not happy about as MWO has evolved as do a lot of other people who play this game.  All I can say is don’t get your head stuck in the forums and the negativity see the game for what it is.  A constantly evolving and improving online experience as a MechWarrior pilot with the Inner sphere, Clans and Mercenaries.\nMech releases are flowing with the in game time line so as the time line progresses more tech and mechs become available.  There is a tier based ranking system that let players play with those at their skill level.  Very good to help new players get familiar with the game play and tactics.  Just remember if you are in a group with players at a higher Tier you will play at that level.\n\n8/10\nIf community warfare was completed and not still in the beta phase I would probably give it a 9/10\nI put this game down for 9months and picked it up again recently and was impressed to see the changes that had happened over that time being new maps, mechs and a graphic overhaul.\nIt’s free and also pay to play, grind your way for C-bills to buy mechs or throw down $100 for 25000 mech credits either way it’s a hell of a game and definitely worth a try.\n\nV1L3\n\nClan Wolf International [CWI]\nclan-wolf.info\n\nSee you in the next drop..\no7\n","March 17","true","138.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's pretty much like getting to play multiplayer mechwarrior of old. The effects are cool, the graphics are okay, the gameplay is slightly different but still about shooting lasers, autocannons, and missiles at enemies and blowing off their limbs.\n\nHowever, I have never seen such visceral hate for the developer as I have in this game. Everyone who plays routinely poops all over PGI (the developers). I understand the REASON people are mad. The mechanics are so solid in this game, that it's just BEGGING for some cool stuff. Cooperative missions, single player campaign, more multiplayer modes, really cool base sieges and destructable buildings. Those would all be really, really great. And yes, the developer talks about how those are going to be in the game, and yes, they are not in the game yet. Should that equal anger and a vicious attitude to the development staff? I guess that's up to you to decide.\n\nAs for me... I still play for a few hours every day, so I can't complain. It's a good game, and it's a mechwarrior game.

It starts you off with four "Trial Mechs" for each weight-class of mech. You have Light, Medium, Heavy and Assault mechs to try out with rather optimized loadouts, but on the whole they'll be suited towards default playstyle rather than individual tastes. The game's intro academy run and tutorial is very nice and simple, it even gives out some free in-game currency (C-Bills), and for the first twenty matches you drop into you get cash injections. By the end of the twenty matches you WILL have enough to buy your own mech to fully customize.\n\nFor those who want to drop cash on a starter kit? I'd recommend it, though I also recommend looking at the website for the developer, "MWO Mercs". It has active bundles for specific mechs, iconic mechs, pre-order packs and "al a carte" style purchasing to pick and choose. It is a bit of an advantage over other players earning mechs via hard fighting, though trial mechs also build XP for those buying that variant. All in all, the game is fun. There's many ways to play and be a credit to your team, and this isn't even touching upon Community Warfare which introduces more organized combat that offers rewards such as in-game items for decoration and "real money" Mech-Credits to buy custom colors and such with.\n\nIn the end, it isn't Gundam, it plays heavier and slower for most mech pilots. You're in anything from a 20-ton Locust with high-speed capabilities to a 100-ton Atlas that can literally bludgeon through enemy lines to open up holes for the team.\n\nI recommend this game, while it might not be for everyone, it's definitely a "Freemium"/Free to Play title that is worth trying.","January 31","true","292.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The mode is way more tactical with actual strategizing, that the community often engages in. However, the queues are extremely long, even longer than gameplay somtimes.\nHere's the rest of the review:\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game, but overall I feel it's a pretty fun, semi-tactical combat arena game in the Battlemech universe. I've been looking to play something like Mechwarrior but more recent, and this fits those old games with improved gameplay and graphics.\n\nI haven't been huge into the Battlemech universe, so part of the game is overwhelming. There is a lot going on in this game; so many Mechs to choose from, weapons and builds to go with.\n\nThe community has been pretty solid thusfar. I've only had 1 game where a teammate purposely shot off my arms. I expected more, but everyone seems to either be going along with the gameplay or actively tactical and supportive.\n\nThe gameplay is very short and can miss a lot of the tactical aspect. The maps are diverse and offer some strategizing, but within the community, the strategy features aren't used often. The same can be said for any gameplay mode that isn't deathmatch; all objectives tend to be to elimate the other team.\n\nSome purchase aspects are mainly skins, or things that can be grinded for. So it's not unfairly balanced to those who pay to win. The challenges add some objective and diversity to the gameplay, but I feel it is really lacking in tactical-based objective seeking gameplay.\n\nThis is a game that works well, plays great and has the community to support it. You get dig deep into the immense Battlemech universe, grind and build limitlessly, or just skirmish in a well developed combat game.","February 20","true","136.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Being a good button-masher isn't going to make you a good player.\n\nSecond: This isn't Call of Duty. You can't carry your team's weight.

This game takes it to a new level in the sheer variety of what you can do to make your big stompy robots YOURS. You have a mech with two ballistic hard points that has enough slots for a pair of AC 20s, go ahead and slap 'em on. Not to mention the game is balanced. Having a big mech isn't an automatic win.\n\nFourth: The game really is free to play. It isn't pay to win. You pay for things like different colors for your mech or some cockpit bling. Maybe you just really want that mech right now, so you can use actual money.

The developers are extremely slow to balance imbalances within the game and often listen to twitter posts more often than the actual "competitive" players so there is a bit of incompetency within the games development cycle.

Fair warning to new players though..... Within my first hour of playing and learning I was bombarded with name calling etc. by veteran clan players on my team about every other game for not knowing the maps, what my mech's role was, etc. It was pretty harsh.... and of all the time I have played online MP games this was probably the biggest bash-fest on new players in the game I have ever seen.... They are easy to ignore... Just keep playing on and learn!! I look at it this way.... if players take a loss in a random, match-making battle so personal.... They aren't worth the bits and bytes of text data they type when they cry about losing in a match with mixed noobs and vets...\n\nGame is free to play as it says and lots and lots to do for free. Trial mechs of every class to learn on or decide which you like, you can buy your first mech or 2 and load it out, as well as add some perks and what not all from playing the game. No purchases really needed. If you want more advanced mechs and components....asthetics... yea it is a little pricey with real money.\n\nAll in all this one can be played without spending a dime and still have fun doing it. If you are obsessed with kill ratios, cool paint jobs, clans, and want to take this game from recreation level to "my day is ruined because I lost again" fanatic....You will need to open your wallet up a little...\n\nGraphics are pretty decent for what it's worth. Gameplay is great... A LOT of different mechs and configurations for them are almost limitless...and free. From what I have seen so far, there really isn't a balancing issue bc of this... Everyone uses all different mechs that are custom built to their style...and none really overpowered considering this is a team effort game....

But there are 4 problems with it.\n\n\n\n\n1) (Weapons) The use of lasers is the recomended weponery in the game it self. I use them myself quite a lot but the difference between Laser, Balistic and Missle Weapons IS ATRETOUICe. Its so bad I mean not to say anything bad to the developers but you guys need to please balance them. (Laser weapons are the pinnicle weapon of the game it is the most used weapon on the battlefield but its exteamly unballenced betweem Clan and Inner Sphere. The InnerSphere type weapons have less range and damage and even have more Heat than there Clan Counter part, However Clan Tech have increased Range, Durration and Damage(Whitch I think is totally unfair). (Ballistic Weapons InnerSphere Ballistic type weapons are probably not the way you want to go if you want a ballistic type.The InnerSphere type ballistic weapons are HORRIBLE comparred to Clan. 1. More Relod time 2. More Heat in numbers 3. less range and last but not least fire mobility. With the InnerShpere Ballistic you only have one shot which is totaly fine its just that you can never seem to get a hit unless under 120 Meters Away! I Mean I fit and AC/20 on a mech of mine and( I do know all of the Ranges of the weapons) absollotly do no damage at all even though I can Clearly see the mech Rock back and the explosion on the mech it self. However Clan Mech balistic weapons have 1. More damage 2.More range 3 less weight 4. More range and finnaly Having thae chance to be able to hit somthing. The clan Balistic waepons are almost aoutomatic with the C AC/20 has a four round Burst comparred to the C UAC/20 which has I think 6. But of course the InnerShpere has only one shot. the Clan weaponry in balistics is Far supirrior to InnerSphere.(Missle) How do i start this.................MISSLES ARE USLESS UNLESS YOU HAVE LIKE 6 SRM 6's ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIT ANYTHING WITH THEM EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOCK! Especcialy when you have that guy with Radar Deprivation or have a Clan ECM or its counter part its bassicly impossible to even get a hit unless you hve Streak but thats not the point missle damage is so Messed up like I willbe in the trial ATLAS (AS7) with the AMS and the Missles just keep on coming  but guess what the AMS DOESNET HELP! all it does is fire a bunch of pretty lights that do nothing!\n2) (Mechs) The Differnces between Clan and InnerSphere mechs is way ou of the Border line. Clan comparred to InnerSphere is So Unbalanced. Clan has more armour, MASC and even come with Lighter Weapons and equipment I mean if you gety Double Heat Sinks the Clan ones only take up one less slot (WHICH IS TOTAL CRAP) Becasue some of the mechs have so much more carry weight than Innersphere plus thay can fit almsot twice as many on theres! (Cost) The cost between Clan and InnerSphere is UNBARRABLE like a Locust will only cost 1,207,304 C bills but the ADDER Cost's 6,998,709 C Bills. I mean come on Lower the prices becasue ven if you want a Clan Mecha it will Take YOU MONTHES TO GET EVEN CLOSE! it took me 3 days with the Cadet Bounuses plus the good games! You could Comparritvely buy 1 Clan Mech commpared to 3 InnerSphere I MEAN WHAT THE HECK DAYS OF GRINDING FOR ONE MECH WHY!!!!! It takes forever to even get money if you lose your minimum is 50,000 which isnt even enough to get anywhere but even if you win with 3 kills you only get 100,000! The only way to even get money is to Pay to win Unless you pay for premium time!\n3) (Matchmaking) One word......HORID............I am a rank 3 player and somethimes ILL BE IN A RANK ONE MATCH! (best players) Ill die instantly to these pros and my team completely sucks! I will also get in a lobby with one of my freinds and it takes 10 min to get in a match! Please Fix it!\n\n4) (Other Players) The other players in the game ether 1. dont listen and get themselves killed or 2. Get in the way. the players need to understand this is a Team Based game not some La De Da FPS it takes Real teamwork to Get good and beat the other team. Which you will take time to get skill and you will have Triumph in this game but thats not the matter the matter is the players dont respect the fact that this game is for team building and teamwork among the Lances on your Team. It takes skill and Effort to win.\n\n","December 18, 2015","true","122.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This is Bill Lumbar reporting in for my first review of MWO.\n\nI started playing MWO around 2 years ago.  I have always been a fan of the BT table top, grew up playing it as a child and young adult.  38 now, and through the years I have played many of the BT games on sega, super Nes, playstation, xbox and pc to name a few.  I used to head up to chicago to the BT center as a kid with my dad to get my fix.\n\nLife took over and I found myself not playing BT games anymore, and for years.  I got that hunger again around two years ago and googled new BT games.  First hit I got was MWLL and I happened to have the old Cyris game so I was all set.  Jumped right in and I loved it... then bam!  MWLL got shut down/they stopped developing it.  I then read the rumors surrounding the "why" and came across MWO and downloaded it and started playing it more then I would like to admit.  For a solid 6 months, I dropped over 6000+ matches.  Within the last two plus years I have spent around $90 dollars on this game between two accounts, one IS, and the other straight Clan.\n\nThis game has faults..... that is for sure.  One of the two biggest issues for me has always been the painful "grind" and snails pace one progresses at in this game, even when spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on it.  Thankfully, right before the Steam release... PGI decided after 2 plus years of very low ingame earnings to increase the C-bill and XP earnings.  I don't believe its where it needs to be, but it is up around 15-25% of what we all used to make per match.  I wanted and felt a 50% increase was long over due, but hey its a start.\n\nSecondly, Prices for everything in this game besides Mechbays are pretty much crack priced.  How they unlock camo, patterns, and colors is just insane for the price.  All the bling for the cockpits, prices are pretty much insane IMO.\n\nThird game lacks serious content and depth.  It needs so much more, and it has been screaming for more for a very long time!\n\nNow to the good things,  Core game play is fun.  I am looking for more of a sim type game when it comes to BT... because I like to build sim pits... I love BT... and I hope they keep it moving more towards that style of play in this game.  for what ever faults this game does have, PGI has come a long way with this game.\n\nI took a several month vaction from this game... going from playing around 100-200 matches a week, to only 5 matches a week.  The  last 3 months I have just got back into playing this game and am back up to maybe 30-50 matches a week.  This was mostly to do with PGI ignoring the pleas of many on the forums/forum warriors that earnings needed to be brought up so this game didn't feel like a snails pace.  Even with PT it still felt very slow, making not buying PT a no brainer.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game to others, core game play is fun.... and I have met some really cool people in game.  The forums are a trip some times... much hate...but there is also a lot of love out there and some really cool people that love to help and also even share/give aways.  One piece of advice...spend wisely, and don't go on a crack spending spree....seriously, its not worth it IMO.  If you have the dollars to do that and want a place to blow them, by all means, knock yourself out.  Plenty to blow money on in this game...golden mechs.... you name it, PGI will sell it!","January 5","true","431.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoffiNailTseng/recommended/342200/","CoffiNailTseng","CoffiNail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoffiNailTseng/","124 products in account","Hello potential MechWarriors,\n\nI am Khan CoffiNail Tseng a unit leader of the Clan Faction loyalist unit Clan Ghost Bear International. I have been on and off heavily active in MechWarrior since May 2010, a year before MWO was even announced playing in a MechWarrior mod for the game Crysis. I was a zealous fan of MWO from the start of announcements for MechWarrior Online using a daily puzzle of the Atlas concept artwork and twitter to stir a buzz felt around the net. I was so crazy in love with this game I ended being the 25th register forum member. I still play this game and am more a grey knight than a zealous fan for various reasons, but I am a die-hard Mechhead and love to see MechWarrior in the spotlight it had back in the 90s. The game has its flaws, but so does any game that is in development still, it may be out but it is a perpetually in development game. So the MWO you play today, will not be the same one in a year, as content is continuously coming out and being teased with.\n\nIt is a great game. It has very well done artwork, and the Mechs are extremely well done. Animation is great as most mechs feel weighty and others make you jump if you run in to them around a corner and you skid to a stop to try and get back around your corner. Scale could be considered a little off by some, but with the addition half a year ago with destructible light posts, knockdown trees, etc the scale seems fairly well for Machines only a dozen meters tall. The environments are beautiful and I still find myself getting lost in them at times.\n\nDo you want a game that can be both twitch and slow, where good aim pays off to take down critical components, but someone who’s aim is mediocre can still do decent damage and have a great time doing it? MWO is a good FREE game to add to your library. If you want a game with a lot of weapons fire going off and an often chaotic battlefield or something to get a fill of stompy big robots this game is a great FREE addition to your library. You are someone who just loves to tinker with things until they are just right, shedding armour off this leg to add a bit more armour or heat sinks, crafting the perfect build and playstyle this would be a great FREE addition to your library. Honestly, it is free, so give it a try and do not take my word for it but experience the battlefield of 1980’s 31st Century Battlefield Technology.\n\nThis game has had its ups and downs much like any develop game and the fact their game has been in a large sense open to the public since November 1st 2011 and the very start of their development, now this means they have had a lot of scrutiny and under the microscope. They have been developing a nestablished universe with a fairly strong fanbase. These fans have not had a game since early 2002 in MechWarrior 4. Of course these loyal crowd, to which I am one love the core universe MechWarrior Online was place in, Battletech. It has a deep and rich backstory that is the effect of an alternate history starting in the 1980s.\n\nPGI’s announcement of MechWarrior Online had a very exciting start. With a twitter feed giving daily in universe news written by the current developer of the tabletop, backstory universe Randall Bills. It had hints of the setting, a puzzle of concept art. The month of October 2011 was fairly amazing from a Mechwarrior fan’s point\n\nThis is getting to be a very balanced game. No longer do you have a arms race to the largest Mechs with the most advanced tech. Every mech in the right hands could be a very deadly opponent. Like in this universe the elite skilled were some of the deadliest pilots, who could operate their machines like and extension of themselves. A green and fresh pilot in a Atlas, should come down to a veteran in a light Mech Jenner.\nThe Customization of Mechs via the Mechlab. Giving you hours of lost time playing around to get your warmachine just the way you like it, with the weapons you like. The deeper meta of the mechlab is an art all in itself and is a core aspect to master in competitive scenes.\n\nRole Warfare: Where your Assault Mechs going in force alone would mean nothing, but a well-coordinated team, mixed with different weight classes and loadouts could crush a more numerous opponents. Your Heavy Mechs were the support and the force going in with the assaults and crushing the opposition. Medium Mechs the backbone of the game, your go to for price and power. The light Mechs of your team were experts as going in behind enemy lines and at using Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) to shield your team from enemy sensors.\n\nIntelligence Warfare: From the above lights, to other, heavier chassis with ECM and other electronics of the battlefield. Using your gear to assist in spotting for you Long Range Missiles allies in the rear or to jam the ECM of your foe.\n\nCommunity Warfare: The creation of units in-game. Guilds, clans, communities. The larger picture of the glory that is a game set in the war torn Inner Sphere of the Battletech Universe. There is always war, and this give the community as deeper meta game to bring to the table.\n\nSomething always feels great about piloting 20-100 ton Bipedal Warmachine of destruction and smashing them around a forest or city. The rush you can have being the last pilot in a match, or as you take on a mech in a higher weight class, or even as that Assault crashing in to wreak havoc with your team.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope I have given a bit of sway for you to try MechWarrior Online, or at least to keep it on your scope to try soon. We see the same games in different forms, and MWO has a bit of a different take on the FPS. I hope to see you on the battlefield MechWarrior.\n\n-Khan CoffiNail Tseng, Clan Ghost Bear International ghost-bear-command.com\n","December 13, 2015","true","62.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I also played ALL the previous iterations of this franchise, going all the way back to the beginning. For what it's worth. I have played in well over 5000 drops, own 200+ mechs.\n\nOn to the game itself.\n\nOh I have spent money, but mostly, because I wanted to, I buy mech bays, and premium time mostly and up until recently every mech pack they sold. I took a small hiatus from purchasing packs until some game issues were resolved, I did not stop playing, not even a little, but I voted with my wallet for a while :).\n\nThe game is fun, it's fast paced, and it requires you to think about what you are doing at all times, stop for a minute to look around, and you might be dead. There is a unique variance in how you play based on the type of mech you bring in the game, light, medium, heavy, assault. You can play the game as a solo participant or as a group participant, here is the divide, teamwork is OP, and always will be in a game that boasts a 12v12 atmosphere.\n\nMany people are reviewing this game, and many giove it negative reviews, mostly, because they are now, or at least were at some point, very passionate about this game, this is the common theme you will in reviews on steam for MWO, passion, it makes for a diverse and interesting commentary on how this game effects  the people who play it. Many people come and go, some say the "best" players have gone on to other games, tired of waiting for changes, and that may be true to an extent, though there are many current players that would argue the point :).\n\nTry the game, see for yourself, if you like shooters, this is the ultimate one, the diversity in how you kit out your mech is completely astounding, you have tons (literally) to play with, as I noted above I have 200+ mechs, and each one can have almost unlimited different configurations, just this alone is worth hours of ones time, mech lab is the game within the game, who can build the best robot? who is going to set the next "meta" ? no one knows for sure. There are so many resources and established units within the game, you won't be alone for long if you want to play with people, use HPGoutreach on reddit for many good guides, even though sometimes you need a salt filter in there, this is normal, and there are good people that simply will help you for nothing. If you want fierce competition and are willing to put in time, the competitive scene is pretty serious, you can get lost in tactics and builds and, well all the things.......\n\none thing, always have fun when you play, try new things, run through the new tutorials, they are very good! play the trial mechs, they arent bad. You will start with others who have not played vis a vis the newish tier system implemented, you start at tier 5 and walk your way up to tier 1, tier 1 is pretty broad in scope, but be ready to play if you get there!!! some people do not miss, almost ever :) take your time in tier 5 and see what you like to do, shoot some stompy robots.\n\nIf you see me in game, say Hi, my in game name is the same as here, and I will be happy to help however I can.\n\ncome play my favorite game of all time, you might get hooked, you might hate it :) but it's free so why would you not try, I bet most will like it, who does not want to shoot giant stompy robots after all :)\n\nNever mind the occasional jerk in game, rats gonna rat, ask questions, have fun...","December 16, 2015","true","498.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

It is possible to play the game entirely free, but it will take some grinding to get enough to in-game currency to purchase more 'Mechs. There are frequent weekend challenges that give extra content for doing well in different game modes, and the devs. are hard at work building more game modes for release in spring of 2016.

The grind in-game isn't as bad as it used to be. You can now gain in-game currency at a reasonable rate whether you do well or not. There is some content that's locked behind a paywall. There's some stuff you can purchase with the premium currency (MC) and some stuff you can purchase with cash directly from the mwomercs.com website.The premium currency stuff is mostly cosmetics. You can purchase mechs and stuff with the premium currency, but that's a waste. There are some premium only mechs with unique hardpoint configurations.Thankfully, PGI is rather generous, as there are ways to gather the premium currency in-game. As for the direct cash purchase items, they are typical pre-order mechs that'll eventually get released for\npurchase via the in-game currency. Some of them have special stuff that's exclusive to the purchase, so if you're a sucker for some of those aesthetics, feel free to purchase?\n\n- Gameplay -\nAs for the gameplay, its a more tactical shooter, with a simulation game feel. It significantly slower than most shooters in the market, so don't try to play it like those other games. You get to pilot some stompy robots and shoot some lasers, ballistics, missiles and stuff at each other. And you get to fully customize their loadouts and such. It's rather entertaining.\nThere are 4 weight classes of mechs you get to pick from. Lights: Played fast and twitchy. They typically have little armor and weaponry, but they get to run all over and wreck heavier mechs in various situations. If you have a twitch shooter background, playing lights may help you ease into the game. Mediums: Relatively nimble and armed. I recommend playing mediums if you have no clue where to start. They have enough tools to show you the range of what mechs can do. Heavys: Well armored and armed. Heavies are the bread and butter of the team, as they have the mobility and firepower to influence a match greatly. Most players play heavies for that purpose. Assaults: Heavily armored, and armed to the teeth. Playing a assault makes you a walking turret. You're supposed to tank damage and push for your team, as most players will follow you. If you get cold feet or are indecisive, don't play an assault. There's a ridiculous amount of awareness you need to play an assault well.\n\n- Learning Curve -\nThe learning curve is steep. There are a ridiculous number of mechanics to keep note of. And a lot of them aren't explained at all in the game. I could type endlessly about it and probably not cover it all. But thankfully, there are various external informational outlets you can find to tell you about those. But for the most part, there's a lot to take in. So don't be intimidated by that fact. Just play and learn from your mistakes. Also, big tip: use the minimap and don't use 3rd-person view.\n\nGive the game a shot, its a genre that's been overshadowed, and who doesn't like robots?\n\nAlso on a side note: PGI has done some shady stuff, so keep note of that if anything seems to be going south.","December 21, 2015","true","384.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

If I didnt recomend this game, I would feel bad for the last 3 years :P\n\nPro's\n\nThe mech's look amazing, and allot of the graphics are pritty good\n\nPGI has really stepped up their game in map design, and allot of the new maps have depth.\n\nThe difference in playstyles of each mec can be vastly different, be it light, med, heavy, or assault.\n\nNot all mechs are viable but allot of them are, so there isnt one or two mech's that are the best.\nI\nf you get onto a decent team, you will have alot of fun, dosnt matter if you want to do compeditive or just tool around in community warfare.\n\nIf you played WoT(World of Tanks) you will have a one up in this game being that they are very close in play style and form.\n\nCons:\nThe hitreg varies between the different weapons and is infuriating. Some times your damage numbers reflect exactly the work you put in, then other times it dosnt and then some time you get no hitreg and you dont even effect you target by shooting him/her...it. It is theorized that if you can have a ping of 120 consitantly you are in the sweet spot and your hitreg will be perfect, and that if you have a stable ping that dosnt vary allot, it will be even better.\n\nThe balancing of the game by PGI is real, they over balence them to try and make every weapon viable and nerf mechs just to make them less usefull, instead of realizing that they are only balancing the game into frustration.\n\nThe new player experience is very difficult. Most of us have been playing for several years, as such we have become really good at the game, figured out what mechs we are good at and are up on the current meta. new players arnt, and often get frustrated because the biggest and baddest mechs arnt nessessarly the best. once they figure that out, most of them have already sunk allot of cbills into bad mechs. Also the learning curve can be brutal and unforgiving, between knowing where to go on the map, to just maneuvering around in your mech.\n\nSticky walls that break your legs, and small rocks that keep your 100 ton mec from moving are just some of the frustrating things that can run you away from this game. It dosnt happen as often as it used to, but it still happens.\n\nFinnaly the community, this community is the most loyal, and at the same time can be the most hateful. There have been and are allot to trolls, at the same time, a game can be won and lost by one person doing somthing really stupid. This is a team game, not a single player game, and is much more unforgiving than all other shooters. Your teamates rely on you not doing stupid things and staying with the team.\n\n","December 13, 2015","true","332.9"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

You dare refuse my Batchal?!\n\nI've been playing MechWarrior Online since open Beta (August 2013) and the road has been a bumpy one since the original release. Though, it has come a long way in terms of user friendlyness and content. It's at the point between "it could be better" and "just right" for a multiplayer only game.\n\nMWO was once only 8 versus 8 deathmatch early in development, then became 12 vs. 12 with team play queue. Now, we have tutorials, ease of 'Mech customization, and Community Warfare (still in Beta, but can participate to gain the highest rewards) with more in production. So, content is slowly being added, but the speed of release can be a turn off to some. There are plans for PvE, co-op, and smaller 4 vs. 4 events in 2016.\n\nThis is a fun game if you do not take it seriously and would rather role-play a Clammer (Clan pilot) with 11 other drunk, uncoordinated players. The PuG games will make you rage quit if you have a nack for skill and winning, so it is wise to pick up a team or join a faction and use TeamSpeak/Ventrillo to better your chances and reap greater rewards.\n\nI recommend this game to any true die-hard MechWarrior fan, as it is the only MW game availalbe (until Hairbrain Scheme's BattleTech in 2017) that has a resemblence of MW4's multiplayer. It's still a decent simulator/shooter despite most of its flaws.\n\nMWO is one of those games you can splurge for a month, drop it for a while, and come back and enjoy relearning after some major content patches. It's easy to pick up for the price of free-to-play.\n\nHowever, MWO does suffer from poor optimization with many players crashing and disconnecting at the beginning or mid match, which is another off-putting minus to the game. Especialy, since loosing an Assault in a critical point can make battle exchanges lopsided before they rejoin.\n\nI hope to see some of you on the battlefield and as they say: "Die well" (because you will die a lot).","December 13, 2015","true","138.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

This is a thinking man's shooter; if you want to mindlessly kill things without any real skill involved, CoD is probably more up your ally.  Basically, you play a big ♥♥♥ stompy robot, loaded for bare and ready to ♥♥♥♥ up the nearest scrub to cross your path.  Think Gundam.\n\nThere are 4 mech weight classes in the game, Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault.  There are many mechs of each weight class, just pick one that fits your playstyle.  Each weight class has a different purpose.\n\nLights act as nimble scouts/Assault killers/Fire support.  Lights are typically fast moving, highly mobile, low damage mechs.  GOTTA GO FAST!!!!\n\nMediums act as nimble fire support.  Mediums have a nice balance of weapons and speed to out manouver your enemies while still putting decent fire down range.\n\nHeavies are your fairly hard to kill well armed mechs.  Heavies act as moderately mobile weapon platforms that you dont want to get in front of in a light.\n\nAssaults are your heavily armored slow moving death machines that can kill you in a couple volleys, but get shreaded if a light gets behind them.\n\nPick a mech and and stick to your team like a sad lost puppy (especially if your buddies are bigger than you, give those ♥♥♥♥ers a hug).  If you're in a light/medium, use your heavy/assault buddies as human shields while plinking the enemies in their weak points (which vary).  Shoot anything that gets near your heavy/assault buddy  If you're in a heavy/assault, pick the nearest/most damaged enemy mech and pull all your triggers (plural ♥♥♥♥ing triggers).\n\nWhen you shoot, your weapons ganerate heat (IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE!).  Therefore you have to watch your heat generation and not just mindlessly fire your weapons into the abyss, you'll overheat.  Much like a computer when it overheats, you shut-the-♥♥♥♥ down, and damage your internal componets, leaving you vulnerable to enemy fire (as you cant dodge/shield the damage).  So, check yourself before you wreck yourself.  Lasers generate a lot of heat, but have infinite ammo.  Missiles generate moderate heat, but have limited ammo.  Ballistics generate low heat, but have very limited ammo.\n\n\n\nCredentials:  I'm a veteran player (since beta) and I love this game from a PvP persepctive, it forces team cohesion and team play.  I almost always have a good time, even in defeat.  I have 1749 games on record (quick play games, not CW), given that ever match is about 10 minutes, that's 291 hours on record (just in match time, double/tripple that time if you count the time i've spent in the mechlab and CW).\n\nThis game used to take a bit of a beefy computer.  Optimization has improved tremendously in the past couple years.  I wasn't able to play much in beta or through initial release due to having a crappy PC, but i got a new computer about a year and a half ago and picked the game back up.  I was amazed by all the improvements made to the game in the time i was away, and I've been playing since.\n\nThe game has improved EXPONENTIALY since initial release, and it's only getting better since the Steam release.  Give it a shot, it just takes a few minutes and a little bandwith.\n\nThis game's community is phenominal, if you want to learn something, go check out some of the streamers or youtubers, especially NGNG (No Guts, No Galaxy).  If you have any questions about anything, multiple people will be happy to answer you in detail.  NGNG is the largest group of MWO content producers.

They often do charity streams and giveaways as good human beings.\n\nIf you want mech builds, check out: http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/ There is a ton of info there for building your mechs for success.\n\nIf lore is your fix, check out the wiki for everything battletech: http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Main_Page\n\nShort explanation of some bad reviews:  Lots of the bad reviews come from unfulfilled promised of what the game was supposed to be.  The old publisher IGP (Infinite Game Publishing) was ruining what the devs PGI (Piranha Games Incorporated) was setting out to do.  This caused IGP to see the game as a flop and return the game rights to PGI.  Many of this game's founders and vereran players felt wronged by some of the actions forced upon PGI via IGP.  Since PGI broke away from IGP, the geme has been on an upward spiral in every respect.  IGP was a group of money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that wanted a flow of income from the game they had the rights to (to an extreme degree).  Many people are still butthurt over these things.\n\nIntense Con:  Mechs are expencive with IRL money, keep in mind, this is a small developer making a very high quality game, and they have to eat too  (plus the Mechwarrior Community is a niche with many whales who will throw money at a develpower willing to make a game in the nearly dead franchise)\n\nPotential Pros:  With the influx of new players from the Steam release, prices of things in game (IRL money) may become cheaper due to the larger player base.\n\nPGI has hired many more people to work on the game (i caught this bit of info from on of the devs in a twitch stream chat)\n\nThe free to play model is actually not too bad, with 16 trial mechs each on rotation (that actually have good loadouts).  Back in beta, and early release, there were only 4 trial mechs with garbage ♥♥♥ loadouts.\n\nYou don't need to put any money into this game to have a good time, but hell, if you find that you're having lots of fun just with the trial mechs, toss $20 at the game, and get a mech or two.  If you enjoyed the game for many hours already, it's probably worth atleast a couple dollars.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:  New players, give it a shot, it's free.  Old players, give it another shot, it WILL surprise you with all the improvements made since beta.\n\nEdit:  I will happily answer any questions if it is not within my review, just leave a comment and i'll do my best to get back to you ASAP (assuming the question is something i can answer).","December 18, 2015","true","118.1"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

I really do like it. It is not a perfect game, but it is pretty good fun. While it may seem kind of expensive for some 'mechs, the truth is you can use the free 'mechs you get and still do very well. The only real thing you would want to buy is more slots for 'mechs.\n\nThe devs make consistent updates to the game every 2 weeks on Tuesday, usually consisting of balance tweaks and bugfixes. We are supposed to be getting a fairly large addition of content in the form of a "Phase III" for the Community Warfare aspect of the game in the near future. There are new 'mechs added regularly, and they have been doing a pretty good job recently of making them moderately balanced against each other.\n\nAs far as the grind goes, it recently got much better. The in-game currency earn rate was increased by a pretty significant amount, which means less time spent to buy a new 'mech. There are also very regular events during the weekend where you can get a good chunk of premium and in-game currency, and somtimes even new 'mechs or mechbays.\n\nThis game looks pretty good graphically, though if you look too close some of the textures are a bit low res. It is running in Cryengine, so the optimization is iffy at times. You may need a pretty good machine to run with all the bells and whistles, and even then probably won't want to run things like particles too high, as that can cause FPS dips. The 'mechs are mostly well modeled, and look good. There is the occasional low res texture on a 'mech, however.\n\nPROS:\n-Can do good as a pure F2P player\n-Grind is not so bad anymore\n-Core Gameplay is pretty solid\n-Constant in-game events\nNEUTRAL\n-Need to spend money on mechbays in order to build up a large stable of custom 'mechs\n-Pretty steep learning curve\nCONS\n-Runs a little bad on older machines\n-Not too much mode variety currently\n-Textures bad in some spots","December 10, 2015","true","291.9"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","16","31","0","0"

They made mistakes in their communication with the playerbase. There is a vocal part of the (former) community which is "very" disgruntled over these mistakes (and decisions they didn't like), so take reviews with a grain of salt. When reading reviews or discussions be aware that there are some guys on a crusade to make this game fail. Furthermore many guys are wearing the thickest rose-tinted nostalgia glasses I have ever seen in any game series (regarding previous Mechwarrior games).\n\nI'm recommending this game. It isn't perfect, but it is better than many games on the F2P market. Take it for what it is: a tactical, slow paced, vehicle combat arena shooter. As of now, it doesn't have an evolving endgame, but Community Warfare Phase 3 has recently been announced to be released around spring 2016, which looks like it will add long term goals.\n\nThe game always had balance issues to some extents, but since the last balance overhaul it's the best it has ever been. The devs recently fixed some issues that plagued the game for a long time, and the overall state of the game is better than ever.\n\nPros:\n\n- The core gameplay (mech combat) is really good, probably best of any Mechwarrior title\n- Lots of customization\n- All mech classes play differently but fun\n- IT IS NOT P2W\n- Graphics are above average for a F2P game\n- You can play this game without ever spending money (mechbays can be obtained in CW)\n- Devs frequently give away ingame and real money currency through events\n- Overall a really good community\n\nMixed:\n- The maps swing between really good and bad\n- Balance still not where it could be\n- Game is not easy to learn\n- It seems to be pretty grindy in the beginning but it gets alot less once you understand the game better\n\nCons:\n\n- Community has some self-proclaimed gamedesigners who depreciate all but their own opinion and constantly bash the devs for not designing the game after their (often terrible) ideas\n- Community Warfare is not where it should be\n- Prices are pretty high (don't buy at full price, there are plenty of sales)\n- Game is not optimized well (hardware)\n- The 3 gamemodes in quickplay play pretty similar\n\nVerdict:\nTry it, it's free. If you are looking for rock solid mech combat, this is your game.  You currently won't find a better one. Don't decide based on reviews, give it a shot.\n\nPs: Don't buy stuff without reading a guide or asking the forum. You "really" don't want to waste  your cadet bonus on things you don't need.","December 13, 2015","true","185.5"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","23","45","2","0"

It hits the rarely achieved sweet spot between first-person twitch gameplay and methodical strategy, combining extremely deep customization of beautifully brutal war machines with intense moment-to-moment combat. The pace of battle is somewhat less than the warp speed found in most first person shooters, allowing the player's tactical awareness and strategic creativity to come to the fore, in contrast to other games where raw reaction speed is king.\n\nThis more thoughtful pacing is consistent with the game's stylistic choices as well, which hew to a more traditionally "western" aesthetic of plausible tank-like distopian death machines stomping across war torn cityscapes and dangerous alien worlds, in contrast to the glut of "Japanese" style lithe robots that dance across most videogames today.\n\nThe game's free-to-play economy has gone through various permutations before appearing here on steam, but has settled into a comfortable place, providing adequate resources to free players in normal play, along with increasingly generous special event prizes most weekends that prevent any "pay to win" problems. Additionally, they have reduced "XP" requirements to narrow the gap between old-hands and neophytes, making this the best time for a new player to enter the arena since it's original closed beta launch. While the enormous variety of potential player customization makes balance devilishly tricky, the developers have consistently improved it over time, and managed to move it to a remarkably tight band that permits significant variety of viable playstyles.\n\nIn sum, I give this game my highest endorsement, I have been playing it since closed beta and it is undoubtedly the strongest it has ever been.","December 10, 2015","true","2.8"," 29 of 57 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","29","57","0","1"

It kinda a bit in common with Battlefront and the developer is almost as greedy as EA. Great graphics with zero depth. it even has it's own version of EA style DLC  , you see, every time they add a new mechpack (at a glacial pace) they are first sold for real currency (for the price of a triple A game mind you 60+ USD) , then in game premium currency then you can finally buy it with regular credits after half a year.) this game is lucky it's the only Mechwarrior sim at the moment and they're squeezing us for every penny. Queue times are long for random battles and MM sometimes has a brainfart and gives one team a significant tonnage advantage. there also aren't many maps and the level of content you get for your money is very low. Playing random battles can be confusing for new players and can get stale fast , the tutorial only covers the very basics and the game has a steep learning curve so new players will not know how to make the best builds and will get outgunned by players running metabuilds. the only thing that keeps me playing is Community Warfare which is a competative mode where player clans join factions from the lore and fight against each other for planets and ultimately control of the Inner Sphere.  to sum this up i would not say this is a good game, with about 3 years of being online the amount this game developed is pretty pathetic especially when you see what kind of prices they charge for content. I'd only recommend this game if you're a diehard fan who can join a clan and i would urge you to seriously consider if you want to shell out the price of a triple A game for a couple of mechs.","December 10, 2015","false","334.3"," 51 of 101 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","51","101","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninja_den/recommended/342200/","ninja_den","BOT Faith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninja_den/","101 products in account","Let's start simple. Try the game for yourself. I can only tell you that my experience with this game since 2012 has been good. That is my experience alone but you can make up your mind by trying it yourself.\n\nPlay the 25 matches for the in game currency to see if you truly like the game or not.\n\n_______\n\nLet's break this down into several components. Gameplay, UI, Graphics, Content, End Game.\n\nGameplay 8/10:\nThis game down to its core is a very fun game when you play it and learn it. Its an action shooter but it doesn't have the cartoon speed of some other FPS where you die after stubbing your toe on a bullet. No you can take a hit and if you are smart can survive for as long as you can. There's a sense of tactics in there somewhere. It's knowing when to attack, when to retreat, when to work with your team. You don't just run and gun and respawn.\n\nThat is just half the game to launch into a match though. The second half is to make and create your own mech builds. To be able to tinker and change a chassis to how you want to play and not some stock loadout. To own and change every mech that you can get. To collect and master all the mechs you want provided you get the mechbays you need.\n\nIt isn't perfect, balance could be better in regards to lesser used weapons. There could be more balance between the two major 'Factions' the Clans and the Inner Sphere.\n\nOverall it feels like a fun game to play,\n\nUI 7/10:\nThe first incarnation was terrible, the second incarnation horrific, and now we have this current '2.5' UI that has honestly been a success. There's a lot of clicking but in comparison to other games like say Armoured Warfare it isn't actually as bad as it use to be. A lot of information that needs to be presented to you is but there is room for improvement which will come.\n\nWhat the game needs? UI Tooltips when you work in the Mechlab. UI for Mech Modules (Extra addons for mechs), and just quality of life improvements.\n\nOverall the UI is not special but its not terrible.\n\nGraphics 8/10:\nMechwarrior: Online is showing its age. It runs on a outdated engine that has high demands for less gains. We've seen the power and scale of CryEngine 3 as a FPS but it demands much more when you see 12 vs 12 Giant mechs that take up a lot more power to render. The graphics are however still quite amazing. The visuals of seeing your lasers, cannons, and missiles fire is amazing. You won't be disappointed by all the effects.\n\nHowever you would want optimizations out of this game. It definitely needs to be optimized across the board.\n\nOverall its a great visual overall but it isn't the type of visuals you would expect from some triple AAA title which you shouldn't anyways.\n\nContent 8/10:\nIn my opinion the story is not rich but the lore behind it is. It leads into having a lot of room for content in the future. It already has hundreds of mechs to choose from which is the meat of the content. There's so much room for variety that it provides so much content already. Could it have more than just mechs? Yes.\n\nI want to see more than just PvP Matches. It lacks in content that isn't just PvP.\n\nOverall its still good but that leads into the last component.\n\nEnd Game 5/10:\nThe end game is unfinished. Plain and Simple it is not done. It is an interesting Idea of a moving world but it just seems like a map and place to fight right now.\n\nThe future looks bright for it with new modes of play, the ability to use guild/faction/unit money to buy things with but its not there yet.\n_________\n\nOverall this game is 7.5/10 until more patches come out. I have some faith but it needs to be proven at this point.","December 10, 2015","true","147.1"," 55 of 109 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","55","109","2","0"

What more do you need?\n\nFair warning: the new player learning curve in this game is steep. Like 90 degree steep. Do yourself a favor and DO THE TUTORIALS. Run them until you're very familiar with how to handle yourself. You don't want to start a match off and get stuck running into a wall, getting you butt shott off, because you don't know to move your legs independantly from your torso.\n\nOnce you've mastered the basics then hop in and get ready to be shot up to pieces. You're probably going to lose right away - or at least get blasted pretty quick. Like I said, the learning curve is a wall. But if you can push through your initial deathfest and learn a few things in the process you might just have what it takes to start racking up the kills yourself.\n\nThis game is also F2P, and as far as free-to-play games go this one is pretty forgiving. The ONLY things you cannot purchase with game-grinded monies are additional mech bays (you start with 4), and Hero Mechs (honestly, nothing special. Just different varients of a chassis, none of which are amazing.) However, between monthly (or bi-monthly) events, contests, competitions and whatnot you can earn premium moneyz to buy those things, or earn them outright. So yeah. It's pretty forgiving.\n\nThat all said, I've spent over $200 on this "free" game. FML.","February 14","true","118.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even though the first mech combat game I played religiously was HAWKEN and FromSoftware's Armored Core series, I needed something more realistic.  That was when I stumbled upon MechWarrior Online.  Set in the BattleTech universe, MWO allows you to enter the BattleTech universe and fight in the Clan Invasion of the 31st Century.  It took me a while to learn the ropes, and now, I'm ready to post a review about it.\n\nTHE PROS:+Community Warfare, where you can pick one of the many factions of the Battletech universe, and fight against other factions.  This mode was the most enjoyable one for me, since it led to the most intense and team-driven battles at times.\n+Excellent customization.  You can swap weapons, add heat sinks, and adjust armor on your mech, and it's only limited by the maximum weight of your mech (and your in-game credits which you earn from battles, of course!).\n+The damage system.  If your mech takes too much damage to the arm, it might lose the arm, and the weapons attached to it.  If your mech's leg becomes too damaged, you move at a slower pace.  If you lose both legs, the torso or get hit in the cockpit, your mech is destroyed.  This, in my opinion, is much better than having a health bar, seeing how it makes it much more intense.\n\nTHE CONS:-It has a learning curve.  If you're looking for something to play casually, than this isn't really going to be your first choice.  You have to manage heat and ammunition in battle, as well as watching your damage, which can make the game difficult to learn.\n-Getting new mechs takes a while.  Mechs cost millions of in-game credits, and you only earn 100 thousand or so per match, so it may take a while unless you're willing to pay real money, or sell off one of your mechs.  I wouldn't consider this a pay-to-win game though, because you can certainly get a mech by earning in-game currency, however, it may take some time before you can get a high-end one.\n\nFINAL RATING: 3.5/5\nIf you're looking for a good mech combat game, this is worth a try.","February 21","true","32.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't like FPS games in general. Hey - come to think of it, I barely like any games.\nBut, I like this one. I've played it for nearly two years, practically every day.\nTwo reasons:\n\n1) You are part of a team.\nSometime your team is a blessing, sometime it's a curse. The game is unforgiving and does not keep tabs - make the wrong choice of 'mech or loadout, forget about where the team is and what they're doing, play in a match of random players doing all kinds of funny (bad) stuff - one misstake (yours or a team mate's) and you're out.

It also is better than previous titles at other things. The last year, I've seen improvements in development I never would have thought possible when I started playing.

Very deep and rewarding mech game. It has the right mix of sim/fps/team tactics. It also stays true enough to battle tech to keep it interesting and nostalgic.\n\nThis game is not perfect but it is super fun and it's not impossible to play for years without spending any money.  It does have a pretty expensive pay for convenience and early access system. These do not break the game balance as PGI is mindful to avoid pay to win. Speaking of balance, the game is a modders dream so balance is hard and constant. Lately PGI has done better responding to balance changes and issues.\n\nIn short this game is my favorite game I currently play and worth a few weeks try to see if you like it. It's free so try it.

This is much more of a simulation experience and not a FPS - in the style of something like Elite: Dangerous or World of Tanks. It has a slow, deliberate pace focusing on the strength of the unit and not the individual.\n\nIt's deep and complex but once you buy and outfit your first mech (which can be done straight away) you absolutely can compete with those who have been playing since the beta. A few novice light mechs can take down or disable any Behemoth, if they work together and target the right areas.\n\nIf you're a big badass robot fan like me who was really skeptical about about Mechwarrior Online, now's the time to give it a try. It's not perfect and the interface is pretty clunky but on the battlefield, where it counts, Mechwarrior Online is the game we all remember.","December 17, 2015","true","5.5"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

I know quite abit about lore, the mechwarrior series and battletech.\nAt first I wasnt much into MWO though. But I kept casually playing the game because I liked the mech combat.\nI can tell you the game has improved much over time and PGI keeps going.\n\nOverall what I like most about this game is the customization in the mechlab. You can spend hours thinking about possible builds and how they might work out in the game, then go for a test run just to be back in the mechlab after 1 game.\nMany possiblitites to play the game and pretty much any mech is viable depending on your piloting skills.\n\nIf I should point out a negative it would be that balance is still shifting. Considering the amount of mechs and weapons though that shouldnt be too surprising and currently MWO is in its most balanced state. All weapons, with exception to flamers and maybe MG, have a role in the game. I think its up to  you to find out what mech and weapon you think might suit your style.\n\nThis game is far from perfect but it has a caring community and developers willing to listen to its community (which has led to some people even thinking they listen too much to us...). Great gameplay and options for most play styles and the design of the mechs kept me hooked onto to game, so I suggest that everyone can give this game a shot, its f2p afterall.","January 16","true","211.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Playing Quick Play over and over again to work out your masteries on a chosen 'Mech is just fun.  Your first 20 matches gives you an insane amount of money to buy just about any 'Mech you want, and depending on what class and chassis you pick, you can even get your three variants to achieve mastery.\n\nHere's how not "grindy" the grind is: I played my first 17 hours and bought three heavy 'Mech variants, and achieved mastery of them without getting bored at all.  In fact, every match that I start, every time I click Quick Play, every time the oh-so-familiar 'Mech computer says "weapons online, sensors online, all systems nominal" I get goosebumps like I'm that kid I was back in 1995 when I first played MechWarrior 2, or when I saved my lunch money instead of buying lunch in middle school so that I could buy MechWarrior 4 in 2000.\n\nThere is near limitless fun you can have just jumping in with Quick Play without ever giving PGI a dime.  Seriously there is not any reason someone who casually wants to shoot big robots in a walking tank would need to spend money.  But once you start finding yourself reading guides, learning strategies, working through your masteries on your first three 'Mechs, something will change.  You'll probably buy a 'Mech bundle, which somehow feels ok, it feels like an even trade, you won't look at your bank account and cringe at that impulse buy for a f2p title and you'll probably get more hours of enjoyment out of those three+ 'Mechs than you would from most $20 title on Steam.\n\nPlay this game and:\n-you will become a MechWarrior, when you see the animation of your character booting up the 'Mechs systems and jiggling the controls, you will be transported to that cockpit and your chair is now the pilot's seat\n-you will call out contacts as they appear on the map, you will work together with your lancemates to flank and confuse and split up the enemy forces\n-you will turn your head and cringe when you hear "warning incoming missles"\n-you will cheer and sound crazy to the people around you when you kill an assault 'Mech while you are piloting a medium or light\n-you will be late to work and you will lose sleep\n-you will see lasers converging on a point when you close your eyes","January 17","true","213.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I've also purchased every top package for MechWarrior Online from Legendary Founders through the latest unseen mechs and have probably sunk about 300+ hours of play time into this title before the steam launch and have been playing since beta.\n\nOk, on to the review: MechWarrior Online has had it's rough points in the past and it's still not entiely perfect.  The graphics aren't mind blowing.  The in game music basically has to be supplied by you running an old mechwarrior OST in the background.  The camos and paints are overpriced.  The cockpit items are cheesy and borerline immersion breaking.  The UI is inherently flawed.  The gameplay can be repetitive on certain maps.  The default keys and some of the game options are questionable.  Some of the warhorns can be headache inducing.  And the power level difference from a new mech to a "mastered" mech with modules and a custom build is a vast bottomless chasm.\n\nHowever, it is fun.  The community is fantastic.  The in game chat is professional.  The devs do listen and are trying.  The redone maps are fantastic.  The selection of mechs is excellent.  The weapon and chassis balance is a lot better than it used to be.  The customisation is awesome.  The gameplay is tactical and skill based.  And finally the feeling you get from coring a mech with your last salvo while limping and with only one arm barely hanging on is unparalleled.  I have experienced some of my favourite gaming memories from this title and I don't regret a moment of it.\n\nI have no doubt there are both positive and negative points about this title that I've failed to mention, hell, there's probably things I have never encountered having not played through the "new player" or f2p experience.  But I've had fun with it and if you're a fan of Battletech or of giant stompy robots in general then I'm sure you will too.\n\nOne more thing, if you're just getting into the game here are some basic tips:  Fight from the cockpit, unlock your arms, torso twist when you're reloading, use double heat sinks, assign left click = left arm, right click = right arm, side mouse buttons = torso weapons, press R to lock target, remap shift to full zoom, set your FOV to 0.75, concentrate fire, stick with the team and watch your heat.\n\nWith that all said, I hope you found this at least a little informative and it helps you out with deciding whether or not this is the game for you.\n\nGood luck, Mechwarriors.","January 31","true","49.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Man, this game is the mech simulator where you can pilot the robot and use weapons wisely, because they're limited. Like HAWKEN, mechs are shown in 4 classes: Light, Medium, Heavy and Assault (HAWKEN has only 3 classes). However, unlike HAWKEN, the mechs have the height differences depending on classes. Trial mechs are usable, but you can't modify them (like in HAWKEN again). You can buy mechs and modify by replacing lasers, SRMs, LRMs and stuff. Also, unlike HAWKEN, you can upgrade your pilot skills beside mech skills. In Faction Play you can join the faction you want to. You can get along with your faction to attack or defend the planet from occupying factions. About mech cosmetics, it needs MC (MechWarrior Credits) which you can get by real money. The game is hard and challenging, the starters with no skills will get killed easily, but challenge excites you, right? ;) I will recommend this game for those who really want to pilot the real mechs.

Namely the fact that you can never lose more money than you make im a battle, allowing players to play how they wish knowing they will progress positively after the match. Recieving 12 trial mechs is also nice.\n\nMy only possible complaint is that the game can be grindy to make credits, unless you buy a good money making mech or have premium.

And to be honest, i still feel like i could lose interest any time now.\n\nFor better or worse, this is not a direct port of TT.  To be hoenst TT had some mechanics in it that were just not suited to real time simulation.\n\nPROS\nThe mech models are really good.  There are some technical issues with some models (hit boxes, scaling), but i think that on the whole, the mech models are in good shape.\n\nWe got the Unseen showing up.  While the mech modles are altered, they are still immediately recognizeable.\n\nMost of the weapon and component implementations make sense when ported over from TT\n\nCommunity is generally less toxic than most others (That said, this is a team-based game and people do ge frustrated when people ignore attempts to organize in match)\n\nThe number of mechs now available makes it less likey that during drops (at least in the lower 3 tiers) you will encounter  cookie-cutter meta teams.\n\nCONS\n\nBallistic weapons aer still just a hair to accurate.  While rounds drop in flight, they don't really seem to deviate in any other way.\n\nSome of the weapon conversions are just badly implemented:  A 5 second cool down on gauss rifles, then charge time before you can fire, which really adds up to a double-lencgth cooldown\n\nClan implementation was just baddly handled, and it still causes gameplay and balance problems\n\nGameplay/Mech balance issues can take some time resolve, and are sometimes knee-jerk reactions (Ask a veteran about tackling)\n\nCommunity Warfare just isn't ready yet.\n\n\nAll in all, despite having some issues, the game does have promise, and is fun most of the time.  There are some changes coming up in the immediate future that address some of the outstanding issue and open up more content for Community Warfare.\n\nSo with all of that, for now, yes, I'd reccomend it, because you can get damn near everything out of the game without spending any money, though obviously people who spend the money get access to new chasis sooner.","January 31","true","652.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think I can honestly say it has delivered so far on most of my expectations.  There's still quite a bit more for me to do as I haven't even ventured into the Faction campaign part of the game.\n\nTo start at the beginning, this game appears to actually be free to play.  I have yet to run into anything other than a few mech variants and some minor cosmetic stuff that requires real money to acquire.  The game is still completely playable without paying a cent however.\n\nThe sheer number of mechs to choose from is excellent.  And, I hear new ones are added regularly as well.  There are several variants of each mech, allowing you to choose one that suits your play style.  And if you can't find one that is quite perfect, then you have the option to purchase and then customize one.  The customization options are absolutely excellent giving anyone the ability to tweak and change their mech to their liking.  The only thing to realize is that there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to the different mech variants and their different hard point configurations when mounting weapons.\n\nMatches are typically fast paced and engaging.  The maps are detailed and quite well designed (well, most of them).  Each one contains a lot of neat features to provide cover or execute complex tactical maneuvers.  I've only been caught in a few matches where things seem to drag on and on, but thankfully each match has a time limit.\n\nAnd I must say, this is so far, the first MMO I have played with a focus on PvP where the userbase isn't a bunch of angry teenagers foaming at the mouth whenever someone steps one foot out of place or not using some specific mech type or weapon type, etc.  I think I may have encountered maybe one, possibly two players that felt it necessary to add snarky parting remarks as they left the match after the team lost, but out of around 100 matches so far, and with exposure to hundreds of other players, I think 2 are tollerable.  At least in the quick matches, I have yet to feel the same vitriol as when I would PvP in games like WoW or Rift.\n\nAll in all I'm pretty excited by this game and look forward to the parts that I still have yet to play.  A big thumbs up from me!\n\nEDIT:  So here I am about a month later and I still haven't participated in Community Warfare.  Quick matches are still quite a lot of fun as there are a lot of different mechs to try, not to mention all of the possible variations of each one to test.  Besides, I'm hearing that Community Warfare isn't very PUG friendly and many times skill really matters (it's not that I don't think I have the skill.... I doubt that others do in a PUG).  I suppose that would be my one complaint about the game so far is that Community Warfare isn't very friendly to solo players.  I know I'm inviting the wrath of the MWO veterans when I say that, but my only response to those individuals is that times are changing, the game is on Steam now where there is a large population of solo/casual players, and anything PGI could do to make the ENTIRE game available to those players would probably be in their best interests.  This, considering they came to Steam to increase the user base to begin with.","January 25","true","344.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I found out no MW4 Vengeance around anymore so I read somewhere there was a MW ONLINE and then researched and did a very scientific survey - nah, just kidding - no survey but i really got excited and tried it out - Failed so badly that i tried more and more and after a couple of months MWO was my thing.

For close two and half years, PGI struggled under the yoke of Infinite Game Publishing, And much to Russ Bullock and Company's credit, they have done a superb job. By first, buying themselves out from under IGP and going on their own. It's Piranha Games is a small company with little or no experience, and for most companies, that's a death's knell. Most would close their doors and fade off into the gaming world sunset, but PGI has prevailed.\n\nMechWarrior has a long standing tradition of rich gameplay and diverse community. Small that it may be, but even the smallest game can be the biggest of giants. And MechWarrior is no exception. I can still recall playing NetMech and going head to head with people using a dial up internet system, where the computers were as big as coffee table books and games were played from a Floppy disc. Yes, it shows my age, but still I have played this game since that time and its many titles: MechWarrior 2, MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries, and MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bears Legacy; MechWarrior 3 and MechWarrior 3: Pirates Moon; MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, Black Knight and Mercenaries, and now a total, but competely new version of the Franchise- MechWarrior Online.\n\nI have loved this game since I first played the Table top version, where I chose the BattleMaster to play with using nothing but dice and paper and paperboard cutouts to simulate warfare in the 31st Century. Too many times in the past with those that I mentioned above I wondered. . . when? When will I see those legends again: the Marauder, Archer, WarHammer, Rifleman, Stinger, Wasp, my BattleMaster, my Executioner [Gladiator]. When will they return? My faith in both Russ and PGI as well as patience has paid off.\n\nThe Legends are returning, first with Project Phoenix `Mech Package, consisting of: BattleMaster, Thunderbolt, Griffin, Wolverine, Locust, and Shadow Hawk have returned to the honored faithful, and soon, the other legends of the BattleTech World will make their debut. The Marauder released on Dec. 1, has become a steady favorite to the new players. The WarHammer will see its release on January 16th, and the Rifleman will soon follow it on Feb. 16, and the Archer is set for release some time in March [this is just a guess. Nothing is set as of my writing this review]/ But what a great time to join! Soon on Dec. 15th, Origins IIC package will see a full release of all four Clan Second-Line `Mechs: Highlander, Hunchback, Jenner and Orion `Mechs, will be getting the Clan Treatment. How can one not want to join?! I ask this time and time again.\n\nAs for those out there whom have said that MechWarrior is a dying game. One might want to rethink that. For no one person can foresee the future, and tell the demise of another. MechWarrior will come to its end when the time and effort have all but gone. When that will be is anyone's guess. As for me, I will continue to play till time has called me to go home and leave this plane of existence.\n\nThere are many reasons in why someone would want to play this game. I'll start with these:\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nAs I said above, there are many games that come and go, and few stay the test of time. What sets them apart from those that do last a lifetime like MechWarrior, is the following they garner over that time. Thirty years is a long time for one game. And yes, it's a lifetime of years. And yet, with a Community like MechWarrior has, the game still exists. True. League of Legends, War Craft, Star Craft, and even EVEOnline have great communities, but none of them have garnered a lifetime of fans and player like MechWarrior. Except for Star Trek and Star Wars, both which have their fandom and support, they are the only games I know of that comes close, or even better than, MechWarrior. I'm not bad mouthing the game. Rather, I'm only comparing them to this game. Those games, War Craft/Star Craft, have only been around for a few years, and maybe more than ten at best. Star Wars, Star Trek, and MechWarrior have been around a lot longer, and all three have their fans to their credit. It would not suprise me in the least if Robotech jumped on board and entered the Online Gaming World. Cause like MechWarrior/BattleTech, and many know the history between the two properties, it too has a large majority of support.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nAnother reason for joining this: Customizing A Machine of War. Not many games have this ability, and many have tried to copy what MechWarrior has to offer when it comes to gigantic machines of war. And yet, they failed to live up to that promise. Think of it this way: if one has played BattleTech, then one will know where I coming from with this. No other game I know of allows for changing out weapons to fit ones play style or fits into their idea of fun. MechWarrior offers that. We all have our favorites, and mine I stated above. For the Inner Sphere: it's the BattleMaster. For the Clans: No doubt, the Gladiator. Between the two, the Gladiator affords me more of opportunity to make a machine that'll make Russ lose his knickers in a less than a heartbeat. True. I can switch weapons on the BattleMaster, but with Galdiator, aka Executioner, it gives me tens tons more and has a pod space of 26.5 tons. Which is not too shabby. I can make a war machine with Autocannons and Lasers.\n\nThat's makes this game so unique. It gives players a chance to make any combination of weapons, even with Meta builds, and then take said machine into the playing, and own or get owned by another with the same concept. Not many games I know of can do this, except EVEOnline, but it's not MechWarrior. True. EVEOnline offers the opportunity to make a machine of war. However, it's not a game of gigantic war machines with a massive chip on their shoulders looking to kick someone's metallic ♥♥♥♥ straight to hades and back again. If one wants to build a ship with long research and skill training over a long period of time. . . EVE Online is the game for that someone. If one wants to go out in a simulated blaze of glory and owning someone else's ♥♥♥♥ with a machine that has a massive chip on its shoulder. . . then one has found it in MechWarrior.\n\nPLAY ABILITY\n\nAs I said Before, not many games stand the test of time, and few have lasted as long as MechWarrior has. Not even World of Tanks can compare itself to MechWarrior. Even though, like MechWarrior, the game has the same play ability and fun aspect as MechWarrior, it can't allow one to customize a machine the way MechWarrior can. That's the attraction for this game is the play ability, and that lies in the means to make and change around the weapons to fit any and all situations that one may find themselves in. Sure EVE offers that, but going around space looking for action, mining one asteroid after another, researching and earning skills, and droning about from one of space to another, is not the same as MechWarrior.\n\nOnly MechWarrior offers the means to go and get into the action quickly, and yes, World of Tanks has this as well. Yet ask this: can you switch our a 122mm D-25T gun off an IS-3? Sure, but if one grinds the points necessary to get another gun. Here, one does not need to research anything or make a character, and go mine, build, and claim a part of space as their own. Or drive some tank into a battle and hope that one does better than the other players. Plus one does not need to use a Mod of any sort to become a better player.\n\nNow all I ask is this: what are you waiting for? JOIN UP. Make this legendary game come to life, and enjoy the time of playing a great and wholesome game.\n\nI am James Edward Crego, aka Hawk819 of the Second Federated Suns Armored Cavalry, and I and my unit, invite any and all players to join this game, and have a great time playing it. Take care, and Godspeed. <Salute>","December 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I enjoy the fact that the meta has shifted now and then, it makes me relearn various aspects. The mechbay and design of mechs, the optimizing of builds, understanding weapon ranges and timing, all of it is enjoyable. The marketing says thinking man's shooter. People that are not terrible at this game know that to be true. That said, there are plenty of dumbasses with terrible builds as well..\n\nThe cons? This game is developed by a small company. They have limited resources. Promised additions and fixes come slowly. They have to focus attention on money making content to keep their business open, and sometimes that trumps adding fun content like game modes or user interface improvements.\n\nThe neutral? Game balance has been a rocky road. The tabletop game this adapts was balanced in a way that didn't translate to a real time shooter. They have made slow akward attempts at balance, and the game is in a decent state at the moment. The developers of this game have been historically really bad at their own game, and hesitant to listen to the top tier players. They recently have been playing more in queue, and have joined some tournaments. Their game knowlege in the real playerbase is growing, and I believe that is helping the balance work.\n\nThe future? With hopes that we can grow this community via new steam users, I hope that this game can make some money so that staff can be added, and playing modes expanded. I really want to see Faction Warfare fleshed out, and a campaign mode added, and player base expansion will support that. The game desperately needs some more good players. Hopefully the balance is decent enough to retain those type of people at this point.\n\nI'll be here shooting stompy robots for a long time. Hopefully you will be too.","December 12, 2015","true","089.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

This is much more of a simulation experience and not a FPS - in the style of something like Elite: Dangerous or World of Tanks. It has a slow, deliberate pace focusing on the strength of the unit and not the individual.\n\nIt's deep and complex but once you buy and outfit your first mech (which can be done straight away) you absolutely can compete with those who have been playing since the beta. A few novice light mechs can take down or disable any Behemoth, if they work together and target the right areas.\n\nIf you're a big badass robot fan like me who was really skeptical about about Mechwarrior Online, now's the time to give it a try. It's not perfect and the interface is pretty clunky but on the battlefield, where it counts, Mechwarrior Online is the game we all remember.","December 17, 2015","true","5.5"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

There is a good range of different successful gameplay tactics and a huge range of customisable different mechs you can bring to a fight.\n\nAfter several teething issues (pre-steam, so don't worry) game balance is now pretty good between the two main factions ("inner sphere" and "clan") and the online population are fairly friendly in a wallaby-name-calling sort of fashion (see Gh1d0ra's review later!).\n\nThe "storyline" part of the game, "community warfare", is fun with much more structured in-game challenges. However as it is pretty much "end game" content, it works best as part of a pre-organised team (lots of these accessible via the MWO website community links) and needs a top-line mech.\n\nIt's main limitations are the initial learning curve and a limited number of maps and game types. Hopefully the developers will continue to respond to this in the next few months. Personally, I'm really hoping for some sort of intermediate gameplay between the random quickplay maps and the involved CW game (some sort of FFA deathmatch tournament would be great...)\n\nAll-in-all, it is good fun, especially as a free-to-play game, and I would recommend having a go through the initial cadet bonus stage, customing a bought mech until it is suitably bristling with lasers, ballistic weapons and missiles, blowing up the opposition team/going down in a blaze of glory and seeing if you enjoy it!\n","January 24","true","166.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

These are common themes in Mechwarrior. Also Boba Fett.\n\nMech-Nerds Rejoice! The O.G. Mech-Daddy has returned! IF you loved Mechwarrior 3050, (No not Super-Nintendo or Genesis, the one for the PC from the era of Lara Croft's Polygon Pyramidoid Breasts.) get ready to POOP with joy. Be warned, some may POOP displeasure and POP anuerism during their first foray into the jungle that is Mechwarrior Online.\nGrinding your favorite chassis into ultra bad-assery takes time and commitment!\n\nSome, either out of fondness or frustration refer to it as a 'Thinking Man's Shooter.'\nYou will be forced to comprehend an insidious heat management concept.\nIf you like to run and gun, you may not enjoy this style of FPS.\nYou will be expected to learn and manage new factors beyond your usual method of 'Finding the Best Hiding Spot!', 'Shooting the other guy First!', or 'Getting the Missile Launcher before the other team!'\n\nSome people's weapons and robots will be blatantly superior to yours either by virtue of chassis-weight or commitment level. You will be RENT and PWNT freeborn, keep your wits about you. You are not limited to holding the bomb or not holding the bomb anymore. Roles are diverse and they feel and play differently. You may find yourself scouting and painting targets, the paltry armament on your Light Mech won't stand a chance against that nasty Assault Mech's opening salvo!\nDon't feel like running and gunning this round? That's fine, change the loadout for your CPLT-A1  Catapult chassis in order to sit calmly, one handed, safely behind your ironclad bretheren and launch LRM-15 MISSILES while your jittery little friends run around and light up targets for you! Inner Sphere and Clan missiles look and behave differently. Woah.. Just like the tabletop. Such Purist. Much Diligence. Wow.\n\nIf you are fat and slow, we welcome you; here's an ULTRA-AC 20 friend! Don't forget fat guy, your usual reliance on the 'dependable center screen reticle' logic that you have wielded with great efficacy for years to point and shoot is a CURSE, that Ultra-AC 20 is mounted on your TORSO YOU BUFFOON!! So why are you firing on the enemy with the circular hand-mounted reticle???\n\nIf you can't stop moving? We want you; take these NARCS with you little one.. Reveal our mightiest foes to us so that we may blasteth upon them with Particle Projector canons and PULSE lasers. Although we sincerely hope you remembered to drop some weight off that chasis and put more armor onto those little chicken legs of yours in between matches... No don't take that Trebuchet, pilot the Cicada instead you knucklehead.\n\nIf you are sick to damn death of that little guy buzzing around you and you havn't yet maxed out your pilot skills for torso twist, go ahead and pop a U.A.V. for the one-handed guy in back, or drop an Air-Strike! You aren't limited by your own lack of comittment after all!\n\nPlay your way! You can brawl, you can snipe, you can 'pop tart'. Yes you can pop-tart. You can run, you can jump, you can FLY! You can POWER DOWN your giant 100 ton weapon of war in protest and NOT PARTICIPATE IF YOUR TEAM IS A JERK! No I swear I've never done it but I've seen it done, and it's hilarious, and yes I was hiding but not because I wanted to, I was looking at my mini-map and saw my teammate there and thought we would team up but it turns out the guy was TOTALLY CHICKEN and powered down because the team sucked, so I stayed and watched him in his powered down state and survived the carnage.

You can overheat repeatedly and MELT YOURSELF.\n\nCareful dude, you totally just blew up a teammate.. I only laughed a little bit and that was because my cat was tickling me at that exact moment in time, and it was totally obnoxious of you to Alpha Strike salvo our Dire Wolf right in the ♥♥♥, I would never condone such behaviour.\n\nPossessed of a rich mythos which has spawned numerous novels, audiobooks, toys, and even a 90's television series, the Battletech franchise certainly isn't lacking in terms of it's robust immersion, diverse factions, cultures, aliens, beasts! Robots! TANKS! PLANES! STARSHIP SPACE BATTLEFLEET ARMADAS!... All rooted in a believable flavor of our own milkyway galaxy called 'The Inner Sphere', which means you don't have to be a science-fiction nerd in order to subscribe to this universe. There is even an Earth!\nIn fact, you might love it as much as that other lore-rich game that you play!\nImagine 'America's Answer to Warhammer 40,000.' and you are halfway there.\n\nYou may find yourself trolling  Sarna.net [sarna.net] just like you do Wookiepedia in order to figure it all out.\n\nIf you loved Mechwarrior 3050? Welcome Home! I would and could pitch this game to any of you personally and you still wouldn't play it because it is that niche! Woah.. But this is like, the sickest game ever dudes!\n\nThe pay model is a miserable mire of misery and ramen and shame. Beware.. These guys probably make more than most publishers out there, and nobody even plays their game! They're that niche. woah..\n\nPardoning the critiques, this game rules.\nOkay fine, this is like my favorite game dude, when I'm bored with everything else; I'm definitely playing this. I would rather die incredulously from some freeborn scum's hacktastic salvo than on the john. There are rumors of a campaign in progress!\n\nWith friends that actively built, painted, and occasionally played the table top role-playing game 'Battletech' in the early ninties, owning a small collection of figurines myself, most of the classic 'Technical Readout' glossy-back publications with the nifty specs and drawings of various Clan and Inner Sphere mechs, I am no stranger to the world that spawned the 'Mechwarrior' franchise.\nHaving a father that was a prominent figure in the virtual reality and next generation entertainment business, I was deeply connected to video games and their various incarnations growing up. (Remember Exhilirama Saint Louis? Stun-Runner!!)\nI was even lucky enough to have participated in primitive versions of  getinthepods [getinthepods.com] before it was getinthepods due to this influence.\n\nUber-Nerd! Uber-NERD!! You have no excuse you slime!!! The Unseen[www.sarna.net]\nissue is going away due to retroactive introduction of designs that look recognizably like the mechs we know and love without blatantly infringing on Harmony Gold's copyright to their Macross anime franchise. Download the game now uber-nerd.. It's 'free'..\n\nNo, don't even start with me Uber-Nerd, don't even compare this to rolling dice and painting pewter, this is so much better..\n\nAnd YOU! Don't talk to me about that golden gun you bought for that game you play or that skin for that champion you love dawg. I got a mother ♥♥♥♥ing Santa Atlas with Boom Box warhorns and christmas lights mounted in my cockpit 'lil ♥♥♥♥♥ boi!\n\nIf you got through this whole thing, you might have what it takes to play the game.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you put in the time to fully comprehend how to play the game (Imagine doing so without the handy client nested tutorials that now exist..) you will dominate and it will make your usual FPS games feel like so much chaffe by comparison.

Do you like the following:\nBig stompy mechs and sometimes smaller, faster, but less stompy mechs?\nFiring lazors? Big autocannons? Or perhaps you like being a scumbag who provides "support" fire with long range misiles?\nCreating the most awful awesome custom mech setup?\nPlaying shooters that focus on thinking ahead rather than twitch reflex?\nIf you answered yes to any of these, the game should suit you fairly well. It's a thinking man's shooter with a good ammount of customisation provided within a number of varied mech models. The weapons loadout boils down to four major groups with seemingly minor differences between them, but that still suffices to make for a number of opportunities to make something that feels, plays and is unique and hopefuly suited to how you like to play.\n\nKeep in mind though, this game is NOT the following:\nP2W - you can buy all mech variants for premium currency and there are premium exclusive mechs. That said, the only advantage the premium exclusive mechs really have is making more credits, you can put together a virtually identical mech and often enough a superior one if you like. Money gets you places faster, but given that it's not an easy game to master, going places faster may not be helpful...\nEasy to master - as mentioned, this isn't easy to master, but the community is relatively helpful and mature, so at least getting the hang of it isn't hard, there's ample tutorials around and plenty of people willing to advise.\nDeveloped fast - the game has changed a lot since I first dropped in four years ago, but given how long it's been, I'd say progress could definitely have been faster. Partially forgiven due to behind the scenes problems, but still rather slow.\nNow that I'm back following the Steam release, I expect to put in quite a few hours once again.

The core 'drive a giant robot and shoot other giant robots' simulation is well-implemented and quite fun. And the Mechlab, where you customize your giant robot from a huge list of components and weapons, is also very realized.  These two core components are what will keep you coming back to MWO.\n\nThe bad side is that I just listed all the good parts. There's no single-player campaign, so forget your fond memories of Mechwarrior 2/3/4's single player. The multiplayer game modes are essentially limited to team deathmatch, so if you get tired of that, there's not much else to do. The persistent element are thin and the social tooling is weak. If you need more than giant robots with a variety of weapons shooting each other, then MWO won't make you come back.\n\nThose two points said; I keep coming back to MWO to shoot more giant robots, and I think anybody that finds the idea of shooting giant robots appealing should at least try MWO.","January 13","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Do you like the following:\nBig stompy mechs and sometimes smaller, faster, but less stompy mechs?\nFiring lazors? Big autocannons? Or perhaps you like being a scumbag who provides "support" fire with long range misiles?\nCreating the most awful awesome custom mech setup?\nPlaying shooters that focus on thinking ahead rather than twitch reflex?\nIf you answered yes to any of these, the game should suit you fairly well. It's a thinking man's shooter with a good ammount of customisation provided within a number of varied mech models. The weapons loadout boils down to four major groups with seemingly minor differences between them, but that still suffices to make for a number of opportunities to make something that feels, plays and is unique and hopefuly suited to how you like to play.\n\nKeep in mind though, this game is NOT the following:\nP2W - you can buy all mech variants for premium currency and there are premium exclusive mechs. That said, the only advantage the premium exclusive mechs really have is making more credits, you can put together a virtually identical mech and often enough a superior one if you like. Money gets you places faster, but given that it's not an easy game to master, going places faster may not be helpful...\nEasy to master - as mentioned, this isn't easy to master, but the community is relatively helpful and mature, so at least getting the hang of it isn't hard, there's ample tutorials around and plenty of people willing to advise.\nDeveloped fast - the game has changed a lot since I first dropped in four years ago, but given how long it's been, I'd say progress could definitely have been faster. Partially forgiven due to behind the scenes problems, but still rather slow.\nNow that I'm back following the Steam release, I expect to put in quite a few hours once again.

MWO is an enjoyable 12v12 mechwarrior game, but it's grindy.\n\nVery grindy and in different ways. You need to complete basic skills for 3 of the same mech to access elite skills. Then there are pilot skills that seem to take forever to gain experience. Then there's the money needed to buy the mech, and then customize it with the parts you want. After the cadet boost expires after 25 matches, money will be a bit tough to come by, even with the premium boost.\n\nIf you don't care too much about customization or progress, there are always 16 trial mechs available for play with 4 for each weight class. Others can use those to figure out what kind of mech they want to purchase and customize with the in-game currency. Some mechs are very expensive, so a trial run is a smart move to not waste money. You start with 4 mech bays and can earn some free ones from Faction play or events.\n\nThe sound effects are great. Firing any of the lasers feels and looks good. The same goes for the ballistic weapons. I didn't care too much for the missiles, but if you like firing volleys of them and hearing them blast off into the distance, this game will let you do so.\n\nThe damage displayed on the mechs is visually satisfying. I'm a big fan of shooting arms off. Mechs will be covered in bullet holes and damaged metal. They'll walk with limps if one of the legs is destroyed.\n\nAnyhoo, this game can offer a good time.

Firstly I want to point out that I am a Legendary Founder of this game and so I have been through the entire roller coaster ride of the good and the bad of MWO.\n\nI must say that overall MWO is quite a fun game to play. Since I have been playing for so long there have been times were I get a little bored and I'll head off to occupy my time elsewhere. I find myself always coming back to play for a little bit here and there and eventually coming back in full force. It comes down to the fact that the core gameplay is simply fun. I love tweaking my Mechs to fit my playstyle and/or to try and get that edge to ebst my opponents.\n\nI typically play as a solo pugger because I like the no strings attached, play a few games and then get some work done. Obviously this means that you're in for some fun with the grab bag of players out there but I generally have a good mix of good and bad games. I must say that if you have the chance to drop with a group it will exponentially increase the amount of fun you experience. The tactical gameplay that emerges from group combat is like no other.\n\nEven though the game is great now, it is continuously expanding. As of this review there are already teasers for the next rounds of improvements. There are even hints to a single player or possibly co-op campaign! On top of this, the president of the company is very active on Twitter and is very helpful in answering questions or providing juicy tid bits of imformation to keep us excited about the future of the game. I find that developers/owners of a company being involved with their community is such a rare treat. I find really helps improve the flow of feedback and generally creates a positive atmosphere.\n\nThere is a lot more I could write about this game but instead I will try to summarize some additional points that I feel stand out.\n\nGameplay\n-Core gameplay is very addicting.\n-Mechlab can provide hours of entertainment by itself as you tweak your Mechs to suit your needs.\n-Faction gameplay is a little lack luster currently.\n-Big improvements to Faction play in the very near future will help breathe new life into this mode.\n\nMechs\n-New Mech releases are fairly frequent Helps keep excitement up.\n-The current selection is quite plentiful and helps keep the battlefields varied.\n-Free-to-play grind can be a little extensive but at least the new player experience gives quite a substantial amount of in game currency to get you started.\n\nMaps + Modes\n-A decent variety and styles of maps to keep things interesting.\n-More maps on the way but at a fairly slow pace currently.\n-Game modes help to change the dynamic of the battle which helps with the map variety.\n\nOverall I find this game quite enjoyable. The beauty of it all is that the game will continue to expand and improve as time goes on. I definately recommend this game. Even if you don't play hardcore, it can be nice to break up the monotony of continuous gaming with a few matches of MWO to keep things fresh.\n\nHope to see you on the battlefield (on the blue team of course :)\n","January 12","true","105.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a huge variety of 'Mechs and wide scope for customizing each 'Mech. I'm mid-tier 3 right now, and matchmaking is fairly quick even in the early hours of the morning. Balance between the Clan and Inner Sphere tech bases is getting better as they tweak it. The Community Warfare/Faction Play part of the game is very much in development, but has additional features en route and I have high hopes.\n\nWhether you're in Faction Play or Quick Play/Solo Queue, teamwork is essential. Stick with your buddies, focus fire, and reap the rewards. Get separated from your team and focused by the red team and you'll have a bad day.\n\nThat said, it is an imperfect game, partly due to the difficulties of translating a turn-based tactics game (BattleTech) into a real-time first person stompy shooter. It's coming along, and it seems that PGI has been a lot more responsive to/involved with the community lately when it comes to making changes.","January 12","true","80.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If anyone out there hates PGI or this game for its history, I think their opinions are valid but I'd like to focus my review on what the game is here and now.\n\nMechwarrior Online is a game about piloting giant walking tanks.\nAs far as these things go, this is the best on the market. The initial learning curve can be pretty steep, but once you get your bearings this game provides an experience like no other. Half of the game is customization; swapping out weaponry and equipment on your massive death machine. The other half is tearing other players' mechs apart; shearing off limbs and blasting holes in their torsos.\n\nThis is a game where your hitboxes, health, and loadout all go hand-in-hand. You might be missing your entire left half, about to die from one more shot to the chest, but still have armor on your right arm. Many times victory will hinge on your ability to shield your critical components just long enough to get one more shot at the enemy. This game truly shines when both sides are locked in this desperate struggle, trying to mitigate incoming damage while simultaneously finding moments to strike.\n\nThere's nothing quite so satisfying as firing the massive, deafening AC20 and watching an enemy mech rock with the impact. No other game makes me laugh with such maniacal glee, as my 100-ton Atlas obliterates an enemy with a cluster of short-range missiles. Nothing gets my heart racing quite like speeding around the map in a light mech, scouting the enemy team's location and harassing mechs several times my size.\n\nI couldn't possibly hope to cover all the tactical elements or loadout considerations in this review. What I can tell you is that all the research pays off. The more time you invest in looking up strategies, loadouts and mech roles, the better you will perform and the more fun you will have. You'll learn which mechs to fear, and the range of their most likely loadouts. You'll learn where to shoot each mech to most efficiently disable or destroy them. You'll learn the best way to play to your mechs' strengths, and the result will be a game that keeps your mind racing as you work to counter each new enemy.\n\nThis is a game I can't recommend enough. Nothing feels quite as cool as becoming a Mechwarrior.","January 12","true","86.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/norserune/recommended/342200/","norserune","Norserune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/norserune/","257 products in account",""The Thinking Man's FPS"\n\nTL;DR Big mechs shoot each other in a rich setting and beautiful maps with a focus on tactics and customization and teamwork.\n\nI've heard this game called that from the community as I've played and I must say it is very accurate. There is a LOT going on in a typical match for MWO. Constantly knowing where my allies are moving, keeping an eye on the Assaults (the slow behemoths) to make sure we don't leave them behind, scanning the targets that the lights (the small speedy ones) are scouting, and always monitoring heat while being under fire by the enemy team. It is exhilarating!\n\nMechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe that has a ton of history and lore to back up the mechs in the game. While this game is less canon and more action, it is a still a great place for lovers of the setting to get their fix. The lore is unimportant to gameplay, so there is nothing stopping a complete newcomer to the game to feel left out.\n\nThis is a game about tactics. You choose your mech from a starting roster of trial mechs after a tutorial that just BARELY gets you ready to dive into the deep ocean that is MWO. There are four "weight" classes: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault. Upon first look, it appears to be a rock, paper, scissors type of scenario, but that is entirely not the case. This game offers a ton of customization to certain mechs (which are available in two separate "makes" that are similar to factions) so that your assault can run with the heavies, or allow your light to carry more firepower than some Heavy mechs. It can be tough to pick a mech in the start and there is no right or wrong mech, but after a good game and some quick deaths, one quickly learns the pros and cons of each class.\n\nAs I mentioned before, there are two "factions" that really only shine in the Community Warfare gamemode, which puts the player in a mercenary position accepting contracts from one of the separate factions in the game. Otherwise, a mech's faction has no real difference besides the level of customization. Mechs can be outfitted with weapons based on the "hardpoints" found on the frame. For instance, an arm could allow three energy weapons while the right torso could allow a ballistic and a missile. Mechs must be build around what is allowed by the hardpoints and weight limit while keeping survivability in the amount of armor and heat management that the build will allow.\n\nThe Inner Spere mechs (IS) are special in that they allow one to customize engines, jump jets, and a host of weapon customizations. However, the IS mechs have special "quirks" that allow them to really shine with a certain weapon type that should be taken into consideration. This allows the IS mechs to be specialized to a certain blend of combat and makes for each mech to be slightly different from another mech of the same build but on a different frame. The Clan mechs are a different beast entirely. While the IS mechs can change engines and loadouts, the Clan mechs cannot change the default engines or jumpjets in their mechs. They do allow one to swap out pieces called omnipods that change the hardpoints on a certain piece of the mech to allow for greater variety in weapon loadouts.\n\nThis game has a great community with a nice dry humor while at the same time being very competitive. From my time with this game, salt and toxicity has always been rare, something that I contribute to the personality that is drawn to the lore and gameplay. Being a free game, there is an incentive to buy mechs with cash to gain early access, but every mech in the game has a variant that can be purchased with in game currencies. There are also "hero" and "champion" variants to most mechs that give a boost to mech xp or in game currency rates, but they don't feel necessary. If you enjoy the game, the grind will be something you enjoy and not a burden. The only cash item that is "mandatory" or addition mech bays that allow you to own additional mechs. These are occasionally given away during events, but mostly will need to be purchased.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game to anyone who considers the RTS style games enjoyable and to anyone familiar with Battletech in general. It is a fun game and a great way to spend an evening.","January 12","true","286.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I use to play the tabletop game back in the early 90's and so was instantly curious. No problems with download, pretty much everything run fines on a mid-range rig at best(mine lol). I've had maybe a dozen bugs/glitches in the near 300 hours I've played so no complaints really. The game is great fun, especially if you like player verse player combat and enjoy teamwork. Alot of depth has gone into the game at this point, tonnes of mechs, well including variants there is over 100 easily. Heaps of customization as well which is one of the best parts of the game. Is the game grindy, yes it is a bit but that can be half the fun. It doesn't take to long to accumulate half a dozen mechs(without spending a dollar) and pretty much every much is available without real money(There are a few Hero/Champion class mechs but the same chassis variants are usually on par or even better). Money does help, especially with premium time but it's most definately not needed. Community seems to be pretty friendly, always trolls about the place like anywhere lol. Anyways, a fantastic game and has heaps of long term value. One of the rare reviews I've ever done, just wanted to people to know. Graphics 8/10, Sound 7/10, Lastability 9/10, Depth 8/10.

The player pilots an armored mech and does battle with eleven other players on a variety maps.\n\nGraphics:  I have nothing much to compare this against except maybe Hawken and Titanfall and it can match some of their look.  Maps are generally good looking ranging from desert wastelands to artic towns.  Weapons like lasers glow, leaving heat marks. and missles/rockets general smoke trails.  You can tell the damage of mechs by how much smoke they can sometimes generate from the damage they have taken.  Cockpits are fully detailed, though you can't push the buttons, and are unique for each kind of Mech.\n\nSound:  There is not much to say about the sound as much of it is muffled.  You get verbal warnings and indicators for what is happening on the map or happening to you.  What I mean for muffled sound is;  you are hearing what you would hear inside your mech.  The thumps of your feet stomping around and bumping into terrain. The hiss of your heat sinks trying to cool you down.  The bang of ballistic weapons being fired and the cycling of energy weapons as they discharge.\n\nGameplay:  In the main menu players can select which Mech they want to pilot.  Once you pick a chassis (general shape and character of the mech) you pick a varient (loadout options)  and you are ready to go.  The roles are broken up into weight classes.  Light mechs are your small light weight fast movers.  Mediums mechs and Heavy mechs seem to be your general all round mechs and Assault mechs are the heavy hitters.  While fighting players have to manage their Mech's heat and torso while they manuever around in battle shooting enemies.   After each battle awards players with xp for their chosen Mech and credits that they can spend on getting new mechs or customizing the ones they currently own.  You spend your XP on skill boosts that affect the performance of your Mech.\n\nNew player experience?:  After installing and signing in, players complete a tutorial to learn how to effectively pilot mechs.  Though many of the more advanced systems are not discussed or gone over in the tutorial, players can complete challenges to see said systems.  They recieve a stack of credits where they can save up to buy their first mech.  Trial Mechs are freely given and rotate regularly to allow players to try out different styles.\n\nOverall:  It is a fun game,  you could lose many hours of sleep into it.  The community seems fairly friendly as the game does have built in voice chat.  Games tend to be more group friendly as you get awards for fighting together.  It does have a bit of a learning curve but what game doesn't.  Just remember to not go alone,  lone mechs are tasty.\n","January 15","true","164.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Your first kills and wins will be SUPER satifying.\n4) This game is very playable without spending any real money.  The tutorial and your first 25 matches give you extra in-game currency (C-bills) which can be used to buy a mech or two.\n5) join a faction and dip your toe into Community Warfare (youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYWTl3mHuk)\ngetting to level 2 in a faction nets you a free mech bay.\n6) Mechs that can only be purchased with real money will either be: A) not as good as mechs that can be purchased with in-game2 earnable currency, or B) will eventually be available for purchase with C-bills.\n7) This game has two currencies: C-bills and MC.

everybody who is gonna read this review il make a short statement here\ni love this game it has all i need from it the system to custimize your\nmech to the battle ingame i am part of a clan in game too Golden Foxes\ncheck them out at http://darkjedi.org/club/FOX/ if you are looking for a group to play with\nnow for what i like hate and all else\n\n-the business modle of the game is well pretty grindy il say my self.\nyou have to play alot to unlock most stuff so yes you will be grinding alot\nto get new mechs weapons modules etc..... but i dont see it as a grind well\nbecause  i enjoy playing so much i have fun every battle so that helps\nnow there isnt really anything pay to win per say yes you can get some arty and air strike stuff\nfor mc the real money ingame but that doesnt matter cause they dont do that much from there regular versions\nwhich you can buy for ingame money.ok now i will talk about packs prem mechbays and more here.\n\nok there are packs ingame and outside of the game on the Mechwarrior online website you can get to into from ingame\ningame packs are mastery  packs it mostly gives you some mechbays around 3 mechs cause you need 3 mechs\nfrom the same chasis to master them that means to unlock all the upgrades for them per say.\nso yes mastery packs are great for people who dont want to grind to get all 3 mechs and you dont only get 3 mechs as i said you get mechbays with them too\nand sometimes prem time and some other cool stuff.\nnow ingame you can also buy champion mechs and Hero mechs il start with champion mechs\ni wouldent recommend anybody at all to buy any of them they are not worth it cause they dont give you that much\nHero mechs on the other hand are worth it  cause they give you around 40% C-bills plus means you earn more money.\non the web you can buy mechpacks you can say well its mostly for a specific mech i bought my self the archer pack not\nsaying you should but i did what that means is i am gonna get 4 archers cause i got the collectors one\nand some prem time and mechbays but on the site its mostly pre orders you can say so be careful there.\nnow i will talk more about game mechanics.\n\n\n\n-now as i said you can custimize your mech add this weapon remove that weapon etc... there is alot of stuff you can\ndo there from how much armor to ammo to what engine so yeah at the start it will look really hard to understand\nit really isnt but i would recommend going to forums or best place youtube to see how all of that works\nwhen you learn a bit you can start building your style of mechs and trust me you will love it.\nthere is another site for ppl that dont really wanna build there own mechs but do wanna\npilot the best mechs its called Metamechs it has all the builds for almost all the mechs the best\nbuilds most of the time not always but its a great place to start to even learn how to build the best mechs or fun\nmechs doesnt really matter if you like it.\nnow for how the combat is.\n\n-Combat in the game is pretty arcady if you played any other mechwarrior games you know its alot faster to kill mechs\nand do damage and more or on tabletop you can get 1 hit kills if insanly lucky or really big guns\nin mechwarrior its really hard to get the 1 hit kill even with big alphas yes you can do it to light mechs\nbut heavy ones well its really hard now in game you have a team of 12 players\non each side i am talking about quickplay not community warfare or just CW but in cw you get 12 players on each\nside too but thats not the point here so each team starts at one end of the map but before all of that you get a minigame  per say its where you get to vote which map will be played and which gamemode all 24 players get to vote there for\nwhat they want after that you get dropped on the game with the gamemode chosen so yeah.\nnow there are assault conquest and skrmish gamemodes skrmish is just team deathmatch assault is both teams have\na base where they spawn if one team gets enough players to the other teams base and caps it it wins or you can\nkill all players\nconquest is like in BF games you have alot of points on the map if you capture them you gain resources you can win like that or ofc killing everyone so yea pretty basic but really fun.\nwell after you are droppend in the game you are part of a lance each lance got 4 players most of the time the lances are\nweight based so heavy or assault or combined sometimes medium or lights togther and then well you battle it out\nthe good thing is you have Voip ingame defualt key is capslook and you can talk with the players on your team and cordinate this game is insanly team focused so get ready for that but the community is amazing everybody\nwell almost everybody is insanly friendly and will love to teach you stuff you dont know\nwell i belive this has went already for to long i hope this was helpful if you want some questions answer you can\nalways pm me or some other form if you wanna drop with me ingame or find some other great\nppl to play with you can always apply for Golden Foxes great clan we accept new players on a regular bases\nand we would love to teach you so look at us

It has gone through a LOT of changes and is STILL undergoing changes (which isn't a bad thing). For me, it is still a lot of fun to play.\n\nIs it perfect? Of course not. Few, if any games are perfect.\n\nIs it Pay to Win?\nNot at all. There is nothing you can purchase for real money that gives you any advantage over those who use ingame currency. It may give you the opportunity to play new mechs early, but other than that, no advantages at all. All the Weapons available in the game work the same no matter on what Mech they are equipped (now, Clan weapons work differently from Inner Sphere but they work the same across all Clan mechs). There are no "Gold Weapons" or "Gold Ammunition".\n\nWhy do mechs cost so much?\nThat is indeed a good question and one I wish they would explain myself! Personally, I feel they would be better off selling them for less money to sell more but I guess they figure their price point currently maximizes their profits. And they are a company out to make a profit (who isn't)! That said, every mech (other than Hero and Champion Mechs) are available to purchase at some point using ingame currency that you can earn while playing the game.\n\nHero Mechs? P2W!\nWhile it is true those mechs are only available for real money, they aren't P2W mechs. They are just mechs with a special paint/camo, and offer a Cbill % Bonus to your earnings. Hero mechs will have a weapon loadout that is not available on any other current variant usually but then suffer from some other disadvantage (perhaps it can't carry as many weapons as the others). But, the key point here ... all weapons perform the same, regardless of the Mech on which they are installed. So a Medium Laser is the same across all the Inner Sphere Mechs.\n\nChampion Mechs\nChampion Mechs are exactly the same mech as their normal variant, just with a (C) designation and a boost to your Experience earnings.\n\nTrial Mechs\nThese are what you will start with if you do not purchase any mechs with real money. They are free for you to use. You just cannot modify their loadouts whatsoever. You don't own them but you can play them to earn Cbills to purchase your own mechs.\n\nLearning Curve\nMWO is going to be wildly different from most other FPS type games. It is supposed to be a Mech Simulator, whatever they mean by that. Anyway, there will be a pretty steep learning curve for this game! To me, it was worth it and makes it so much more fun and involved. You have to learn how to Torso Twist to spread damage across your mech to increase your survivability. What this means is the upper half of your body can turn independently from your legs. You can be running one way and facing another (the degree of twist is dependent on the mech...some can turn more than others). Mastering the ability to Twist your Torso independent of your legs is a MUST.\n\nAiming Reticles. You will likely have 2 sets of reticules. Your Arms can also move somewhat independently of your torso (depends on Mech) to some degree. The small Circle reticule is where your Arm mounted weapons will fire while the + reticule is where your torso mounted weapons will fire. Oh, the OTHER thing you have to keep in mind is WHERE on your mech these weapons are mounted as far as height goes. While your Reticule may not appear to be obstructed by terrain, low-mounted weapons may not fire over the hill you are standing behind (for example).\n\nHeat Management\nThis is going to be one of your MAJOR things to master in MWO. Every weapon you fire (with the exception of the Gauss Rifle) generates some measure of Heat. Your Mech can only handle a certain amount of heat before you risk shutting down and/or doing internal damage to your mech. Each mech has Heat Sinks that add to your heat capacity and also contribute to dissapating the heat you have accumulated. So, the greater the number of weapons you fire at once, the greater the amount of heat you build up. Also, the faster you fire, the more you generate heat. Heat is your biggest concern and the thing you HAVE to learn to manage.\n\nGhost Heat\nThis is something the developers added as a "balance tool". It's not very well described in the game. What this means is they have set up a limit to the number of weapons of the same type that can be fired at the same time without incurring a "Ghost Heat Penalty". If you fire more than the allowed number at the same time, then you incur additional heat, hence the term "ghost". This penalty increases quickly based on how many more weapons past the limit you fire (so 3 more than the limit is penalized much more than 1 past the limit). You will get an indicator in the Mech Lab that warns you of the limit if you have more weapons of that type installed on the mech. For example, you can fire 4 SRM 4 missile packs without a penalty but if you fire 5 at the same time, you start incurring the Ghost Heat penalty. This is only if you fire them all at the same time. If you fire them one after the other (Chain Fire) you are fine or if you fire in smaller groups and pause at least .5 seconds between you are fine as well.\n\nSo, it is a rather complicated game to learn but once you begin to understand and master the skills, it becomes second nature. The game still has some improving to do...matchmaking isn't the best in the land and the game really needs a Lobby available full time in my opinion, but they are slowly getting those things added. I find the core game a lot of fun to play.","January 13","true","18.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's my favorite genre and I've purchased every title in the series since. A few years ago I played this Open Beta for a couple weeks, and left very disappointed. I thought the title was doomed. But loyal fans spending lots of cash have kept the developers motivated. Improvements were made, so I decided to have another look. I've been back for 3 months now and while it's not the MechWarrior 5 I and many other fans hoped for, it is still quite enjoyable to play in its current state. Fortunately I picked a good time of the year to come back as multiple sales were going on both with in-game and premium currency. I was even motivated to spend some real cash for premium purchases which is out of character for me.\nSo you're here to find out if this title is worth your time? If you love the series or the genre, I would say yes it certainly is worth installing and playing. There is a learning curve if your background is all Player versus A.I. of the previous titles. Humans are infinitely more unpredictable. (that's not saying they are always smarter) If your background is Player versus Player, especially First Person Shooter titles, this game's tactics will be familiar, yet different enough to be a new experience worth trying. You move much slower - depending on the chassis size, have multiple weapon groups to choose from - depending on range and heat levels, and must orient/steer your upper and lower torsos independantly.\nThere is a strong focus on team logistics. You'll see it time and again: a lone wolf playstyle will get you killed as isolated mechs of any size can be overwhelmed with even just a pair of attackers. Then once you're gone, your team has a numbers disadvantage and the odds of them losing rise quickly. If you're the kind of person that likes team-chat, defined combat roles, and focused fire, you'll love this title.\nThe in-game chat is 99.9% adult and respectful. Most are willing to give free advice and understand the challenges of playing the game well. Those that choose to swear/slur or team kill can be easily reported and seem to quickly disappear. The out-of-game community is alive and well. Searching the official forums, youtube, or the relevant reddit sites will give you links to many external resources for role-tactics, mech customization, chassis purchasing advice, social ladders, and just about anything you need to be successful except the actual in-game skill of keeping calm while 12 strangers (or possibly even friends once you've been around a while) are trying to melt your face off.\nI intend to play this game for quite a while, and I encourage anyone reading this to give the free install a shot. It might just be exactly what you're looking for. It doesn't take long for a new player to have several vehicles in the garage and feel like they can contribute or even turn the tides of a battle.

If you are familiar with the Mechwarrior franchise, battlestyle-wise the game feels very similar with big bad robots stomping each other. Most matches are done in 12v12s. Each match earns you C-bills, the in-game currency, which you use to buy new mechs or new equipment.\n\nThere is a great deal of customization offered from the kind of weapons you can opt for, to the different variants of each chassis you can pick from and even down to what color or paint pattern you want on your mech to make it as visually distinguished as possible.\n\nOne remarkable feature that I have to put out, the community is amazing so far. Most players I have came across are really helpful and patient, save for a few, but those a very small minority. Most players here are polite in response and will gladly help out new players in need. There are plenty of units (aka clans / guilds in layman terms) that are recruiting new players so if you have the time, you may want to check them out on the forums to help you get settled faster into the game.\n\nOverall experience: 8.5/10\n\n","January 30","true","787.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's a lot of fun right now and I like the ideas they have for the future of the game.  I played a lot of World of Tanks and this is similiar but better in my opinion.  The graphics are excellent and the gameplay really good - the more you play the more depth you find.  I recently started playing light mechs and I really underestimated the power and fun of that playstyle (scouting, harrassing, ect..).  Playing as a light vs. Medium/heavy vs. Assault Mech is very different and keeps thing fresh.  The maps are very different and some are really wonderful.  I LOVE the feeling of landing on an alien planet with your fellow Mech pilots and heading out to battle.  And finally for those of you who like the buliding and crafting part of the game, the Mech LAB is a lot of fun.  You can change weapons and weapon locations and engines and armor and heatsinks.  And all these choices matter and change gameplay.  Weapons placed up high on shoulders allow for differnt play style than lower mounted arm weapons, both have benefits and drawbacks on the battlefield.\n\nAlso, they give you tons of money over the first 20+ games so is not grindy at all.  Just play a bit and you will be able to buy some mechs and lots of gear for your mechs.  ALso there are always tournament rewards that you get for just playing.\n\nCons -\n\nThe gameplay modes are mostly just kill everyone.  They are working on changing these in the next few months.  But even with the repetative game objectives - the different maps and mechs keeps it interesting and just blasting apart other Mechs never gets old.  :)\n\nTLDR:  Fun game.  Maps are beatuiful.  MechLAB is fun.  Gameplay is entertaining.  Give it a try (It's free, so nothing to lose).","January 30","true","165.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Ran out of ammo. proceeded to run around and distract/tank shots while team mates around me dropped the Mechs. after getting them down to a single light, i took an opportunity and pinned the silly little chicken while my team pounded him with a hail of fire.\n\nFunny Business aside, this is at first glance a battle arena "shooter". However, you have to think with this one. if you're not a MW fan then you may fumble with the controls initially but just think that its a tank. the Tutorial is quick but you learn the basics. This is definitely a good one to play, especially Fans of the universe.\n\nThe major Drawback in my opinion, is the lack of Modes and maps. it has somewhere between 5-8 maps but only 3 modes, Assault, Conquest, and Skirmish. There could be a bigger selection of Game modes and a few more maps and this would be a lot better. Hawken, another F2P Mecha shooter, has several modes and a hanful of maps. the mode selection is what caught me on that game. If a lower budget Mech shooter like Hawken can have multiple modes why doesn't MWO have more?\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is a great Mech Shooter. its not the simple shooter mechanics, it stays true to the MechWarrior playstyle. the MW3 Nastalgia hit my in the gut hard.

If anyone out there hates PGI or this game for its history, I think their opinions are valid but I'd like to focus my review on what the game is here and now.\n\nMechwarrior Online is a game about piloting giant walking tanks.\nAs far as these things go, this is the best on the market. The initial learning curve can be pretty steep, but once you get your bearings this game provides an experience like no other. Half of the game is customization; swapping out weaponry and equipment on your massive death machine. The other half is tearing other players' mechs apart; shearing off limbs and blasting holes in their torsos.\n\nThis is a game where your hitboxes, health, and loadout all go hand-in-hand. You might be missing your entire left half, about to die from one more shot to the chest, but still have armor on your right arm. Many times victory will hinge on your ability to shield your critical components just long enough to get one more shot at the enemy. This game truly shines when both sides are locked in this desperate struggle, trying to mitigate incoming damage while simultaneously finding moments to strike.\n\nThere's nothing quite so satisfying as firing the massive, deafening AC20 and watching an enemy mech rock with the impact. No other game makes me laugh with such maniacal glee, as my 100-ton Atlas obliterates an enemy with a cluster of short-range missiles. Nothing gets my heart racing quite like speeding around the map in a light mech, scouting the enemy team's location and harassing mechs several times my size.\n\nI couldn't possibly hope to cover all the tactical elements or loadout considerations in this review. What I can tell you is that all the research pays off. The more time you invest in looking up strategies, loadouts and mech roles, the better you will perform and the more fun you will have. You'll learn which mechs to fear, and the range of their most likely loadouts. You'll learn where to shoot each mech to most efficiently disable or destroy them. You'll learn the best way to play to your mechs' strengths, and the result will be a game that keeps your mind racing as you work to counter each new enemy.\n\nThis is a game I can't recommend enough. Nothing feels quite as cool as becoming a Mechwarrior.","January 12","true","86.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a LOT going on in a typical match for MWO. Constantly knowing where my allies are moving, keeping an eye on the Assaults (the slow behemoths) to make sure we don't leave them behind, scanning the targets that the lights (the small speedy ones) are scouting, and always monitoring heat while being under fire by the enemy team. It is exhilarating!\n\nMechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe that has a ton of history and lore to back up the mechs in the game. While this game is less canon and more action, it is a still a great place for lovers of the setting to get their fix. The lore is unimportant to gameplay, so there is nothing stopping a complete newcomer to the game to feel left out.\n\nThis is a game about tactics. You choose your mech from a starting roster of trial mechs after a tutorial that just BARELY gets you ready to dive into the deep ocean that is MWO. There are four "weight" classes: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault. Upon first look, it appears to be a rock, paper, scissors type of scenario, but that is entirely not the case. This game offers a ton of customization to certain mechs (which are available in two separate "makes" that are similar to factions) so that your assault can run with the heavies, or allow your light to carry more firepower than some Heavy mechs. It can be tough to pick a mech in the start and there is no right or wrong mech, but after a good game and some quick deaths, one quickly learns the pros and cons of each class.\n\nAs I mentioned before, there are two "factions" that really only shine in the Community Warfare gamemode, which puts the player in a mercenary position accepting contracts from one of the separate factions in the game. Otherwise, a mech's faction has no real difference besides the level of customization. Mechs can be outfitted with weapons based on the "hardpoints" found on the frame. For instance, an arm could allow three energy weapons while the right torso could allow a ballistic and a missile. Mechs must be build around what is allowed by the hardpoints and weight limit while keeping survivability in the amount of armor and heat management that the build will allow.\n\nThe Inner Spere mechs (IS) are special in that they allow one to customize engines, jump jets, and a host of weapon customizations. However, the IS mechs have special "quirks" that allow them to really shine with a certain weapon type that should be taken into consideration. This allows the IS mechs to be specialized to a certain blend of combat and makes for each mech to be slightly different from another mech of the same build but on a different frame. The Clan mechs are a different beast entirely. While the IS mechs can change engines and loadouts, the Clan mechs cannot change the default engines or jumpjets in their mechs. They do allow one to swap out pieces called omnipods that change the hardpoints on a certain piece of the mech to allow for greater variety in weapon loadouts.\n\nThis game has a great community with a nice dry humor while at the same time being very competitive. From my time with this game, salt and toxicity has always been rare, something that I contribute to the personality that is drawn to the lore and gameplay. Being a free game, there is an incentive to buy mechs with cash to gain early access, but every mech in the game has a variant that can be purchased with in game currencies. There are also "hero" and "champion" variants to most mechs that give a boost to mech xp or in game currency rates, but they don't feel necessary. If you enjoy the game, the grind will be something you enjoy and not a burden. The only cash item that is "mandatory" or addition mech bays that allow you to own additional mechs. These are occasionally given away during events, but mostly will need to be purchased.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game to anyone who considers the RTS style games enjoyable and to anyone familiar with Battletech in general. It is a fun game and a great way to spend an evening.","January 12","true","286.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Big stompy robot-on-robot action with a complex mechlab system to outfit your mech allowing for pretty crazy customizations. An interesting "WAR" option called "Community Warfare"(I hope that they change this name pone day to something a little cooler).\n\nWhat I like:\nCombat is very, very, VERY fun\nLooks good\nSounds good\nMechlab is well done(finally)\nVery nice tutorial\nGrind isn't bad when you consider that there isn't a tech tree to climb. This means that you can buy any mech or equipment from the beginning(as long as you have the C-Bills)\nSo many events and chances to get free mech bays/mechs/items/MC that you could almost spend no money into the game and still grow your hangar every month.\nWhat I don't like:\nCW for many reasons. Many of which PGI is said to fix in the next 2 months, but we'll see. The combat is even better than in regular matches, but victories/defeats feel empty. Capturing planets means nothing as wel as losing them.\nBalance still needs work. I think that PGI's eyes were bigger than their stomachs when they decided to go for the 3050 timeline as it is insanely complicated to balance all of these different weapons systems while at the same time making them each unique and useful. Hopefully this will be adressed before any big tournaments are launched.\nFinding modules/cockpit items is still a pain. Better than it used to be, but still not ideal. I often don't equip them just because I don't want to go through the hassle of looking for them and removing them later.","January 12","true","169.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first I thought I would be a light scout pilot, but found myself enjoying 300 meter or less scrapping in brawls. Situational awareness is more of a strength for me than being a good shot. I found myself being good enough in the Assualt Class mechs while still enjoying every other class of mechs. I find some Mechs to be higher skill mechs than others. I know Pilots that you give one small laser and a high skill Mech (need skills to hit with or stay alive)and they get massive damage done, a bunch of assists and a couple kills. That is not me in any way.\n\nThis game caters to each individuals play style and differenciates everyones skill levels. Each pilot can build a mech that hightens skills or hides the lack thereof. My builds hide my lack of skill shooting while taking advantage of my abilty to know where the enemy is or is moving to, in a brawl, in a flank, or smashing down on my team.\n\nI am better than I was, but you long time Steam players start with more skill than I will ever have! That said, I like my chances against you. Thinking mans game, and you are a child my friend ( just kidding, almost).\n\nSmash and grab play style, long range sniper, big ballistic crusher, short or long range missle havoc wrecker, or the sneeking little evil back stabbing elite scout light that has the temarity to do such to a Majestic slow moving Assault Mech that rightfully and normally strike fear and apprehension to the enemy, showing it's superiority in almost every way, right? heh heh lol\n\nAnyway, I think this game is great. There is a learning curve some find tough, but every hard core gamer I ever met that stuck with it, they loved it and were too good at it to suit me, unless they were on my team stealing my kills.\n\nDo not use the center torso button as a crutch, get on teamspeak, fix your armour and get double heatsinks. Buy 3 of the same chassis leveling them up on the pilot tree, do not spend a dime on the game if you shouldn't, spend whatever you like if you can.

I have to teach my friends either through video or private matches...and forced to REFUSE teamming up with them so that they will have a better experience and time to enjoy rather than being stomped by 12-men team.\n\nWhy? because, if you ever want to play with even just one friend, you will be dropped into the group queue and has to bear with the very likelihood of being steamrolled by a bigger premade group (a bunch of 2-4 mech teams vs an organized 12 mech team is quite common). and I have no idea why PGI still had not allow a 2 mech team in 'solo' queue as I failed to see, contrary to those forumites, how it will make the game unfair. See, WOT, WT and many other online session based games are allowing 2-4 men platoon, they don't have any problem with that.\n\n2 men team = 1/6 of a full team for MWO (16.7%)\n3 tanks = 1/5 of a full team for WOT and others (20%)\n\nAnd just throw the 4-12 mech teams to CW (even though people crying that it has long MM and whatever things they dislike). They don't belong to pub games. Or just get rid of large teams and make a cap for Lance-sized (4 mechs) premade queue. You will want to allow veterans to bring in and teach their friends rather than giving those people a hard time to do so, so that you will have enough population to support Community Warfare and larger group queue.

Do you like the following:\nBig stompy mechs and sometimes smaller, faster, but less stompy mechs?\nFiring lazors? Big autocannons? Or perhaps you like being a scumbag who provides "support" fire with long range misiles?\nCreating the most awful awesome custom mech setup?\nPlaying shooters that focus on thinking ahead rather than twitch reflex?\nIf you answered yes to any of these, the game should suit you fairly well. It's a thinking man's shooter with a good ammount of customisation provided within a number of varied mech models. The weapons loadout boils down to four major groups with seemingly minor differences between them, but that still suffices to make for a number of opportunities to make something that feels, plays and is unique and hopefuly suited to how you like to play.\n\nKeep in mind though, this game is NOT the following:\nP2W - you can buy all mech variants for premium currency and there are premium exclusive mechs. That said, the only advantage the premium exclusive mechs really have is making more credits, you can put together a virtually identical mech and often enough a superior one if you like. Money gets you places faster, but given that it's not an easy game to master, going places faster may not be helpful...\nEasy to master - as mentioned, this isn't easy to master, but the community is relatively helpful and mature, so at least getting the hang of it isn't hard, there's ample tutorials around and plenty of people willing to advise.\nDeveloped fast - the game has changed a lot since I first dropped in four years ago, but given how long it's been, I'd say progress could definitely have been faster. Partially forgiven due to behind the scenes problems, but still rather slow.\nNow that I'm back following the Steam release, I expect to put in quite a few hours once again. Hopefully if you try it, you'll like it. Nothing to lose since it is F2P after all.","January 17","true","79.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you are reading this you are deciding whether or not to invest your time and possibly your hard earned money. I hope this review can answer some simple questions you may have.\n\nFirst off I am not new to MechWarrior as I have grown up with the series starting with the original in 1989. I have played through all the MechWarrior 2, 3 and 4 games and have enjoyed them thoroughly. If you are looking for a single player campaign in the vein of the previous games you may have to wait. PGI is currently working towards releasing a single player campaign in the future that would be loyal to MechWarrior and MechWarrior 2 Mercenaries.\nRight now they have two main ways to play the game. The first is “Quick Play” consisting of 3 different modes (more to come in the future hopefully) spread across a dozen or more so maps (more always being added).This first mode can be done as a solo player or as part of a team (which can be found by joining a unit/guild or using the LFG Tool).\nThe second mode of play is called “Faction Play” this mode is best played as part of a group or as a unit as solo players may find it frustrating because going it solo often puts them at a disadvantage. This mode is still in Beta with more features coming soon (Spring 2016 CW Phase 3).  They recently released a sneak peak here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdC90yXKRFs\n\nThe game offers a ton of Mechs to choose from each with a game play style of their own. The game features 4 weight classes: Light (20-35 tons), Medium (40-55 tons), Heavy (60-75 tons), and Assault (80-100 tons). Each plays differently and has different roles. Lights are great at harassing the slower moving assaults and punishing them for not moving with the team as an Assault will have problems dealing with a fast moving light for example. There are dozens of chassis available for each tonnage and multiple variants for each chassis. For example in the Assault Mech category we have the Atlas which is one of many assault Mechs available to play; and within the Atlas chassis there are half a dozen different variants: http://mwo.gamepedia.com/Atlas.\n\nThe game has 4 different types of currency, but in all it is really easy to learn They are C-Bills, MC, XP, and GXP.\n\nC-Bills are earned by simply playing matches, completing achievements, gaining faction ranks, or through events (more on this later). There are ways to boost your income such as buying “Premium time” or using special Mechs that give C-Bill boosts (these are labeled “Special Mechs”  denoted with an (S) these are customer application Mechs or Mechs variants that are purchased when Mech packages are sold. As seen here: https://mwomercs.com/urbanmech). C-Bills will be your primary method of buying Mechs in-game (You must have a free mechbay).\n\nMC is the Real Cash to In-Game Currency. You can buy Mechs with this currency (This is how you attain Hero Mechs 90% of the time), and this is a method of attaining Mech bays (outside events). They have a variety of method of buying this stuff: Karma Koin, PayPal, and Credit Card. However they do have events where you can earn MC so do not fret.\n\nXP is what you will use to level up your Mechs (Yes you level your Mechs by buying skills). XP is earned through matches; however XP is bonded to a chassis. For example if you are playing your Atlas-D and earned 10,000 XP that XP is only useable for that Atlas-D, you cannot use it for that Atlas-RS you want to level up. However…\n\nGXP (General XP) can be earned through matches (at a MUCH SLOWER rate) and can be used on any mech. However GXP is used to level up yourself as a pilot and earn access to modules (which you can purchase in the Mech Lab after unlocking them via GXP in the Skills tab. Also you can convert XP to GXP if you are willing to spend your MC.\n\nI know that is a lot to absorb (and there is even more I am leaving out). I did promise to mention events. MWO often offers events that span Quick play and Faction Play every so often (often). At the time of this review the current event is: https://mwomercs.com/tournaments?t=201601champion3.\nAs you can see there are some good rewards being offered in these events; In these events you can earn C-Bills, GXP, Consumable modules, Mech Bays, vanity cockpit items, paint, camo/pattern, and even Mechs for free.\n\nYou can get just about everything in this game (Minus Hero Mechs) for free if you are patient. All Mechs that are sold in packages do make their way to the in game store for C-bills, and there are ways to attain Mech bays outside of MC (Although they are rare!) However I’m not one for patience and I tend to spend my money on packages and MC (Though they often have MC and Mech Sales so your wallet won’t get hit as hard).\nThe Community is fairly good however there are toxic members and communities as you probably have noticed just by reading some of these comments. Though some of these negative reviews are from players who quit and haven’t played in a while and are just salty. While PGI has made mistakes in the past they do try hard to make this an enjoyable game and in the last year and a half have made enormous strides in improving the game and their image with the community after parting ways with Infinite Games Publishing (IGP). The president of PGI (Russ Bullock) is often talking shop and features with people on his twitter and you can tell he loves the BattleTech Universe. He often has town halls where players have a chance to ask him questions about upcoming features and events.\n\nI advise visiting https://www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG/ if you have questions or are looking for more information.\nThe game is constantly getting new Mechs and other content (UI Improvements, Maps, etc) and to paraphrase PGI: They will always be working to add more features to this game.\n\nI hope I was able to offer some information you found useful.\n","January 14","true","409.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

MWO is an enjoyable 12v12 mechwarrior game, but it's grindy.\n\nVery grindy and in different ways. You need to complete basic skills for 3 of the same mech to access elite skills. Then there are pilot skills that seem to take forever to gain experience. Then there's the money needed to buy the mech, and then customize it with the parts you want. After the cadet boost expires after 25 matches, money will be a bit tough to come by, even with the premium boost.\n\nIf you don't care too much about customization or progress, there are always 16 trial mechs available for play with 4 for each weight class. Others can use those to figure out what kind of mech they want to purchase and customize with the in-game currency. Some mechs are very expensive, so a trial run is a smart move to not waste money. You start with 4 mech bays and can earn some free ones from Faction play or events.\n\nThe sound effects are great. Firing any of the lasers feels and looks good. The same goes for the ballistic weapons. I didn't care too much for the missiles, but if you like firing volleys of them and hearing them blast off into the distance, this game will let you do so.\n\nThe damage displayed on the mechs is visually satisfying. I'm a big fan of shooting arms off. Mechs will be covered in bullet holes and damaged metal. They'll walk with limps if one of the legs is destroyed.\n\nAnyhoo, this game can offer a good time. Just make smart purchases and have fun with your builds. I have read that the higher tiers require optimal builds, so keep that in mind, but I'm still in Tier 5 after 30 hours. Go crush some trees already!","January 21","true","38.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I obviously enjoy it.\n\nThe pros of this game? You get to run big stompy robots. I love the history and background of this game. I enjoy the fact that the meta has shifted now and then, it makes me relearn various aspects. The mechbay and design of mechs, the optimizing of builds, understanding weapon ranges and timing, all of it is enjoyable. The marketing says thinking man's shooter. People that are not terrible at this game know that to be true. That said, there are plenty of dumbasses with terrible builds as well..\n\nThe cons? This game is developed by a small company. They have limited resources. Promised additions and fixes come slowly. They have to focus attention on money making content to keep their business open, and sometimes that trumps adding fun content like game modes or user interface improvements.\n\nThe neutral? Game balance has been a rocky road. The tabletop game this adapts was balanced in a way that didn't translate to a real time shooter. They have made slow akward attempts at balance, and the game is in a decent state at the moment. The developers of this game have been historically really bad at their own game, and hesitant to listen to the top tier players. They recently have been playing more in queue, and have joined some tournaments. Their game knowlege in the real playerbase is growing, and I believe that is helping the balance work.\n\nThe future? With hopes that we can grow this community via new steam users, I hope that this game can make some money so that staff can be added, and playing modes expanded. I really want to see Faction Warfare fleshed out, and a campaign mode added, and player base expansion will support that. The game desperately needs some more good players. Hopefully the balance is decent enough to retain those type of people at this point.\n\nI'll be here shooting stompy robots for a long time. Hopefully you will be too.","December 12, 2015","true","089.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Take a look at that word there, "personally".\n\nI say that because this game isn't for everyone. It's not CoD, it's not Battlefield, it's not even Hawken. It's a robot simulator with 30+ years of Lore, books, and other games behind it. It's slow, it's grindy (when leveling up new mechs, when you choose to do that), it's got it's own share of problems constantly popping up, or constantly being fixed and hammered out.\n\nDon't come in to MW:O looking for your next singleplayer robot game, or come in expecting to kill everyone forever, or expecting your robots to fly around the maps while doing backflips.\n\nCome into this game looking for a unique, fun, slower paced game. Come into MW:O looking for kick-♥♥♥ robot battles, missiles flying overhead, lasers everywhere. Come for the giant land-slide games where you and your team crushes 12 other robots into the ground with giant guns... stay for the games that drag on.\n\nStay for the games that come down to the wire, with a panicking Light mech falling apart while darting around the map to spot the last few guys on the other team, so your last few nearly-exploded friendly mechs don't walk into a trap. Stay for the games where you're the last-mech-standing on your team, going full Rambo on the last lance of enemy mechs.\n\nYes, the game has its flaws, but it's a free-2-play game that's actually fair and paying money gives no in-combat advantage.

And to be honest, i still feel like i could lose interest any time now.\n\nFor better or worse, this is not a direct port of TT.  To be hoenst TT had some mechanics in it that were just not suited to real time simulation.\n\nPROS\nThe mech models are really good.  There are some technical issues with some models (hit boxes, scaling), but i think that on the whole, the mech models are in good shape.\n\nWe got the Unseen showing up.  While the mech modles are altered, they are still immediately recognizeable.\n\nMost of the weapon and component implementations make sense when ported over from TT\n\nCommunity is generally less toxic than most others (That said, this is a team-based game and people do ge frustrated when people ignore attempts to organize in match)\n\nThe number of mechs now available makes it less likey that during drops (at least in the lower 3 tiers) you will encounter  cookie-cutter meta teams.\n\nCONS\n\nBallistic weapons aer still just a hair to accurate.  While rounds drop in flight, they don't really seem to deviate in any other way.\n\nSome of the weapon conversions are just badly implemented:  A 5 second cool down on gauss rifles, then charge time before you can fire, which really adds up to a double-lencgth cooldown\n\nClan implementation was just baddly handled, and it still causes gameplay and balance problems\n\nGameplay/Mech balance issues can take some time resolve, and are sometimes knee-jerk reactions (Ask a veteran about tackling)\n\nCommunity Warfare just isn't ready yet.\n\n\nAll in all, despite having some issues, the game does have promise, and is fun most of the time.  There are some changes coming up in the immediate future that address some of the outstanding issue and open up more content for Community Warfare.\n\nSo with all of that, for now, yes, I'd reccomend it, because you can get damn near everything out of the game without spending any money, though obviously people who spend the money get access to new chasis sooner.","January 31","true","652.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has it's faults, but can be an amazing game as well.\n\nPros:\n- BattleMech customization: They have struck a fairly good balance between the standard tabletop construction rules and a hardpoint system to prevent rediculous boating and encourage customization. You CAN make pretty much an kind of variant you want, even if it's not always smart (See the Cons)\n\n- Variable gameplay: You can make your play as involved (or not) as you want. Quickplay gives you the ability to jump right into a match, which lasts for a maximum of 15 minutes. More depth can be had in Faction Play (also known as Community Warfare), where group play is strongly encouraged and players fight across various planets in the Inner Sphere. Keep in mind, this mode is scheduled for significant changes in the next few months (CW: Phase 3)\n\n- Community: This can be a negative in any game, but MWO at least has the redeeming feature of a strong population of mature gamers and Battletech veterans to balance out the annoying trolls. You can find groups to match what you're looking for.\n\n- Visuals: It's made by a small dev studio, and some of the graphics can show it at times, but they are rescued by an indredibly talented art department. Mech models in particular are almost universally superbly done.\n\n- It's an F2P that is most assuredly NOT Pay2Win. Real life purchases are for cosmetics and boosters, as well as early access to newly released Mechs. It may take a month or two, but any mech that is initially released for $$$ will always subsequently be released for in-game currency\n\nThe Cons:\n\n- Time-sink: Yes, it's a time sink. The grind can be pretty severe at times, as in-game earnings can take quite a while, especially if you are playing as a solo player.\n\n- Release Schedule for mechs: This can be a matter of perspective. While the game is not pay2win, there is a tendency for new mechs to be initially relased (during the real life $$$ period)  with "op" characteristics. Sometimes it's oddly coded hit-boxes, sometimes it's poorly thought out design quirks that give an advantage. The design is then fixed/nerfed just as or shortly before the design becomes available for in-game currency. Taken individually, any of them appear to just be mistakes by the devs, but it is slightly suspicious that the pattern has repeated itself so many times.\n\n- The "pro" or "comp" community: MWO has a small but dedicated group of competetive players. They play in the Faction play, and third-party tournaments. While there are plenty of good people who participate, the overall comp scene can be quite abrasive, and it's members pompous and annoying. It likely stems from being the top dog in a very small community, like being boastful of being elected Class President of your home-school class of 1 person. If you've ever known that team in an adult rec league that take things too far, as if they're pros or something, that's exactly what this is. Most enjoy showing how "leet" they are by clubbing seals over and over. It's possible that revisions to CW and the influx of new blood from Steam will help, but that remains to be seen.\n\n- Teamwork is required, but rarely to be found: Teamwork is huge, people playing as a team have a huge advantage. The game has built-in chat and VoiP, but they are usually just used to troll/abuse. Especially on the weekends, there is an influx of low-skill players who simply do not work with their team at all, and this can be frustrating as it can virtually guarantee losses if you get stuck with that team.\n\n- The "meta": While you can theoretically build any type of mechs you want, certain weapons/combos/variants are just plain better and stronger. If you want to have any success at the higher skill levels, you have to use the meta.","February 1","true","314.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are too many reviews to wade through for me to egotistically believe that a long meandering review will cut through the rest.  So I'll keep this short and sweet.\n\nIt's a free to play FPS game where giant stompy robots shoot each other in 12 v 12 matches.  To the new Steam players that are joining us: this is not a simple game.  Your twitch skills from other shooters will definitely help you, and may even give you an edge over the old timers eventually.  But prepare for a steep learning curve.  There is SO MUCH nuance to understanding this game, let alone succeed at it, that no one will be an elite pilot without some serious time logged.  But, if you want a challenge, this game is it.\n\nMy advice to you, the new player, is this.\n\nJoin the game.  Jump into the tutorial system and get the hang of the basics of movement and shooting.  Play 10 matches or so in quickplay to get a taste of combat.  Save up that starting cash and play trial mechs at first.\n\nTHEN: Ask in team chat or General chat if there are any vets that would be willing to help answer your questions and show you around.  You can lone wolf all you want in this game, but there is simply too much to understand if you don't ask questions.  Established units all have teamspeak servers and would love to help you learn the game.  Please take advantage of the existing community.  Most of us are drinking beers, having fun and are ready and willing to share both with anyone that wants to learn.  You don't need to make any commitment to joining units.  The community of vets truly want the game to succeed and grow, and we know that the best way to do that is to tutor new players.\n\nWhen you know what you're doing, you've built a stable of mechs that fit your playstyle and you drop with a group of pilots that you have grown comfortable with, there is simply no better gaming experience to be had anywhere.\n\nCrack a beer and look me up on the Steiner Teamspeak hub.  ts1.housesteiner.com  No Password.  My Callsign is Veritae and I'm the XO of Team Cortez Merc Corps (TCMC).  I'll vouch for any unit on the hub.  Peiper and the Devil Dogs are a great group of guys that switch between Wolf and Steiner and enjoy roleplaying.  FFI is a growing and emerging comp merc unit that switches between Clan and Inner Sphere and are a blast to hang out with.   6RCT, 5RCT, OCP, LoP and on and on and on all have vets that play every day and would love to help you out.\n\nPlay the game.  Join the community.  Welcome to Mechwarrior: Online.","February 5","true","195.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I know quite abit about lore, the mechwarrior series and battletech.\nAt first I wasnt much into MWO though. But I kept casually playing the game because I liked the mech combat.\nI can tell you the game has improved much over time and PGI keeps going.\n\nOverall what I like most about this game is the customization in the mechlab. You can spend hours thinking about possible builds and how they might work out in the game, then go for a test run just to be back in the mechlab after 1 game.\nMany possiblitites to play the game and pretty much any mech is viable depending on your piloting skills.\n\nIf I should point out a negative it would be that balance is still shifting. Considering the amount of mechs and weapons though that shouldnt be too surprising and currently MWO is in its most balanced state. All weapons, with exception to flamers and maybe MG, have a role in the game. I think its up to  you to find out what mech and weapon you think might suit your style.\n\nThis game is far from perfect but it has a caring community and developers willing to listen to its community (which has led to some people even thinking they listen too much to us...). Great gameplay and options for most play styles and the design of the mechs kept me hooked onto to game, so I suggest that everyone can give this game a shot, its f2p afterall.","January 16","true","211.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is my favorite free to play game hands down. If you like fps,give this game a try. It can be a little daunting. It is fairly complex. There are endless variations for loadouts on mechs and play styles that go best with certain loadouts. You have to balance power, cooling,ammo,rate of fire,etc. You have to put in effort if you want to have fun. This means learning how to play your chosen mech and unlocking upgrades for mech to give you a bit more of an edge. Modules for mech also play a big roll. To give a couple of examples,these can be consumables in the form of coolant shots that greatly reduse heat in one shot or weapon modules the increase the rate of fire or range on a particular weapon. Your loadouts are fully customizable. This is a great game!","January 5","true","53.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The graphics are nice. The customization of the mechs is nice. The handling of the mechs is great. It all feels "right."\n\nThere are plenty of memorable and epic moments to be found even though the missions are typically fairly short. The maps are nice and varied, allowing for the different classes of mechs to have environments where they fair very well in one game and very poorly in another. This adds challenge and forces adaptation of play style.\n\nUpdates are still occurring, including new mapes and, recently, a new play mode.\n\nThe system by which mechs and skills can be upgraded is reasonable and does not always require actual money for the transactions. I have played over 100 hours without spending a dollar, though soon I plan to make some purchases - there are things worth buying, after all, you just don't HAVE to buy them. This is definitely not a pay to win game.\n\nGenerally, if you like mechs and PvP on-line games, its pretty good. I spend some time with it almost every day.\n\nNow for my only gripe:\n\nThe only thing wrong with this game is the number of trolls playing it.\n\nSure, die first and then spend the entire rest of the round typing about how everyone else and their mech loadout sucks.\n\nSure, pilot a light mech and then refuse to acquire targets so that the slower but more powerful long range mechs can use your scouting to rain hell down on your enemies.\n\nAnd let us not forget the necessity of having a mute button so that we don't have to listen to the constant nagging of the 5 different "commanders" in every company.\n\nThis game is designed to be a team event - consistantly winning any of its various mission types requires team work and an understanding not only of your own mech's/ lance's capabilities and strengths, but also an understanding of and cooperation with the strengths and capabilites of the other lances you are fighting with. Never the less, almost every single mission ends up being a free for all skirmish followed by idiotic critiques by people who have too much time to type while everyone else is fighting.\n\nThis is why I don't usually play on-line games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Carchomatic/recommended/342200/","Carchomatic","Carchomatic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Carchomatic/","10 products in account","Looking for the honest opinion of a veteran of big stompy robot goodness?  Someone with an intimate understanding of even the smallest game mechanics, and who can give an objective review for all of MWO's features without sugar-coating them?  Well sit back and read on potential mechwarrior.  I, the venerable Carchemish (in-game name) do kinda sorta fit that description.  Mostly.\n\nI'll break this down into what MWO is, and what it is not.  First the 'is':\n\n-  Mechwarrior Online is a player vs player, team arena style game set in the venerable Battletech universe.\n-  It is a beautifully rendered game, both in the landscapes and of course the mechs.  PGI has done a fantastic job making the mechs look amazing, especially given the awful source material. Anyone familiar with the old crappy Battletech "artwork" knows what I mean.  I really can’t say enough about this.  I’m always blown away by how they continue to make such gorgeous mechs from such bad original art\n-  It is a great blend of slow, build-up-to-the-fight, and then fast paced action.\n-  You’ll have a huge mech variety to explore.  Want to race across the map in a fast, agile scout?  Done.  Want to slowly lumber into the battle in a behemoth carrying a blistering array of guns?  Make it happen.\n-  MWO is well balanced across the two opposing factions, the Inner Sphere and the Clans.  Those familiar with the BT lore will know how insanely strong Clan tech was compared to the Inner Sphere.  PGI has done a very good job of balancing the two sides without entirely neutering the Clans.\n-  MWO has an appreciable learning curve, and will take some time to fully absorb.  The actual gameplay is essentially point and shoot, but the mech and weapon variety will take a while to get used to.\n\nNow for the 'is not':\n\n-  MWO has no PVE content (yet).  If you prefer a story-driven game with missions and NPCs and such, this may not be the game for you.\n-  MWO is not a ‘fast action all the time’ game.  Players will have to scout, find the enemy, set themselves up in the best positions they can, maneuver on the fly, and duke it out with the other team.  Planning and forethought will help you win games. Which brings me to my next point.\n-  Mechwarrior Online is NOT a single player game.  It is a team effort which rewards players for working with their cohorts.  Running off by yourself (with few exceptions) will likely get you and your team murdered.\n-  It is by no means a perfect game.  It has bugs, though they are few in number.  The mech balancing isn’t complete, though they continue to work on that.\n-  It is not “pay to win”.  This one deserves some attention.  Yes, there are some mechs (the so-called “hero” variants) which can only be purchased with real cash, but in most cases they are actually inferior to the standard variants!  So why would you buy them in the first place, you ask?  Hero mechs provide a c-bill (in game currency) boost when playing them, so they’re a good way to earn more money to buy more mechs!  And when I say “inferior”, I mean marginally so in most cases.  Sometimes they are just as good.   And yes you can purchase mech packages with real money, but they offer no advantage over other players who choose to grind out the in-game money!\n-  It is not World of Tanks!\n\nAll in all, MWO is a solid game with a lot of playability and huge potential for even more features in the future.  If you enjoy the PvP experience, and are into the mech genre, this one won’t disappoint.  I fully recommend it, so long as you know what you’re getting into.

'Mech customization is very thorough, and combat is supremely fun. It requires a lot of teamwork, and is slower-paced than a typical shooter.\n\nHowever, waiting for Community Warfare matches can be very frustrating. This area of the game seems particularly poorly designed. I frequently wait 10-30 minutes on a match, which for the most part renders this mode unplayable for me and a lot of other players.\n\nBecause the game is entirely dependent on teamwork, whether you win or lose a match doesn't have as much to do with individual skill, and so when you wind up on a team full of noobs or uncooperative players, it's a landslide loss. That's usually how matches go. When your team works together and communicates, win or lose, it's incredibly fun, but the overwhelming majority of my matches involve silent, uncooperative, and/or seemingly bewildered players, which unfortunately has a dramatic effect on the quality and trajectory of the resulting gameplay.\n\nThe ranking system isn't particularly fair. I'm a good player but remain stuck in the bottom-ranked "tier" 5 because my teams lose most of the time. You can have a great match, sticking with your team, doing lots of damage, pulling off great tactics, and your rank will still go down if your team loses. It can be frustrating when you are stuck playing with new and low-skill players because your success is overwhelmingly dependent on the team effort. I understand that wins and losses should play into your ranking but they need to adjust the formula to account more for match performance.\n\nCombat is far too focused on the use of Long Range Missiles (LRM's), the "noob tubes" of the game. Not only do they do quite a bit of damage, but they lock onto you and can hit you behind obstacles (except for tall buildings or geographical features). There is also a consumable item called a UAV that allows the enemy team to spot you without having line of sight, making the use of these LRM's even easier (granted, UAV's can be shot down but they don't show on your minimap). What this means is that the overwhelming majority of matches play exactly the same, regardless of game type (Assault, Domination, Skirmish, etc.)--you hide behind obstacles while people with LRM's slug it out, and this involves a lot of waiting because LRM's have double the range of smaller energy weapons. It's just a shame for the most boring and easy-to-use weapon to be so dominant in almost every single match, more so on some levels than others of course.\n\nThe game has been out for several years and the updates pretty much focus on release of new mechs, so I doubt any of these issues will be resolved, and may or may not even be regarded as issues by the developer or the broader community, depending on who you ask.","April 2","true","50.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I played competitive CS and Battlefield most recently at a high level. My usertag back then was "3N3RGY".\n\nI have friends from MechWarrior 4 that have been waiting for the newest installment of MechWarrior since 2003. I, myself, and others, literally built PCs (computers) for this game when it was announced. Everyone had VERY high expectations. I played the game in beta and upon release.\n\nThe game had numerous drama since, and if I talked about it all, I could write a 100 page paper. I'll try to keep it short. I'm stll a bit salty because I feel this game, MWO, has a lower skill-cap than MechWarrior 4, but there are simply NO mech games on the market. Thus, if one is looking for a "mech" fps game, then this is it.\n\nI still wish the game implemented suicide options for the mech, crouch ability, active/passive radar ability, and more freedom with movement, as-well as bigger maps and weapons with longer ranges with high skill cap to allow more elite/skilled players to master that have more hours in the game, to show their expertise over more novice gamers. I feel currently with the way the game is setup, a good player can peak at 100hours, and there wouldn't be THAT much difference with someone at 1000hours, but this skill cap just isn't that high (i.e. CS:GO).\n\nAnyway, as mentioned before, there are simply no other mech games that compare, thus I have to recommend. I guess I also have immense nostalgia from MechWarrior 4, and I truly have not met, not in Battlefield or Counter-strike or ANY game I played, as many DEDICATED, DIE-HARD battletech fans as you find in MechWarrior. There has been a lot of critiscim on PGI and Russ Bullock, but they have made efforts thus far and I have to support though (Though I am still banned on MWO Forums and they refuse to change my ingame name, "ENERGY").\n\nNevertheless, try the game, love or hate it, it is one of the best if not best mech game on the market currently. I would love to write a more comprehensive review, since the drama around this game has been insane, but instead I recommend new players log-on to HPG outreach on reddit, as it's a very good MWO resource.\n\nEnergy signing off....","December 12, 2015","true","884.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Oh and machine guns don't cost 10 quid like some F2P games do. *Looks at Planetside 2*\n\nOh and I have played since closed beta in 2012. For whatever that's worth.\n\nBut yeah, onto what makes MWO good and better than atleast 100% F2P launches on Steam in 2015.\nIT'S NOT P2W\nShock, horror a F2P game on Steam that isn't P2W? The humanity!\nSure you can pay for 'mechs with the ingame MC and they can be rather expensive, so my advice? Don't, it's easy to rack up money with the cadet bonus which extends to 25 games netting you around 10mil, the tutorial gives you like 5 million to start and doesn't force you to purchase stupid things for the sake of a tutorial that 5 mil it gives you, is all yours.\nSpeaking of money, let's talk in game money 'mech prices. The cheapest is currently the Locust, a 20 light 'mech, starting at around 1,388,241 and peak at  1,777,326 C-bills. This doesn't include upgrade costs like Double heat sinks or endo steel structures or even the paramont need for an XL engine, which can easily cost around 5/7,000,000 C-Bills on a light 'mech.\nThe most expensive? The Executioner a 95 ton Clan 'mech that can 'sprint' for short durations, has jumpjets and some of the most tanky hitboxes seen in any Clan 'mech. Ranging from 17,505,967 to 18,142,422 C-bills (In lore it was far more expensive at around 36,000,000 C-Bills so thank God that isn't a thing.)\nThere are however 'mech packs released occassionaly on the Website, these typically contain 4 Battle/Omni Mechs.\n\nBattlemech packs including Clan IIC 'mechs start off at $20 and peak at $80.\nOmnimech packs start at $30 and speak at $120.\nThese little packs can be hit or miss, personally I'd only go for them when released as they have a 'Early Adopter' bonus which gives more value to the pack within the first 30 days of it originally going on sale.\n\nPGI have recently started doing solo packs as well starting off with the venerable Urbanmech, followed by everyone's fave the Marauder, in January the Warhammer, February the Rifleman and finally in March the good old Archer. These are $20 for the standard pack which has three variants and a little bit extra on the side, the collector's which has a nice paint job for the 'Prime' variant and a 30% C-Bill increase for that 'mech which is $40 and the Hero add-on which is $15 and can be purchased with either the Collector's or the Standard.\n\nThere is a grind, like every game practically ever. And is frustrating at start, you may get hate for starting which is stupid yet it happens everywhere, still don't let what they say bog you down, they most likely started off in the same place a while back. To minimize stress and whatnot, look at the forums and search for in game units, they most likely will have a teamspeak server or something on those lines and trust me, premaking is what makes this game amazing, the fact you have a team you can actually talk to and will listen to orders if given and also, y'know you can talk to people rather than yourself when playing a game, which is good. Before you know it, you'll have like ten games played and the time would've flied.\n\nI rate this game, legit, 8.5/10, it's a Mechwarrior game, it's not the perfect Mechwarrior game, but they're taking it in a nice direction ever since they seperated from IGP.\n\nPlay it.","December 31, 2015","true","342.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

The gameplay is slower and more tactical than about any other FPS on the market, not only in the way you have to focus on team play but also how you have to fight. With the ability to destroy parts of the enemy mech you have to make choices in the heat of the battle, do you go for the kill by destroying the center torso or do you first destroy their ability to fight efficiently by destroying their weapons (arms and/or side torso)? The game gives you a lot of different possibilities on how you want to fight, just keep in mind, this game will punish you hard of you try to do the "Rambo".\n\nThe game has its problems, game balance is a big one that has plagued the community for a long time. With 3 big weapon kinds (laser, ballistics, missiles) and with different weight classes and kinds of each of those makes getting everything equally  viable, very hard. And since the two factions both have their own variants of almost all the weapons with range, dmg etc differing between them, I imagine that its hell to make it all balanced. PGI do try and each patch has new tweaks to make it better. (Some times they do fail big time! ;)\n\nGraphics and sound are really good, all crankt up the game looks amazing, sadly turning the settings down gives you an edge since you will have better visibility due to less particles in the air, less effects from weapons etc.\n\nSeen some people saying that there is pay2win in MWO, but there isn't, there is no weapons, armour, "gold ammo" etc you can buy for real money. You can buy colours, skins, cockpit items, premium time (extra XP and cash rewards) and mechs. The newest mechs are only available for cash for a time after release, they will then come available for in-game currency. And since "new" mech doesn't equal "best" mech I fail to see the problem with that. F2P games need to make money and this is probably the best way they can do that with the player count they have. There is no content locked behind levels or any such nonsense (looking at you WoT, Warframe etc ). You can buy any mech in the game if you can afford them, want the first mech you buy to be a 100ton murder machine? No problem, with the in game currency you will make from completing the tutorial and your 25 first matches will reward you with extra cash (Cadet bonus, I believe that still in effect?) you will have lots of cash to spend on your first mech, I would recommend that you don't buy the most expensive one you can find, read the forums for great tips on what to go for depending on what weigh class you want to play.\n\nTry it and don't give up just because to die without killing any one your first match! Believe it took me 5 matches before I got my first kill and man was it rewarding after all the fail in previous matches! ;)\n\nI also recommend checking out the forums, MWO has a great community and will help new players with tips and tricks for getting started. Many will also drop in game with you and help you, great community of guys and gals!\n","April 10","true","88.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The addition of Community Warfare last year upped the intensity of the game. PGI has really listened to the community and added funcitionality while maintaining balanced play.

This is NOT Battletech – and shouldn’t even be allowed to wear the name.\n\nIf you are a Battletech fan and want to play this because of Battletech, leave now. Do not play MechWarrior Online!!\n\nHere are just a small list of the glaring examples of how MWO has nothing to do with Battletech:\nPin-point fire.\nNo physical attacks.\nWater has no effect on movement.\n2. General game play issues.\n\nCommunity Warfare leaves a lot to be desired. Quite simply, it’s pointless and boring.\n\nThe game needs more maps – maybe slow down on the ‘Mech releases and create more maps for a while.  (Though I really do love seeing Marauders and WarHammers in the game.)\n\nWith the exception of River City the redesigned maps haven’t really impressed me.  Forest Colony is especially horrible; it went from being my favorite map in the game – by far – to my third most hated (after Terra Therma and Viridian Bog.)\n\nWhat I love about MechWarrior Online:\nIf this game was called Giant Stompy Robots Online (GSRO) – which is what I am going to call it from here on out – I would be a pretty big fan of the game.\n\nThe improvements made to GSRO in the last year or more have been slow, but plentiful and (generally) well done.  It's true that PGI may never repair the trust they lost with many of us Founders; however, as a generic Giant Stompy Robot shooter goes, it is good and getting better.\n\nThe quirk system is mostly working, 'Mech modules are a neat way to add minor (but helpful) features to your 'Mech, and any balance problems seem to be minor.  Remember, an online game like this is always in flux as the players and meta-game change.\n\nIf you’re the type of person like likes to play a game for 30 minutes, knock out a couple of drops then return to reality, you can’t go wrong with Giant Stompy Robots Online.  If you’re like me and you binge play for a few hours once a week, you still can’t go wrong with Giant Stompy Robots Online.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs much as I do not want to like this game – (I want to hate GSRO and I want to keep making horribly offensive remarks toward the PGI development team) – but I can’t keep hating it. Some day, someone will make a real Battletech/MechWarrior game, until then Giant Stompy Robots Online will keep me entertained.\n\nHate: It’s NOT Battletech no matter how you try to ram that down my throat.\n\nLove: It is a good Giant Stompy Robot Shooter.  The changes they have made in the last few months really have improved the game substantially.\n\nAgainst my own angst and animosity toward MechWarrior Online and PGI, I would not be a fair reviewer if I did not recommend the game.  I play it, I have fun, and I look forward to playing it more.  Just remember, it is NOT Battletech or anything legitimately belonging to the Battletech/MechWarrior IP.","January 24","true","23.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The combat gets my heart racing so fast. Exhilarating combat experiences await when you have a good team leader and team mates.\nHowever, if you are flying solo, it can turn into a complete slaughterfest very quickly and very often. This game needs to be played with a group of people who are willing to march as one coherent group.\n\nThen we have the game store. This completely kills it for me. if you have the money you can buy everything you want. No need to grind in-game credits when you can avoid it entirely with $20-50. This makes the grind a wall setup to impede free players.\nWhat my biggest gripe of all is there is no way to expand your mech capacity for free. You have to spend hundreds in order to collect these mechs. And collecting is fun! It's not fun selling your hard grind just to make room for another mech. This one shot the score down for me. I would be willing to forgive most of the shop, but not this one.\n\nPros:Beautiful graphics.\nThe world and the mech models are amazing.\n\nAmazing combat.\nThis combat is action packed when it heats up and you can feal the heat! Some feel the fights are too slow paced. I however like it. Big hulking machines pounding each other as if there is no tomorrow.\n\nCompletely team oriented.\nYou need team work or you fall apart fast! This is kind of a con at the same time if you don't find a team to play with. You wont have as much fun if you solo queue.\n\nVOIP built in.\nIt doesn't sound bad and mostly works well. Still recommend using your own VOIP with the team you play with. Communication is key in this game and this was well needed to be built in.\nCons:Too few free mech slots.\nYou end up having to buy additional space for your mechs with real money. If you dont have space for another, you have to sell it. That's terrible!\n\nMicroTransation store can purchase anything and has exclusives mechs.\nThis store is completely anti-free player. It has the essential Mech garages (needed to increase mech slots), exclusive mechs and every mech available. There is nothing you can't buy with this store.\nNo free way to obtain this pay currency on a regular basis.\n\nNeedless Grind.\nThe games grind is 100% setup to hold free players back. The store is a shortcut to buy your way out of it.\n\nMatch Making.\nIt will put you up against a complete pre-made.

Someone with an intimate understanding of even the smallest game mechanics, and who can give an objective review for all of MWO's features without sugar-coating them?  Well sit back and read on potential mechwarrior.  I, the venerable Carchemish (in-game name) do kinda sorta fit that description.  Mostly.\n\nI'll break this down into what MWO is, and what it is not.  First the 'is':\n\n-  Mechwarrior Online is a player vs player, team arena style game set in the venerable Battletech universe.\n-  It is a beautifully rendered game, both in the landscapes and of course the mechs.  PGI has done a fantastic job making the mechs look amazing, especially given the awful source material. Anyone familiar with the old crappy Battletech "artwork" knows what I mean.  I really can’t say enough about this.  I’m always blown away by how they continue to make such gorgeous mechs from such bad original art\n-  It is a great blend of slow, build-up-to-the-fight, and then fast paced action.\n-  You’ll have a huge mech variety to explore.  Want to race across the map in a fast, agile scout?  Done.  Want to slowly lumber into the battle in a behemoth carrying a blistering array of guns?  Make it happen.\n-  MWO is well balanced across the two opposing factions, the Inner Sphere and the Clans.  Those familiar with the BT lore will know how insanely strong Clan tech was compared to the Inner Sphere.  PGI has done a very good job of balancing the two sides without entirely neutering the Clans.\n-  MWO has an appreciable learning curve, and will take some time to fully absorb.  The actual gameplay is essentially point and shoot, but the mech and weapon variety will take a while to get used to.\n\nNow for the 'is not':\n\n-  MWO has no PVE content (yet).  If you prefer a story-driven game with missions and NPCs and such, this may not be the game for you.\n-  MWO is not a ‘fast action all the time’ game.  Players will have to scout, find the enemy, set themselves up in the best positions they can, maneuver on the fly, and duke it out with the other team.  Planning and forethought will help you win games. Which brings me to my next point.\n-  Mechwarrior Online is NOT a single player game.  It is a team effort which rewards players for working with their cohorts.  Running off by yourself (with few exceptions) will likely get you and your team murdered.\n-  It is by no means a perfect game.  It has bugs, though they are few in number.  The mech balancing isn’t complete, though they continue to work on that.\n-  It is not “pay to win”.  This one deserves some attention.  Yes, there are some mechs (the so-called “hero” variants) which can only be purchased with real cash, but in most cases they are actually inferior to the standard variants!  So why would you buy them in the first place, you ask?  Hero mechs provide a c-bill (in game currency) boost when playing them, so they’re a good way to earn more money to buy more mechs!  And when I say “inferior”, I mean marginally so in most cases.  Sometimes they are just as good.   And yes you can purchase mech packages with real money, but they offer no advantage over other players who choose to grind out the in-game money!\n-  It is not World of Tanks!\n\nAll in all, MWO is a solid game with a lot of playability and huge potential for even more features in the future.  If you enjoy the PvP experience, and are into the mech genre, this one won’t disappoint.  I fully recommend it, so long as you know what you’re getting into.  Last thing…getting a hold of a decent headset/mic and Teamspeak will make your mech life much easier.\n\nHope to see you on the battlefield!\n\nCarchemish the Wise and Powerful","December 12, 2015","true","395.2"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","21","42","3","0"

It fills in that niche giant robot slot you've been craving.\nThe game appears like your poorly-interactive-MMORPG at first glance (it took me a couple days to figure out just WTF is going on in the Mechlab), but once you get the hang of the wealth of information presented, it becomes much more intuitive. Every piece on the screen, in-game or in-menu, serves a purpose and tells you something. It just takes a bit to get used to it.\nThe piloting segment of the game is very fun but is a challenge to do well. Many aspects are occuring at once, and it's up to you to manage them all effectively (ex. heat management, ammo, presenting armor, etc.). If you are a tanker (World of Tanks, War Thunder, Armored Warfare, etc.) you can apply your knowledge directly to this game and do pretty well. If you aren't, the learning curve is about the same. The idea is to play smarter, not harder. Coordinate with your team and you'll likely take home the big money.\nMy biggest credit to this game after playing more Pay2Win games is the free-to-play model. The game is very much playable for free; in fact, the game will help you grind for your first 'Mech, and even so, supplies you with "rental" Trial 'Mechs throughout the game. There also isn't a progression tree, so you choose what you want to play, grind it out, and get the one you want. Beyond that, the Mechlab will allow you to customize the components on your 'Mech to suit basically any playstyle (look up B33f's Direstar build: it's a riot!). All of this is free, you don't have to pay a dime to them. The cosmetics of your mech will be what they grab cash out of you on, but that is entirely optional.\nAfter seeing so many dull, indless games come up, it's good to see a game that requires a good mind. I would definitely recommend this game.","May 25","true","302.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The developers prioritze money (overpriced mechpacks) over any real content, it's shown through the lack of finished content added to the game in the last two years. If you really want to give it a try, go for it, just set your standards low. It's not a AAA title, its not even close to finished. In fact there's little this game does well. If you want to know more, please read below, and thank you for your time.\n\nMy experience: I've played off and on since its release, mostly off, because the game hasn't changed much since release. A few maps have been added, but the over all main problems are still in the game. The worst part being the developers lack of effort to really fix them.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Its freaking mechs!! Battle Tech Mechs!\n\n- They hold monthlyish contests in the Clan Warfare. Though CW is in beta and widely considered trash. Seriously its terrible. I'm not sure why they keep pushing people to play it.\n\n- The community is helpful, only if you agree with them though. Dont say the game is bad around them lol.\n\n- Its Free, but more on that in the cons.\n\n- They do give you just enough to buy a low level mech at the start. Which is only a little nice since you'll be in that mech for a long time until you can buy another. The trail mechs are a joke and you don't gain exp on the mechs.\n\n- Voting system for the 3 game modes. So you'll rarely have to play the terrible Conquest game mode or the terrible maps.\n\n- The tutorial is probably the most polished part of the game. Note: They didn't make it, a third party did, which is why it looks nice\n\nI honestly cant think of more things I like about the game. If I do ill add them. Now for the long list of cons.\n\nCONS:\n\n- PGI cant stop the hackers. Seriously.\n\n- Global chat is NOT the game. It may be to limit people from knowing how many players are on.\n\n- The UI for the mech bay is terrible, and that's after they revamped it.\n\n- The UI for your friends/Unit/and LFG window is just a crappy block window. It doesn't even have ranks for your Unit.\n\n- Few maps, made even fewer by the vote system. You'll constantly play same 5ish maps over and over because most of the maps are just that badly designed, and no one wants to play on them.\n\n- Only ~3 game modes. Skirmish, TDM, and Conquest. Skirmish and TDM are pretty much the same. Conquest is the worst mode due to the maps not being designed for it and teammates not knowing what do to. So\n\n-  Its freaking mechs!!

It may be to limit people from knowing how many players are on.\n\n- The UI for the mech bay is terrible, and thats after they revamped it.\n\n- The UI for your friends/Unit/and LFG window is just a crappy block window. It doesnt even have ranks for your Unit.\n\n- Few maps, made even fewer by the vote system. You'll constantly play same 5ish maps over and over because most of the maps are just that badly designed, and no one wants to play on them.\n\n- Only ~3 game modes. Skirmish, TDM, and Conquest. Skirmish and TDM are pretty much the same. Conquest is the worst mode due to the maps not being designed for it and teammates not knowing what do to. So almost every match in any game mode will boil down to death balling from cover until a team has a huge lead.\n\n- The balance in this game is all over the place, because PGI will completely destroy a weapons/mechs and leave them broken with little hope of ever fixign them. Their style is to nuke the flavor of the past 6 months instead of trying to bring the game to a blanced playing field.\n\n- The monetization of the game is quite possiblely one of the worst I've ever seen. From Mechs packs being sold from $30 bucks to an astonishing $220. Thats a premium price for an unfinished game that doesnt have a bright future in terms of content.\n\n- The Free part of the game is laughable. Only mechs may be bought with in-game money at an exorbitant price for each one. Then you have to buy weapons, a new engine, modules, for your mech. The cost alone to deck out a mech far exceeds the cost of the mech it's self sometimes. If you want to max out said mech you have to repeat that process , except the modules, for 2 more times to buy the other variants. That whole process will take months of play just to max out a SINGLE mech. Math: You will make around ~100,000 C-bills a match. Mechs range from 12mil to 20mil or more. And thats just for the mech, not all the gear. Also those other variants you will buy are most of the time really bad.\n\n- Cosmetics cost around 15 bucks to really make a  SINGLE   mech look unique.\n\n- Gameplay is stale af and slooowww\n\n- The common tactic is to just shoot and go into cover, and sit there until a team has a large number advantage. If you have dreams of being a brawler, keep dreamig.\n\n- Maps end up being narrow/wide long range path ways with little cover to effectively push up and get close to enemy mechs. Leading to my point above.\n\n- The meta is centered around alpha striking only (How much damage and be done in a single shot.) Rarely will you see someone going a DPS build because that dont work. The DPS weapons need to be up close to be effective. See above why that sucks.\n\n- The sounds effects and motions of the mechs dont feel visceral. Giant 25-100 ton mechs walking around dont feel very large. The massive weapons dont sound like the 16inch cannon they are suppose to really feel/sound like. Even the more power weapons feel like their smaller counter parts.\n\n- Clan Warfare is the biggest joke in the game. If your Unit takes a planet from someone else...good job. Thats all you get. C-bill reward is higher for each match, but you need 4 fully fleshed mechs to really be on par with the enemy, and if you dont do well you wont get a great reward. Also you will be mostly playing against a 12 man team. Thus making solo dropping pointless unless you want you be fighting a losing battle from the start.\n\n- The community is torn into two groups those who are burned by the developers who not making the game the promised and those who spent too much money on the game to see it die and watch their money go to waste. Just check the message boards on Steam, Reddit, and dont bother on their main forum. They auto delete/downvote any criticism that isn't praising the game at the sametime. Seriously I'll be surprise if you see this review.\n\n- A small development team means VERY SLOW small releases if they arent delayed for months.\n\n- The small development team has a long history of lies to their player base about what content they are working on.\n\n- Graphic are just ok, and battle damage looks like something made in MSPaint.","December 10, 2015","false","12.5"," 88 of 177 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","88","177","8","1"

For better or worse, their love of what this game "could be" keeps them both playing and being positive about the game as a whole.\n\nAs far as positives there are some great members of the MWO community, and early on that kept me playing this game. As a founder unfortunately I don't have similiar feelings about the developers but my feelings are less important then the facts.\n\nWhen advertising for the game began several promises were made about the type of game being delievered. Mech warrior online would be a "....the Mechwarrior you know. It's a fully first-person. It's not a new interpretation."  "Players will be able to band together in the format of a lance..... they'll be able to band together as a mercnary coporation for hire.... to customize the look and feel ..... how they enter battle, the lances, their names, ranks, and all kinds of things."\n"Anything that would affect or give you a tactical advantage, you can't purchase with real cash."\n\nI could continue quoting unrealized promises and quickly run over the character limit for reviews so I will sumarize.\n\nOf the "four pillars" of gameplay (mech, role, community, information) at best two are fully realized.\nYou can both purchase mechs/items with real money and some of the meta (most useful in the current game) mechs can not be purchased without a cash purchase.\n\nThe idea of community warfare and therefore the ability to act as a "mercenary" is completely non-existant even though it was heavily talked about.\n\nNews/lore relevant to actual gameplay (arguably another part of community warfare, but still missing)\n\nA single player campaign, PVE, the explicit statement that there would be no 3rd person, coolant flush/shots, priority strikes (improved usuables only available with real money).\n\nThe devs also had several at best insulting statements to large portions of the community on multiple occasions, claiming that same old "small vocal minority".\n\nThere are multiple instances of employees acting out towards individuals in the mwo community, there are certainly claims on both sides, but several instances of them acting out without just cause, including the entire banning of huge groups of players, then later saying they would unban anyone who asked nicely. Theres no doubt they unjustly banned players to ever make such an offer.\n\nOn top of this the game has only gotten more punishing for new players with hard to understand hidden mechanics, the worst example being "ghost heat".\n\nOn all of these, simply google them, no need to take my word.

If you have assistance breaking the learning curve and have friends that you can communicate with you will have a much better experience like most games.\n\nOne final complaint is the horrid grind to "master" specific mechs and the game often puts you in uncomfortable positions grinding out currency to pay for varients of the mech you want.\n\nI would recommend this game but its to steep of a curve for new players mixed with the toxicity of the veteran community.

But that is only once and each new mech requires some basic upgrades like double heatsinks, a necessary update at 1.5 million for every mech, endo-steel, and new engines and weapons. After you get one mech you need to master 2 other variants of the same chassis to unlock the skills required to compete with veterans who have been playing for a long time.\n\nThe queue times are probably the biggest killer, taking 5+ minutes to find a basic match for the game's most common game mode and that's the fastest it gets. Community Warfare queues can take up to 30 minutes.\n\nGame modes in this game are all really simplistic with the TDM and team conquest styles because really basic kill-all-enemies is fine but the community warfare mode is completely lacking on any deeper roles or meaning despite it being supposedly the final game mode for faction vs faction warfare. Factions are so empty that everyone jumps around to whatever faction has enough people and there's no meaning to planetary losses or gains.\n\nOverall, this game has been developed poorly for years, minimal viable product being an actual term used to describe it by the developers, and this is just an attempt to gain a few more people before the game goes under. The free to play game is usually described as having whales to make money and a large amount of people to fill the game so everyone's happy. MWO is a game that only has whales left and they're desperate for the game to appeal to people who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on this game.\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","251.2"," 46 of 93 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","46","93","7","0"

It can be a fun game, and is most of the time, but there is a ludicrous amount of grinding to make progress, even for a free to play game.\n\n15+ hours of gameplay to unlock a single top tier mech is ridiculous, especially when you have to buy three variants (all for full price, mind you) to maximize the potential of a single mech. This adds up to hundreds of hours played to field a decent mech of each weight class, and when new mechs are released which are clearly superior to mechs already in circulation, the frustration caused by either devoting over a hundred hours of your time just to stay competitive is... significant.\n\nHopefully the steam release will increase the size of the community enough to motivate PGI to fix the balance issues and ease the grind but I am not optimistic.","December 10, 2015","false","74.4"," 43 of 87 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","43","87","4","0"

A love that this game has poisoned.\n\nAs a gamer, is this a terrible game? No. It sorta works, there is some fun to be had here. The F2P model is terrible, its grindy and expensive. Worse than wargaming games. But if you throw away some money and grind forever, it can be fun. Sadly, the whole 'outfit your mech' doesnt work well here. You generally have to set your mech up with whatever flavor of the month builds are working to be competitive. If you end up wasting your hard earned cash on the wrong part and/or mech, you're in for a bad time. Even some of the paid stuff is garbage.\n\nAs a battletech game, it is blasphemy. Nothing is right about this game, the devs know nothing about battletech. They just jumped on the license, hired someone else to make this game.. then fired those guys and went on to milk battletech fans for their money. Now they are here to milk you for your money. Seriously, go watch some of their videos. They are canadian car salesmen, not programmers or gamers.\n\nUltimately, I hate this game, I hate the devs, and I hate the spineless legion of white knights who hold this turd up in the spotlight. Most positive reviews will come from these guys, they are all 500+ dollars in and they desperately do not want the game to die. They want you to play and will say anything to get you to play. They are sad broken people, and if you do get sucked into scam warrior online you will end up sad and broke as well.\n\nUPDATE: Just to be sure i tried the steam version. Some things are better than i remember, some things are worse. The most dissapointing issue is that groups of 2 are still put against groups of up to 9+. So if you want to play with just one friend, you are doomed to constant and quick defeats. And no, the devs will not fix this. This is INTENTIONAL. They are feeding you to their whales who have dropped $1000's into this game.\n\nAlso the time to kill is way too low. You spend 90% of the time loading, and walking to the spot where you will die.

Those were good times indeed.\n\nIn those days I had happened upon a copy of MechWarrior 2, after being an obsessive fan of sci-fi simulation games like X-Wing, and strapped in to my first Mech Simulator and powered up - "All Systems Nominal." Everything got better from there that is until the Golden Century of Gaming had ended and the Great League of Publishers fell into dissarray (or were destroyed by the Word of EA and Microsoft).\n\nAfter a decade or so of players keeping MW alive, with the franchise having fallen into the dusbtin of history, and MW5 being destroyed by the evil of publishers a kickstarter-like (but not really a kickstarter) declared MW was back in 2012, and with promises that it would be "awesome."\n\nWas it in fact awesome? Let's see.\n\nThe Space Lords of "Freemium" - Latin for Not Really\nAs most people may be aware, the first games in this unique series were made with a quality standard for premium type games. However, MW had been reborn, as a Freemium in 2012, made by developer Piranha known for classic games like Duke Nukem Forever Multiplayer and Bass Fish Gaming? Where is Jordan Weisman? No clue. The Nostalgia Was Strong and I threw my money into the 5 million dollar pile and be a glorified Beta Tester for 2 years.\n\nFor those that know me, I have a love-hate relationship and low tolerance for plenty of OTHER F2P type games and approached this game with trepidation. I gave it my best shot. A series, once based on the old BattleTech franchise, and doing the bidding of Space Lords from your Cockpit with detailed, branching Single-Player with an addictive, bonus Multiplayer - became this. I'll get to that at the end, but firstly what to expect out of this review:  My honest take on the game and what you can expect, either as someone brand new to this series or those who were aware of the original franchise.\n\nThe Basics - Is this the review now?You shoot at Walking Tanks with an assortment of space magic weapons like lasers, huge ballistic cannons, and missiles\nYou move around a battlefield to destroy the other team's Mechs, earning in-game currency to buy more Mechs, parts, or modules\nYou can tinker with a Mech and experiment with different designs, not unlike previous games, but problems arise (weapons, how fast you move, armor levels, etc.) + base/weapon stats can be upgraded via modules and 'pilot tree' (recommended)\nMechs are layered into pieces that you can shoot off individually (if the enemy has a laser in their right arm, you can shoot off that arm)\n'Twitch' based shooter that plays well enough with the keyboard/mouse, joystick, or a combination\nMatched against random Robots with (when it works) similar skill in 'Solo' on random maps\nThere is no story, only LARPing\nIf you want all the Robots prepare to hunker down for many days at a time, perhaps months, otherwise you can follow the whispers of PGI to open up your wallet (kind of like zealot ComStar hoarders)\nA tutorial is available, but there is somewhat of a learning curve if you are not used to quasi-simulations like MW\nDetractorsPricing - this isn't like MechWarrior you may have remembered paying 60 bucks for and being able to pilot hundreds of Mechs to your hearts content.\nTime commitment - if you don't have a lot of time to play games like me like an hour or two a day here and there, advancing in-game will feel like it takes ages, which will then make you feel like you need to spend cash as you fall behind everyone else and the vicious cycle repeats\nGame still has optimization issues - I can run Witcher 3 on Ultra, but this game hiccups quite a bit for me; there are also default eye-sores like film-grain and reduced/smudgy view distance (some of these things can be turned off in the menu, some can not and require editing of config files outside the game)\nWasted Potential: Or why I'm not recommending thisLack of unique or challenging Game Modes from previous games such as: Stock Mode, King of The Hill, Convoy, Co-op Missions, Terrain Control (true Conquest), or a better objective-based, etc.\nCustomization while fun to a point in this game has its own inherent problems coupled with lack of cohesion with certain mechanics, which has caused imbalances that PGI will never be able to resolve truly in a Random Matchmaker. Balance in the previous games was better handled by Admins, Lobby or bidding systems, and generally the players themselves. In both BT and MW, players decided how and what level of customization was allowed.\nLack of true variety; here Mechs at the top are sporting similar builds meant to kill an opponent as quickly as possible, with similar speeds and weapons, truckloads of endless ammo, and the only difference is how they look for nostalgia purposes. (BT and previous games have more variety with setup/rules)\nNo innovation from holdover issues of old MW games using 'pin-point' damage in Multiplay (just go for the center torso, its all that matters and its easy to do)\nThe pilot trees are the same for every Mech, so if you're looking for some depth and nuance to it there is none\nYour first Mech includes a default build, these are canon builds from the original Battletech that are meant to be used/balanced against other similarly non-customized Mechs, BUT you will never actually be matched 100% against an entire team of non-custom and rather forced into the cauldron of Super Nascars.\nNo ability to save your loadout into an in-game list for easy switching back and forth\nThe UI is clunky, laggy, and less intuitive compared to games a decade old, seriously\nLack of robust Multiplayer features on how you wish to play (no choosing of a specific map, match length preference, kill limits, whether you want sim aspects on or off such as spawning or third person, or you want to join a 2v2 4v4 8v8, IS vs IS, Clan vs Clan, etc.)\nInteresting tactical depth and sim-like aspects from past games are non-existent: Active/Passive radar, Jettison Ammo, Rear/Side internal cameras, true uncoupled free roam aim, and more - replaced by more Arcade\nMaps are smallish, usually laned or nonsensically built; the largest maps have tons of unused space.\nCommunity Warfare is somehow worse than the better MW MMO from the late 90s\nThe 'custom' servers actually require you to pay real cash to fully utilize unlike most other f2p games, and over all is unintuitive (its not like a custom DOTA2 lobby for instance)\nThe grind, for people like me who really don't have time for f2ps, was ultimately frustrating to no end; in previous games I loved using and trying EVERY Mech in the game but it takes too much time and/or money in this game.\nSummary: The Milking of Resurrected Ambitions\nThe game overall left me simply wanting MORE out of it. Sort of 'ok' for a time until it set in how much it lacks in true content, depth, and a boatload of features compared with even the tacked on Multiplayer of previous games alone, let alone SP. If you DO play various F2Ps, you may tolerate it if you're not concerned about what all was in the previous games, but if you're like me where certain F2Ps just rub you wrong way with aggressive grinds and pay2notgrind nonsense or want a TRUE MechWarrior5, this just doesn't cut it. Frankly it saddens me that THIS is all that's left of the rich MW series. This is it? A shallow husk that feels 'average.'  It would be great if someone just makes MW5, but frankly perhaps MechWarrior should just be drug out back and buried.  All in all the type of f2p design decisions in this game holds it back from being truly great.","December 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 37 of 75 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","37","75","3","2"

I stopped playing just after the release of the Clan mechs. I was disgusted with the developers choices and behavior. This made me and my friends decide to stop playing entirely. The game could be good but the developer holds it back.\n\nProsIt's a new Mechwarrior game.\nThe controls are pretty good.\nDeep and rewarding customization.\nCombat can be pretty rewarding.\nTeam play can also be rewarding.\nDeep backstory.\n\nConsThe developer.\nLong delays in changes, balance, and content releases.\nMany lies about release dates and pay to win elements.\nConvoluted and sometimes frustrating game systems (Heat Scale is the big one here)\nDid I forget to mention the developer?\nBait and switch sale tactics for content releases.\nBalance, but this is typical in a game with such freedom and inherently built-in unbalance in the original game this is based on.\nRuss Bullock, Paul Innouye (Trained by Nexon), and Bryan Eckman.\nThe grind is beyond ridiculous last I played.\nOh and finally, the Developer.\nSeriously, these guys made Navy SEALS: Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n\nNow for the long version.\nThrough a glitch in the developer's website I got an invite into the closed beta. The game was much simpler then and was actually pretty fun. I told my friends about the game, got them into the open beta, and we had a lot of fun. Then they started adding in some missing gameplay elements and we started to see how the developer was going to handle introducing systems and balancing. As timed passed we've played through an LRMpocalypse, Squawkalypse, ECMalypse, Splat-cats, Poptartpocalypse, and the Return of the LRMpocalypse: The Quirkening. We played through all of this. All during this time it seemed as if the developer that was creating these new systems were not the original developer of the game.\n\nOnce Clans were released ($500 for a gold-plated one) is when we really saw the developer's true colors. You could not purchase the 'Mechs in game unless you spent money. They were quite a bit more powerful than the regular IS 'Mechs (they technically were supposed to be...). This forced you into a terrible situation where you were playing with IS 'Mechs and losing often or spend money and winning 90% of the time. All of us gave up on the game shortly after this. We've watched the descent of the game's population ever since.\n\nThe grind, last I played, was particularly awful. It required many days of consistently good matches to be able to afford a single new chassis with no upgrades. You also could not test-drive them. If you choose the wrong one, you were out the money... no refunds.\n\nI mean, I really like Mechwarrior and Battletech. I used to have a spinning wireframe Timberwolf from Mechwarrior 2 as my Avatar. I really wanted to like this game... but, after ~2 years of abuse from the developer I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\ntl;drI do not recommend this game, especially if "[you're] on a bit of on an island".","December 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 36 of 73 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","36","73","5","2"

To start expect a heavy pay to win experience or at best a pay to not grind three weeks for a standard mech. Also expect to be charged ridiculous amounts of cash to obtain hero mechs or even just mechbays or colors/patterns. Seriously it's in the neighborhood of $30+ PER MECH. Don't even think about the bundles and such as you'll get very little for $100+. Just standard mechs you can buy in game a little faster and MAYBE a bonus mech with a slight cbill boost.\n\nOnce you get into the game expect two things. Fun stompy mech action and complete and utter bs metabuilds. In my time it went from LRMs for a brief period to PPC/Gauss builds. The PPC/Gauss was the worst because it was instant pinpoint HIGH damage. You'd wait 5-10 minutes for a match and die in seconds if you weren't in a light or assault class. Unless you got lucky matchmaking wise and the other team wasn't loaded with 5-6 metabuilds and you'd get a decent match. After the forced mech setup for matchmaking requiring x of each class it got a little more even in matches but the wait times went skyhigh. Eventually the high alpha BS and long wait times drove myself and my friends to stop playing.\n\nThe company also has issues. One of the WORST I've ever dealt with. I understand Niko left a bit ago but still damn. They also can't balance their way out of a paper bag. Things get buffed WAY too far or not remotely enough and stay that way for months if not years. It took them six months or so to even start to nerf the high alpha metagame and even then it was weak nerfs that did very little curb it. Not even the bizarre ghost heat changes ever successfully killed it. The highest alpha to a side torso or center torso is the only real way to fight with any real success.\n\nI will admit before the issues started piling up and things with the company got worse it was a blast. It really captures the stompy mech action quite well. However the magic is long gone so if you play do it without wasting money like I did. Get in, do a couple rounds for some fun, and get out when the lopsided matches get to be too much. The trial/standard mechs work well enough for light play. As long as you don't invest too much time or money it's a perfectly fine game to play a match or two on occassion.\n\nEDIT - It seems they fixed up the wait times at some point. So it's faster to get into a game. The rest still stands.","December 10, 2015","false","446.8"," 35 of 71 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","35","71","3","0"

There is generally only one major "balance pass" a year rather than iterative changes, so if the weapon is useless after the pass its probably gonna be that way for a year or more.  It dosent help things when it seems that half the balance is made with dice rolls.\n\nThe new mechlab came out 1.5 years ago and was total crap, it took them over a year to get it decently useful (at least better than the old one) and there are still features that the community wants put in, like a way to strip all the modules off all your mechs, that have been basically ignored.\n\nThere are issues with map and gamemode design.  For gamemodes, the problem is that theres only 3 modes, and most of the time theres no real difference between the 3 of them.  Map design has a tendency to funnel everyone to the same spots every game, due to a combo of defensive terrain in select areas and both teams starting spread out rather than togeather.  By the time you grouped with ur team you are under attack or about to be.  This makes most maps seem very small and cramped no matter how large they are because ur fighting in the same small defensive areas.\n\nThe time to kill (TTK) is very low as well.  There has been alot of power creep in this game to the point where a game which involves huge stompy mechs of doom that are supposed to dominate the battlefield instead plays more like COD with mechs hunkering down behind cover and popping out to fire and duck back in.  The TTK has been shinking for years  with no end or solution in sight.\n\nThere is a part of the game called "Community Warfare" (or CW) which allows you to pick one of 10 factions and fight each other for control of the galaxy.  In reality the population is too low and most of the time its the Innsershere vs the Clans which gets real old after awhile.  In addition the issues with map design and gamemodes are even worse in CW, to the point where its alot like playing a tower defence game (not even joking)\n\nTo top it all off while the game is free to play pretty much any ingame items are incredably overpriced, just look at the "Steam performace packs".  The grind is real so be prepared to either shell out alot of cash or time to get a decent mech.","December 10, 2015","false","209.3"," 119 of 240 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","119","240","4","1"

I played this game on a table top, where company-level games between two players took an hour for one turn, and I loved it.  I played many incarnations of Mechwarrior on the PC, from Cresent Hawks Inception the Mechwarrrior 4, and I loved it.  I was there in the early days of closed beta, when we still had all the goodies that Cryengine 3 could deliver, like inverse kinematics and all that, and I loved it.\n\nNow, like three years later, after launching a beta product as a general release, after not having more than two game modes between pick up death match and community warfare (and don't come back and say that there are three game modes in public death match, they all boil down to skirmish in the end), I have absolutely no reason to believe that this product is anything more than a shameless cash grab aimed at the absolute bottom of the gamer community, one that thought that the previous games were too "hard" or too "niche", as made by a developer that has a track record of making bare-bones minimum viable products, or as we like to call it for short, SHOVELWARE.\n\nThis guy Russ, whom I hope I can run into in real life on the streets of Seattle one day just so I can cry in his face about how he ♥♥♥♥♥ one of my favorite IPs and got away with it, is so desperate for good reviews he has to beg players to start Steam accounts just so they can thumbs up this crap even if they have no intention of playing it on Steam, is nothing more than a craven raider of popular titles, and he figured he hit some real pay dirt with the Battle Tech license, didn't you Russ?\n\nTLDR; This is a beloved robot combat simulator dumbed down into a mediocre arcade shooter, play if you want, but try not to spend any money on it.

But dont spend Money on it as theres no need for it for now. After few weeks , if you still like the game, drop some dimes on it. But until then let the game impress on you. The developer dont have a good track record and are known as to be incompetent.\n\nThe core  gameplay itself might be pretty fun, but after some times it gets extremly boring. Maps are bad designed- The battles going on mainly on the middle of the battlefield- same old nascaring is a big issue.\n\nYou aint see much hard content- there are only 3 gamemodes basically since a few years which all play pretty much the same. Community warfare is a very bad designed "hardcore" mode which has been abandoned by the community and pgi.\n\nSpeaking of content, you will notice that you get pretty much spammed with mechs for $ sale. After some owned mechs you ll realise  that most new mechs are a repeat of already existing mechs.\n\nSpeaking of Mechpacks, if you dont decide to buy them with $ you have to wait up to 6 months to buy them for ingame currency. And in any mechpack there allways  a broken- outperforming mech, which only get fixed  - if even - after a few months while the rest of the non package payers have to suffer facing those new broken mechs( broken in terms of hitb oxes mainly).\n\nMechpacks and pricing in that game is extremly unreasonable. Mechpacks cost between 80 and 120 dollar, which i find disturbing as you can buy 1- 3 AAA games with it.\n\nThe veteran/core  fanbase can be very ignorant to criticism. They have a bad habit of defending the game and the develeoper  even if you have a obvious and valid point to critique.\n\n\nIncome used to be terrible so it took you up to 1 or more months to colllect the ingame currency for the mech (3 variants of the same mech) and then you have to level all 3 variants up in order to benefit from unlocked modifictions such as speedtweak.)\n\nThe dev who in charge of the game mechanics and weapon balance has no clue what he is doing and is pretty much disliked by the community. Over nerfs and absurd buffs following each other.\n\nI Played the game over a year but then left when  i realized that the devs are really untrustable and incompetetent.\n\nPgi was  previously known as jarhead games.

If all you want is to kill some time and blow stuff up, its not bad. If you enjoy Battletech LORE, the Table Top game(s) then understand it does NOT exist here.\nMechwarrior: Online is a Swiss Army Knife... it tries to please everyone and pull in as big of a crowd as it can, promising the world, but never really delivers or does anything well... just "good enough" and the main focus of development is primarily centered around pushing out new Mech models.\n\nThe game as a casual “just stomp around and blow stuff up” is fun, but that’s the thin candy-coated shell that covers the bland, uninspiring empty center of the game. And this is the major reason why there are so many mixed reviews… there are many people who enjoy the casual lack of depth this game has, but there are just as many people who really wanted the depth that was promised and believed that depth to be delivered in a TIMELY fashion instead of accepting years of “Glacial Progression” about everything (such as MW:O finally got working monitors JUST in time for steam launch after years of staring at multiple “AUTO DETECT: NO” screens)\n\nAlso, it helps to understand how the upper management developers of this game work before new players consider investing into the game. Here are some examples I’d suggest reading or looking up the following issues and coming to your own conclusions:\n\n- PGI and Transverse game\n\n- First Developer blog and intentions of addressing issues yet still exist 4 years later:\n•	Urban Combat to address circle strafing and long range sniping.\n•	Dynamic Battlefield further expanded on the concepts of Urban Combat and mechs having roles.\n•	Dynamic pacing, introduced an early version of one of the final pillars, Information Warfare.\n(ref:  http://mwomercs.com/news/2011/10/2-dev-blog-0  )\n\n-Most recent admission of balance issues by a lead developer, suggestion of change and implementation of another system, termed “Infotech”:\n(ref: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/208441-mech-rebalance-and-pts/ )\n\nRuss Bullock’s reaction on Twitter to the player base regarding people heavily commenting on and rejecting the proposed “Infotech” issue, telling people “it’s turfed already, so you can all sleep again.”\n( ref: https://twitter.com/russ_bullock/status/662804251668692992 )\n\nAs of this writing, the new “IIC” clan battlemechs have been introduced. New players will obviously be able to follow how the community and PGI reacts to these new mechs but will be a great indicator of how things eventually work out in MW:O and what to expect from there on… so read the forums and both reddits to see and understand the kind of community you’re getting involved with.\n\nI’m not saying you should or shouldn’t play this game or put money into it, you should be old enough to make up your own mind about playing a game and what you consider “worth it.” Just don’t expect a lot of depth beyond what you get your first few games, and as far as PGI fixing things, if you stick around, get used to the word "Soon."","December 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","28","57","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekadept/recommended/342200/","tekadept","Tekadept","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekadept/","110 products in account","I played this game from closed beta. Many fun times where had, it felt like a reasonably good battletech game, there was only a handfull of mechs, there was no Double heatsinks basically 3025 tech. When wanting to play a match it was easy to get a drop in, click launch and wham you were in and playing.\n\nIf you wanted to play with friends you could group up and easily get into a match. There was repair and rearm mechanic which was a good way to govern people running munchkin builds.\n\nOver time numerous changes were made that made this game less and less fun, until finally I was forced to stop playing with the introduction of cockpit glass, since then I never went back.\n\nNow with the introduction of steam I thought I would be fair and have another crack at this game I used to like playing, however sadly it just does not have it. It is not what I would expect from a mechwarrior game, it is very shallow, limited repetive gameplay. The tier system is not a true ranking system and the only goal in the game is to pokemech so you can collect them all.\n\nThe mech chassis are mostly just skins, and lack real variety or flavour, you have a few key loadouts replicated multiple times with just a different look. Since I last played it looks like they introduced the quirk system, this attempts to provide some unique flavour to mechs, but is more complicated then it needs to be and you need to play spreadsheetwarrior to be able to make sense of it. If mech customization was a bit more restricted I feel the balance would have been more natural then the artifiial quirk system that was introduced.\n\nSince the lack of repair and rearm munchkin builds became prolific, and continue to do so to this day, there is no consequence to running the most expensive kit in your assault mech. Every other F2p games introduce a repair mechanic and it works quite well as a natural balance mechanic, ala World of warships, World of tanks ,Warthunder and Armored Warfare and it manages to work quite well but PGI could not make it work.\n\nThe graphics looked great back in Closed beta and were amazing, nowdays they are very hohum, the mech Models up to a certain point look pretty decent, but looking at some of the more recent releases, it looks like they are just calling it in doing the Bare minimum to pump out mech packs. The textures and effects are very dated looking now. Whether that is the age showing , or as Ihave heard they have dumbed the quality down because they couldn't make the game run optimally on higher settings I don't know.\n\nThe community is polar opposites generally, you have black knights who hate the game with a passion, and the white knights who love the game like it was brought to us by the messiah. In my eyes both are wrong and the game is just meh.\n\nI may try a few more sync drops with friends that still club pugs over the next few days as that is the only way to get matches going quick enough, but taking the game as it stands today I find it a very shallow and meaningless game, unable to easily and quickly drop with friends for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles anymore.\n\nThe beauty of it being F2P is you can try it out and make your own decision as to whether you want grind away or pay to skip.","December 11, 2015","false","2.5"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","25","51","2","0"

Give the game a try, and play at LEAST 25 matches before deciding if you want to keep playing or not because this gives you all the rewards for being a new player. Shuffle through the different trial mechs during these games, as this will help pin down your best play style. Each mech plays differently. To help minimize frustration as you learn;\n\nTips and tricks:\n-Lrms have a minimum range of 180m (unless they are clan-tech)\n-When playing lights always keep moving.\n-3rd person hurts you in major ways.\n-Be aware of things like your armor paper doll. Even when you think you are safe someone could be shooting you in the back.\n-When you see an enemy mech press "R" this locks onto the target and transmits data to your team. It also helps in picking already damaged parts of a mech to shoot at.\n-Avoid running off, and stick with the team. Stragglers often meet untimely demises.\n-Don't be the first one in line when in combat. Frontline units are the first to die.\n-Spreading damage across your mech is key; twist your body while not firing in combat, as you become a better pilot this   will be more natural. Choosing a shoulder/arm to always show is also helpful when one side has less weapons.\n\nHope this helped.

Today is what matters, as the game goes to STEAM.  To be up front, I have about 11,500 matches under my belt and hundreds of hours of game play so I'm not new to the game, it's background or it's challenges.\n\nVideo fx/Graphics (8): The artwork for the Mechs is fantastic imo. Even if you don't necessarily agree with the direction of the Art team or modeling of the Mechs, they still look well done and attractive. Intimidating and lethal, they look much as any fan of the intellectual property of BattleTech might imagine. I deducted points here due to some pixelated terrain that looks like a game from 2003 in places and some odd modeling/animation mistakes. Additionally, some of the mechs need a scaling overhaul, as some smaller tonnage mechs are larger than mechs in heavier weight classes. Overall tho, a great effort and all indications are this will get better.\n\nAudio (9): Again, barring some minor aesthitic disagreements, the sound effects are well done and the game sounds good during gameplay. Autocannons have a great bang/crunch mechanic, lasers sound vicious and explosions/getting hit add to the immersion.\n\nImmersion (6): This is where the video excellence and audio excellence fall short, in tandem with other things that are decidedly lacking. The musical backdrop is solid usually, but there are no immersive ingame sounds. While you are in the Mechlab/game join screens. If I'm in some giant bay somewhere modifying a 60-ton warmachine, shouldn't there at least be some air-wrenches screaming or the sounds of metal clanging or SOMETHING besides simple music? Missed opportunity there. Additionally, there's no tie to a back story within the game. If you're not already familiar with the IP, most of the game will mean nothing to you nor does the game give you much information in that respect.\n\nBackstory (0): PGI makes no effort to tie the grand-lore that sets this IP apart from any other "walking-tanks" battlesim and misses out hugely there. Hiring some writers or poaching directly from the novels/game books that are associated with the IP would make sense here, but there's no real history at all. Just some forum links to community based websites (such as sarna.net) that are great efforts, but in no way as reach, or as accurate as actually being source material. With the addition of "communit warfare" some of the planets have information about them, but no context really. Ultimately, you know this IP/background already or you're finding it from other sources, as PGI hasn't bothered.\n\nGameplay (7.5): Purely from a gameplay mechanics and fun aspect, I enjoy playing it BUT I've been playing it for years now. The initial stings of playing through the learning curve are long past for me. I can enjoy the new Mechs as they are introduced immediately for their various strengths and weaknesses. This is not the same for new players.\n\nNew Player Experience (2): I only grudgingly even give it a 2. The tutorial is a great (recent) addition to the game, but the game mechanics are not explained well anywhere, forcing new players to learn through pain or comb through dense forums. The occasional tip at the start of the match isn't enough, and usually have to do with reminding players about key-bindings to use. It has no centralized resource to explain how the Clan, Inner Sphere, Trial, Hero, or Champion mechs work differently, how certain weapons when "boated" in larger quantities cause ghost heat, etc to help people understand what the heck they are doing. The cadet bonuses to your first 25 matches are substantial but easily squandered by new players who are completely clueless on what does what. A PDF file attached to the game with all of the tips and key info, or a wesite framework with a similar design would be incredibly helpful to new players. The current website information is largely out of date.\n\nBalance (7.5): The weapons have some balance issues that are bound to be improved upon but are not intuitive to the player. The Mechs themselves as the platforms have some glaring optimal performers and some glaringly bad Mechs, with the majority in the comfortable middle. If all Mechs had useful roles, even if those roles were not purely combat related, that would improve their value immensely. Players who live primarily Clan, or Inner Sphere tend to accuse the other side of being "OP" based on Clan mechs having significant intrinsic advantages uniformly, while Inner Sphere mechs enjoy very niche, but powerful "quirks" to bring them up to par. Overall, balance has improved much over time and continues to balance the main systems to a reasonable degree. Room to improve here, but overall it's solid.\n\nModes/Replayability (2): The game has three quick modes....assault, where teams can kill the enemy team or capture a objective on their opponents' side of the map, conquest where teams can the enemy team or earn points by owning up to 5 slow-ticking objectives scattered between the two teams, and skirmish which is team death match.\n\nCommunity warfare, involving larger maps (but still 12 on 12 matches) with 4 spawns per pilot is the "meta" level of the game, where players are fighting over planets. As much as I'd love to say they got this right....it's incredibly tough to enjoy at the moment for a variety of reasons you can read about on the forums. I'm very hopeful that Beta 3 will introduce some options that add more to that mode and help attract more players to it.\n\nEndGame/Why play factor (2): Once the fun wears off in playing the same three modes, you're left with grinding new Mech chassis for the sake of collecting them. Without a driving reason to fight and no value to community warfare outside of bragging rights (no politics, impact to resources, impact to your gaming experience for fighting etc), you're literally just playing because you enjoy the shootem up portion or to make your collection larger.\n\nF2P factors: There's no penalty to P4F, as the "hero Mechs" don't represent a real leg up in any true sense, but it does cut into the grind ALOT to pay for premium time.\n\nGrind:  This game does have a grind/leveling component that can be daunting for new players only because again, within the New Player Experience (NPE), they are likely to make mistakes in how they spend their initial funds.  Recently, PGI increased the rate of return on c-bills (ingame currency) that helps mitigate this facet of the grind, and players will learn quickly about the experience/mastery grind which really isn't something you can get around without spending MC ($ for game currency) to expedite.\n\nIn 2013, I gave this game a 5 on metacritic.\n\nMy overall opinion of the game would be to give it a 7 currently, but again I'm biased due to my love for the Battletech IP.  If you "scored" things with roughly equal weight as I laid them out above, you'd get a lower #. In the end though, the community is small but overall pretty good (ignore the toxic outliers), the game has a certain amount of fun factor that cannot be explained, the game continues to improve albeit at a slow pace AND it's F2P without any real penalty to do so.\n\nWell worth the serious stab at it if you're at all interested in tactical shooters, especially ones that are not pure twitch.","December 10, 2015","true","22.7"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","24","49","0","0"

The price points for cash purchases are absurd. New mechs are released for real money at absurd prices ($30-$500) and are unbalanced but once available for in game currency they are nerfed down to match the rest more or less. The devs are morons... you can watch their video blogs if you don't believe me. It is true that they dropped the ban hammer when people disagree with them on forums. I have heard but not verified that they nerf mechs that beat them in game (I do believe this however because many of the nerfs they do are absurd and they never seem to nerf the mechs they play). The user interface is the worst I've ever seen. It is overthought, convoluted and rediculous. The current UI is the third version that I'm aware of. All 3 versions have been terrible and I can't say any version has been better than the other. It is absolute garbage. As you play and start to notice the fine tuning that could make this game good you will also notice the devs reall focus is on pumping out new mech variants at exorbidant prices. Ultimately this game is a money grab aimed at gen-x'ers who are established and may have a few bucks to blow on a ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nNow to end on a good note:\npros:\n\nActual gameplay is fun.

PGI is a dishonest, inept developer that drove away many who bought into the Founders Program.  They *consistently* overpromise and under-deliver.  The game, as it exists, still does not have what was promised to Founders at launch two years ago.  This is a minimum viable product that continues to have little depth, is poorly balanced and is only a shell of what a game worthy of the "Mechwarrior" title means if you know the IP.  By all means, play it for what it is, but don't give PGI money.  Let the game die so that another company can get the IP and do it right.\n\nIf this game had just been released in the state it is in and you only intend to play it for free, I could recommend it as a fun stompy robot arena shooter, but the history and the company that made this game matter if you consider putting money into it.  When viewed through that lens...don't spend your money.  I started in closed beta and spent a good bit of money on this game before I realized PGI could not be trusted and would outright lie to the player base.  I still play now just because I love the IP and this is all we have right now, but I won't put another thin dime in PGI's pocket.\n\nMany have already pointed out many things that PGI got wrong and continues to get wrong in other reviews.  I won't belabor all of those here.  My key points:\n\n1.  Lied to Founders about ECM implementation, Third Person View, Ghost Heat, and consumables.  To give you an idea of how PGI treats its players, PGI banned players on their own forums for things people posted on reddit.  Really.\n\n2.  All items are overpriced in real money and it is a pretty steep grind for a F2P.\n\n3.  Player balance system is better, but still broken.  One-sided matches way too common.  This is because there is a small player base.\n\n4.  Game has no depth...just different arena battles.  Clan and IS mechs on same side in single player que is a clear example to anyone who knows the MW IP.\n\n5.  Wait times for games can be long due to small player base.\n\n5.  CW is NOT what you think it is.  It is a shallow layer on top of the shallow arena combat game with stompy robots.\n\n6.  Expect balance to swing wildly with each patch.\n\n7.  Don't expect first time quality from anything PGI promises.\n\nI will say the game looks and sounds pretty good (although infuriatingly, 100 ton mechs still get caught by small rocks on maps)...so it can be fun.  I stopped playing for two years and the progress made was only incremental when I came back.  I came back simply because MWO is the only MW game in town and I figured I should get my money's worth.\n\nDid I mention you should play it for free, but don't pay PGI anything? ;)\n\nIf you want to read about some of PGI's missteps...start here:\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/15/free-to-play-mechwarrior-online-offends-players-with-500-golden-mechs/\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/piranha-games-speaks-out-on-transverse-crowdfunding-and-the-future-of-mechwarrior-online/  - check the comments on this one.\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mechwarrior-online   - Peruse some of the user reviews...\n\nhttps://www.themittani.com/features/mwo-failure-communicate\n\nhttps://www.themittani.com/features/mwo-pgi-community-manager-ignites-reddit-controversy\n\nI realize the last two are goon site posts (and i do NOT endorse goons...but those articles are the truth)\n\n","December 11, 2015","false","695.4"," 94 of 190 people (49%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","49","94","190","10","0"

Walter Scrubnut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derhollander/","222 products in account","I'm sure there's been everything I've written down already said, and I'll also point out that I put in time since the closed beta, got the Atlas Founder's Pack and Overlord Phoenix pack (both of which I regret to this day), so I'll basically sum up first, and explain my biggest (not the only ones, just the biggest) beefs with this game. If you like Battletech/Mechwarrior, Don't Play This Game. It's not Mechwarrior, it's some sort of terrible World of Tanks clone wearing Battletech's skin. Don't even download the installer, just pop in that Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries disc that I know you have, and play that until Jordan Weisman's real Battletech game comes out.\n\nLet's put down some details.\n\nThe good stuff - The 'Mechs, and about 2 maps are real pretty. End of list.\n\nThe rest - The development of this game has honestly been a fantastic, 3-year long trainwreck in slow motion with 3-D effects. Although I'll mention that deciding to use Cryengine (an engine that is poorly optimized, and completely miserable to work with) is typically a good indicator that the developer has no clue what they're doing, they just want it to look pretty, that's not even the main problem.\n\nThe first biggest issue is they absolutely have no idea how to balance their game. It was busted in Beta, and they continue to keep busting it under the guise of fixing, but after this long in active development, it's pretty clear they have no idea how to make it an enjoyable, balanced game. Going back through the patch notes, you can see that they dance around several problems that they blatantly refuse to fix for who-knows-what reason, and as a result, certain mechanics such as ECM and about every other patch, missiles, have been broken and will continue to be so. The second issue in the balance bucket is their matchmaking system. if you want to do anything other than drop with 11 complete strangers, you have to drop into the team matchmaking, which can put you up against a full company team, while you and maybe 1 or two buddies just wanted to play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game together, not get rolled 24/7 by full teams of meta/balance abusing goons.\n\nSecondly, the pricing for their pay content is completely ludicrous. Don't feel like farming credits to get a new 'Mech? 15-20 dollars please. Oh, is that 'Mech a Hero Mech, I'm sorry, that will be 30-40 dollars, please. 5 dollars will get you a colour, though! Oh, that's colour singular, not like, a colour range, I'm sorry. No, if you want all of the purples, that will be about 50 dollars, please. But, if you pre-order our content for 80-120 dollars, you get 16 'Mechs, 3 colours, and a cosmetic item for your cockpit!\n\nLastly but not leastly, like with any fine, upstanding multiplayer-only title, the forums and in-game chat are roughly 99.9% a cesspit of vitriol and imbecility, and the remaining good bits are mostly folks making art.\n\nThis game goes in the deepest shame hole for making an absolute shambling mockery of this fantastic universe.","December 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","21","43","2","0"

At all.\n\nMechwarrior Online is a game plagued with problems. I backed and founded the game based on the strength of the franchise, but I'm going to bring up any of my personal disappointments and the only mention of the Transverse fiasco will be right here. I'm giving this game a negative review for a few reasons, but if current trends continue I may choose to recommend the game instead.\n\nPGI, when's the Flea coming out? It's been nearly two years since you announced it and MASC exists now. To whoever has the job of moderating the negative reviews, at least pass this question along when you moderate my review into oblivion.\n\nWith this review I mostly wanted to point out that the game typically goes months without anything resembling a balance update. MWO also features a few HIDDEN mechanics specifically designed to punish new players who don't know about it. That mechanic is colloquially known 'Ghost Heat,' which causes your BattleMech to gain additional (and often excessive) amounts of heat if you fire more than an arbitrary number of one type of weapon. This is never explained anywhere in game, and while the game does have a 'heat warning' that pops up in the mechlab if you've taken too many of one type of weapon that warning is small and easy to miss.\n\nUp until about a month ago (over a year after MWO's launch) MWO was also completely without a tutorial, and the typical 'new player experience' was 'pick a trial `Mech at random, die three or four times without really understanding why, and uninstall the game.' If you didn't have a friend to show you the ropes or warn you about Ghost Heat or several of the other 'traps' (like LRMs currently being absolutely terrible weapons due to their slow speed, scattered damage, and tendency to ram into the nearest wall) you weren't going to make it very far.\n\nThis has changed, the tutorial is actually pretty nice, and there are some bonuses to help new players buy a BattleMech quickly so they can start customizing and using actually good weapons and the latest balance patch (the first one in MONTHS) has brought back a close-range brawling playstyle that's actually quite fun, but that doesn't change the fact that all of this was done immediately before the Steam launch and that the buffs to close-range weapons will almost certainly be reverted.\n\nThe real-money cost of BattleMechs is also completely absurd. They could cost a quarter what they do now and they'd still be expensive for a free-to-play game. An Assault BattleMech in MWO costs  Coupled with the fact that new releases often aren't balance-tested and aren't available for in-game currency for months after release means that new `Mechs are often pay-to-win, and due to the high prices (often approaching the cost of a AAA game for a `Mech pack or even a single Assault-weight BattleMech) this means that players who aren't shoveling their money directly into the furnace often become the punching bags of the players who are.\n\nYou also, and this is a real killer for me, have to spend real money on Mechbays (at around $1.38 per bay) to even buy a `Mech at all. Now, the MC cost of a Mechbay ultimately isn't that high, but it's another 'hidden' cost slowly nickel-and-diming the userbase to death.\n\nMWO is a game best played with friends, and individual matches can be enjoyable once you get a handle on things. But the learning curve is steep even with a tutorial and you'll often waste tons of in-game C-Bills just trying things out. If you do play, my only advice is to save the 'Cadet Bonus' you earn over the course of your first 25 matches and buy a 55-ton Stormcrow. It's one of the most efficient `Mechs in the game and has access to the more powerful Clan versions of all the weapons, and will probably always be a good workhorse for grinding C-Bills in since it's fast enough to get to the fight and fast enough to get itself out of trouble.\n\nOnce you've learned what 'trouble' actually looks like.","December 10, 2015","false","125.8"," 92 of 186 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","92","186","6","1"

I Backed it. I left it a long time ago.\n\nIt was refreshing abit to come back, but the core issues on the game keep coming back to me on this, and as such - I just cannot reccomend it.\n\nThere is so much in this that "isn't" how it should feel to me, making this off-putting, at least as it is for this specific game/goal.\n\nIt is not Mechwarrior. It isn't anywhere close to BattleTech. That much makes the naming only for the looks - but I have to admit, it looks great. Its just not the same in either the lines of the old Mechwarrior games, and the translation of the numbers from BattleTech makes this feel choopy.\nThe gameplay is much the same as it was. It feels "floaty" in a way that can only be described as this is a FPS with a mech-skin. Think Modern Warfare or Call of Duty and the gameplay makes so much more sense.\nThe biggest issue for me is the mechs have no weight. They feel light as a feather, responsive as any twitch-shooter, and as such breaks the immersion of the idea - you forget you are driving 100-ton mechs when the respond like a sports car.\n\nThat to me is why this doesn't feel right. But that's my feelings on it.\n\nThe game itself, the way it plays, the intent the devs have put into this is... alright, but its just not how I would think the game should be. It doesn't strike me as Mechwarrior outside the appearance. And that's it.\n\nThe other major reason I gotta complain? When I backed this in its beta the cost for mechs and parts were reasonable. Cheap, effective - now? Its like pulling teeth through your toenails. They bleed you dry in this Pay 2 Win. And it is P2W. You need to grind for perks, grind for credits, grind for that mech - until you grind to the parts that work and eventually the neigh-broken Clan equip. All the while others are standing on the top of that shooting you back down to the ground.\n\nIt just doesn't feel right. The MM is dodgy that way, often placing vets against newbies, slanting the games into a slaughtering ground.\n\nAll and all.. it feels much the same it was back in the day. With a direction that just doesn't feel like it should. Not Great by any means - but also not horrible.\n\nSo long as you get into it knowing and understanding its P2W, grinding, and its somewhat off-kilter approach to featherweight mechs you'll probably enjoy it - but don't expect much more from it.","December 15, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","20","41","3","0"

It's easy to spend more hours in the mechlab than in the matches themselves.\nIn higher tier matches, even the geometry of the mechs and placement of weapons on them become important. The higher the weapon mounts, the less you have to expose yourself from cover to shoot your enemies.

MWO is perfect for one to three hours of gameplay in the evening and a ton of fun. For longer playing sessions, it feels a bit too repetetive, but that's just my personal experience.\n\nQuick note for newcomers:\nIf you are new to the game, you should finish the tutorial first and complete the callenges in the Mechwarrior Academy for extra CBills (ingame currency). Try out the different trial mechs available to you in Quick Matches, until you know which kind of mech suits your playstyle best.

There's pretty much nothing here from the lore other than PGI trying to cash in on nostalgia. This isn't the game you are looking for in a MW/BT game, unless you're just here for a repetitive arena shooter with mech skins. All the time in development and post release and all the game really has to offer is 3 mostly similiar game modes and lots of mechs to buy. The prices are high. The development slow and usually 1 step forward and 2 steps back. All in all, I can't recommend it and if you try it please don't give this company any money until you've played a bit. You can survive on the initial trials and the Cadet bonus and such before you really should spend any real money if you so decide.\nI'm a Legendary Founder so let my mistakes help save you the time and most importantly the cash.

Its NOT a tabletop game.  Its more of a shooter at this point with a huge selection of chassis and loadouts.  Depending on the chasis and loadout depends on how you play.  Its a huge cooperative/teamwork game.  If you dont play with your teammates you die.  Your team dies and you all look like noobs.  Its very unforgiving in this regard.\n\nThere is really no endgame at this point and as I am sure you have seen in some of the reviews it was promised to be much much more but it is not there yet.  They have been implementing new content at a higher pace recently and the balance and tweaks have been generally good.  The 3 different gameplays of Skirmish, Conquest, and Assault really do not vary much as it usually just turns into an all out brawl at the end.  Community Warfare is fun but intense and absolutly REQUIRES teamwork as you end up going against coordinated opposing teams that absolutly dominate uncoordinated teams.  However, some of the funnest, heart pounding, got the shakes gameplay has come from CW as it is very...well,,intense.\n\nSo if you are wanting an RPG style shooter this is not it at the moment.  If you are looking for a good well rounded stompy robot game then this is it.  Literally endless options on how to tweak your mechs and customizations.  Serious fun team play and solo play.  Find yourself a good group of friends to play with or a friendly unit to drop with and you will enjoy this game.\n\nbtw I have been playing MWO with theskjaldborg.com (SoR) for 3 years now and we can help point you in the right direction if you want.","December 11, 2015","true","95.0"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andreypet256/recommended/342200/","andreypet256","Nomad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andreypet256/","141 products in account","Hello everybody. I write this review as a fan of Battletech, MechWarrior in particular, and as an MWO player since late closed beta. According to the stats page of the game, I have spent 205 hours in-matches. Note that this does not include Community Warfare matches which should be roughly another 30 hours and tinkering with mechs inside the mechlab or one of the many player-made mechlabs available on the web. The money invested into this F2P title is around 70 dollars which includes the Hunchback IIC package (40$) and a few other MC (MechWarrior Credits, the IRL money currency in-game) transactions for hero mechs, premium time and colors. I primarily play as a Heavy pilot, with a few choice Assault and Medium mechs. I am also a Tier 2 rating, so I like to think I have an O.K. understanding of the game and it’s Meta. All these things may have colored my perception of the game and the experience it offers.\n\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Unique gameplay that seems to be underrepresented in today’s market\n\n-Vastly improved controls over its predecessors\n\n-Complex and meaningful customisation (MechLab)\n\n-A mostly mature community that is supportive and enjoys explaining their passion about stompy robots\n\n-A great selection of mechs with varied play styles. This game has so many of them, there will be one for you. During the writing of this review 12/9/2015, most mechs are in a good spot with some underpowered exceptions.  The most recent balance patch was on 12/1/2015 so the new meta has yet to solidify.\n\n\n\nThe Neutral:\n\n-Starting Trial mechs are a mixed bag. Try all of them\n\n-Steep learning curve\n\n-Lacking in-depth tutorial about most important part of the game (MechLab and Mech Customisation)\n\n-Runs on CryEngine and has performance issues on weak CPU’s. Recommend lowering “Particle” setting\n\n-A fair selection of maps, but could use more. Maps also vary in quality\n\n-Owning 4 mechs of each chassis allows you to “Elite” your pilot with the chassis, used to grant you considerable buffs. Those buffs were since nerfed hard, but are still noticeable. Investing in a mech chassis you enjoy is still recommended and somewhat expensive\n\n- Mech Upgrades are expensive, required for competitive play and are NOT factored in the initial mech buy price (hidden costs). Same goes for different engines ratings or engine types. It may look like Light Mechs are the cheapest but a competitive Light Mech can run you the price of a Competitive Assault Mech (hidden costs)\n\n-All new mechs release in a Pre-Order Pack model, where the mech becomes available for those who pre-order, a month later it releases of MC and a month later for in-game CBills\n\n-Community Warfare technically no entry requirement, but having 4 custom mechs is highly recommended\n\n-Performance based economy. As in any game, you probably won’t be amazing at it right away. The game can be somewhat grindy between your first and second mech. However, once you perform well consistently, the money will be flowing in.\n-Controversy around developer and their practises\n\n-Community Warfare lacks a matchmaker. It’s considered the “hard core” mode where people play with their units!\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Limited base game modes .Quick Play only has TDM with a base, pure TDM or Conquest. Community Warfare features an asymmetrical Attack/Defend mode with turrets and dropships that let you deploy up to 4 of you mechs (Each mech acts a as a life) as well as a TDM mode where the invader team defends the destroyed base from a counter attack. That’s it until a new “scouting” mode drops sometime next month.\n\n-Signature game mode Community Warfare has low population on off-hours and work days (This may change with steam release)\n\n-Somewhat slow development rate on big features. However, there are 2 patches per month and fast hot fixes (even on weekends).\n\n-Hit or miss balance patches\n\n-Minefield of an in-game store. Somewhat expensive too! Please research a Hero Mech before purchasing, not all of them are good!\n\nOverall, the game is solid enough to warrant a download. Most importantly, even if I find it somewhat stale nowadays, it has a way of being FUN. Try it out, but it’s not for everybody. Look up some of the excellent player guides and resources.\nI recommend visiting www.reddit.com/r/outreachHPG it has a great player resource selection. MechWarrior has a passionate community that are willing to help out new players. It might be overwhelming at first, but this game can grow on you easily.","December 10, 2015","true","65.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

The game encorages players to work together & improve their teamwork and to be tactical with their shots managing their mechs heat levels not only when deployed in combat but when creating the loadouts for their purchased mechs. That large pulse laster puts out a lot of focused damage at good range, great for removing opponents limbs and components, but it also puts out a lot of heat and it is heavy!\n\nI have been playing MWO for about 2 years and i can honestly say that i have seen a continuous improvement in the game over that period (it has had some downs as well). There are not a lot of games i am still playing after such a long period which i consider testament to its quality.\nMWO caters well for casual play if you just want to stomp around in a big robot spraying laser death for an half an hour or so as well as more involved clan matches and alliances in clan warefare.\nThe regular challenge weekends have been fun and provided insentives to get players using new features when they have been added, as well as giving players "hats" to adorn their mech cockpits with.\n\nedit:\nJust read a review which slammed the mwo community... clearly the reviewer had never attempted to join it. The PGI forums are very active and a lot of experienced players are willing to advise new ones, the team speak servers are also very active!\nThe reviewer also mentioned that there is no guidance on how to build a loadout for a mech and that its easy to blow your hard earned cbills on something that, well isnt the most effective build. I will go back to the community bit here because the builder tool http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab lets you design your mech build and test its heat performance before you spend a stone. If you dont know enough to work out a good build on your own there are countless shared builds to choose from linked from the forums.","December 13, 2015","true","100.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

I find the gameplay is good, the maps are fun, and the variety in the mechs adds a lot of flavor, strategy and planning that needs to be done before a match even starts.\n\nIs the game perfect? Definitely not. There is a steep initial learning curve, the matchmaker can sometimes take a while to find a match, and with all the customization it's easy to bring something to the battle that is very sub-optimal. On the flip side, I really enjoy the high skill ceiling, the high level of customization, the intense matches, and that good strategy/tactics pay off in the field.\n\nWould I recommend this to anyone? Absolutely. Is everyone going to find something to like about the game? Absolutely not. If the theme or style appeals to you at all, there is a lot of stompy robot goodness to love in the game. If you like shooters, I'd say give it a try and see if it's your thing. I'd still recommend anyone slightly interested give it a try, as the game is great for a free game. I continue to get a lot of enjoyment and entertainment from it.\n\nIf you try it out and don't like it, then I wish you luck on finding your next game.\n\nIf you try it out and do like it, you are in for a lot of fun!

This is a sim-light shooter that maintains all the greatness of the previous versions while also providing a fantastic community of people to play with in a simulated galactic war that, while still in development, is shaping up to be a very unique experience.\n\nMost importantly this "freemium" game has a very reasonable grind and practically no "pay to win" elements. The Hero mechs are a nice way to ease the grind, but after playing 2 years I can honestly say that most of my best mechs were purchased with the in-game currency - "C-Bills", which are earned by simply playing the game. There is no "gold ammo" or any other such pay to win devices here. The only thing that costs money that is essential are mech-bays, but these are frequently rewarded in weekend spanning "events" that offer many prizes for scoring "points" for game play. Many of these prizes are "real money" items and PGI has proven very generous.\n\nThat's not to say that there isn't a reason to spend money. There is plenty of "swag" that can be purchased to deck out your favorite mechs, such as - War Horns, Camo Patterns, Paints and cockpit items. You can also purchase mech packs or if you want the hot new thing, you can pay for early access to new mechs before they are available for C-Bills. Last but most importantly there is "premium time" which increases the XP and C-bills earned during matches. This decreases the grind and when coupled with Hero 'Mechs practically removes the grind completely. I have spent more money on this game than any other in my life, and I will continue to do so, simply because I don't feel I have to.. There is no extortion here, no "pay to win". The grind is hardly a grind at all. If you enjoy playing the game, forget about your bank account and check on it occassionally and be surprised by how fast it grows.\n\nTo sum up, MWO is perhaps the best "free to play" game on the market. It hits that perfect balance of "free" and "grind" without aggravating "pay to win" mechanics. I have been playing it solidly for over 2 years now and still play it more than any other game I own. Be warned though. The learning curve here is very steep (2-3 months). Don't be surprised if you go a week before getting a legitmate kill. But in return MWO offers an incredibly deep and diverse "thinking man's shooter" experience unlike any other.","December 12, 2015","true","134.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

I have seen this game change very much since those days. Ever since IGP went bankrupt and the license has been under PGI control, they have done a lot to make the game so much more. From Faction Warfare, to a robust tutorial system, to a future PVE campaign.\n\nThis game is not Call of Duty, this is not Rambo rampage, this is MechWarrior. The combat is slower paced, and team oriented. Running around solo, trying to be superman will get you killed. Stick with your team, focus fire, provide cover fire and try to move from cover to cover.\n\nDon't be scared by the price of mechs and mech packs, every single mech (except for hero mechs) can be earned for free by simply playing the game and grinding cbills. There is no 'Pay to Win' mech, buying mechs with cash does not give you a mech thats superior to a standard mech bought with cbills. The only difference between a standard mechs, champion and Hero mechs is that champion mechs earn 30% mroe xp (that stacks with premium time), and Hero mechs {designated by parenthesis like (F), (L), (I), (S), etc} earn 30% more cbills (which stacks with premium time). But you can get standard versions of the same mechs without the bonuses.\n\nNot to mention that almost every month PGI has an event where you can usually earn free cbills, MC, mech bays and sometimes even mechs for free. And you can earn free mech bays for doing faction warfare. [Warning if you are a brand new player, I do not recommend doing faction warfare until you have 4 full mechs that are decently skilled)\n\nThis game will give back to you what you put back into, whether its just a couple quick drops for after hard day, or you are binge-playing over the weekend to get event rewards, The more you play, the better your understanding of the maps and mechs will do you will. Torso twisting, focus firing, cover from LRM swarms, This game will take time to get good at, and putting skills into mechs will make your mechs play better, which will in turn make you play better.\n\nDont be afraid to ask for help, the community thats been here for over 3 years has no problem helping out new players, but for more indepth answers to your questions, go to the MWO forums.

Yeah, well, technically. In reality, if you want  to compete you'll be plunking down cash for one of the two in-game currencies you can only buy with cash. Works like this: To max out your pilot's abilities on a chassis, you need to level-up four different variants of that chassis, so you need to buy four different variants of that chassis. To compete in something other than skirmish play (random pubbies) you need to have leveled up four different chassis. So four variants times four chassies equals sixteen different variants.\n\nProblem: you only start out with space for four chassis. So if you want to avoid paying cash for more you'll be selling chassies for underwear-streaking losses to fit the next one. While you could *technically* do this, it's a giant waste of your resources, which means it's a giant waste of your time.\n\nAnd the very best variants of every chassis are only available if you pay IRL money.

(unless you really want the mechs in the performance pack.)\n\nHoesntly this one of those games where you can whole heartedly say "It has come a long way."\n\nI started playing MWO back in its closed beta days. (I got the Hunchback 4G to prove it) and the game has gone through a huge number of changes. Back when PGI was smaller and had less man power, a lot of things they tried to add felt hurried and "Oh ♥♥♥♥ change some thing now so we can fix the other thing in the mean time". But as they got closer and closer to releasing on steam they have been doing much better.\n\nCurrently Id say PGI gets things right maybe.. about 85% of the time. They getting better, and sure there are some things that could be tweaked.\n\nIf you like big stompy robots and big fights, Id say give this a try. It isnt no call of duty or battle field. but by god if you like to use your head while you play this is a good game to check out.","December 17, 2015","true","39.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

While not exactly a fast pace game, there are moments of all out slug fests when head to head engagement over a point become inevitable. This game comes in second place just under Mech Warrior: Living Legends mod, only because that mod allowed the use of air units and tanks along side mechs. There is the issue of expensive mechs, and I agree the prices for them are pretty steep and the grind for them is tedious. However when it comes to mechs it isn't about having many, but mastering the one you own. A light mech can just as easily out manuever and harrass the heavy tonnage mechs. Though the risk is there for being outright killed if they get a shot on you. They do a good job at immersing you into a battle as well, with game rounds starting with your pilot doing a systems check in a drop pod into a battlefield.","December 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I highly reccommend it if you favor strategy and team play over a lone wolf, arcade style shooter. As far as Battletech fans from the table-top or past MechWarrior games, this is probably not for you, but as it is free-to-play, I would at least give it a try. It is a solid game with TONS of customization and it still feels great getting into those mechs and bringing the pain. It's very possible to have fun playing the game solo but the most fun I've ever had playing this game has been joining up with a full drop team and communicating strategy and tactics during tournaments and scheduled team vs team skirmishes.\n\nOne thing I will say about the game as a negative, it has a rather large learning curve. The new in-game tutorial is great and a significant improvement for welcoming new players, but I would still definitely recommend trying to join a MWO clan or group that is willing to teach you the game or at least give you some tips. At the very least maybe watch a tutorial video guide about weapon systems and loadouts. As an example, overall, the premade load-outs for the mechs you use are decent but definitely not the most optimal. Learning which weapons, engines, armor, etc, work best in your mech of choice and which role you should be playing on the battlefield with that loadout, is imperative to your (and your team's) success and overall enjoyment in the game.","December 13, 2015","true","41.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The game was run under IGP and they were horrible and stunded this game's growth.\n\nNow with that said, the game has been under to control of a new company, PGI for a while now. PGI has made GREAT strides in providing balance, reducing grind, and avoiding a pay-to-win game.\n\nThe game is rather simplistic in game-modes but is not tiring as each map can be VERY different from the next with the simplest changes to a tactic. Tactics and team-work are huge in this game and makes everything so much more interesting. It is has a nice balance between teamplay and first person shooter that makes the game so much fun.\nGet a few friends to play the game with you, form a group, be aggressive, work together, and use the MIC and you will have a lot of fun. The game has made great strides this year alone and I high recommend it to anyone as it is one of the few games that truly changes and just has something that not even HAWKEN could provide. There's a huge learning curve but getting past it is SOOO satisfying!!!\n\nAnyway, in conclusion:\n\nBig-stompy-robots/10 would play again.","December 12, 2015","true","279.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I was there for LRMggeddon, LASERPocalypse, and many other trying moments for this game. I can say that there have been more than a few moments where I've been frustrated with the direction that PGI chose to go in. I really miss knockdown and really wish that melee combat was a thing. I don't let that stop me though.\n\nIf you are looking for something that is super fast paced with lots of jumping around and has big robots, I recommend Armored Core or Hawken for you Japense Mecha fans.\n\nOtherwise, if you want GIANT stompy robots then this is where you come. This is based on Battletech, many people already know and love what FASA did all those years ago in creating that game. PGI has actually done a good job at crafting a great quasi-arena style game. In the beginning this game looked weak and pathetic. Now a days this game has gone from looking like a C grade game to a B+ or possibly even an A grade game. The kicker there is that PGI isn't done yet. They are continuing to improve and extend the life of their game.\n\nBig things have been announced for the future. A new phase in community warfare is going to see that mode expanded by a great deal. Inner sphere mechs are about to receive clan type mechs that utilize Clan tech on Inner Sphere chassis'. A new decal system is in the works to allow for greater mech customization.\n\nAlso, this is a prediction, due to the expanded and continually expanding nature of the training grounds missions.

There is also no active monitoring of user age. Getting slagged by a kid is one thing, but having to listen to some 11 year old scream into the VOIP and Caps-rage about how no one will do what they're told needs to stop.\nThere are also legal issues at play that will continue to slow or even alter game content.

As your pure mechanized machine goes to pound off the armor of another, whether it's by guns, lasers, or missiles. Unfortunately, despite it's release, it still can feel rather beta.\n\nIf you carry knowledge of the game, they are trying to stay very close to the story of what Mechwarrior is. Here are some of the things are making this go so wrong.\n- The Inner sphere take on equal amounts of clanners, where as the clanners. still have their unmatched firepower.\n- They are desperately keeping clan weaponry to the clan. The Inner Sphere will most likely never see their integration into their systems.\n- There is an uneeded, visible, TIER system in the game to make you struggle and hate your skills to get to the top.\n- The maps that they carry are only about small/medium at most in comparison to what size older maps could have been, though this is reasonably required for a 15 minute match.\n- (Personal) Weapon customization is limited on mechs (But there are many "Types" to choose from), So.. take my opinion with a grain of sugar. :P\nI'm not about to go about this without a bit of things that I like...\n- Playing something such as a catapult is now pleasing, locking with missiles doesn't require you to literally hold line of sight on an enemy.\n- Clan have some very interesting way's to adapt. They can switch around ligaments, if you own other types.\n- Their updates always come with interesting promise. They often do their updates/events with public opinion. A petition was even able to get the urban mech into the game. <3\n- Buying a Premium mech holds the user no advantage. All mechs and their abilities come from the way you design your mech.  The pilot makes the mech, not the other way around.\nDespite what's going on, I still hold a lot for this game. Even if there may or may not be a lot of mechs to ever come see the fields, what you have to choose from at this time is still. It definitely scratches some nostalgia for me, it is a very pretty, and pretty much bugless.","December 15, 2015","true","312.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The actual gameplay of the battles and customization of the mechs in the mechbay is where this game is great.\n\nThe battles are fought as 3 4 mech lances (squads) so to get the best out of the game you need to work together and support your team (it only takes 1 mech to run off by themselves to turn a garanteed victory into a defeat) each mech class has its own advantages and uses that you will find out from playing.\n\nThe grind in the game isn't to reach the biggest mechs as you can pretty much get these from the get go and each class plays verry differently suiting different people, if you like to run and gun darting from cover to cover in hit and run tactics then a light mech is your thing, if you like heavy firepower and the armour to stand your ground (because you are not moving very fast) then assault mechs might be your thing but remember even in the biggest baddest looking mech you can still be turned into a smoking wreck in a matter of seconds by light mechs without the support of your team.\n\nSo I will leave with this, the game is f2p you have nothing to lose so give it ago, compleet the tutorial, use the trial mechs to get a feel for the different classes and find the class that suits you then once you have finished 25 matches and earned all the cadet bonus you should have a fair amount of credits to get a mech of your choice all without spending any real money.\n\nSo have fun and I may see you on the field of battle mechwarrior.","December 13, 2015","true","33.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It is indeed Mechwarrior and it's alot of fun. The game can be a bit grindy especially if you don't put a small amount of money into it,Premium time is where it's at to get credits. The hero/champion mechs aren't broken or OP you just get more money/xp and hard points ooo wippity doooo. The game itself is great there are alot of mechs to use, not to mention a decent chunk on trial. You should only buy a mech when you think you like it and want to customize the loudout and camos and paint. The faction play is also pretty awesome it's a unique way to get into a team based shooter. I'd say the main probelms with this game are the intense amount of time it takes to grind if you're a free player, Sometimes you will get mercilessly stomped by a clan in faction play while you're with a bunch of randoms, and the lack of costumization options without using real money as well. But paying to look pretty isn't pay to win, or a reason to stay away from this game. Like come on people do you expect every f2p game to just give you a full game experience?

I don't tend towards the hyperbolic, so I think all this is fair.\n\nGreat\n-F2P done right. Fans of Planetside 2 will enjoy this model. You could grind for ages and still have the best equipment eventually. I ended up paying about $180 and it was all well spent. No regrets. Recommend budgeting at least $80.\n\n-Matchmaking. Going up in tiers really helps weed out poor players and griefers. Lunatics will always be present, but you can mute or block them.\n\n-Clans. You don't really have to join one. You can find a group of folks and they will always be happy to associate with you. They may be a clan or just other individuals (your friends list).\n\n-Mech combat. Well balanced (aside from typical forum bemoaning) that is ultimately gratifying. Go fast, go slow; go long range, go 120m brawler. Whatever you want.\n\n-Mechs. Customizable, skinable, and relatively true to lore. You can roleplay yourself as a hardcore pilot or just play casually. Fun fun.\n\nGood\n-Developers keep on developing. They are slow, promises tend to be 2-8 months after delivery date. It'll arrive eventually though.\n\n-Content continues to be released, along with rough timelines published each month. New pre-orders are always in the hopper. Enjoyable to watch the options grow.\n\n-Faction content/loyalty. I enjoy repping my faction but the differentiations are pretty slight in general play.\n\nPoor\n-The engine has some pretty crappy object hit detection. Not ballistic - think mechs running into each other (weird clipping) and terrain issues. It can't really be fixed without upgrading the software engine...which is probably never.\n\n-UI. A bit arduous to do relatively simple inventory management and accounting.","April 28","true","816.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Sure, it's effectively 12v12 deathmatch for 80% of the quick play games. Noone complains about having only one map on DOTA. each different mech feels different, handles different, and the breadth of customization, while not fully open to anything under the sun, makes spending time in the mechlab sometimes more enjoyable than playing the game itself. You can effectively have fun without paying a single cent (and not be disadvantaged compared to those who pay). However, for those with the money and no time to work the grind, their system allows for a good time-vs-money tradeoff. I've paid for stuff in the game, and have not had any regrets (at all!).

This will be a first-impression of the game without any prior knowledge of the company, community and their actions.\n\nSo is MechWarrior Online worth playing?\nHell yes.\n\nIs it worth paying the premium for?\n♥♥♥ No.\n\nLet's start with the overall basics of the game, it's the closest you can get for a latest-generation MechWarrior game. Being a Mechwarrior fan since the 1995 MechWarrior 2, I felt an extreme sense of nostalgia while playing the game. Launch PPCs using a TimberWolf from far has never felt better. However, the P2Win element, as per all F2P games, is obviously there. And the game IS shoving that right into your face. Despite that flaw, I'd say that MechWarrior Online is worth playing, but not worth paying for.\n\nHere's why.\n\nGameplay Wise, the game is as solid as a MechWarrior game can get. You pick a mech, you drop into the landing zone, and you blow everything up. It isn't as fast paced as the spin-offs such as MechAssault, and stays true to the classic, oversized, clunky mechs that stomp around blasting each other with lasers. Newbies to the series will HAVE to play through the tutorial before going into matchmaking or risk getting stomped. Older Veterans from past MechWarriors should have little to no trouble getting familar with the game's controls asa in my opinion, the game plays very similar to MechWarrior 4 Vengence.\n\nYou pick a mech, you click on matchmake, and you're off to blow stuff up. There's several game modes, but most of them just consists of blowing up the enemy team, because it's THAT fun to blow up mechs. There's also a more serious matchmaking called Faction Play, where you team up with people on your selected Faction, and work together to win--imagine ranked play or ELO, or comp, you get the point.\n\nThe sound?\nI'm using a subwoofer below my desktop, when my mech fires it's weapons, it's amazing. The lasers, rockets and autocannons are amazing for a F2P game. Or it could just be my childhood nostalgia kicking in.\n\nThe P2Win Element?\nYes, it's there, RIGHT SMACK IN YOUR FACE. As a newbie, your first mech is free, after about 25 games. However, you only have enough money to buy 1 Mech and equip it with decent weapons. Make a mistake in your mech purchase and you're outta luck. A typical matchmaking game would land you about 100-300k credits (or so). A new, stock mech, should you choose to buy a second (which you will), can easily go for 15M credits. Do the maths. Yes, it is a huge grind to get to your second stock mech, and the cost of equipping it with decent weapons? Ugh.\n\nMatchs end with credits and how well you've scored, also, a screen which says how much YOU COULD HAVE EARNT if you've played on premium time. Yes, you can buy bonus credits using real money.\n\nStock Mechs for real cash? Yeah sure, just hand over $30, and they'll give you a stock mech, which you could have bought for 15M worth of grinding. The amount you hand them is NOT, in my opinion, worth the amount you receive. For instance, other F2P games such as Dota, LoL or heck, even MapleStory gets you decent items with say, $6?. That amount here gets you nothing close. Skins for a single type of Mech would hit insane prices of $10 and above. So imagine you have 3 mechs, you'll have to spend $30 just for skins themselves!\n\nNo, they're not marketable like CS:GO skins. Don't bother talking about reselling.\n\nAlso, Faction Play normally consists of players with insane mech build ups, most of which can outgun, and outclass you. So I'd personally advise for one to play normal matchmaking, get a nice mech collection THEN jump into Faction Play.\n\nThe Community?\n2 game modes - Normal play and Faction Play. Normal play matches you with just about anyone, no coordination most of the time--it's essentially a 12 v 12 deathmatch. Faction Play, people get more serious, they use mics, they use fully equipped mechs, all the good stuff--Essentially, most of the guys here have played for a long time. They can be extremely elitist, or, welcoming to new players. For my time spent in Faction Play, the people that I've been matched with were really friend, save for a few exceptions.\n\nOverall\nThis game plays ALOT of nostalgia for old MechWarrior fans, it might be fun for a while, but you'll begin to notice the grind element creeping in. Personally, as a fan of the series, I don't mind sitting at my desk, spending an hour or two a day on normal matchmaking and doing other stuff later.\n\nTL:DR?\nIt's worth playing for FREE.\nThe premium content is ridiculous in pricing. Absolutely ridiculous.","December 16, 2015","true","15.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

A slower paced game, great if you want to get away from the twitchy, super competitive madness that is Halo/CoD.\nCustomization in the mechlab is phenomenal. Spending time in the mechlab building and tweaking mechs and testing their effectiveness is half the fun. Anything from armor values on all 8 of your different components (11 of you count the rear armor), weapons, ammo, engine size and type, and equipment, can be relocated and swapped to suit your needs.\nAnyone who has played any other Mechwarrior title should feel right at home. If you haven't played/heard of Battletech before, I recommend reading up on some guides and strategies before you hop in. The learning curve is steep. You WILL lose a lot at first.\nCombat is slow and methodical. Engagements will often last several minutes. The feeling of brawling with an enemy mech and having parts blasted off, will keep you on the edge of your seat; especially if it comes down to a 1v1 situation. Being '1 shotted' is very rare and is often the result of bad positioning and multiple enemy mechs focusing you down.\n\nPROS:\n-Solid game play mechanics\n-The artwork and attention to detail behind the mechs and maps is visually stunning\n-Mechlab/building mechs is quite fun\n- Not P2W. More 'Pay to skip the grind'\n-Huge selection of mechs to buy\n- Encourages teamwork. Teamwork is often the deciding factor between winning and losing.\n-events usually every second weekend that hand out all kinds of free goodies\n-It has adhered well to the original Tabletop stats and rules, which makes balancing hard. But the game is in the best state of balance it has ever been\n\nCONS\n-The meta game Is very strict\n-Development is rather slow\n-Balancing tweaks are few and far between. The same meta can reign supreme for months\n-The grind can feel overwhelming is you play only for Free.\n-Lack of tutorials/briefing for mechlab and Faction Play\n-Game mode variety is limited. Basically Team Death Match over and over again\n-No real feeling of 'end game' you need 3 variants of a mech to level it up past Basic skills, then Elite, then Master. Master unlocks a module slot, but modules are basically C-bill sinks to improve your mech. A new skill tree is in the works.\n\nAll said and done, it's Free to Play, and if you enjoy the game it doesn't feel like a grind. Development has grown in leaps and bounds since the publisher broke off from the developers.\nGood luck and maybe you'll see me out there\no7","December 24, 2015","true","208.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This is a game where two large teams enter, but every player counts.\n\nAnd this game rewards you for finding your favorite balance of speed, armor, firepower, and battle field enduance (heat and quantity of ammo).\n\nThis is a game about trading blows, taking risks, and defining the envelope.\n\nAnd the best thing about this game, is it truly is free to play.  The light mechs are cheap, but POWERFUL in skilled hands.  The medium mechs are affordable and are the standard battlefield units.  The expensive assault, though expansive, may have a role to play, and are worth every penny, but they do NOT own the battlefield.\n\nAnd every patch rewards people who play their role more and more.\n\nI am a freelance mercenary.  I am not a part of a unit, I do not use team speak, I am a pug player, and I still thrive in Community Warefare.\n\nI cannot say how amazing this game is.

So I'll just get down to the important stuff.\n\nThis game has its pros and cons but the important thing to remember is that it -IS- free and if you play semi-regularly the grind doesn't really feel too hard. Everything performance-wise you can get with real money you can get with in-game money except for Hero mechs, which aren't even remotely P2W but do have unique playstyles and loadouts compared to their standard variants. Also, some of them look sexy as hell. (Most of the pay model in this game is cosmetic btw)\n\nThere are a LOT of mechs you can pick from and decent variety between the individual models. You can customize the loadout and there's a fair bit of playstyle flexibility for MOST of the mechs. However, this game suffers from a terrible state of "forced" meta due to the way rebalancing is handled (or not handled), making things considered non-meta really hard to be competitive in. Still, if -you- like it and you can put in the performance, go for it and do you. All my clan mechs are ballistic-based and I love the unexpected facetime and carries I get against people expecting pulse vomit or streams or other meta Clan stuff.\n\nThis game hates AMD FX processors!!! Full stop. It's a known and somewhat long-term issue and, while not incapacitating, can be really frustrating because it causes small, infrequent hiccups/bottlenecking during gameplay. For everyone else, this game has the optimization of a flint axe! Bear that in mind if you crank up the graphics settings. However, the mechs on higher settings look amazing, as do the particles and shaders. The LODs are terribad but I guess that's the price you pay for super-sexy giant stompy robots with full first-person cockpit views.\n\nAnother big con for this game is that the developer doesn't always make the best or brightest decisions in regards to balance passes and content updates. But!!! Things have been way better in that department in the past few months/past year, and we actually got the new CW when they said they would put it out, so that's refreshing.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Should you play this game? Yes. It's free. It's fun. There's no P2W. At least give it a shot before you decide you hate it.","April 30","true","245.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Maybe it's just being stuck in the same mechs for such a long time, and the "slow" speed at which you get money, but I find it hard to play this game for longer that a few minutes at a time anymore.

At least through the tutorial, but once I got through that, I found there was no content to speak of.  Just some 'practice missions' and matchmaking. I was expecting a MechWarrior RPG game, with characters and a story, but it turns out that it is essentially a MOBA, and I detest those. I like storylines with a world to explore, and characters to love or hate. Something to fight for.

If you're a lone-wolf type prepare to be disappointed because this game isn't for you.  MWO uses a number of effects that you rarely see in FPS shooters and requires more thought to kill one mech than I have ever seen in any game before.\n\nThings that I liked about the game:\n+ HEAT: Mechs don't just fire lazers endlessly, you have a certain amount of HEAT before you pass the thresh-hold and just shut down. This makes firing something as unlimited as lazers tricky. HEAT is effective by the ambient temperature as well as other enviornmental quirks. What I liked about HEAT is that it balances the fire-power within mechs.\n\n+A lot of variants: MWO has tons of variants and classes of mechs to choose from. Don't like being a big clunky and slow target? Pick a light class mech. Don't like using only lazers? Well there's different variants for different chasis. Because the variants are so easy to get and the upgrades for them are cheap this makes experimenting with the bots less costly and more fun.\n\n+FACTIONS: This conquer and defend style of factions kept me in a very happy mood. Loads of banners to cast your loyalty to and loads of perks and rewards for siding with those factions. FACTION PLAY is the big leagues for MWO. With thousands of planets and maps to explore you will be occupied with more than just the DM style of quickplay. Not only does FACTION demand a sense of loyalty but a sense of tactical approach I have never seen in an FPS. You will find that players are actively trying to call out and use plans to thwart their enemy combatants. From defending a planet you own to attacking another to increase your factions control of the galaxy this is something that I really enjoyed!\n-\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n-Mech Bays: Mech bays limit the amount of mechs that you can buy and add to your MECHLAB. This doesn't seem like much of a big deal but the SKILLS for certain variants of mechs require you to buy and maximum level 3 variants. You only get 4 empty mech bays at the start and you can only aquire more by either paying real money or by earning them through faction promotions. This makes it difficult to get EXPERT into mechs and limits your choice of weight class if you're interested in experting in a certain chasis.\n\n----\n\nThat's all I feel about MWO. The content is grand and the players are fun.\n","December 17, 2015","true","27.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I lost interest for reasons. But I do recall the game felt like it was missing a lot of mechs.A year later I turned the game back on and found the developers, Piranha Games, has been busy adding content and even a whole new series of game play modes related to the Inner Sphere and Clan factions and taking place on a star map of the inner sphere. If you're a fan of the Mechwarrior games you'll like MWO. It turns out Piranha Games has been busy on MWO since 2011!\n\nIf you're not a seasoned Mechwarrior expect a steep learning curve, the game is very strategic. Then expect long periods of learning. One fast huge tip -- Don't sell anything ... keep all the stuff you get because you'll want it later. Just keep increasing your C-bill worth. Every piece of equipment is c-bills you dont need to spend later for a laser and can go to a new mech chassis. If you save up and buy a mech, don't sell it, or the parts that came with it. It will really pay off after you own your first few mechs and want to change them up a bit.\n\nThe game itself is a multiplayer Omnimech, Battlemech, Mechwarrior 12v12 (first person or third) with 2 modes, Quickplay and Clan Warfare. There are three game types for Quickplay mode. Skirmish, a team battle - last mech standing. Conquest, there are multiple points on the map which teams must capture to earn victory points. Assault, when the teams can capture a single base to win the game. In any Mechwarrior Online match the game is won when all enemies have been killed.\n\nThe second gameplay mode is Clan Warfare. This mode puts the mechwarrior in the front seat of a battle on a galactic scale. Incorporating a star map of the inner sphere, players can battle to gain territory or defend what they have. Players must choose allegiance to a faction (Innersphere houses or Clan). The mechs you can select and play in Clan Warfare mode depend on your faction. For Clan factions, only clan mechs will be available, same for IS factions. Players can then select the star planet they wish to attack (or defend). Depending on the status of the contested planet different game scenarios can play out.\n\nPlayers might find themselves "Holding ground" on a recently conquered enemy territory, in this case an attack mission has become a defense mission. Eventually, if your faction persists and succeeds, the planet will be converted to your faction's territory. The starmap changes over time as different factions gain/lose territory.\n\nAdd up to twelve of your friends to a unit and smash the opposition. This game features automatic matchmaking and in-game voice communication on par with other popular games. The game has a great "Play for Free" model. You can become a powerful and rich mechwarrior with out spending money and eventually will unlock items that cost money for free in special events held frequently.","January 4","true","38.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This game has a solid learning curve and being F2P amassing wealth and exp to buy mechs and upgrades takes a good while if you choose not to Pay real money. However... that time is definately worth it. I have not been playing this for long and allready i like the community. I will most likely sub the game pretty soon if i continue to have as much fun playing it as i have now. This game needs support and i will do my part for sure.\n\nA little list of positive and negative things about the game...\n\nPositive:\n- Good and friendly community\n- Great potential for epic team battle provided you have a good strategic leader.\n- F2P. It is actually possible to build very deadly mechs without using real money\n- Some awesome maps with very good looking graphics despite still providing good strategic points.\n- High learning curve... Means you won't get bored soon if you have an ambition to matter in the game.\n- You Pilot Mech's ... Who wouldnt want to pilot a 100 ton Mech? Think Pacific Rim... Seriously... Mechwarfare!!!\n\nNegative:\n- F2P has its drawbacks... Hopefully Piranha Games wont pull the plug anytime soon and make enough cash to see the game as a financial success.\n- Steap learning curve means that you propably need to love the genre to stay in this universe for long.\n- Some maps are awesome while others are downright awfull.\n- F2P Speed at wich you can gather wealth is pretty slow so you really need patience here...\n- as far as i have seen no support for multi monitor... wich is sad if you have the system to carry it.\n\ni would give the game 8/10 points tilting towards 9/10 but there is still room for improovement. If you are into the Mech Genre... This game is a MUST HAVE!!!

The adrenaline rush in this game is real.\n\nWhen you achieve victory on those situations, your satisfaction is immense: both intelectual and physical. You can't win at this game with just twich reflexes.

You hate some Mechs or weapons until you learn something new that makes you love them. You learn how to handle your legs independently from your torso, and then it's time to spread damage by torso twisting...\n\nI have been playing this game for 2 years and every day I learn something new.

This game has a solid learning curve and being F2P amassing wealth and exp to buy mechs and upgrades takes a good while if you choose not to Pay real money. However... that time is definately worth it. I have not been playing this for long and allready i like the community. I will most likely sub the game pretty soon if i continue to have as much fun playing it as i have now. This game needs support and i will do my part for sure.\n\nA little list of positive and negative things about the game...\n\nPositive:\n- Good and friendly community\n- Great potential for epic team battle provided you have a good strategic leader.\n- F2P. It is actually possible to build very deadly mechs without using real money\n- Some awesome maps with very good looking graphics despite still providing good strategic points.\n- High learning curve... Means you won't get bored soon if you have an ambition to matter in the game.\n- You Pilot Mech's ... Who wouldnt want to pilot a 100 ton Mech? Think Pacific Rim... Seriously... Mechwarfare!!!\n\nNegative:\n- F2P has its drawbacks... Hopefully Piranha Games wont pull the plug anytime soon and make enough cash to see the game as a financial success.\n- Steap learning curve means that you propably need to love the genre to stay in this universe for long.\n- Some maps are awesome while others are downright awfull.\n- F2P Speed at wich you can gather wealth is pretty slow so you really need patience here...\n- as far as i have seen no support for multi monitor... wich is sad if you have the system to carry it.\n\ni would give the game 8/10 points tilting towards 9/10 but there is still room for improovement. If you are into the Mech Genre... This game is a MUST HAVE!!! If you are not... you will still have lots of fun.","January 4","true","192.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

(this paragraph is null and void as literally right after i wrote this, i found you can earn mechbays through faction warfare)\n\nall in all, an amazing game that i'd happily spend 10 dollars on for the time ive put into this game. (i played before it was on steam)  i would recommend this to any giant robot fans, fans of the series, or people who enjoy driving tanks (as the controlls closely resemble tank controls from other games).","December 26, 2015","true","37.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

Since then MWO went a long path and had its UPs and DOWNs. This game is not perfect, and some times it is quite a mess, to be honest. I wont go into too much detail and bore you with indepth describtions.(There are TONS of guides, for Christ Sake)\nOk, Here's the deal:\n-12v12 - DeathMatch, CapturePoints, KingOfTheHill, BaseVSBase and Marco-Polo (FactionWarfare).\n-The game itself is a shooter, but very unusual one. The pacing is slower than in most shooters. It requires methodical and thoughtful approach. There are a lot of things to be taken into consideration both during the match and when building a mech.\n-There is a great variety of Mechs (Big walking robots) to choose from. Some are Good. Some are Decent. Some are Situational. Some are terribad and only MIRACLE can save them; buying those might seem compelling, but it is not recommended.\n-Mechs themselves are exreamly customizable. Most of the customization options directly affect gameplay.\n-Success highly depends on team work and situational awareness.\n-Since Battletech is relatively old universe the player base mostly consists of adults with semi-serious approach to the game. Most of the time you can find friendly unit/group without problems. But there are always butthurt exceptions.\n-Learning to play MWO is hard. Though it became A LOT MORE newb friendly, since now it has Tier System, PROPER training mode and bonuses for new players.\n-Free To Play model is tolerable. There are mechs that can be purchased only for real money, but they are not OP. And you still have to grind to build your own config.\n-Still some of the 'Good' Mechs are easier to be bought for real money rather than grinded. Shoving 30-60$ down game's throat will save you WEEKS' worth of grind.\n-Balancing needs some serious tweaks.\n-Some of the game features are introduced too hastily.\n-Some maps need rebalancing. Older maps are being remade to proper fit player count and team balance.\n-Developer team is constantly introducing new stuff and fix/tweak found bugs. They work at their own pace but they seem to know what they are doing.\n-There are REGULAR events and sales.\n\n\nThis game is GOOD but its NOT FOR EVERYONE. Its slow, hard and demanding. Try it out if you have what it takes.","May 28","true","77.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It takes some practice just to get your machine going in the direction you want it to, but fortunately they do offer a training academy that is slowly getting better as time moves on. I recommend running through the academy several times in order to get a feel for the machines.\n\nAnother word of advice: Considder changing some of the option in the game. Turn on Torso Twist, for example. It's better to learn now, before you develop a bad habit. Secondly, set it to first-person mode. It just makes the experience that much better. I would couple this with nudging the "FOV" slider up, to you can see out all of your windows.\n\nIf you're a battletech fan, this is a good Battletech game. Forget what the naysayers yammer about. I've been playing since 2012, loggin on averag over 40 hours a week. Yes, there is a bit of a grind, but nowhere near as bad as World of Tanks. Yes, there is premium content to purchase, but none of that will guarentee victory. Mostly, premium items and 'Mechs have a cosmetic value to them. Most of the actual builds can by built on standard, non-premium machines.\n\nIf you like a multiplayer game with a bit more thought to it that the endless deaths of Call of Duty, consider this title. Not only do you get to lumber across the landscape of alien worlds in a machine massing between 20 and 100 tons, you will also be rewarded for utilizing proper team tactics. The only truly "overpowered" component to this game is teamwork. Everything else can be countered.\n\nThere is also a very large number of 'Mechs to try out. Find the weight class that suits you best, and you will be left with plenty of options for play, further expanded by the ability to completely customize your Battlemech.\n\nI would avoid Faction Play until you've gotten comfortable both with your 'Mechs, and the fact that you tend to die a lot. Faction play is pretty brutal right now, and dropping in without a team can be very frustrating.\n\nThe takeaway? This is Mechwarrior. If you've ever been a fan, whether it's from the tabletop game or MechAssualt, then this is the latest chance to imagine yourself in the cockpit, controlling 75 tons of heavy armor and even heavier weapons.\n\nAn excellent game that is constantly improving.

This game is addictive and tons of fun if you play with a group. Its good alone, but I imagine it could get really frustrating once you understand whats going on.\n\nIf you decide to go ahead and get into this, know that the first 20 mil or so C-Bills you make is much easier than the rest due to bonuses from leveling, and many of the factions have dedicated faction teamspeaks if you want to get into faction play.\n\nAlso know that focused fire on particular components is always more lethal than things like rockets.

The bulk of my Mechwarrior experience has been with MW2: Mercs where I ran a unit called ComStar Mercenaries.  Ahhh those were the days....no easy multiplayer interfaces....limited options....however Mechwarrior has always been on top.  After Microsoft's mutilation in MW4 I had started to lose hope in the series.  Then, out of the blue MechWarrior Online appears and war had returned to the universe!  The graphics are very good, gameplay is a little imbalanced in favor of the Inner Sphere(IS).  Community Warfare is an awesome part of this game allowing players to play out the changes in the game universe.  It will be nice if they add an interface similar to MW2: Mercs where you can sign up for smaller contracts and gain loyalty with other factions or lose loyalty if working against a faction.  Choosing a path for loyalty is also a good way to make some friends and work together toward a common goal.

It takes some practice just to get your machine going in the direction you want it to, but fortunately they do offer a training academy that is slowly getting better as time moves on. I recommend running through the academy several times in order to get a feel for the machines.\n\nAnother word of advice: Considder changing some of the option in the game. Turn on Torso Twist, for example. It's better to learn now, before you develop a bad habit. Secondly, set it to first-person mode. It just makes the experience that much better. I would couple this with nudging the "FOV" slider up, to you can see out all of your windows.\n\nIf you're a battletech fan, this is a good Battletech game. Forget what the naysayers yammer about. I've been playing since 2012, loggin on averag over 40 hours a week. Yes, there is a bit of a grind, but nowhere near as bad as World of Tanks. Yes, there is premium content to purchase, but none of that will guarentee victory. Mostly, premium items and 'Mechs have a cosmetic value to them. Most of the actual builds can by built on standard, non-premium machines.\n\nIf you like a multiplayer game with a bit more thought to it that the endless deaths of Call of Duty, consider this title. Not only do you get to lumber across the landscape of alien worlds in a machine massing between 20 and 100 tons, you will also be rewarded for utilizing proper team tactics. The only truly "overpowered" component to this game is teamwork. Everything else can be countered.\n\nThere is also a very large number of 'Mechs to try out. Find the weight class that suits you best, and you will be left with plenty of options for play, further expanded by the ability to completely customize your Battlemech.\n\nI would avoid Faction Play until you've gotten comfortable both with your 'Mechs, and the fact that you tend to die a lot. Faction play is pretty brutal right now, and dropping in without a team can be very frustrating.\n\nThe takeaway? This is Mechwarrior. If you've ever been a fan, whether it's from the tabletop game or MechAssualt, then this is the latest chance to imagine yourself in the cockpit, controlling 75 tons of heavy armor and even heavier weapons.\n\nAn excellent game that is constantly improving.

I wish the real-world prices for some of their mechs was a bit lower, but otherwise they've done a very good job of keeping things balanced and not letting only those with real cash get an advantage.\n\nThe key to success is patience. Stay with the group, concentrate on the same target(s) as everyone else and don't wander off alone or stand in the open. Don't play this like you're in a Gundam.

I really enjoy the concept of people able to modify your armor and weapons loadout. You have limitations, including a total ton limit and certain parts of the mech can only hold certain types of weapons, and you have "slots." But within these, you can do just about anything you want. You can stick a really big engine and a bunch of machine guns all over your mech to make him fun to play with but annoying to other people, but to do this you will probably have to sacrifice armor. Or you can load your mech down with lots and lots of missiles but you probably won't have much room for other upgrades. You can choose to protect your ammo, or risk it exploding. You can switch standard heat sinks with more efficient doubles, or ferro fibrous steel instead of the standard in order to make your mech a lot lighter.\nThe main problem I have with this game is money. In the beginning, the game does give you a ton of money for your first 25 games, but you better use this very wisely. I am a mediocre gamer, not bad, not great, and I average 75,000 per battle. So I would expect a really good gamer to earn 150,000-200,000 at best. The cheapest that you can buy a new mech is around 1.5 MILLION but the good ones are going to cost you at least 6-8 million, and the best reach 15 million. Even just buying a new engine will cost you at least a half a million. And very simple, small weapons like machine guns and small lasers will cost you 10-25,000 and it only gets more expensive from there, with some getting close to a million. The point being...it takes FOREVER to make any real progress in the game.\nIf it weren't for everything being expensive and it taking a long time to earn the money, this would definitely be one of my favorite games, but unfortunately things are expensive and the game has simply become tedious as I have only had 2 mechs since getting the game a couple months ago.\nPerhaps the game designers intended for you to have this problem though. They do give you trial mechs that you can play with for free and automatically change every so often so you can still have fun using those. All in all, not a bad game.","January 4","true","38.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I guess this could either be a pro or a con, but not every setup is viable, there are rescources out there to learn good builds, or you could test things out yourself. Just know that cheap mechs are usually cheap for a reason, and at best, you'll have to spend a lot more to make them useful. You shouldn't need to use real money though. I would say the game is not pay to win. The premium mechs aren't really better, just different and with cool paintjobs. Try it out if your into mechs or tank games, since the mechs are pretty much tanks in this.","January 10","true","375.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The bulk of my Mechwarrior experience has been with MW2: Mercs where I ran a unit called ComStar Mercenaries.  Ahhh those were the days....no easy multiplayer interfaces....limited options....however Mechwarrior has always been on top.  After Microsoft's mutilation in MW4 I had started to lose hope in the series.  Then, out of the blue MechWarrior Online appears and war had returned to the universe!  The graphics are very good, gameplay is a little imbalanced in favor of the Inner Sphere(IS).  Community Warfare is an awesome part of this game allowing players to play out the changes in the game universe.  It will be nice if they add an interface similar to MW2: Mercs where you can sign up for smaller contracts and gain loyalty with other factions or lose loyalty if working against a faction.  Choosing a path for loyalty is also a good way to make some friends and work together toward a common goal.  I've chosen my path with Clan Wolf, which path will you take?","January 19","true","317.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is almost entirely skill based apart from missiles, which do have a bit of a random spread, the balance is great and their ideas to add "quirks" to balance mechs that have bad hitboxes was a great way to make subpar mechs be competitive without changing the shapes of iconic designs\n\nThe CW is a letdown though, both with the gameplay you get out of it and the rewards you get out of it","January 27","true","150.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Amazing game.\nMechWarrior Online is a truly stunning shooter game involving giant four-storey-building-sized robots known as BattleMechs. It's graphics are visually gripping, with highly detailed textures and shockingly realistic sun shafts and shading. Yes, when you first load it up your brain will probally be instantly overloaded with information, but you can replay the tutorial as many times as you want, and the entire game seems to be centred around progress ad improvement.\nThe only negative thing I can find to give the game is that those stunning grahics come at a performance cost: unless you've got a top-end graphics card you're going to need to tone them down a lot. Personally, I've got an AMD Radeon A10, so I'm running on full power with barely any lag at all, but when I first played this game with an old Nvidia something-a-rather I experienced quite a lot more 0-10 frames-per-second than 30-60.\nAll in all, MechWarrior Onine is one of the best free shooter game there is on Steam, second only to perhaps Team Fortress 2.","April 17","true","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I eagerly backed at the Elite ($60) level and chomped at the bit for ever to get into the game and then I did.  I was elated with how fun the game was in it's early days and was enthralled with the promise of what was to come, so my friends and I waited eagerly for that content...and waited...and waited...eventually got frustrated and stopped playing feeling like we had wasted $60 on broken promises.\n\nThat's what things were.  We backed the game with that understanding but PGI's approach was not that same as what you see on Kickstarter or Greenlight today...they did it all independantly.  So in short, we kept up with what they were doing for a while hoping to come back one days and things just seemed like they were going down hill and the game was going to crash and burn.\n\nWhen we saw it launch on Steam, my initial thought was "Well, one last ditch effort to keep the game alive it seems."  Then one day we were talking about it and decided to pop in one last time to see if things had changed...and were very surprised.  So now I have over 70 hours in the game in less than two weeks and am eating crow.\n\nSo, I may not agree with everything that PGI did when they got started but I think they've been trying to find a way to make it work and had to grow some thick skin in the process to keep things afloat.  I'm not defending them by any means but this was an early learning lesson in crowd funding a game.  Lots of things they promised came very late or are still not in the game today.  That's OK, I'd rather them get it right but they had issues communicating this to their backers.\n\nIn short, mistakes were made and some people are still mad about it.  I'm happy now and hope to see more of the content come to fruition.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  Yes, so long as you know what it is and isn't.  There are plenty of reviews that details this info, but in short:\n\n-  This is not run'n'gun, you do you die, fight alone, die alone\n-  Teamwork is essential for victory as is communication\n-  It is a slow paced progress to improve your mechs, do not expect to buy your way to victory.  Even if you put hundreds of dollars into it, you still have to grind the XP for your mechs to improve them\n-  The controls are complex but intuitive once you learn them\n-  The game is for a mature audiance and by that I do not mean 17+ because of language and nudity but because the players are primarily veterans of the Mechwarrior games from the late 90's/early 2000's.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't play, just be aware that it's not a game for those of little patience\n-  Yes, they ask for money.  You can buy mechs outright or grind out money and items.  The game is NOT pay to win and you can play it completely free if you're willing to take the time to work through it.  The stuff you pay for is getting mechs/equipment early or for cosmetics\n\nSo, if you're looking for a game that requires true tactical teamwork, has arguably fair pricing, looks amazing and can feel pretty rewarding then this game is something you should check out.","January 27","true","343.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

THIS IS A GAME FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT STRATEGY AND TACTIC IS.\n\nSo, you have a mech, you sit in cockpit, waiting for drop, then you push forward to meet your enemy. Prepare to live exactly 10 seconds if you do that, because it's the best way to get f...ed. This game requires coordination, strategy and tactics. No matter if you drive lightweight fast Locust or 100 tons beast of doom like Atlas. Don't pay attention where your team mates are, and your internal organs will decorate the landscape. This game requires you to think. From the moment you decide what mech to drive, through it's design and specs to the battle itself.\n\nSure it has it's flaws (it begs for better terrain simulation, because f.ck it annoys me when I shoot on a clear line of fire and then it turns out it's not so clear after all, because some model had invisible boundaries). That begs to be fixed or just done better.\n\nThe system itself is nicely balanced, good if you are a beginner or if you already know Battletech. I used to play board game a lot and Mechwarror from the old days when it first came out (yay for 486 DX4 ;)) so I must say I love it. Best online game for me.

I absolutely love this game.  It is NOT perfect.  I think the cost for real money items can be a bit high, when you're paying 30.00 real money and the currency you get in game doesn't yield you enough for more than 1 mech that seems excessive.  However, you can play the game without dropping a single dime and have a great time doing it.  I have only played quick matches because i'm still feeling the game out but I do absolutely think this is my personal favorite FPS style game.\n\nMech Customization is a bit fixed.  You can not put clan weaponry on inner sphere mechs and I find that to be a draw back but I think they're doing it because the game is set in 3051 which predates the 3055 sourcebook that was the introduction of Clan tech on innersphere mechs with the exctensive list of IIC mechs that came out such as the Rifleman IIC and so forth.

Mechwarrior is a shooter that doesn't reward reflexes rather than it rewards careful strategy and knowledge. Understanding the game is your key to winning, but unfortunately it can be a bit difficult to get into.\n\nThere is lots of things to juggle and pay attention to at one time while you play. Heat, Armor, Ammo, Movement speed, Limb Strength, current torso direction, current leg direction, radar. Its a lot. When you first play it is a bewildering amount of information that confuses you and makes it hard for you to really know what you are doing. But once you get it, it becomes second nature. You find yourself calling out enemy locations while getting missile lockons, targetting air strikes, and keeping your heat/armor carefully managed.\n\nThis is the game's strength. When you finally master the game you really feel like you are piloting a 100 ton battlemech. It feels good to fire autocannons and break the leg of an enemy mech and see him limp away in fear. It feels dire when you run as a light mech, dodging enemy fire and attempting to sabatoge the support units of the enemy team.\n\nSure the game is complex as all get out, but that makes it all the more *real*. Nothing gives you such grim satisfaction as turning off your heat protection and blowing out your engine in order to suicide kill an enemy mech. Feeling the loud slam as Particle cannon tears off your left arm and you retaliate with your remaining right. Never before has any game but the Mechwarrior series made me feel like I'm actually driving something. You feel connected to your Atlas or Timber Wolf as you would your car or truck. They even made it to the point where you can hear your engine malfunctioning if you are on low health, and you can listen to the hissing of your failing heat sinks if they are destroyed.\n\nMake no mistake. This game is in beta. It still has a long way to go before it is perfect. There's also a lot of skill involved, and it isn't the kind of game that you can learn in just a few hours. But once you do, it is great fun and it is also free!\n\nSo join me, and maybe I'll see you on the battlefield mechwarrior.","January 30","true","190.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're looking for a simulation experience with tactical gameplay, solid cooperation in every match and a positive and friendly community then look no further. Given that there is very few mech/mecha type games out there of this calibre, luckily MWO really has nailed most of what you want. The maps are big and detailed. The mechs are very customisable. This is a simulation where skill is required - but forgiving enough for a novice. When you relay coordinates and see people actively respond it shows you the community understand teamwork. When you spend the time and effort tagging opponents and people thank you for it - it's worth it. You can play a ranged game, a stealth game or get amongst it and brawl.

My other complaint is how much the mechs cost, they are WAY overpriced and trying to grind c-bills for them takes a very long time unless you have no job, school or life.  My advice to you is do some research before spending your cadet bonus money on a mech you might not want later on and check out all the trial mechs (they change every now and then) to find a mech you like.  nothing feels worse than spending a whole ton of c-bills on a mech only to find out you dont like it.  they are adding new content all the time and if your patient you can get some decent mechs and items for free when challenges come up.","January 25","true","332.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Enjoy a wide variety of mechs that specialise in different ways of play. They range from your up close an personal brawler, to your sniper, missle battery, support class and many others that are too many to name. Pretty much what what ever your play sytle is, MWO has something for you. and enough variety that you don't get easily bored. The number of maps are growing steadily which is nice to see. Also the maps them selves can be either balanced, or favored to one side or to a certain type of play. this makes teamwork extremely crucial for victory and gives something for everyone to do and be happy with. all in all this is a great product as long as you have the time to spend.\n\nThe game is a bit grindy so to speak. it will take a lot of effort to get everything you would want in the game. there is also a premium pack that you can pay for with real life money if that is your thing. I personally don't mind spending $5-$10 on a free game since it helps developement of the game. however if you want things like paint jobs or accessories or to buy mech flat out with cash it is so expensive it will make your wallet snap shut. it would cost you $30-$40 to buy a mech flat out with cash which is kinda stupidly expensive.\n\nAdvise to new players,\nInt he beginning do the turorial it gives you ingame money also save all your turotrial money and your new cadet bonus money until you figure out what type of mech you want. You can have anything from light to medium, even heavy and assault classes. when you figure out a chassis that you like and your play style buy a mech and outfit it to what you want out of it. until then, again save your ingame money because it can be difficult to reaquire.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTo the developers,\nthe prices of your consumables and other items are what you would expect. However the cost of mechs are stupidly expenensive. making them $10-$15 would bring in more sales. since you have the softcores and the hardcores buying mechs instead of only the hard cores. Also the price of unlocked paint/camos/cockpit accessories is also extremely high.\n\nThe MWO product is self is a great product, runs smooth even on an old computer or a high end new one, so you have a very wide player base in terms of pc budget. The graphicsa are nice, although it would be nice to see the pilot breath during boot up and shut downn modes for a little extra eye candy. also please make a setting for depth of field because the game can get kinda grainy when your sniping 1250m+ away.\n\nInnersphere/Clan mechs\n\nthe innesphere mechs are stupidly unbalanced to clan mechs and have a but ton of useful quirks while a clan mech may only receive a slight exp bonus at the end of a round. Clan mechs are suppost to be drastically more high tech in comparisson to innersphere mechs according to game lore. because of the advantage of innerphere with both mech costs and quirks the clan mechs are severely at a disadvantage. if the balance is not going to be fixed at least make clan mechs relatively the same cost as innerphere instead of them often being 50%-100% more expensive","January 25","true","188.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No. It is NOT pay to win. Pay for convenience, absolutely. I spent the first year or so that I played without dropping a dime. It will take you time to build up a large reserve of cash and mechs if you don't invest anything but you absolutely can. Sure there are a few things that you can only buy with real world cash, about two dozen mechs, mech bays and paint. The mechs are nothing special, the bays can be won in some challenges/in-game achievements and the paint is purely aesthetics.\n\nThe next problem I see people have is that there is a large learning curve. The game has become much more newbie friendly recently with the addition of a training academy tutorial and a tier system that will help to place you with similar skill level pilots. The issue many people have coming into the game is expecting a Hawken or CoD like shooter. This game is about tactics and attrition. You will need to hit your opponent more than once to bring him down at the same time avoiding as much damage as possible. My number one recommendation is to join a unit. Your peers are going to be a HUGE help with teaching tactics, mech building and the like.\n\nThere is also a quickly growing competitive side to the game with PGI even hosting a tournament with a 100k cash purse. There are player driven leagues with cash prizes and a shout casts on twitch and with the new spectator tools allow for some really fun to watch battles.\n\nOverall I strongly recommend this game.","January 21","true","502.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

My actual experience is more than Steam hours suggest.\n\nMWO, in its current development, is a solid and reasonably fleshed out shooter.  More specifically, it's a Mechwarrior game, meaning it's at least somewhat loyal to the Battletech universe.  It's fun to play, fun to plan out, and quite challenging as you progress through the Tiers (skill level system that tries to match you against similarily skilled players).\n\nThe good:\n1. Lots of big robots of varying kinds, each with unique qualities, shapes, weapon options, and experience.\n2. Quite a decent list of different locations/planets/terrains/environments to carry out a match in.\n3. Decent selection of weapon types to suit different playstyles, ranges, loadout mixes, and flavour/interest.\n4. The beginnings of an overarcing goal in the form of a galaxy map where you can expand/defend your chosen faction.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Not a lot of gamemodes to play, and fairly limited variance between them.\n2. No real reward/benefit to conquering planets on the Faction/galaxy map other than ego.\n3. No missions or similar kinds of matches to make it feel like a real galaxy/war that you're fighting in.\n\nIn the end, MWO is a lot of fun to play - so right there I have to recommned it.  Everything is free, if you want, so you really don't have to invest any cash in it at all.\nI find myself regularly logging in after a couple of years, and still having a good time.\nI think MWO could really expand to the point of having a lot of depth - which would make it a really killer option.  In reality, though, it still feels a little bit incomplete/lacking.  The matches themselves are fun, but there doesn't seem to be a grander purpose - which I think would be valuable in a galactic game with a rich story background.\n\nWorth checking out.  Stompy robots, my friends, with big guns.","January 13","true","486.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have too much to say and I won't bore anyone with it. The game is pretty, it's fun, it is free, and most importantly remember it is a work in progress.\n\nDownload and enjoy!","January 13","true","131.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

PGI is dedicated to making this game a quality product and has worked tirelessly, especially since splitting from their former publisher IGP over a year ago.  Content in the form of new mechs, new maps and game modes has been steadily increasing while PGI also puts a lot of work into game balance.  The community is a very passionate one and does not always agree with PGI's decisions regarding balance but PGI usually has it's eye on the long term and, for the most part, balances choices have been for the best.  The game is picking up more depth and although I have had periods where I was unsure about my passion for the game, I return to it with fresh enthusiam and hope.  Thank you PGI!","January 14","true","810.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a fun FPS that really makes you feel like you're in a giant walking death machine. It gets tiresome sometimes but since the developer separated from the original publisher, everything has been better. The support, the free stuff, the updates. This game feels like it's on the rise and in a F2P FPS, that's important.","January 14","true","41.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You'll spend just as long tinkering with your mechs as you will using said mechs to facesmash people. Few games have the amount of satisfaction this game does when you make a good mech or when you do a good shot and cripple another player.\n\nInsanely moreish, not too grindy and definitely worth playing!","January 15","true","173.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I was an Elite Founder myself. There were many rocky patches during development, I even had to take a break for a while. However I can assure you that what you see here on steam is one of  if not the most solid mech game out there, especially for the current gen, the only games that could compare would be Armoured Core 4 or Chrome Hounds.\n\nIf you like a slow-paced tactical shooter, or if you like big stompy robits, or if you like flashy lazar beemz, frankly if you like vidya I recommend you give MWO a try. Heck, its free, whats to lose?","January 15","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Mechwarrior is a shooter that doesn't reward reflexes rather than it rewards careful strategy and knowledge. Understanding the game is your key to winning, but unfortunately it can be a bit difficult to get into.\n\nThere is lots of things to juggle and pay attention to at one time while you play. Heat, Armor, Ammo, Movement speed, Limb Strength, current torso direction, current leg direction, radar. Its a lot. When you first play it is a bewildering amount of information that confuses you and makes it hard for you to really know what you are doing. But once you get it, it becomes second nature. You find yourself calling out enemy locations while getting missile lockons, targetting air strikes, and keeping your heat/armor carefully managed.\n\nThis is the game's strength. When you finally master the game you really feel like you are piloting a 100 ton battlemech. It feels good to fire autocannons and break the leg of an enemy mech and see him limp away in fear. It feels dire when you run as a light mech, dodging enemy fire and attempting to sabatoge the support units of the enemy team.\n\nSure the game is complex as all get out, but that makes it all the more *real*. Nothing gives you such grim satisfaction as turning off your heat protection and blowing out your engine in order to suicide kill an enemy mech. Feeling the loud slam as Particle cannon tears off your left arm and you retaliate with your remaining right. Never before has any game but the Mechwarrior series made me feel like I'm actually driving something. You feel connected to your Atlas or Timber Wolf as you would your car or truck. They even made it to the point where you can hear your engine malfunctioning if you are on low health, and you can listen to the hissing of your failing heat sinks if they are destroyed.\n\nMake no mistake. This game is in beta. It still has a long way to go before it is perfect. There's also a lot of skill involved, and it isn't the kind of game that you can learn in just a few hours. But once you do, it is great fun and it is also free!\n\nSo join me, and maybe I'll see you on the battlefield mechwarrior.","January 30","true","190.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Before you start to yelling,  to any\nOne who has played the mektek mod for MW:M,  you know exactly what I am saying,  that mod added 300+ Mechs to a game that already had 100+.  On top of all of that EVERY mech in that mod was official.  Imagine all the potential in all of that.\n\n\nall the comments that are negative are salty kids who spent money on Mechs and then realized they didn't know how to play","January 22","true","88.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're looking for a simulation experience with tactical gameplay, solid cooperation in every match and a positive and friendly community then look no further. Given that there is very few mech/mecha type games out there of this calibre, luckily MWO really has nailed most of what you want. The maps are big and detailed. The mechs are very customisable. This is a simulation where skill is required - but forgiving enough for a novice. When you relay coordinates and see people actively respond it shows you the community understand teamwork. When you spend the time and effort tagging opponents and people thank you for it - it's worth it. You can play a ranged game, a stealth game or get amongst it and brawl. As a final bonus, there are paid elements but you can do everything in game and there is no pay to win - David can always beat Goliath!","January 25","true","44.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
