Please 'o' please don't listen to these imbaciles giving a negative reviews of a proper racing simulator.\n\nStarting things off, there is currently no way you could enjoy a proper racing game without investing time to set it up first. Look at those negative reviews, they barely even scratched the iceberg with 0.2/0.5 hours of gameplay?\nI've been playing a lot of racing simulators so I know my way around setting it up.\n\nNow, ehem, this game is a lot for a free game. Heck you get all 4 licensed for not a single penny! They put a lot of effort in this game, especially in the FBB I love how it feels, how the car slides, how you lose grip when you hit a curb. The graphics is by far descent. I'm playing with n i3 and a GTX750 and I can run it max, talk about optimization. The AI is just wonderful, clearly a large amount of effort was put into this. (Now I think you're saying why are they saying the AI is bad? Well did you actually think those players are good? Food for thought)\n\nBottom line I say, if you have a gaming steering wheel you got to try this out. I know you have interest in simulations since you looked this up, I know too you are more capable than these fools that complains just about everything.\n\nAnd to the Devs, well done sirs and madams well done.","April 10, 2015","true","7.9"," 438 of 476 people (92%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","92","438","476","40","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DengekiReporter/recommended/359800/","DengekiReporter","Dengekiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DengekiReporter/","406 products in account","As soon as I loaded this game up, I knew exactly what I was in for. Developed by Reiza Studios, the same folks behind the excellent Game Stock Car 2013 (Extreme now) and Formula Truck 2013 series of games, this is pretty much the same thing, but on the Brazilian stock car circuit. While not familiar with the Brazilian circuit myself, I thoroughly enjoy the aforementioned games, and anyone else that is familiar with those will feel right at home as well. This is mainly the reason that I am able to write this review with such little play time on this at the moment!\n\nSo on to the gameplay! Once you're behind the wheel of either of three different car manufacturers (for now anyway), you'll see the familiar gMotor 2 engine used with these games, from the HUD to the ever-so-lovely shift/rpm gauge. Of course, these can be turned off (thankfully), which gives you a more realistic sim experience, if that is your cup of tea. And yes, you can change the view from the default cockpit! This is found in the Options > Display menu. There are a multitude of other settings that can be changed as well, from the number of cars seen on-screen at once to graphical settings. Most gamers with mid to high range machines can naturally max out these settings, as the graphics are not quite up to the same standards as Asetto Corsa and the likes. But, to me anyway, they look pretty good right out of the box, so to speak. This can also be said for the car handling physics, which are the same as other entries from Reiza Studios. And that is to say that they are some of the best that I have experienced in any racing game to date. Again, those that have played the games I mentioned know what I am referring to.\n\nIn summary, if you've played the other games Reiza has offered, you know what you're in for, and will feel right at home once you're in the game. If you're even remotely interested in racing games that are more of a simulation, then you should definitely give this a try. And heck, even if you don't like racing games, give it a try anyway. After all, how can you go wrong with a free game, especially one of this magnitude. What are you waiting for, add it to your Steam library right now!!!","April 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 94 of 117 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","94","117","9","3"

The controls are quite nice and smooth, even with my crappy old racing wheel. Graphics are OK, they aren't PS4 standards... They feel... 2010'ish, but still pleasing to look at, it works for what it is quite well. The customization and options are unbeliveble! You can change a lot of stuff to your liking, even on the camera, it's the first racing game i've seen that you can adjust the angle of the third person camera, its really neat!\n\nThe game suffers a little bit on the HUD department tho, kinda barebones and there isn't a map, like other racing games usually have (unless it's hidden on some option menu i havent found)... also, the menus aren't the most intuitive and user-friendly, you will have to spend some time to fiddle with the options to find what you need, but when you get everything set up to your controller, it will be a blast!\n\nSome people seem to have problem playing with the keyboard, but since i played with a racing wheel, i cant say... even tho the game has a lot of options, with some patience, you probably can make any controller work fine!\n\nIf it had multiplayer i would gladly pay for it, it's a really nice game!","April 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","46","58","6","0"

But it just falls short when compared.\nThere are 4 different cars in the entire game, each with 2 different liveries. But they all feel the same.\nthere are also 6 different tracks in the entire game, each with it's own feel to them. Nothing bad to say here.\nOptions have been made well, there's a lot to change, controls, audio, display, and also difficulty of the game and rules of the races.\n\nAnd then there's the driving physics. None of these cars have ever spun on me, even with every driving assist off. They just feel as if they were FWD, is that supposed to be that way? Other than that, clutch works, brakes do lock, and You do lose control in certain situations, but it's way too easy.\nSame goes to the rival AI, once passed they do nothing to get their position back, and even before You pass them they seem like they were just moving obstacles on the road.\n\nGraphics are... not that bad actually, the contrast etc is fairly well balanced, but everything else is just not there. True, there are working real-time shadows of the cars and the track but... that's it. No real-time car reflections, they're just reflecting the skybox (which isn't any good either, just about 20 small clouds on the sky), no motion blur, no depth of field, nothing! It's the middle of 2015, what were you thinking?\nSound is nice, You can hear everything happening around You, Cars do sound a little different but that's it, nothing spectacular again.\n\nLong review short, it's an average game when compared to other racing "simulators" out there, but from what I've seen, it's a good way to get into "arcade-simulator racing" as I call it. There aren't many cars to master, and they all feel the same so it's not a huge hop to change a car, the tracks aren't too hard to master, the AI isn't too hard and unforgiving, etc etc.\n\nSo if You're new to the simulator genre, have an old computer which can't run modern games and a steering wheel do get it. It's for free so You can find out if You're going to like simulator racing or not. But if You do, please do get GTR2 and find some mods for it because that is the best way to get into "hardcore simulator racing". It's from 2005 so Your PC will run it, and it has a damn well written physics engine.","August 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

I've pressed every button my keyboard, testing things out, and couldn't get my car to actually start. The control panel had what seemed like MILLIONS of controls, and would be very hard to remember them all, especially if you don't play often. I've fixed my controls though, and finally started to drive.\n\nI turned off gasoline useage, tire ware, etc. so I could get used to the driving. Even with the fixed controls, the car was still very hard to control, and since some of the maps have a lot of twists and turns, I crashed often, or slowed down, and the AIs caught up, thus me ending up in 10th place in 10 minutes, even with a map I chose with only a couple of turns. Everytime I got back onto the track after crashing into the walls, I'd sometimes get hit with a passing AI, ending in me crashing AGAIN. Sometimes this cycle would repeat 2 or 3 times. Other than that, I had a lot of fun racing, and hope to soon get better as I play more.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are decent\n- Sound is awesome (in my opinion at least)\n- Beautiful car details\n- Free to play\n- Runs on slow computers\n- Perfect game for if you don't have a lot of money\n- No lag\n- Replays are cool\n\nCons\n- Hard to drive\n- Music is annoying\n- No tutorials\n- Controls are like wow\n\nOverall, I will give this a game a 6/10 and I recommended you give it a try if you like racing games.\n\n","January 3","true","1.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

So if you want some funny arcade game, this is not your cup of tea. Graphics is working under Direct-X 9, very nice models, but nowadays it looks like the graphics in racing games in years between 2006 - 2008. Engine sounds are not very real, but this is a same problem, like Project Cars, GRID2, and lots of other car racing games have, so do not be dissapointed. I have been playing this about less than 15 minutes? Behind view is very funny, you just see only your seat, nothing else behind. :D No damage model (but it is understandable, most car producers does not want crashing their cars in racing games) If you do not have anything else, it is free, so you can say "it is still better than nothing" and I am really confident, there will be someone who will like this "game" or "racing simulation". Very real looks interior view, where no hands are holding your racing wheel, but you can look left and right and the interior looks very nice. If they put some DX 11 efects, this game would be very nice to watch. This game looks designer for racing wheel owners, it worked on my keyboard, but it was weird and every corner I was telling myself "If I had a steering wheel, if I hade a steering wheel!!!" But on the replay videos It looked just fine.\n\nSo...Recomend or not? Definitely recommend! It's free and steering wheel owners with older PC could be satisfied. If you have slower computer, so you will be probably satisfied with Graphics and you can play it for free.

The result is that the game offers a solid, reliable driving experience similar to games such as GTR and F1 Challenge 99-02, though in a different scenario: Brazilian racecars and circuits, recreated with great attention to detail - thanks Reiza Studios!\n\nIt is important to notice that, as a serious race simulation, the game requires a steering wheel if you want to enjoy what it has to offer. Graphics are a bit outdated, but the overall driving experience, the sound and the detailed models make up for it. On the other hand, the game doesn't require a Master Race desktop setup.\n\nIf you're Brazilian, you know what to expect. If you're not, it's chance to know some tracks popular in Ayrton Senna's country, and take some popular vehicles such as the Focus, the Lancer and the Corolla for a drive. In the real competition, these cars are equipped with a similar engine and a fixed ratio gearbox (this aspect was thoroughly recreated in the game).\n\nMost importantly, Copa Petrobras de Marcas is free to play. Not the microtransaction type, it is actually free!

The only reason this game is free is because Brazil's largest oil company Petrobras is paying the bill. Marcas is a promotional game built on a quality sim engine, by people who know how to make this engine shine better than the original programmers.\n\nYou get a FULL TC championship, with the same great handling that comes with Reizas Game Stock Car series.\n\nIf you have a FFB steering wheel you are in for a treat, as Reiza's Stock Car series has been universally recognized as having one of the best driving models in the business. The graphics are crisp and functional, without unnessessary eye candy (check SweetFX*), so the game can be played on most mid range machines at the highest graphical settings.\n\nI was actually happy that the Marcas content was recently added to the Stock Car Extreme game, as it is one one my favorite Reiza classes to drive - being front wheel driven they require a different style. FWD is another detail some negative reviews seem to miss when they discuss handling.\n\nAs for the comment on driving views - there are many camera views (!), in and outside the car.\n\nBefore posting negative reviews, take a little time to check the set up possibilities, controls etc, and you'll find that almost anything can be set up. Same for FFB, it can be tweaked to near perfection. At best any negatives given on these issues show a lack of looking for the proper settings - read stupidity of the reviewer.\n\nMost of the negative comments seem to come from people who are expecting an arcade racer, with basic one size fits all ez mode, game pad support, game pad friendly handling and "eye candy" visuals.\n\nUnfortunately by doing so they completely miss the point - as non target audience of this game - and trash the game accordingly.\n\nPearls before swine I'm tempted to say.....\n\nThe graphics are GOOD, nice and crisp SIM STYLE, instead of the on steroids Michael Bay kind you find in most arcade racers.\n\nGet a good FFB wheel, take some time to set up this game - my Logitech Driving Force GT requires NEGATIVE FFB to work correctly, you have to know that and deal with it. These are really essential requirements, just like installing the SweetFX* shaders to get optimal visuals.\n\nLearn how to drive with the free copa game and soon you'll be buying Stock Car Extreme for all its other classes and tracks. Want something really different, get Formula Truck.\n\nI own the original non-Steam versions of Reizas games, including the older GSC2012 - still cool, still on the hdd and I still play them.\n\nSummery\n- arcade racers move on (please, and stop reviewing)\n- get a good ffb wheel (essentiel with race sims)\n- take some time to tweak your settings (also essentiel, no one size fits all in sims)\n- install SweetFX (...some eye candy)\n- have fun RACING (the whole point)\n- give Marcas and Reiza some well deserved love!\n\n*The post processing effects you see in videos and screenshots are not standard, but can be easily installed. SweetFX - takes less the a couple of minutes to set up.\n\nhttp://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sweetfx-reiza-settings-for-gsc-extreme-formula-truck-2013.3482/","April 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I`ve been playing sim games for many years now, gtlegends, rfactor, race07, iracing and rfactor2, i`ll even spout I own what I would class as arcade racers ie shift 1,2 dirt 1,2,3 f1 2010 etc etc....\n\nMy setup does not involve a joypad if your gonna play a sim then buy a wheel its that simple, I love my g27.\n\nOnto Copa\n\nGraphics: the gfx are poor for a game this recent, a mediocre laptop could run this at full whack and not suffer.\nSound: music was ok in menu, car sounds suck massive unicorn wang! meaning they are the worst Ive ever heard.\ncontrol: wheel setup was easy, the cars feel very unrealistic even running on veteran settings.\nOnline: is there an online? i dunno it was uninstalled after about 10 mins.\n\nconclusion: If your a serious sim racer avoid this game at all costs you will be nothing but disappointed with it even given the fact that its free. If your an arcade racer then I spose its ok but my 2 cents would say to look elsewhere for arcade racers, I would even recommend the original Grid game over this. The only plus` I can give this game is the inmenu music and the ui is easy enough to navigate.\n\nSo all being said serious sim racers not wanting to spend money on iracing dont get this lol,,, do yourself a favour and get rfactor2 or even race07, you will have far more fun with those titles... now excuse me while I load up rfactor2 and go hit nord in autumn on full HD with the nissan gtr :) nuff said,,, avoid copa unless your an arcade racer!!!!!\n\n\n","August 9, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 25 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","4","25","0","0"

Just remember when to lift at the end of the straights.\n\n2) change the assists and the car still tries to steer itself a little in the corners. Set the FFB to above zero and you can feel it. at +50% (yes it is possible to have -50%) you end up fighting the wheel to strighten up to the line out of the corners.\n\n3) if you don't like the bumper view the camera options are horrible\n\n4) I tired interlagos for 20 minutes. At the end of the pit straight the braking markers on the right side are missing and with the camera view it is impossible to judge the braking distance. I did 10 laps and went off every time.\n\n5) Although it has many defualt wheel configs they all need to be customised and it's not immediately obvious how you do it.\n\nPros\n\n1) race 07/rfacetor engine.\n\n2) defualt setup for the evo (only car i tried) is good. very grippy and stable.\n\n3) free\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are new to racing games. This is one to try. It will help teach you the racing lines and how a car should feel before you dive into something like LFS/ Race 07/Asstto Corsa. If you have any experience, it's best to avoid unless you want an easy game to play while drinking and driving but the Need For Speed games exist for that purpose.","August 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 32 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","7","32","0","2"

Yes.\n\nIs this a multiplayer game? Sadly no.\n\nWould it be worth paying 10 bucks for if it wasn't free? No.\n\nThe reason why it's not worth 10 bucks is because it's only singleplayer, and you can only race a couple of track.\n\nAnd there aren't that many cars. So no, it's a fun game. But not worth much money.\n\n\nBut that's why it's free, do I recommend it??? Ummmmm. Well, for the racing itself yes. And if your gonna get this game, that's probably what your into.\n\n\nBut for the game itself? Nope. It's good as a free game but look at Trove for an example of what a great free game is (it's not even constricting, you don't need to buy anything even though it does have microtransactions).\n\n\n\nNow I know I clicked the "No" on the "Do you recommend this game" thing. But here is the thing, I wouldn't recommend it for the lack of features, not for the racing. So if your not bothered by this then go and get it. The racing is great, the features, not so much.","January 3","false","1.1"," 2 of 21 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","2","21","0","2"

The fact that it is free might turn you off to downloading it, but trust me it is worth it. The only racing games I usually play are Need for Speed and Forza, and this game was kind of hard to get use to at first, but it was incredibly fun once i learned it. This game is chock full of features and controls. It runs very good on low end PCs and laptops. The cars handle pretty realistically and sound amazing. The only problem I have with this game is the lack of cars (which I'm sure they will add more) and the recycle bin sound when exiting a menu..... haha.  But overall this game is a steal for free.

The good news is that this 30 day demo, rather than sixty minutes, and it's only 2.1 GB.\n\nOriginal Review\nThis is a nice game that is essentially an in-depth demo for Stock Car Extreme, another racing game from the same publisher. It's very detailed with nice features like in-depth car set-up, in-race adjustments like brake bias and lots of other realism settings. It supports a variety of racing wheels, but I did just fine with my X360 controller. The graphics are a bit dated,  but better than GTR or Race 07, which it very much will remind you of if you have played those game. The nice thing about the less than bleeding edge graphics is that you don't need an uber-rig to run the game at a nice rock solid 60 fps. There are plenty of in-cockpit and other views, and a replay feature too.\n\nThere are six tracks included, including a nice "square" oval that is a good training ground for new drivers. There are all sorts of options when racing as well. Opponents can be set to any number up to sixteen, you can select rolling or standing starts, and you can also decide whether to include practice as well as qualifying sessions.\n\nRaces can be run against a clock or by completion of a number of laps. Tire wear and fuel use can be set to normal or can be multiplied to simulate a longer session. AI driver skill can be adjusted, as well as their aggression level.\n\nThis is a nice racing game even if you had to play a few dollars for it, but for free?

The fact that it is free might turn you off to downloading it, but trust me it is worth it. The only racing games I usually play are Need for Speed and Forza, and this game was kind of hard to get use to at first, but it was incredibly fun once i learned it. This game is chock full of features and controls. It runs very good on low end PCs and laptops. The cars handle pretty realistically and sound amazing. The only problem I have with this game is the lack of cars (which I'm sure they will add more) and the recycle bin sound when exiting a menu..... haha.  But overall this game is a steal for free. I hope to see more cars and improvements, of course. I'll rate this game a 8.5/10.","April 10, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise you are gimping yourself of any drivability and you will miss out on just how good titles such as this can be.\n\nControl of your inputs, smooth accceleration, controlled braking, finesse in the steering is what these titles are designed for. Pressing A to go and X to stop is just...wrong.\n\nYou get a handful of cars and tracks for your money...which is $0, and that gives you enough content to keep a driver satisfied for sometime. Learing how each car drives, and then mastering it whilst learning all the intricacies of a track\nis what you do here. It is not a matter of "Grats Dude! You just drove 3 laps in Shiny Supercar A, not go take Extra Shiny Super Car B for a spin! Put it on Youtube!"\n\nPro points:\n\nAll content free.\nNice cars.\nGood tracks\nTried and tested engine.\nGreat FFB\n\nCons:\n\nWhilst engine is good, and you will get super high FPS, it is a touch dated.\nBring this into a next gen engine and Sim drivers will need to clean the white stains off their undershorts.\nThats about it for the cons really.\n\nTitles such as this, for free, and others you can get pretty cheap these days, such as GTR2, the Race series, Rfactor 1 are still very enjoyable, great to drive and extrememly entertaining.\n\nIf you are new to simming and looking for titles to cut your teeth before investing more heavily, and you have a half decent FFB wheel, get this. Then go buy Stock Car Extreme.","July 17, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a rearranged and revamped UI skin.  Once you pass the first screen its painfully obvious what you are playing because no matter how you skin it, rFactor, stands out from its other clones like Race 07 and all of its variants.   The time favored menu options are still here.  Now the dead giveaway for me was the garage and its tuning options. The UI is so annoying and confusing to navigate to accomplish whatever tuning or changes you wish to make.\nLoading out onto the track was like a joke. It screamed GTMAX world touring car mod (a rFactor user made mod) from 2011. Same Toyota, however this Focus version is new, seen this Lancer before.   Although these modders make a better default cockpit view. Its more like looking through a person with two eyes , than that narrow perspective ♥♥♥ rFactor "I must have only one eye" FOV.\n\nThe controls by far, hands down, are a billion times more understandable and appreciated over rFactors ♥♥♥♥ for sensory feed back.   It seems like rFactor was geared towards idiots with logitech wheels, and not really followed by people with actual quality made devices.   As if the modder community just are a bunch of blow hards.  I do play rFactor  as a die hard fan, since it came out. But what I say is true.     This game without even touching any settings I chose to set out onto the track to see how "factor" like it was, and was proven wrong.  I was so happy to see that my first turn, that i said to myself "this is just about how i would steer if I were sitting in this car" actually gave the car the direction I wanted.\n\nExcellent job guys. That alone is something to cheer about.  Though being an rFactor fan, it makes me wonder if the settings we see and the choices that are configured in the .PLR file are set with some options that are in place to create that superb handling.\n\nSuch as the fact that I cannot do anything about my infant drivers weak ♥♥♥ neck and his floppy loppy head banging around in the cockpit.  That ♥♥♥♥ is so wrong for one god damn reason. Yes G forces will batter your head from side to side, but, our amazing "anti skip technology" built in to our eyes, prevents us from having that unuseable sight of vibration.  Eyeballs let us look to the side without moving our heads. They allow the head to move without the area we are viewing to pan tilt or skew whilst our heads move along dang near any axis.     If my noodle neck driver could just hold his head still, (and option in all other games using this sim engine) it would be so much more fun to play.  But as  I inspected the games files I am to belive they acomplish their handles by using a slightly different approach. And I think its that they use the games physics engine in a different way. I believe this game bases the cars handles off of the drivers head physics, versus the other games having the .HDV file, the SUSP.pm, the , tires.tbc, and a few other components to configure how your car would feel on the track.\n\nWhatever it is, great job.\nQuestionable though I just find this game after its makers get bought out.\nYou guys going to do a clone port of rFactor 2?\nThat would be awesome if you keep improving the steering experience.\n:D","May 2, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Cars them selves look very nice. The surroundings are not particularly great, however you shouldnt notice it if you are looking where you are going! ;)\nUser Interface (UI): 46/100. It doesnt look the prettiest. Simple design however it feels like it's the wrong colours that just make it look... not right?\nArtificial Intelligence (AI): 96/100. The AI feels perfect. They notice that your there (unlike other tittles recently). They know if you are faster then them then they would move over to let you through. But dont think it's that easy ;) If a bot wants to challenge they will. You can get some really good battles.\nFrames Per Second (FPS): 85/100. I didn't have many FPS drops when playing it that were particularly noticeable. I wasnt sure how many frames I do drop because I had to use the Keyboard to drive, due to the game not noticing my wheel.\nSounds: 87/100. The car sounds are good. The music is meh, but you can turn tht off in the menu. The game notices what type of terrain you driving over, for example when going over rumble strips, you for sure know you are.\nContent: Currently at 68/100. There are only the one class of car currently in the game. There are about 6 different race tracks. About 4 different types of car. Single race, Test day and Championship. I am not sure if they are planning to add more content in the furture?\nControls: 72/100. The game does have a few wheels that it knows, such as G25 or the G27 and some Thrustmaster ones like the TM 500. You can use a Xbox gamepad and your keyboard. (If you do use your Keyboard make sure to check the keybinding's)\nOverall rating = 73/100\nOverall great for a Free to Play! If you like racing games then I would suggest this to you. Only a small download nothing big. Good base to the game if they want to make more content. Few problems with the UI looking weird, all in all, worth the download.","June 24, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its the handling and how it "feels", well again I've many race games on and off steam, and I think so far this is great, its responsive and you can tell understeer etc, so tuning shouldnt be too hard. over all i'm very impressed, and I'l recommend it on the brief anount of game play I have had. after all I have paid for racing games that I have really regretted.

I've played trying to 'improve' my driving, as the physics are realistic, these are close to a real car (Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, etc). You can even feel you're a troll with the AI and bump into them, they will give you a black flag but, who cares? I haven't played in multiplayer, although I've been told there is one. The car state is also simulated, the engine may overheat and break, or the wheels may also step out from the car and embed into a tree or pedestrian if you're a bad driver and bump into the walls or they will just suffer from wear.....I recommend it just for a boring sunday or monday, or when you've got nothing else to do in your interesting (or boring) life (or if your irl slow car is on the game [Chevy Cruze] and you wanna feel the Poweerr [thanks, Clarkson] it doesn't have).","December 17, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
