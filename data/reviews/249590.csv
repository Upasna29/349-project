Rain falls in torrents, molten steel glows ominously in the depths of the tower in which you explore, and electricity crackles and hums. It's a world of mechanical beasts that can destroy you in a moment, of dangerous traps and puzzles, of strange gadgets and weird machinery, and at the heart of this world is you and the Tower\n\nFleeing into this mysterious Tower, you'll work your way through its many rooms and floors, each offering new and inventive puzzles and obstacles to surmount. The game doesn't waste any time in throwing complex platforming puzzles at you; within the first 30 minutes or so, you'll already be equipped with a gauntlet able to reverse an object's polarity and blink boots that allow you to teleport a short distance. The puzzles and platforming all revolve around utilizing and switching between magnetic fields, causing objects to attract or repel. In this way, you turn platforms into barriers or elevators, move along ceilings or float over gaps, and more. Surviving the challenges require both puzzle solving and tight platforming as you time teleports between moving hazards or switch your own polarity to navigate around electric barriers. Hard to reach batteries offer replay value, as there's usually an optional extra challenge between you and the collectibles.\n\nI'm only about two and half hours in at the moment. If there was one minor flaw, it would be the lack of checkpoints in boss fights. While these fights simply revolve around pattern recognizaton and aren't that lengthy, it can be annoying to die and have to start fighting a boss from the beginning. But the boss fights themselves are fun and varied and use the mechanics in cool ways. Controls are responsive and simple, WASD to move, Space to jump, arrow keys to use your abilities. But from those simple controls, Rain Games has crafted a fun and challenging puzzle platfformer that not only offers exciting gameplay but a fantastic art style as well\n\nI'll update this review as I progress","December 13, 2013","true","6.7"," 490 of 508 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","490","508","0","42"

But then I was introduced to the first magnetic mechanic and all I could think was "wow, this is really cool."\n\nThat's something I kept thinking again and again as I got higher in the tower that houses the game's levels, with each new area bringing with it a new twist on mechanics I, for whatever reason, had mapped out in my head before even pressing start, It continually and cleverly subverted the concepts I've come to associate with games of its ilk, smartly introducing new mechanics that build upon those that come before, while simultaneously developing a rich medieval steampunk world for me to get lost in.\n\nThere's not a single line of dialogue in Teslagrad, be it written or spoken or even just a tutorial, and yet it manages to create this abundantly interesting narrative of a kingdom obsessed yet terrified of technology, and the power it brings with it. Paintings, reenactment cutscenes, and pieces of the environment are used to tell this story subtly, in a way that hides most of its simplicity and had me wanting to find out more about it up until the very end.\n\nSimilar methods are used for each gameplay hook, most of which involve manipulating magnetic polarities. Tools are trickled out to you and then liberally experimented with before giving you another to try and work with, which creates an invisible learning curve as you apply what you already know to the new obstacles placed before you. Teslagrad is always conscious of making sure you understand it, and giving you time to figure things out without punishing you for mistakes or taking too long.\n\nThat is, except for the boss fights. Though they're likely the coolest moments in the game, these few encounters are rife with tedious and agonizing trial and error death loops, with one hit kills and the complete lack of checkpoints causing them to go on far longer and be much more annoying than they otherwise would be. It's not even that many of the bosses are that hard to defeat once you understand their patterns, but they're so pattern based and often consisting of numerous different parts that you're left with no choice but to die over and over until you've memorized their every move and can play them back exactly. There are a handful of moments like this in various puzzles throughout, which stand out all the more starkly because of how well the rest of the game avoids falling into the same traps.\n\nThe inconsistent difficulty was rather a lot more frustrating than I'm making it out to be, but that should also say something about the quality of the game outside of those moments, which I was enjoying so much as to push through the times I was ready to snap my controller in half and curse my reflexes to hell. It's a gorgeous, clearly guided journey in a genre that's become more and more uninspired and cluttered, positioned awkwardly among its less impressive peers that will likely cause it to be passed over in the deluge. And that would be a horrible thing indeed.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","47","50","2","0"

I like the art style, the audio was mostly good (there were a few volume spikes) and the controls were handled well enough (except for some annoyances in the menus.)\n\nI want to be super clear. This game is unforgiving. Everything, everything is instant death. This isn't too terrible in most sections, except for the larger rooms where death will set you back to the entrance and it takes a while to get back to the part that's thwarting you.\nWhere it really starts to hurt is in the boss battles. Yeah, I'm not sure why there are boss battles in what is almost completely non-violent game (a few exceptions, but they're mostly avoidable)\nThe boss battles are brutal. No checkpoints. Die? You're back to the entrance to the room. Hit? At all? Dead. You're back to the entrance to the room. Any mistake? Any misjudgement? Die. Over and over and over again. Also, I don't know if I'm bad, or the controls just aren't as tight as they should have been, but I found myself dying repeatedly to stuff that I think I should have survived. (I can't be more specific without some spoilers.)\nI think that last boss killed me 100+ times before I finally beat him. (Then I had to do it again to get the right ending. Should have picked up all the scrolls the first time D: )\n\nI can honestly say I'll never play this again. But I don't exactly regret it either.\nThat said, if there's ever a sequel, I'll have to think long and hard about playing it.","February 10, 2015","true","7.4"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","0"

I had gone into the game expecting “Braid with magnets” and Metroidvania-style exploration. Instead, I got a Super Meat Boy clone with long, frustrating, unforgiving platforming segments and annoying trial-and-error bosses. The magnets are mainly used as a means to traverse death gauntlets, often with twitch-action polarity shifting. One wrong move and you’ll either die, or fall down a long way and be forced to climb back up. The magnet puzzles themselves are pretty bland and uninspired physics puzzles, and ultimately pointless. The level design is about as linear as a Super Mario Bros. level, and all four of the important powerups are placed directly in your path. Backtracking is only required for 100% completion (or if you happened to not find at least 15 of the 36 collectables to unlock the door to the final boss). Overall, it failed to meet just about all of the expectations I had for it.\n\nWhat redeems this game is the atmosphere, art style, and storytelling. There are no words or dialogue at all; this game tells quite a fascinating and unexpected story through the environments, characters, and pictures alone. The hand-drawn art and backgrounds are all beautiful to look at, and there’s no shortage of good music, both of the catchy and atmospheric variety. Perhaps it's style over substance, but for me it really worked.\n\nOnce I attained 100% completion and reached the best ending, I looked back upon the game and realized I was glad to have played it. It was a real emotional journey. There’s nothing at all awful about the game, it’s just average in a lot of ways. The difficulty isn’t actually all that hard, it’s just frustratingly out-of-place, and skill eventually did take over and help make the experience more enjoyable. And despite the lackluster puzzle design, there were some instances of great ideas in there; the secret scrolls were highly satisfying to find and collect. With minimal hints and hundreds of mistakes, I got 100% completion in less than 10 hours.\n\nSo, after much deliberation, this gets a thumbs-up from me. If you can get it on sale for half price, and if you can put up with the stupid platforming sections and the death gauntlets, you might also find there’s a lot to enjoy here.","April 7, 2015","true","8.7"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","1"

I agree, we only differ on whether we'd recommend it on that basis. I like the puzzling. For me the infuriating bits, mainly the non puzzle boss battles, ruin it entirely, there is no room for error, death is instant meaning you cannot make a single mistake or you'll start the battle all over again from scratch.\n\nAdded to which, trial and error is sometimes the only way to know what works and what doesn't. Fighting later bosses is exhaustingly repetative and brutal. It's all very retro, a reminder of times when games were punishingly hard and very repetative, if you are nostalgic for those times then you may enjoy it but I cannot recommend it.\n\nI play games to relax, and there is nothing relaxing about fighting the same boss countless times, making achingly slow progress with no clue how many 'hits' you need to land before it's finally over.","December 7, 2014","false","2.3"," 89 of 137 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","89","137","0","0"

I love metroid/vania style games and liked the lack of enemies for the most part with a focus on puzzles and collection.  The controls felt nice and when I died it was my fault.  The bosses are hard but the attacks are mostly pattern based, not very random so I'd learn and get better with each try.  The puzzles could get challenging but made sense and while timing was important in places I never felt rushed by the game.  The art style and atmosphere was great and the music wasn't bad.  Level design with a central tower and sub areas of rooms made for fairly easy backtracking to find scrolls.  The few powers felt useful and were taught well by the rooms they preceded, without any superfluous poorly implemented extras.  Also the game doesn't punish the player for dying with close checkpoints and fast respawn so trial and error is not penalized, which is great because I died a lot.  Overall this game avoided many of the pitfalls I've seen in games of this genre, while really shining at what it does.","September 29, 2015","true","8.4"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","1"

Infuriating at times, but overall very pleasant puzzle platformer. Well worth the time spent, I'd say, especially if any of the gripes below doesn't sound bad to you..\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n- Lovely art design, backgrounds, animation and music. Production values are overall very high, only a step below UbiArt games, I'd say. Very reminiscent of Braid, I'd say.\n- Good puzzles, solvable without resorting to outside help in most of the cases. Definitely nothing as obtuse as Gateways final puzzles.\n- Interesting player abilities. Can't really say that having magnets and Dishonored Blink was innovative, but the way they were used and interacted with each other very much worked in the game.\n- Controls were very good, even if the jumping was a tad too floaty for me. Would be a much bigger problem if the game had a bigger focus on platforming, but given that it was 80% puzzles, I can't really complain.\n- Metroidvania-lite concept with no forced backtracking - only some of the secret scrolls required revisiting areas, everything else could be done by the first visit.\n\nWhat I didn't care for:\n\n- Boss fights, or rather lack of checkpoints during boss fights. Main character doesn't have any sort of health meter/shield, so the second you touch any of the hazards, you're brought back to the beginning of the fight. Which gets a tad annoying if said fight has several stages with new, random hazards added in the later ones.\n- Few instances of physics not working consistently - I had worked out a few puzzle solutions, given up on them as non-working after a few tries, only to check online and find that I had the good idea, but one that requires blind luck to work out. This is only true for a few scrolls, nevertheless should not happen.\n- Lack of proper map - the game marks your location, sure, but doesn't allow for map scrolling and doesn't mark the collectibles you discovered but haven't solved yet. Which makes the whole map pretty useless.\n- The achievement system used by the game (1 for each of 36 hidden collectibles) could do with a revamp - you can 100% the game well before finishing actual playthrough. Would be lovely if the devs added at least a 'Finished the Game" achievement.\n- Weird performance issues - I don't have the fastest computer, true, but still, would not expect the game dropping down to 30 fps in few areas. Really noticeable when most of the game is silky smooth. I've also had the game crap out on me three or so times - game logic was still running, but the game stopped updating screen. Had to enter menu and quit the game using only sound effects as a guide.","July 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Upon reaching the tower, the promise of a grandiose adventure is all but assured. for all of its visual splendor, and the mystery surrounding the world, in the end, Teslagrad emerges as a beast only slightly greater than the sum of its often lacking parts.\n\nThe tower you will explore is filled with wondrous architecture, artwork and snippets of a tale of partnership, a burgeoning lust for power, and betrayal that followed. You'll discover more of the story of Teslagrad as you climb the tower, solving increasingly complex puzzles. Unfortunately, this complexity often comes more from the mechanics, than from the puzzle's ability to test your wit. The theme of Teslagrad is magnetism, and you soon earn greater abilities in pursuit of its control. Puzzles typically consist of moving blocks or repelling your way higher. Issues arise in that everything has its own physics, and pieces that you may need to move a specific way can be difficult to place, and not for lack of trying. Later puzzles even rely on your ability to repel yourself off of moving objects. Now while this sort of thing is of no real concern in a title such as Portal, in Teslagrad, the danger is far more apparent, and being hit even once will kill you and reset the portion of level that you're in.\n\nIn the majority of cases, this isn't a serious problem, as there are often checkpoints near more difficult segments, and even the most frustrating puzzles shouldn't occupy your time for more than twenty minutes. The real trouble occurs during any of the number of boss battles in the game, all of which suffer the dreaded three hits to kill motif. Should any of these bosses' attacks hit you, it's back to the very beginning of each fight, leading to frustrating exercises of trial and error. The bosses can take up an unhealthy portion of your time in Teslagrad, and this is especially true one of the last bunch, who fails to exhibit a truly discernible pattern, due to the game giving physics to every moveable object.\n\nEven with the frustrating boss encounters, and sometimes irritating puzzle design, the sheer beauty of the scenery often manages to quell the rising feelings of annoyance. As you progress, you will be treated to story elements in the form of short puppet plays, all of which lack dialogue, but are arguably stronger without, anyway. The mystery of your predicament is the greatest driving force in Teslagrad, as without it, I imagine many would quit at one of several specific points I can recall.\n\nLastly, as I feel it should be mentioned, the metroidvania aspect, and how much it pertains to the gameplay as a whole. You can go back and explore any room you've been previously, and there are indeed hidden pathways and secrets. These secrets come in the form of collectible cards, of which you will need to find 15 to even complete the game. And when I say "complete", I mean reach the credits, because to find the true ending, you must collect all 36 missing cards hidden all throughout the map. This sounds fun, and in most Vania style games, it is. But in Teslagrad, many poorly designed puzzles are not meant to be run backwards, and this can make exploration difficult.\n\nEven as I complain of the gameplay elements, I still look fondly on Teslagrad for its story, visuals and unique attempt at magnetic manipulation, as flawed as some of it may be. And while I've beaten the game and seen the vanilla ending, I'm sure I will spend an equal amount of time gathering the remaining cards to see what secrets might be waiting for me at the end. I wholeheartedly recommend Teslagrad, flaws and all, for its incredible visual design and world that is far too grandiose and exciting to be brought down by the occasional, but potent, frustration.","June 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","2"

The game's story is entirely show, don't tell, which is pretty uncommon and it allows for some player intepration whilst still being straightforward enough to follow. Exploration, finding play rooms and scrolls expands upon the story, which ties the story into the gameplay nicely and makes doing such exploration rewarding. Striking visuals and the shockingly good soundtrack really set the mood, harmoniously matching the tone of the story.\n\nI highly recommend the use of a controller as the keyboard controls are not superb, thankfully everything is rebindable, but even then a controller is much easier to use. As for the gameplay itself, the bulk of it is puzzles, some hard and some easy, most of which focusing on the use of magnetism to progress. The layout of the map is reminiscent of metroid games, and thanks to how they split the areas up, it is easy to backtrack and find missing scrolls. The hardest part of the game for most is probably the 5 bosses, the final boss is considerably challenging, however all the bosses have patterns and it shouldn't be so hard once you figure them out. The bosses do feel dissonant from the rest of the game, some meld well like the 2nd boss, which is the most puzzle like in my opinion, whilst other bosses are more luck/skill based like the 1st and 3rd bosses.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, more for those who want 100% completion. I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're a fan of puzzle-platformers, just be warned that the bosses are harder than expected.","January 15","true","7.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Well that's Teslagrad, a 2D puzzle platformer where you use magnetism and other electromagnetic powers to explore the Tesla tower.\n\nGo buy this game, if you for some reason you're on the fence at spending $10 on this awesome game keep on reading.\n\nPuzzle platformers usually require 1-2 unique elements to help separate itself from its competitors, now while Teslagrad has these unique elements; it's the cohesion between all these elements which pulls the game ahead. You have to use all your abilities in order to solve the puzzles, which increase in difficulty and scale as the game progresses. It's in a Castlevania style and you can backtrack whenever you want, which you need to do if you want to get 100%. Backtracking is not a daunting task as you may think as the levels are constructed in a way so that the 2nd time through with your new abilities you can explore new areas and have an easier time getting through some of the puzzles.\n\nThe storytelling is also a strong point, with no spoken dialogue and no text the storytelling is done visually. While these are usually hit or miss in Teslagrad case it’s a hit and lets you have a unique experience.\n\nThe art style is something you have to truly see in action to fully enjoy, it's a mix of steampunk and realism, with many of the buildings giving this mid 1800s feel. Animation quality for the most part is high and they seem to match the time in which the game is set.  It boasts amazing lighting effects which are seen as you use your electromagnetic powers, or fighting a massive furnace trying to burn you to cinders.\n\nNow while there's no deep options menu the lighting effects can be toned down which is where most of your performance issues will arise, it's also not capped at 60FPS (THANK YOU!!!) and runs fairly well even on my toilet of a machine. Keys are fully rebindable and it supports a gamepad.\n\nThen we get to the soundtrack, which is kind of amazing. These simple compositions choreograph amazingly with the backdrops; they're disturbingly beautiful as they give you this eery feeling while still being a treat for the ears. The sound assets are just as strong and certain sounds such as rain, which may be in the room next to you can be heard and increase in volume and intensity as you approach it, small things like that add to the atmosphere of Teslagrad.\n\nHighly recommended for all puzzle platforming fans and it should still peak your interest even if you're new to the genre.","December 18, 2013","true","3.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I eventually got to a room that was so infuriating that I decided I could no longer be arsed with it.\n\nWorse, the game has boss battles where, if you get hit one time, you have to restart the entire boss battle from the beginning. This means there is no way you can defeat a boss on your first attempt (maybe the first one if you're lucky, but good luck with the others). You have to repeatedly die until you trial-and-error learn all of the boss's moves and patterns and then---on the 27th try or whatever----execute a flawless battle.\n\nWorse, there are also non-boss segments where you have to navigate through a room, and the only way to "solve" the room is to repeatedly die until you trial-and-error memorize a path through the traps.\n\nA beautiful game to look at, but god d*mn frustrating.

The whole thing is beautiful, proudly displaying handdrawn visuals and fluid animations. The world you explore is mysterious and begs to be explored and its puzzles solved. The story is told completely through visuals with no dialogue whatsoever which was what got me interested in what Teslagrad was in the first place. The music is suitably ambient and fits the mood well.\n\nThe puzzles involve the concept of polarity and opposite attractions. They're fun and satisfying to complete, but...most of them are pretty complex and if you fail anywhere along the way, it's back to the beginning. There's no penalty for dying, but the pain of having to go through the same thing over and over again just to get to the one part that you screwed up on is enough. Boss battles have a similar curse and caused me a lot of frustration.

As you explore the Tesla Tower, you unlock new abilities and get hints, what might have happened here in the past.\n\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws. Every hit is an insta-kill; that itself is not the biggest problem, the checkpoints are. It can get frustrating pretty fast, having to redo a puzzle or especially a boss fight from the very beginning just due to some small mistake.\nI couldn't find any way to scroll the map, so whenever I opened the map screen, I saw a small area of the map around me and that was it. For a Metroidvania, this is a no-go, as you have to rely on your map ingame, to see, where you are and where you want to go.\nAlso mapping your controller buttons feels unintuitive when they're called JoyA8+ or JoyB2, yet this is a minor flaw. Native controller support came in with a patch and works quite well!\n\nThese flaws might be present, but overall the sensation of exploring the tower, finding new abilities and scrolls without the interruption of annoying "Press A to jump" tutorials prevails.

Simple yet engaging, the exploration is deeply satisfying if you love platforming and puzzles. You can even increase the replay value by collecting all the tarot cards hidden in hard-to-reach places.\n\nStill, there is one major issue. The game is hard. Not "I wanna be the guy" hard, not even "Super Meat Boy" hard. It is simply "old school" hard. Every room will come with a few deaths, every boss will have to be carefully studied, every pattern analyzed. That would be the good kind of hard.\n\nThe bad kind of hard is the philosophy of the one-hit kill. I am not a huge fan of "variable health" in platform games but a two or three strikes approach gives a little room for error while maintaining tension (Spelunky for instance). Here, one slight mistake or one tiny timing imprecision and it's back to the start. For a room, it's okay. For boss fights, it becomes borderline rince-and-repeat tedious if you're not patient/dedicated/born with lightning reflexes. You can also regret the small use of checkpoints (especially during the first final boss which is known to make grown men cry). But there is a reason why the lack of margin of error is detrimental to this game.\n\nWhich brings us to the worse kind of hard, namely letting a physics engine handle key elements instead of using scripted behaviour. Do not misunderstand me, the engine is solid but it introduces randomness (even in some boss fights) leading to your doom not by lack of skill but by lack of control, precision or just luck. Of course, this is a core part of the game, but this plus the one-hit kill principle sometimes seems ridiculous.\n\nTo give you an example (spoiling the method for the first boss), one boss fight consists of charging blocks that the enemy will swallow. After a certain amount, it will try to burn you, killing you if you are not on the edge of the platorm, but not too far as not to be thrown in a furnace on one side, electrocuted on the other. At this point, you could have a perfectly good boss fight. Unfortunately the blocks fall randomly and are handled in a "realistic" fashion sometimes piling up and blocking your way getting you killed.\n\nHowever, this should not prevent you from buying this game, far from it. The experience is amazing and the art (design and animation) memorable. If you like platforming, add this to your library this instant. Just be prepared for a lot of frustration now and then, but it is worth it.","September 15, 2014","true","10.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The use of magnets and electricity as a gameplay device is fun and reminds me of a 2D version of Magrunner, also from last year.\n\nUnlike similar games such as Vessel and The Swapper, Teslagrad is more action and reflex oriented. There are enemies and traps to avoid on practically every screen. The checkpoint system is generous in most places if you die, but the one thing where the reflex oriented gameplay falls short is the bosses. There are five throughout the entire game, with the 2nd and 4th being particularly difficult thanks to the fact that you only have one hit.Teslagrad is not afraid to offer a challenge. It is the Dark Souls of puzzle platformers. You will die. A LOT. You'll also feel a real sense of accomplishment upon completion, eve if you don't get all of the scrolls for the best ending.\n\nThe environments are rich and beautiful. Cathedral-like aesthetics rub shoulders with steampunk and Eastern European influences to create a game world that is striking in its look. The game is 2D, but makes occasional use of 3D and advanced lighting effects to add depth. There were times when I felt the sprites could have used a bit more frames of animation, but overall its a very impressive looking game.\n\nWhere the game falls a bit flat is in the storytelling. The developers made the decision to tell the story without dialogue, so despite all of the characters having names, you won't really know what's going on unless you look up material outside the game.

There's a problem with some incredibly hard to think puzzles that I had to resort to video walkthrough to find the solution, and of course the bosses' mechanics are quite challenging - you need to build the bosses' attack patterns in your memory and adapt to it.

The artist(s?) is working in harmony with the overall vision of the game it seems. It's subtle, not too detailed to maintain the cartoony style of it and the animations are AMAZING.

The mechanics are simple in design, which allows for SO many opportunities when it comes to level design. And this is where the level designers have done an excellent job. It's a lot of fun doing the puzzles that are presented because the levels are structured in such a nice way. The mechanics are playing with each other. Often you'll see these tiny magnetically charged creatures wander around, and just by seeing the direction at which they are headed, one can figure out the puzzle even before they have gotten to their destination.\n\nA lot of content as well.

I can only reccomend that people get and play this game. I whole-heartedly enjoyed everything about the game. The artwork is excellent and creates a very nice aesthetic style. The attention to detail in the art makes it a joy to take in. The music complements the game very well, often having a somber melancholic tone. The game also does an excellent job of telling it's story through the environment and is surprisingly emotional for having no voice acting. The game controls tightly, and magnetic puzzles are a nice change from the moving around boxes puzzles you see in too many games. The progression of puzzles is excellent and the game does a great job of teaching you. The combat works surprisingly well and the bosses, while hard, feel like a natural extension of the game using all the puzzle mechanics you've gotten used to. Teslagrad is oozing with polish and it's a real shame it hasn't gotten more publicity. I'd rank it up there with Fez and Super Meatboy as one of best modern indie platformers.","October 14, 2014","true","17.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You end up getting three distinct abilities in the game, but two of those take up two buttons each (positive and negative magnetism), which ended up proving a challenge in some areas.\nPart of that challenge comes from the fact that you have one life, no health bar. There are boss fights in the game, and though the first three passed by fast and easily, the last two felt rather punishing because it wasn't always clear to me how to deal with certain attack patterns and upon failing to understand them, I'd immediately have to start from the beginning.\n\nBut again, these are minor frustrations. For how frustrating having to restart a boss fight because of one single mistake could feel, they still were very fun. Especially the fourth fight was one of the most satisfying and well designed bosses I've come across in a while and kept throwing surprises at you.\nThere is some backtracking involved if you want to go for a 100% completion (and I would recommend you do, it's definitely worth it!), as is the norm for metroidvanias. But by the time you reach that point, you'll be able to do so very fast. Furthermore, the collectible items are hidden in a fair way - there are no walls you can unexpectedly pass through; instead clear but subtle visual cues tell you where to look or attempt to go.\n\nFinally, I feel I should adress that I've called the game an action platformer rather than a puzzle platformer. The reason for that is that though occasionally you'll need to turn on your brain when trying to figure out how to get to places or defeat a boss, the puzzles never felt like the focus to me (unlike in games such as Braid, Fez or The Swapper) - even having figured out the solution, you still need to have the dexterity to pull it off too.\n\nBut yeah, if metroidvanias are your kinda thing, get Teslagrad. It's atmospheric and gorgeous; and though it's a bit hard at times, it's also very satisfying and fun. To some, it might feel too short, to me its length (~7 hours) felt perfect. I'll take a short game that constantly feels fresh and exciting over a game that outstays its welcome any day.","November 30, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So this mostly consists of objects getting magnetically attracted to or repelled from each other.  The game has many varied puzzles and endbosses with the magnetism mechanic. Many times in Teslagrad I encountered an endboss or obstacle and I was like; 'This has to be impossible! I probably have to travel back to get better unlockables.'But, in those moments, I would finally see how you have to do it. This makes you feel smart and satisfied. And made me say; 'Wow, this is really well thought out!' I should also say that there are parts where the gameplay blends in well with the music and the story. To be fair, I didn't really care about the story. So the little animations in the background were just nice looking images, for me. The only parts of gameplay I didn't really like were at the beginning, where you were unable change the magnetism. Those parts felt forced. The game has a nice handdrawn style which reminds me of the game Braid. In my opinion, the game is good until the end. The only thing that annoyed me is that you have to find 15 collectables for the final endboss. So I used a community guide map to find the last ones to reach 15. Shame on me. Overall, the game really well polished. The only bug I encountered was at the final boss of the game. Even if you would encounter bugs it is not a problem because like in metroid/megaman the game reloads the room.\n\nIn short:\nA well thought out platformer, with the main mechanics centred around magnetism.","December 5, 2014","true","6.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

On your way you get haunted by some sort of soldiers until you get into some sort of castle or something where you soon find a mysterious golden glove that allows you to change the polarity of certain metal boxes etc. which you encounter on your way, so they react magnetically to each other. This allows you to solve various puzzles to continue on your way. Shortly after you get to a tower containing a blue something which looks like an excursion funnel of Portal 2 but only moves you while you're of the same polarity as that thing. One way of achieving that (and at the moment the only one) is by touching a special flower on the ground of the tower. Then you're moved upwards by that funnel thing, allowing you to get to one of the entrances which are located at both sides (in terms of 2D graphics) of the tower's wall. Now you begin solving various puzzles to get higher in the tower and eventually reach it's top, while encountering various bosses and finding various other "helper items" (like the glove) on your way. And when you get higher, you also come across some theatres telling you about the history of the land.\n\nGameplay\nAs mentioned above you have to solve various puzzles, mainly using magnetics but also buttons, funnels like the one from the tower and small robots which can reach smaller places, press buttons and have other side-effects - all in all it's a bit like Portal without Portals and the 3D. The puzzles are all well-balanced in terms of difficulty - you have to think a bit about them, but you don't end up being frustrated and looking in the internet for the solution. The bosses are a bit harder, but basically it's just about figuring out how they work, and then you just have to try a few times until you get good enough to beat them, making them challenging whithout being frustrating.\n\nThe basic controls are A and D for moving left and right as well as Space for jumping. The various actions of the "helper items" are triggered by the arrow keys and can be directed to the character's top or bottom using W or S. You can also view a map (showing only rooms which have already been visited) by hitting Tab. All in all the controls are comfortable to use, and if you're dissatisfied with them you can also change them. The only thing that annoyed me is that the game did not really introduce the map as a feature, I just discovered it accidentally when I found a secret and the game displayed a little information together with "Tab" as the key to view the secret (they can be viewed by hitting the right arrow key while in map view).\n\nGraphics\nAs others wrote before, the game has quite beautiful, handdrawn graphics with fluid animations. And really, there isn't much more to say about this.\n\nSound\nThe sound effects resemble the mechanics of the game well, but there is nothing special however. The music however is very beautiful and has a sad touch. During the boss fights I find the music to get a bit mechanical, and in other games this would probably be a deficiency for me, but in this game it actually works, mostly since most of the bosses are mechanical as well.\n\nStability / Technichal Realization\nI found Teslagrad to work very, very well, at least here on Linux. Everything runs smooth and without flaws. I didn't discover anything to blame the game for in this category.\n\nConclusion\nTeslagrad is one of the games which tell their story without words, and especially the intro does that very well, since this part in which you mostly run away and experience the story flows directly into the part in which you actually play the game. However the story is not the main focus of the game (which are the puzzles), and therefore it (the story) is not quite a big masterpiece. However the other parts - the well-balanced puzzles and the nice graphics and music - are all very good and together actually make a game which is a lot fun to play, challenging but not frustrating. Also I find the game to be very well-priced at ~10€, so all in all I’d definitely recommend it to all fans of puzzle games.\n\nEvaluation\nCategory        Relevancy        Rating                Story        20%        75%                Gameplay        20%        98%                Graphics        20%        100%                Sound        20%        100%                Stability / Technichal Realization        10%        100%                Cost/Benefit        10%        100%                Total                95%","February 13, 2015","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

The cards are not collected in the order of the story however, and so we learn bits and pieces from different parts before we can connect the dots. Although slightly confusing, it didn't really affect much in the game (I just love stories).\n\nThe mechanics are utterly simple, so after a bit they fade into the background. Your fingers just know what to do after a point. I was extremely pleased with the challenge the game provided in terms of gameplay. It constantly forced me to improve my skills, learn by trial (and death), jump just a split second later, drop a few pixels lower, time it -just- right. Not once did I mind having to start over after I died, because I really enjoyed it, and my death had usually taught me something helpful. It felt like old-school games, where you had to actually try hard to get past some spots, and there was just no way around it, or any consolation prizes. If you wanted to do it, you had to get better at it. There were not many enemies to fight, but the puzzles to be solved were interesting enough to keep me occupied, and the boss fights were entertaining and rewarding as well.\n\nThe game played quite lightly. One day I had to keep pausing, or alt-tabbing to attend to other things, and it remained responsive, smooth and didn't burden my laptop at all. It felt both casual and also deeply immersive at the same time.\n\nI would love to play a sequel.","September 30, 2014","true","16.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I won't say much to the details of the story because it is best experienced in the format presented in the game.  It is well developed without being spoonfed to the player.  The main game mechanic is that there are blocks charged with red or blue energy and you're able to change this charge on some to move them or pick up a charge to move yourself.  Like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract.  The art style is highly developed with almost a steampunkish vibe.  There are large mechanical boss monsters at a few points in the game, and they require clever use of the game's mechanics to defeat.  There is a lot of exploration but I would like to have seen more metroid-style backtracking when new gamplay features get unlocked.  There is some, but there are also whole large sections that never need to be revisited unless to grab missed collectibles.  A few of the puzzles are extremely devious, but the challenge in solving the harder sections comes from having to perform extremely precise actions rather than just being completely stumped.  Some of these sections get rather frustrating, but overall, it's apparent that this is meant to be a difficult game.

While the physics suffer the same problem a lot of unix-based games have (especially on the magnetism and magnetized objects that fly at random sometimes), the game is quite solid in its premise and execution. The backstory is "told" through background animations, imagery and collectable items scattered through the map, while the story itself is shown rather than told, as there is little to no text in this game. All in all it is a very good story, reminiscent to what Journey presented. The puzzles make good use of the magnetic instruments one gathers metroidvania style, and while there are some whose success relies more on trial and repetition (mostly due to the above mentioned physics),  all in all they are a good challenge, if very frustrating at times, especially the boss battles, some of which could have benefited from a mid battle checkpoint (but that might be laziness speaking).","May 18, 2014","true","12.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I almost didn't have the patience to get to the end of Teslagrad. And that would have been a terrible shame, because it's a beautiful and creative game from start to finish. It just does one thing wrong that nearly killed the whole experience for me.\n\nTeslagrad is unsurprisingly set in the city of Teslagrad, a sprawling, steampunky place with one hell of a tower in the middle of it. You play a small boy of auspicious ancestry who flees capture one night into the tower. This is where most of the game will take place, with you working to unlock the upper floors as you find new abilities to advance. The theme of the game is magnetism, so your powers will allow you to attract and repel objects to great effect. It's a neat, tricky gimmick with some clever puzzles, but it's a very directed experience with few branching paths and no sequence breaking.\n\nIt's not a long game, either, clocking in at around three to four hours from start to finish. There are secrets to find, however, in the form of 36 scrolls (also the game's only achievements). You'll have to do some searching and some challenging puzzling to find them, and you need 15 to get to the endgame anyway. There's an alternate ending if you find them all, so there's a few more hours of magnetic wizardry if you want. The actual platforming handles well, but there's a bit of that floatiness that tends to plague indie platformers. It's nothing damning, and it does allow for some fun physics shenanigans in a few of the puzzles.\n\nYou'll also face off against a few bosses, and this is where the game nearly lost me. Like the rest of the game, the bosses are clever and beautiful and challenging, but one thing makes them absolutely infuriating. You see, you have no health in Teslagrad. One hit kills you, usually starting you back at the beginning of the room. Coupled with bosses that have challenging patterns that must be memorized, this is a recipe for intense frustration. You might have to repeat a pattern three or four times as it speeds up and gains new hazards, and one wrong move will see you starting from scratch. Some of the puzzles are equally lethal, the standout being an anti-gravity ascent through a field of electricity that took me dozens of tries.\n\nThere is a very real possibility that Teslagrad will make you rage, and it's such a tragedy because the game is otherwise brilliant. The art style is gorgeous and animated in incredible detail, the story is excellent (told through charming puppet interludes), and the setting is a real stand-out amidst a sea of steampunk dreck. I have to recommend Teslagrad for its many strengths, but there's no shame in checking out of this one when it gets too tough.","February 10","true","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Your town, Electropia is overun by The Corrupt Kings men, and it's up to you to bring The King down, who hides in the Storm Palace.\n\nThis game is done simple, but effective. Your progress is impeded until you explore for power ups such as the glove, that changes Positive and Negative which helps you manipulate magnets to lift doors, the Boots that shoots you forward like a bolt of lightning which helps you cross long gaps, etc.\n\nLess is More is a theme with this game. You start by running from home to a palace where you are chased to, and it explains the story with theatre (That you can choose to watch. It's optional). Other than that, you are solving puzzles and you quickly learn how to make progress. To go UP. During this time, you find scrolls that vaguely tells you the story, and seems like a collectable until you reach the final part of the game, where you need a minimum of 15. I don't know about anyone else, but I had 20 scrolls when I got to this part of the game, and it elongated the game for me knowing that I may need to get all the scrolls. If you rush through the entire game, you'll surely miss scrolls. It's a game that you can play at YOUR pace.\n\nThe scenery, the music, the subtle story telling, the Less is More emphasis, everything was made very well, but because of this, the only reason you have to play this game for more than 20 minutes is the art since it slowly teaches you everything you need to do over time and it's understandable if you get bored of this concept over time. This game didn't have an instruction manual that'll tell you the story and what abilities will be available to you over the game like Super Metroid. You're going in blind, hoping for an enjoyable experience. From first hand experience, I did find this enjoyment. It's a short 4-5 hour game depending on if you look for a 100% completion with lots of replayability, and because of this, I give it an 8/10.\n\n\n","June 18, 2014","true","23.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Generally I've tried to avoid the Steam review system, as despite the best efforts of a great many reviewers the big blue and red hands at the top of each label each review as calling the game GOOD or BAD. There is little room for subtlety in such a system, and while many reviews list both good and bad qualities of a game and insist that certain tastes and demographics should definitely avoid / immediately buy the game, the specter of the big, colored hand trumps the text of a review.\n\nBut Teslagrad, though.\n\nThis is a game which I have absolutely no trouble in plastering a big, blue hand on. Were this just a series of puzzle rooms with no connecting narrative, I still would have had a blast playing it. Maybe it wouldn't have possessed me to sing its praises in a review, but I would have finished it. As it stands, Teslagrad is one of the great meldings of narrative and gameplay to exist in the modern age of gaming. Teslagrad's is a story (nearly) without words, a story told through the environment and the somewhat optional collectibles. The few and far between mechanical puppet shows which play out are the closest the game comes to an exposition dump, and they are short enough to not impede enjoyment and completely skippable besides. The story is not that complex, but it is different enough from the usual fantasy offerings that it was a reasonable part of my motivation to finish.\n\nVisually, Teslagrad is pretty damn tops. The character designs are simple, cartoonish and pleasing, while the environments and bosses have what I feel to be the perfect degree of detail and fidelity to fit in with the tone of the game. Had this come out in a time before every other indie game of note was a stylistically striking platformer I might gush more about the graphics, but our cup runneth high enough that I wasn't as impressed as I might have been.\n\nThe mechanics and feel of Teslagrad compliment the game perfectly. While gameplay concerning blue and red magnetic polarities is no longer a particularly novel concept, the execution of the puzzles and the way that they tie in to the story and world make up for this game coming too late for the idea to be novel. The puzzles never become too hard, and while it's possible that you will be tripped up at several points it will most likely be due to platforming difficulty rather than the inability to wrap your mind around a puzzle.\n\nWhile there are faults in Teslagrad, none are so glaring as to ruin or even mar the experience. The game is slightly short, though this could be said to be to its advantage, as it never overstays its welcome or stretches itself too thin. One or too puzzles almost necessitated deaths to learn how they worked, and while trial and error is not an inherently bad method of teaching the player there was at least one occasion where I felt cheated into a death that the game could have been designed for me to avoid. Finally, without spoiling anything, the final boss could have been handled better. Their attack pattern and design didn't quite meld with prior revelations about the character and the end result is just a boss that feels designed as a generically powerful figure than the unique character he was subtly built up to be.\n\nIf forced to attach a number to the game, I would give it an 8/10. For context it is one of my new favorite games, but the parts that fail to shine as brightly hold it back from a higher score. Having said that, absolutely play this. If you enjoy puzzles and and platformers, or even just wish that more games had narratives that were married tightly to the gameplay, this is for you.","January 7","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Other than the post-game clean up, I don't recall ever seeing the same exact puzzle or room layout twice.\n\nArt:  This game is beautiful. Although it's a somewhat cartoonish art style, it really worked for this title, especially when things took a turn for the dark.\n\nStory:  Teslagrad manages to tell a really great (and sad) story without ever saying a word. Seriously. It's all done through the gameplay, creepy cardboard puppet shows, and music. It's refresing, attention grabbing, and just pretty freakin cool.\n\nDifficulty:  Not too hard, not too easy. The boss fights are by far the hardest parts of the game, but they feel really great when you finally figure out the patterns and emerge victorious\n\nLength:  A common problem with indie titles is that the game either drags on too long or ends to abrubtly. Teslagrad does neither, and could probably be finished in under 4 sessions. The game can take longer if you choose to collect everything (which I recomend, the "scroll" puzzles are awesome), but it still feels pretty good.\n\nGood and Bad:\nControls:  The controls are really good for about 90% of the game. Going through rooms, solving puzzles, flying through the air, and all sorts of other things are great and feel good. The problem comes when you get to boss rooms.\n\nBosses:  The boss fights are all pretty original, which was a nice surpise. The controls (mentioned above) can make them quite frustrating at times. It's hard to really explain, but the bosses can be a bit hectic and hectic + the control desgin don't merge super well.\n\nAutosave Points:  Your best friend and your worst nightmare. I had a primarily good experience with the autosaves, but there were a few times  like at the top of that damn tower  where they makes your journey much harder.\n\nCons:\nSpoilers\n\nFinal Item:  In metroidvainias the last item you get basically grants you full access to the map or an overpowered weapon of some kind. Although it does become the method of attack for the rest of the game, it originally gave me an "oh, that's it?" feeling.\n\nEnding:  I got the special ending, which you unlock for getting all the collectables. All I know is that I ran back to my home and saw my mother and then it went straight to the main menu. I didn't really know what to expect, but I don't think that was it. Unfortuntely, that's probably my biggest qualm with this game.\n\n\nIn final summary, I do indeed recomend the game.\n\n\n\nThe king is a ♥♥♥♥.","November 19, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On par with Braid, but more refined\n+Silent story.  Told entirely and wonderfully through visuals.\n+A soundtrack that accompanies the story well, particularly the melancholy main theme.\n+Interesting and unique mechanics.  Platforming utilizing magnetism.\n+Difficult boss fights.\n+Difficult platforming segments.\n\n-/+Difficulty is rather poorly implemented.  A "Trial by Fire," in which the player might find his/herself becoming frustrated over a particular boss fight or platforming segment in which they are forced to die in order to learn how to overcome the challenge.  When done correctly, such as in Dark/Demon Souls or Limbo, this does not feel like a chore, but in this case, it does.\n-/+Few checkpoints.  Furthering the previous con is the lack of checkpoints in these difficult segments.  The player may be able to get past 90% of the challenge of a boss fight or platforming section but continually die at the final 10%, respawning them at the very beginning, and thus forcing them to go through the first 90% before getting to the part holding them up.

The controls are simple, but robust. You never blame the game for dying. The art is magnificent and full of little gems. The puzzles never out stay their welcome, and the game itself feels long enough for the price.\n\nSome points of critique, I had a hard time loving the bosses... Although I got a feeling of satisfaction when i finally beat them, they ended up feeling too repetetive in the long run. Especially since some of their cues were a bit hard to read at times and the different phases of each boss came pretty abruptly, which made it hard to adapt and evade on the first try.\n\nThe story is sparse, but cute. If you dont pay attention to it, it seems non existant. However what is there, is very well made, very clear and very enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, Telsagrad is an incredibly good first title from Rain Games. If you love games like super meat boy, portal, and long for a return to the olden days of platforming, this is definitely a title worth picking up. It only costs like 8$ anyway.","January 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You're doing the same thing over and over, yelling at the screen, trying to figure out this puzzle that people have probably solved in a matter of seconds. Well, Teslagrad does things right to make this sweet little puzzle game flow just right.\n\nLets talk about the puzzles. Are the puzzles hard? I haven't even finished the game yet, and I can tell you, yes, the puzzles are hard. Sometimes it's logic puzzles, what goes where, what do you do, how do you use these new mechanics you just discovered. Sometimes it's reaction puzzles, a race against time, split second movements and challenges, punishing you if you hesitate or even think too long. Sometimes, oh sometimes, it's both. And these puzzles always feel new and fresh, while being introduced at the correct time, slowly introduced to you, developing your skills so, when faced with a puzzle, you know you CAN do it if you just figure out how. This slow build up actually rather fits with the story.\n\nThe story. Not many puzzle games really put much thought into their stories. It's just something to drive the action along, it's silly or laclustre. Usually, games don't actually try to portray a story using only visual clues while keeping the entire game silent (in terms of voice acting at least). In Teslagrad, you won't struggle through massive cutscenes of exposition where one person talks at you about the world just to try and flesh out the game. Yes there are, as I like to think of them, "background shows" in certain places, where you see the history as a silent puppetshow, but if you want to you CAN ignore them and they never feel intrusive.\n\nOn a more personal plot, the character develops with you. A silent protagonist is wonderful to project onto, and that is what you can do best with the main character. He learns as you learn, he make mistakes as you make mistakes. Without a single line of dialogue you can't help but sense a kind of developing strength in him with every overcome challenge. The character themself doesn't get more powerful, you don't have offensive attacks, but you as a player get smarter, so the character on screen feels stronger. It's rather wonderful.\n\nI will be fair. There are a few bad parts of the game, there always will be. Sometimes the bosses suffer from a lack of explanation, and yes, there are bosses in this puzzle game. They are most likely some of the worst moments of the game, but that doesn't make them as attrocious as that sounds. They just don't have the fluidity and strengths that the rest of the game has. Even then, their difficulty makes you feel truly stronger once they are defeated. I never found the bosses a deal breaker however, I was just glad to see the back of them.\n\nI have read, in other reviews, that the collectibles I have been snatching up as I play, are actually somewhat necessary to finishing the game. Some see this as a bad thing, I'm a little hesitant to support this idea in the game, but I would also ask this. Why weren't you going for them in the first place? I saw a collectible and went for it for the challenge, to see what this little secret was. If you don't go for at least the occasional collectible... you're not really testing yourself. That is just what I wished to say.\n\nIn conclussion... buy this game if you want something fun, cheap, and honestly puzzling without being being so punishing as to seem impossible. This game will become hard, there is no denying that, but you will learn, you will develop. Have fun.","January 18, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/249590/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Steamified Revisits is a new concept on Steamified.com where we will be running a feature for games published onto Steam in 2014 and prior that never made it onto the Steamified Countdown. The games that we feature within this program are those that are much beloved titles or are highly wishlisted or just never received the type of recognition by the gaming press or Steam players. If you have a game that is from 2014 or earlier that you would like to see featured on Steamified either post in the disqus comments section below or submit your suggestions on our Steam group forums. I cannot make any guarantees but I will promise to get into contact with the developers and to show them your interest in having their game(s) featured and if they agree then we will feature them for you.\n\nThe very first game in our Steamified Revisits series is Rain Games Teslagrad. It was released back in December of 2013 and has remained one of the most criminally underplayed games in the entirety of the Steam catalog. This is such a shame because the title fared reasonably well with the critics scoring 77/100 on Metacritic and 78/100 on Game Rankings. The highest number of people that have ever played the game simultaneously on Steam is 169. It’s a much better game than that and as a result is one of the driving forces behind the new Steamified Revisits feature of the website.\n\nSo what is Teslagrad? It’s a puzzle-platformer that also fits within the metroidvania genre. It tells the story of a young boy whose exploratory behavior gets him mixed up with a long-forgotten conspiracy involving the king of the land who rules with an iron fist. The knowledge that the boy possesses could change the course of history for his land. Of course, you will not know this at the beginning of the game. Rather what you are told is that men dressed in red and looking mighty official are after him and that the boy is attempting to escape on what appears to be a cold stormy night that no boy should be outside in. Throughout the course of the game the developers do a superb job in telling the story in a minimalistic manner as there are never any words provided of the written or of the spoken kind and you are given just enough that you’ll want to play on and discover more of the story until it plays itself through to its compelling completion.\n\nAs there are no words in the game greater importance is placed upon the art direction. Thankfully the visual presentation of the game is absolutely superb. The hand-drawn environments are among the best that I have seen. The lighting effects have been perfectly designed and serve only to contribute beneficially to the game without ever detracting from the experience – a critical balance that is so very difficult to get right. The audio too is among the game’s great strengths which may be difficult for some to consider given there is no voiceover work. The visual presentation is based upon a steampunk world.\n\nAnother critical component of any puzzle-platformer is the level design. Rain Games have you covered here.  The game has been designed almost flawlessly with the opening levels of the game serving as a tremendous tutorial to the game without being overtly difficult or easy. The puzzles fit nicely within the spectrum of the game and are well designed and possess a high level of execution.\n\nTwo of the criticisms that I’m willing to lay upon the game is that I wish that the devs had spent a little more time in determining the layout for the controller. Some of the important options lack a button. Yes, you’re able to customize the options but unless you’re someone who checks every option before getting started you will not notice this until you’re left wondering what on earth you need to do. The other critique that I have of the game is that the controls should have been made to be a little tighter. Occasionally you’ll have to redo a small section of the game because you’ve died through no real fault of your own.\n\nHowever, in all, Teslagrad truly is a game that should have been experienced by far more people than have played it. It’s one that is bound to provide several hours of entertainment.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group\n","March 26","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In Teslagrad you start off playing as the village idiot, at first it seems interesting but the controls like all platformers are garbage.  Ignore the awards games like this get and awards in general they are usually meaningless.  The menu is a mess as well its difficult to even tell what is selected its so poorly designed.  The boss fights are laughable at best, if they can be called that.  Example is the bird fight, a robot not a human could play this part, it takes zero skill.  Run up to the bird wait for animation attack, rinse repeat done, a robot could do that.  Like all platformers this game was garbage controls, great idea making a game, then forgetting how to make controls work, just make the whole game based around platforming then implement terrible sluggish response and use of odd button assignments.  There 4 BIG buttons on the front of most controllers yet their ignored except the A button.  This game gets the award for just being another platformer fail.  It may look pretty but this is a game, noone is hanging this on their wall, if we could it would be spit on and burned.  People seem to like it because the fights are easy maybe, who knows, maybe because its pretty, either way the controls suck.\n\nThe dev is very active and helpful on the forums so +5 for that.\n\nRating:  5/10  Value:  $4.99","August 31, 2014","true","4.3"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It has a Metroidvania style that many games try to mimic, but fail at. In this case, it is perfectly crafted. It also features an elaborately crafted world and inferred story line that made me think of Another World / Out of this World. The puzzles and bosses are challenging. It requires a good deal of precision and practice to get through some sections. Though it was unforgiving at times, I felt that it was a rewarding experience overall.

Being a metroid-vania, it already hits a soft spot for me! You have a fairly big map with different areas to explore, gaining several abilities as you progress that let you reach previously undiscovered places.\n\nThe puzzles mainly revolve around magnetism, as you could guess from the game. It bares some similarities with the game "Magnetic By Nature", but, while that game has more ... imaginative puzzles, Teslagrad is more polished, and it stands out with its awesome artstyle and unorthodox story-telling.\n\nI haven't found most puzzles to be too difficult, nor the physics to be too unpredictable. Sure, there were a few times that the game was a bit frustrating for execution rather than solving a puzzle. But the difficulty was just right, for the most part.\n\nThe artstyle has got to be one of my favourites aspects. Reminds me quite a lot of older, hand-drawn cartoons, and it works surprisingly well with a few modern touches in the lighting effects.\n\nThe music was also really good! Unfortunately, it was a bit sparse, and the sound designed lacked in several occasions. Boss fights especially... while trying to carry a bit more impact by stopping the music right after the fights were over, the game felt a bit empty, while leaving the impact behind. Not something that is easy to explain... PID was great in this regard! Using the music's intensity to carry a given vibe.\n\nWhen I mentioned "unorthodox storytelling", I meant the way that the game presents its backstory. There are 36 scrolls hidden in the game, which are usually harder to spot or get to. Most of them, you can see, being alerted to it if you want to get it. Some were completely hidden, sometimes by abilities which you did not have, at the time...\nMore on that next, though!\nThese scrolls are just little cards (almost postcards) with very simple, but representative drawings of this country's history. It shows how things evolved from medieval times to the more developped world, and then crumbling world. I found it really cool, and it certainly gives players the chance of exploring the world by searching for scrolls... twofold.\n\nThe only problem, as I said, is the gated scrolls. As a result, you'll have to go back right after/before the final boss, and go through the whole game again (-- with all of your abilities and the map explored, though! Still, you'll have to solve many of the puzzles again, even knowing the solution). In more combat-oriented games, it's a great technique! It lets the player feel overpowered by going back to old, previously difficult places.\nIn a puzzle game, traversal is rather annoying.\n\nRegardless, most of them are well in your grasp, less than 10 (if that many) requiring backtracking.\n\n\nNot much more to say about it. The game is beautiful, and the puzzles are pretty well designed. Certainly worth a shot if you're into the animation, puzzle-platformers or  metoid-vanias in general!","November 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally am horrable at platformers. I haven't ever beaten Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie cause of how bad I am at platformers. While playing this I did encounter some ragey monments Mostly with one of the late bosses but thats good in my option.\n\nThe main Machanic of this game is how magnets work, You coolect items through out the game that can change the polarity of certain mobs or platforms. You can ether repel by making your self and the object the same color, or attract by turning yourself and the object into opposite colors. I personally have never seen a machanic used in a game and it worked amazingly well then what I was expecting. The developers did an amazing job to get the physics realistic and plausable.\n\nThe story is easy to follow even though there is no voice acting. You are a boy that is escaping from bad men and you make it to a tower and you have to make it to the top. But what makes the story telling interesting is through out the journy you encounr puppet theater that begin playing the backstory through paper puppets. It was a very interesting and  well designed way of telling the story with out words but with the music and art.\n\nGoing on to the music and art. Honestly the music and art have got to be my favorite part of the game, as I stated I am not good at platformers so I can get easly angry at a level. The music kept bringing me back honestly, each level had its own sound that matched the stage perfectly. For example there is a stage tht is simular to a boiler room there was a metal sound incoperated into the song to make it feel like it was being played in a room filled with pipes. Then a sage that had many plants in it I belive it was the level with a large tree had a more upbeat tune that reminded me of legend of zelda with the lost woods. It was very well orcistrated.\n\nThe art is simple yet had massive amount of detail. The charater and objects had a simpler design compared to the backgrounds but that made them pop out alot more then having both extremely detailed or had the charater detailed and the background plain. It was pleasent to the eyes as well. I have sensitive eyes so bright lights and very white bacgrounds make me sick or give me a headache and i encounted none of that while playing.\n\nI highly recomend you play this game. I belive its on steam and on psvita. I played the steam version and used a controler. I highly recomend you play with a controler as well. Hope this helps and hope you enjoy the game.","November 21, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you get stuck on a boss, don't stop trying. It's worth it to finish it all.\nThere are collectables around the world which give you achievements and a different ending if you collect them all. You also need a certain number to advance past a certain point in the game.\nSo while short and simple, it is a game filled with variation, challenge, and character.

Everything is a one hit kill and sometimes you have to redo things all over in some maps. It can get frustrating, but when you get to conquer that area it's worth it. That's the feeling you got when you played classic games.\nThe story is told through the many scrolls scattered in the maps (collectibles that sometimes seem impossible to get, but you can do it with a little patience), scribbles on the walls, childish plays and paintings. It's a game that focuses a lot more on gameplay than anything else.\nAll of the powers you get have to be used at some point and are necessary to fight bosses (that are really hard to beat) and get collectibles, so there is some backtracking to be done at times.\nI only recommend this game for people with patience, otherwise you'll probably give up on the first boss battle.","April 15, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It serves the story very well, but one wrong move in a tricky platforming section and you have to do a tedious, tedious section all the way from the bottom of the damned tree.\n\nThe bird. I'm stuck on the bird. I've been stuck on the bird for so long. The bird is cheap (how big does the explosion radius on the babies need to be???). The bird is glitchy (I'll occasionally fly off the screen vertically and die, or ricocet off the bird itself and land on the spikes). The bird has made me dislike this game as much as I love it.\nI know what I need to do to get past the bird. I cannot get the on screen action to match what I'm trying to input or even make sense. I've tried other controllers, I've tried other control setups, I've tried repeated practice... Not even practice helped. I don't get better. I know what I need to do. That doesn't help when _sometimes_ I hit a glitch instead of a bird and bounce off into oblivion. A game that's scaled with OpenGL shouldn't be pixel-perfect. It just becomes confusing.\n\nIt's so good... why is this boss here? Why does this area have to suck so much? Widen a few platforms in the tree area, and fix the friggin bird. Make the bird hit you when it should, and not when it isn't (it's very very inconsistent) and reduce the blast radius of the babies.\n","May 6, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Any fan of Nickola Tesla will love this game: the main characters hair is styled after Mr. Tesla, the game features many Tesla Coils, Serbian Culture References, and many more subtle details about Tesla that only his most advid fans could make out.

I remember first seeing Teslagrad on multiple websites such as RockPaperShotgun and Polygon back when the game first showed up but back then I didn't really payed much attention to it. Teslagrad takes you to a soviet-esc setting as you play as a little boy running towards a big tower and it's in that tower where the magic will happen. The graphic style is absolutely gorgeous and the animation qualtity hits just the right spot for me. The soundtrack is engaging and charming and has it's amazing moments at key points of the game. The plot is very mysterious but as you progress everything slowly starts making sense as, one of the really cool things about it is that there's no dialogue or text in the game so the story is told basicly by what you see and what the game shows you. Besides the standard jumping, Teslagrad puzzles are solved by changing the polarity of certain magnets, red or blue, later on you acquire a cloak which will let you manipulate gravity to some extent like using the opposite color to propel yourself into the air and eventually you'll also gain the ability to flash, or teleport, the way you're facing. All of these represent a very important role in the puzzle solving. When you're inside the tower you basicly need to solve various puzzles located on rooms on both sides of the tower in order to unlock the next level of the tower, until you eventually reach the top and in the end you end up facing your nemesis. It's also worth mentioning the game has 2 endings, one which is always achieved and the second one which people like to call "secret" or "real" ending and in order for you to get this ending you need to collect all 36 scrolls that are spread throughout the entire tower. The game is fairly easy to beat and to play through except when you get stuck at a certain section of a level or a certain puzzle which might drive you to frustration but in the end it is totally worth it, Teslagrad is a very good game and I'm pretty sure people didn't payed the attention it deserved.","January 24, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

'Teslagrad' feels so familiar, like a game I have played many times before. When I first saw the trailer for the game, I thought the mechanics looked gimmicky and there would be no way the game could feel fluid at all. I could not have been more wrong, and I'm so glad to have this as part of my library now.\n\nThe traditionally hand-drawn artwork and ambient music is combined wonderfully with silent storytelling, to create a very charming world. You play as a young boy that starts off escaping from an invasion and onto a journey inside a mysterious tower. There's a slightly haunting atmosphere that develops as you continue to explore and uncover the story of a twisted King and what had transpired in the past to lead up to this point.\n\nThe platforming is simply gratifying. You use electromagnetic powers to dash, float, and climb your way through the fascinating environments. However, although there is little backtracking in the main game, completionists should be aware that if you wish to collect all the scrolls scattered around, it's quite unfortunate that the map is so unhelpful.\n\nThe controls feel very polished and responsive, and even though some parts (mainly, the unforgiving boss fights) had me borderline frustrated at times, there were no cases where I felt like I didn't know what to do to succeed. The puzzles are interesting and challenging, constantly pushing players to test the limits of what's been learned. It never gets boring nor repetitive, and the boss fights really spice up the puzzles with a dash of combat.\n\nMan, I want some Blink Boots!","January 11, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Since this game features monsters that run around in the dark and kill you called "grues" I think we can safely assume this game has all the nerd cred it needs and we're looking at the latter use of Tesla's name.  Now don't take that as some snarling criticism of Teslagrad.  Despite having nothing else to do with Tesla, dropping his name in the title does set you up for abusing wondrous electricity and magnetism based powers amidst an oppressive Eastern European backdrop.  It certainly delivers on that count.\n\nI'm going to assume you've already watched the trailer and been wowed by how good looking this game is with its smooth, forceful, hand-drawn animations.  It's certainly a beautiful game, but don't let that vibrant animation fool you.  This is a grim game about grim Eastern European seeming people doing grim Eastern European things with lightning!  And as somebody with a grim Eastern European family, I knows from grim Eastern European things (not with lightning though, that's new).  Teslagrad tells a basic story, but it does it elegantly without a single word of spoken dialogue or cumbersome written exposition.  Once again, this game is a stone-faced immigrant staring you down, and made all the more unsettling by inhabiting a world that looks like it was drawn by Walt Disney.\n\nYou've seen the trailer, though (or you need to just go do that already), and are already sold on the aesthetic of this game.  So let's talk gameplay.  Teslagrad is a bit of a Metroid game and a bit of a puzzle game and a bit of a precision (i.e. frustration) platformer.  You'll notice I said Metroid and not metroidvania.  The Castlevania games have always been a bit more combat oriented and Teslagrad features almost no combat.  There's a tiny bit toward the end and you kill some bosses in round-about ways, but for the most part Teslagrad is all about exploration and evading hazards.  And, remember, this is a grim Eastern European game with ligthning so everything including the floors want you dead.  And don't think they will go light on you because you are playing an adorable child!  There is no food for adorable children, only being lightninged into ashes!\n\nWhen I said frustration platformer up there, I do mean that.  Teslagrad is absolutely unforgiving with the timing you require to navigate its many hazards, and not just for optional secrets.  Combine this with some imprecise mechanics (especially when magnetizing yourself to float), and I will bet many boiled cabbages you will not be able to beat this game without sighing, growling, or outright screaming "BS!"  So before you pick up Teslagrad, best make sure you're strong like bull and smart like tractor, or at least possess adult reflexes and patience.  That said, the game is pretty liberal with checkpoints.  Stick an incinerator on the end of your most barf-inducing carnival ride and you'll have an idea of the speed with which your ashes will be scattered.  But then you just pop right back up at the start of the room or right after the last ridiculous challenge you overcame.\n\nOverall, Teslagrad is a great looking game with a large environment to explore and a wide variety of puzzles that make use of simple, elegant mechanics.  It would be nice to see an easy mode where the timing on some of the challenges is relaxed, but hey, in mother Teslagrad you must work hard at pixel forge for many achievement.\n\nIn other words, it's difficult, but satisfying.  Go play it if exploration-precision-puzzle-platformer sounds good to you.","March 22, 2015","true","8.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","5"

Please bear with me**\n\nTeslagrad is an amazing platformer where one uses numerous objects with their own special abilities to make it through various puzzles. Before buying the game, I played the demo. The demo, though, doesn't really show one enough of Teslagrad and its elements going in. Thus, besides how much I've enjoyed it, I've decided to write a review.\n\nJust to give a quick overview of a non-gameplay related aspect, this game is one played in silence; in which there aren't voices. This, though, leads to an amplification of the game's story. Either way, adding voices would do little more than take away the adventure and prevent one from noticing the very fitting and melodic music.\n\n\nTeslagrad is a real mix of three aspects: intuitive and trial-and-error puzzles, coordinated and reflexive platformer action, and exploration.\n\nPuzzles: Teslagrad's main view isn't solely focused on puzzles. I'd learned this after buying the full game. One could argue that every room is a puzzle, and that's true. Teslagrad, though, is a linear game and most of these can be discoved with quick intuition. If you're a puzzle fanatic and are looking for a game with a Professor Layton type of challenge, this isn't for you. These puzzles can also be melded with quick reaction, and the bosses are puzzles in themselves; trying to figure out how to defeat them and the best way. You will also die over and over again to find answers.\n\nPlatformer action: This is especially seen from the implementation of bosses, many of which took numerous tries to defeat. Many of the puzzles and bosses require quick intuition (such as evaluating jump height and distance), coordination with numerous fingers, reflexive actions, such as to dodge attacks, and memorization (mainly of boss moves and how to defeat them). To look objectively, the boss fights are repetative, though: you dodge all of the attacks, you preform a certain action/counterattack, the boss becomes faster and/or has harder to dodge attacks, and repeat two more times.\n\nThe adventure: This is by far my favorite part. The story is very heartwarming in certain parts and leaves the guessing about the backgroung story. There are thirty-six scrolls scattered in hidden locations throughout the game, each telling part of the story. The story sequence, though, cannot be obtainable in temporal order unless you restart the game after beating it, leaving one continuously wondering about the plot. The ways that these scrolls are hidden also requires active thinking and guessing as to where they might be. It also requires planning combinations of certain moves to get to their locations.\n\nAll in all, I lreally enjoy Teslagrad, my first-ever attempt at making a review is getting too long, and I think it doesn't suit all audiences based on their "gaming-values". 9/10","January 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

During the first couple of minutes of play, I was severely impressed by the highly detailed art style and lovingly rendered animation.  This is, quite frankly, a great game to look at.\n\nGameplay wise it is a well pieced together 'gimmick' physics platformer, with the flavor this time being electromagnitivity.  Platforms and other obstacles are overcome by either positively or negatively charging elements in the world or even yourself after a certain power-up is attained.\n\nI've always had a big soft spot for metroidvania gameplay, mostly for the exploration aspect, but most especially for the moments when you've aquirred all of the power-ups in the game and, while going through the earlier parts realize how simply things are overcame, either through the skills you've gained throughout or the power-ups you've been equipped with.\n\nTeslagrad accomplishes this in spades, teaching you the 'hard' way how to do things; considering that you are punished for taking a single hit.  That's right, insta-kill is everywhere and it's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen.  That being said the developers do an excellent job of placing invisible checkpoints before each challenge, giving you the chance to experiment with very little annoyance of having to slug through five minutes of repetitive action.  Most of the time at least.  Bosses, on the other hand are unforgiving in that regard, often taking place over different 'phases'.  Oh, you died during the last phase?  Well you shouldn't have a problem doing the first two phases over and over again then.\n\nAt times frustrating, Teslagrad is great about the sense of satisfaction that comes with accomplishment; the feeling of finally getting through a particularily difficult skill-based challenge is a source of joy and never feels under-sold.  This isn't Dark Souls, but it isn't exactly Baby's First Platformer.\n\nThe story is told purely visually with no dialouge or narration whatsoever.  The closest clues you receive are adorable cut-out puppet theater snippets scatered throughout the tower and collectible scrolls litering the levels which require a certain amount of cunning and determination to receive.\n\nIn all, I clocked in a day's worth of gameplay from beginning to end- about the same length of Braid, which felt like a major source of inspiration.","July 4, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please bear with me**\n\nTeslagrad is an amazing platformer where one uses numerous objects with their own special abilities to make it through various puzzles. Before buying the game, I played the demo. The demo, though, doesn't really show one enough of Teslagrad and its elements going in. Thus, besides how much I've enjoyed it, I've decided to write a review.\n\nJust to give a quick overview of a non-gameplay related aspect, this game is one played in silence; in which there aren't voices. This, though, leads to an amplification of the game's story. Either way, adding voices would do little more than take away the adventure and prevent one from noticing the very fitting and melodic music.\n\n\nTeslagrad is a real mix of three aspects: intuitive and trial-and-error puzzles, coordinated and reflexive platformer action, and exploration.\n\nPuzzles: Teslagrad's main view isn't solely focused on puzzles. I'd learned this after buying the full game. One could argue that every room is a puzzle, and that's true. Teslagrad, though, is a linear game and most of these can be discoved with quick intuition. If you're a puzzle fanatic and are looking for a game with a Professor Layton type of challenge, this isn't for you. These puzzles can also be melded with quick reaction, and the bosses are puzzles in themselves; trying to figure out how to defeat them and the best way. You will also die over and over again to find answers.\n\nPlatformer action: This is especially seen from the implementation of bosses, many of which took numerous tries to defeat. Many of the puzzles and bosses require quick intuition (such as evaluating jump height and distance), coordination with numerous fingers, reflexive actions, such as to dodge attacks, and memorization (mainly of boss moves and how to defeat them). To look objectively, the boss fights are repetative, though: you dodge all of the attacks, you preform a certain action/counterattack, the boss becomes faster and/or has harder to dodge attacks, and repeat two more times.\n\nThe adventure: This is by far my favorite part. The story is very heartwarming in certain parts and leaves the guessing about the backgroung story. There are thirty-six scrolls scattered in hidden locations throughout the game, each telling part of the story. The story sequence, though, cannot be obtainable in temporal order unless you restart the game after beating it, leaving one continuously wondering about the plot. The ways that these scrolls are hidden also requires active thinking and guessing as to where they might be. It also requires planning combinations of certain moves to get to their locations.\n\nAll in all, I lreally enjoy Teslagrad, my first-ever attempt at making a review is getting too long, and I think it doesn't suit all audiences based on their "gaming-values". 9/10","January 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Two negatives for me: 1) While travaling through the game it seems like you have the option to collect scrolls for achivements, but it turns out you need quite a few to unlock the final boss which means backtracking if you skipped them and 2) some boss battles and platforming parts are challenging which isnt necessarily bad but doesnt mix well with the puzzles.

Nothing much is explained and a lack of a good tutorial makes the beginning of the game rough. Some of the puzzles are pretty insane as you will probably get stuck on a single puzzle for hours. Best thing to do, is quit and come back later. The game is very visually appealing and has snappy controls. Nothing feels out of place in the levels. I do recommend getting acquainted with the abilities that you do recieve as you advance. Some parts of the game feel unbalanced like some of the bosses make me think dark souls in a way, which means a really cheap tactic that the boss will use to kill you over and over again. The boss fights consist of pitting you against a well crafted boss mechanism with being stuck in a position that something will kill you in one hit. For example: spikes, fire, pits, and other instant death mechanisms that make boss fights even harder despite simple to predict patterns. Overall: the game is fun, but the story is told through some kind of picture book manner and there is no spoken pieces in the game. In a way, the story telling in this game is very unique among side scroller games that I have played.","July 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You collect up to 4 items from ancient teslamancers and each one adds a new dynamic to the game and even allows you to backtrack and find collectibles you couldn't quite get to before. The game also liked to keep you guessing and decided the best way for you to learn was through constant practice.

The beautiful music, challenging puzzles and platforming, and creative boss designs keep you engaged through the whole thing. Simple concepts lead to very challenging and precise puzzles (and bosses) later on, and the way the game tells it's story is by your own observations and how deep you want to complete the game. However it isn't completely flawless by any means. Total game time with 100% completion took me about 8 hours, which is kind of short. It also is incredibly punishing. You do not have any health bar, 1 shot you're dead. This works for most of the game, even enhancing the experience some, but it becomes very frustrating against bosses when the boss pulls out an entirely different moveset that requires some good timing, and you have to start the whole boss fight over again. It gives the game a very "trial and error" feel, in a sort of unfair way.\n\nBut I certainly wouldn't let that keep you from buying and enjoying an incredibly fun game.","May 5, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found many of the puzzles to be very clever, and the abilities to be overall very fun to play around with, and the method of storytelling to be interesting (although perhaps the story to be pretty predictable, nothing necessarily new…although it did catch me completely by surprise at one point!). Plus, Mages with Tesla-inspired powers/weapons, who wouldn’t want that?\n\nThe Steam page doesn’t lie though that some of it’s puzzles are keyboard-smashing frustrating, although it shouldn’t be so proud about that—they were frustrating not because I couldn’t figure out the solution, but rather because the solution was difficult to put into action, being either so tedious or requiring more precision than at least my controller afforded me. I think all of these puzzles were towards the very end of the game for the most part, and didn’t occupy the majority of my experience (the vast majority of puzzles were really fun to think through). One last frustrating thing is the ‘one hit, you’re dead.’ For the most part this isn’t too much of an issue, and you always start at a safe point (typically the beginning of a room) when you die, but let’s just say there are very specific points in the game where starting over again and again is really annoying (spoiler: the last two boss fights), and it’s be a lot nicer if there was a ‘three strike’ system or something like that."\n\nLooking back probably five months after I beat the game, I'm still excited for learning more about the world in future installments (which I believe the dev team has mentioned they have in store). It's one of those games that went in knowing nothing and having no expectations and came out loving it.","June 21, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZHDINC/recommended/249590/","ZHDINC","ZHDINC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZHDINC/","136 products in account","Teslagrad is really just outstanding and I quite frankly wish that it went on longer than it did. Even if you are on the fence about the length of the game, I highly recommend you give it a try. This is one of the better games that I have played in a while and it speaks volumes about the capabilities of the independent developers. This is the kind of innovation that the gaming industry has been missing.\n\nThe game starts off really simple. You play as an unnamed boy taken to the streets after an invasion of red shirts. In the beginning, you are quite powerless and all you can do is run from the invaders while learning the platforming elements in this game, but eventually you reach the gates of a mysterious tower. From there, you gain your first ability and the rest of the game revolves around solving puzzles with magnetism (the two polarities are represented by red and blue).\n\nThere is a bit of initial adjustment to the mechanics (I personally was wanting to match colors when the situation needed opposites), but everything feels completely natural after the first thirty minutes. There is some really good level design here because despite having little prompt on what each ability does or what your goals are, there is little question on what you have to do. For new abilities, the game essentially traps you in an area whenever you get a new ability and the only way out is through using that new ability. It is so much more enjoyable to learn through doing rather than watching or hearing an explanation of what your new powers allow you to do. There is also a very long sequence involving hamster wheel-like contraptions that is very intuitive and epitomizes the great level design in this game. This is the way that games should be.\n\nThere is a nice mix of simple and difficult puzzles, so you never feel as if you are stuck. The more difficult puzzles are enjoyable to figure out and you'll find that some of the puzzles aren't necessarily restricted to one solution. I often found that I initially found my way through a room in an unintended way upon visiting a room a second time. It is actually really fun to revisit older rooms with all of your abilities unlocked since you aren't bound by the restrictions you once faced.\n\nThe first boss fight is simultaneously epic and disappointing. The atmosphere combined with the music is very ominous; however, you might find yourself thinking, "That's it?" It may be an easy fight, but the first fight is mostly designed to adjust your thinking in how you fight the bosses. They are puzzle boss fights much like the rest of the game is puzzle platforming. Your character isn't all that powerful, so it is necessary to think about how you approach a boss fight. Past that first boss, every other boss fight is satisfactorily difficult. There are no checkpoints midfight. If you die, you are absolutely starting at the very beginning of the fight. This game's boss fights are the best area of this game and I wish there were more bosses. Honestly, that's the only change I would make to this game. Usually, I feel like games have too many bosses, so this game definitely is doing something right with the boss fights.\n\nThe lack of a lives system or something of that nature might seem too forgiving at first, but the game appropriately spaces checkpoints. They never occur too soon and a few take a while to get to. When you die there is a very brief cut to black and then you usually start at the beginning of a room or puzzle sequence. There is some trial-and-error, but the average player probably won't be dying repeatedly in a single area (thankfully, the boss fights are the exception).\n\nThis game has some incredible set pieces and the hand drawn art is really beautiful. The blue and red polarity motif is extremely helpful at guiding your way through the different areas. The layout of the game won't change for each playthrough, but this is a welcome drawback for the level of detail that goes into each area. If you like to explore in a game like this, there are 36 hidden collectibles spread throughout the game. For a lot of other games, I've found that developers are too sneaky about where they hide collectibles and it is usually ultimately impossible without consulting a faq or wiki, but the locations of most of the collectibles is pretty intuitive in this game. There are a few really hard to find or hard to reach collectibles, but you should be able to find them without assistance if you are trying to find them all (and you are rewarded for finding them all, but I won't spoil how).\n\nThe collectibles are just one way in which the story is told in this game. The collectibles tell the story through pictures. There are also little theater rooms scattered about the game that slowly reveal what has happened in this world. Much like the rest of the game, these parts are unvoiced (and there really isn't any text in the game aside from menus). Aside from that, the art direction really helps you understand what is happening in this game's world.\n\nFor those wondering about controls, I played this game a bit on a keyboard, but I found it to be uncomfortable. I recommend using a gaming controller (I used a Dualshock 4 for the majority of my playthrough). The game was a lot more enjoyable once I made the switch over.\n\nThis is just such an incredible game and just reading a review doesn't do it justice. I can't recommend it enough. This will definitely be a studio to keep an eye on. I cannot wait to see what kind of game Rain Games makes next.","August 24, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

During the first couple of minutes of play, I was severely impressed by the highly detailed art style and lovingly rendered animation.  This is, quite frankly, a great game to look at.\n\nGameplay wise it is a well pieced together 'gimmick' physics platformer, with the flavor this time being electromagnitivity.  Platforms and other obstacles are overcome by either positively or negatively charging elements in the world or even yourself after a certain power-up is attained.\n\nI've always had a big soft spot for metroidvania gameplay, mostly for the exploration aspect, but most especially for the moments when you've aquirred all of the power-ups in the game and, while going through the earlier parts realize how simply things are overcame, either through the skills you've gained throughout or the power-ups you've been equipped with.\n\nTeslagrad accomplishes this in spades, teaching you the 'hard' way how to do things; considering that you are punished for taking a single hit.  That's right, insta-kill is everywhere and it's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen.  That being said the developers do an excellent job of placing invisible checkpoints before each challenge, giving you the chance to experiment with very little annoyance of having to slug through five minutes of repetitive action.  Most of the time at least.  Bosses, on the other hand are unforgiving in that regard, often taking place over different 'phases'.  Oh, you died during the last phase?  Well you shouldn't have a problem doing the first two phases over and over again then.\n\nAt times frustrating, Teslagrad is great about the sense of satisfaction that comes with accomplishment; the feeling of finally getting through a particularily difficult skill-based challenge is a source of joy and never feels under-sold.  This isn't Dark Souls, but it isn't exactly Baby's First Platformer.\n\nThe story is told purely visually with no dialouge or narration whatsoever.  The closest clues you receive are adorable cut-out puppet theater snippets scatered throughout the tower and collectible scrolls litering the levels which require a certain amount of cunning and determination to receive.\n\nIn all, I clocked in a day's worth of gameplay from beginning to end- about the same length of Braid, which felt like a major source of inspiration.","July 4, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We were drawn to it by its unique look and the fact it seemed to be full of clever play mechanics and traps. It’s now finally with us and we can explore the mystery of a small boy with magnetic powers escaping into a castle after being chased by some Rasputin-esque looking pursuers.\n\nThe game has a style that though familiar we haven’t really seen before. The Soviet influence reminds us of steam punk animations and fairy tales from the Eastern Bloc and it works perfectly to set up a mysterious and unique atmosphere. There is also very little text with the story and controls explained via drawings and animated theatre puppets. The silence further intensifies the mystery (even if the lack of tutorial is a little confusing).\n\nThere is gamepad support but you’ll have to set it up manually. Again, this can be a little odd at the beginning of the game as you don’t really know what half of the commands are. Once you get it sorted out though it’s a much easier way to play as you’re going to need very quick reflexes to get through.\n\nTeslagrad is a difficult game and it requires sustained amounts of quick thinking, jumping and precision placement to get through most sections. Most of the time you are trying to avoid dropping onto spikes or electricity but there are also some shadowy beasts and mechanical enemies to avoid from time to time. You don’t really have any offense so you’ll be darting past them and running away a lot.\n\nOur little hero is far from powerless though and you’ll soon find the equipment that gives you the use of a unique set of powers. First off you’ll get the positive and negative magnetism glove. This allows you to change the charge of magnetic services and blocks. This means you can get blocks to move or fall, or use opposite charges to propel yourself up tunnels or across chasms. The next thing you’ll find is the ability to ‘blink’ or teleport a short distance. This is vital for passing barriers or dodging enemies and moving electrical fields. Before long you’re having to bounce around and blink all at once in sequences that require constant movement. It’s tough and challenging and certain sections will be repeated over and over and over.\n\nDying is perhaps where the biggest weakness in the game lies. The controls can feel a little twitchy at times and I don’t think we’ve ever been so frustrated by a character auto-climbing up a ledge they’ve grabbed onto. Death can also feel unfair with the blink ability very difficult to judge while in motion. What compounds the issue is that if you miss a jump or die, there are times you’ll have to repeat quite a large section to get back to where you were. Don’t even get us started on some of the bosses that just never seem to die either.\n\nFrustration aside this is a very clever and well crafter game. You do get used to the controls and both the level and graphical design is of a standard that makes you want to persevere and get to the next section. The constant climb up the castle and gradual revelation of the mystery within it are engaging and will likely keep you striving until you reach the end. There will be some gamers who just won’t be able to cut it though and that’s a shame as this is a beautiful fairy tale that you really should try.\n\nOverall 8/10","February 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The presentation is fantastic; the art and the music are great, the way the story is told works effectively enough as well. The puzzles are generally very well crafted though there is the occasional slip into tedium, but not very often, though often enough to be noticeable. The puzzles never really repeat themselves over the 3-4 hours it takes to complete the main game, so there's plenty of variety even if the end result is a tad on the short side. I also wish there was a bit better way to navigate around the map, as the central tower helps but can still result in a fair bit of time spent getting back to some rooms when looking for the secrets. The secrets themselves are also generally well-handled, never overly challenging though a few of them rely on luck due to the physics.\nIf I had to call out one especially weak part of the game though, it's certainly the boss fights. They're not really that hard, no, but the problem is that you end up dying repeatedly trying to learn what all the boss does, because if you don't know what's coming often you won't have the time to react. The final boss is probably the only exception to this but replaces this instead with tedium; one phase is hard to figure out but trivial once you know what to do; one phase basically exists to kill time with attacks that are incredibly easy to dodge; and one phase can get you stuck in an impossible situation the third time it repeats if you're unlucky enough. The flaws of the game aren't enough to bring it down entirely as the majority of the game is quite an enjoyable experience, but it does knock the game down in my favor a small degree. Still, pretty good game, maybe a bit short for the price tag though I can't truly be the judge of that.","April 28, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its both good and very far from perfection. I found some puzzles and boss fights, especially at the beginning, somewhat unfair due to the fact that they were based on object physics, so some times it was simply imposible to do things right.\n\nGame mechanics are very well designed tho, I enjoyed founding new objects to empower my character and be more resourceful. Been able to go back and forth easily through the game with those new mechanics makes you feel like good. You can collect all those cards in no time when you have the 4 objects.\n\nNarratively speaking, the story was good but in this kind of game i would have prefered more polish game mechanics, player control and object physics rather than a well told story. But thats personal taste I guess.","February 21, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A great puzzle conceals the most vital tool, one’s ingenuity. In more recent years, Braid and Limbo did this well. They made the puzzles less about how to put the pieces together and more about how to realize and apply what you already knew. It’s for this reason that Teslagrad isn’t a better game. Though it offers some original puzzle design, presents a beautiful aesthetic and an original narrative-style, Teslagrad often makes luck the central tool to ascend the electrified tower.","February 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both the story and the gameplay use a show, don't tell methodology which was extremely nice to see. There is no dialogue but you imidiately get a sense for state of the world and the story is driven by the art itself. Similarly the game gives you no explicit instruction but to tell you the keys you need to press. It presents you with a simple problem first so that you can experiment and learn the new mechanics.\n\nVery enjoyable well worth picking up if you enjoy puzzle platformers even a little bit.","January 28, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics and music are cute and very pretty, so pretty that a good chunk of my time in-game has been spent taking screencaps of the lovely environments and the adorable player character.\n\nThe pretty backgrounds and objects aren't strictly for show - with no dialog whatsoever, the story is told through the environment.  You can piece it together by looking at optional puppet shows that play in the background of various rooms, scattered propaganda posters, signposts, graffiti, murals, wreckage, statues, hidden rooms, and even the achievements.  Some people might find it a little disappointingly vague, but I think it adds to the mystery of the setting and enhances the "lonely" atmosphere (I mean, you ARE mostly alone in a huge tower).\n\nThe controls are simple - your standard movement, jump, and pause/map/achievement-checking buttons with 4 special ability buttons.  I would recommend using a gamepad if you have one (I don't), as a lot of the puzzles require a great deal of precision that's difficult to achieve with a keyboard.  The game auto-saves whenever you enter a new room, which is great because you'll probably die a lot.  Thankfully dying in this game isn't met with a lot of fanfare and you're quickly dropped back where you entered the current room.\n\nEach puzzle is quite different.  They vary wildly in difficulty and fun-ness, although there do seem to be a few that are universally reviled (the notorious "Scroll #30") and some that are universally loved (hamster wheel room!).  While the game definitely doesn't focus on combat, there are 5 boss battles.  I found myself dreading the boss encounters, which sort of added to the narrative: you are playing as a mostly-defenseless little kid, so it makes sense for these huge machines to curbstomp you.  That said, the bosses are unforgiving and will make you hate your life.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game and will probably replay it quite a bit if only to take in the gorgeous atmosphere again.  I have 2 tips for anyone about to start the game:  1, use a gamepad, and 2, get all of the achievements before you go to the final boss.  The final boss is a huge pain and the "normal" ending isn't really worth it IMO.  Finishing with all of the achievements gives a better ending and lets you restart the game with all of your special abilities from the very beginning.","January 18","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Narrative in Teslagrad is all about visual, there is no text or dialogue. History can be unvailed through the scrolls collected during the course of the game as well as drawings on walls and puppet shows. Traversing through the castle with abilities from artifacts is fun and solving puzzles to go further or to get to items and/or secret areas is challenging and satisfying. Boss fights are difficult yet rewarding when you figure the way to defeat each of them and pull that off perfectly. Teslagrad has virtually no punishment for the player as you can respawn at the last checkpoint indefinitely. In my opinion, the only downside is that it offers no tutorial or clue, you have to figure everything out by yourself.","February 15","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics and music are cute and very pretty, so pretty that a good chunk of my time in-game has been spent taking screencaps of the lovely environments and the adorable player character.\n\nThe pretty backgrounds and objects aren't strictly for show - with no dialog whatsoever, the story is told through the environment.  You can piece it together by looking at optional puppet shows that play in the background of various rooms, scattered propaganda posters, signposts, graffiti, murals, wreckage, statues, hidden rooms, and even the achievements.  Some people might find it a little disappointingly vague, but I think it adds to the mystery of the setting and enhances the "lonely" atmosphere (I mean, you ARE mostly alone in a huge tower).\n\nThe controls are simple - your standard movement, jump, and pause/map/achievement-checking buttons with 4 special ability buttons.  I would recommend using a gamepad if you have one (I don't), as a lot of the puzzles require a great deal of precision that's difficult to achieve with a keyboard.  The game auto-saves whenever you enter a new room, which is great because you'll probably die a lot.  Thankfully dying in this game isn't met with a lot of fanfare and you're quickly dropped back where you entered the current room.\n\nEach puzzle is quite different.  They vary wildly in difficulty and fun-ness, although there do seem to be a few that are universally reviled (the notorious "Scroll #30") and some that are universally loved (hamster wheel room!).  While the game definitely doesn't focus on combat, there are 5 boss battles.  I found myself dreading the boss encounters, which sort of added to the narrative: you are playing as a mostly-defenseless little kid, so it makes sense for these huge machines to curbstomp you.  That said, the bosses are unforgiving and will make you hate your life.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game and will probably replay it quite a bit if only to take in the gorgeous atmosphere again.  I have 2 tips for anyone about to start the game:  1, use a gamepad, and 2, get all of the achievements before you go to the final boss.  The final boss is a huge pain and the "normal" ending isn't really worth it IMO.  Finishing with all of the achievements gives a better ending and lets you restart the game with all of your special abilities from the very beginning.","January 18","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not particularly good at puzzles, and I started playing it maybe six to eight hours before my friend did. He passed the second boss ahead of me, and has since finished it with all 36 scrolls. I, however, am not doing such.\n\nI will recommend Teslagrad to both people of my ilk (more action gamers) and the analytical, puzzly thinkers. Never really seen a game with its mechanics; magnetism and electricity are fun to mess with as you get progressively cooler gadgets to work with.\n\nThe bosses are viciously hard, since you have only one life and they often employ nasty stuff like lasers, explosive birds with weird hitboxes, giant walls of fire on conveyor belts, and homing/not homing projectiles. Watch out. Like, seriously.\n\nAn incredibly good game with a somewhat more niche audience. 8.5/10.","December 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There are cinematic moments where the player character has to stand still to let the camera focus, but the camera's focus can be cancelled by moving around. Movement is never locked, so the game never forces the player to sit through a cutscene.\n\nMovement and puzzle mechanics are introduced at a good pace, and the all the puzzles encountered will rely on the player's understanding of the mechanics. For movement, I'd recommend a controller.\n\nGranted, there are a few areas where I did get frustrated from constant deaths, but I was able to recognize the patterns eventually. Mostly, the frustration was overshadowed by how much fun I had while learning about the lore through puzzle-solving. The risk-reward system worked well since the 36 collectible scrolls were usually hidden behind some kind of skill barrier based on already established puzzle mechanics.\n\nFinding everything the game had to offer was fulfilling, making Teslagrad a rewarding experience from start to finish.","April 2","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are vibrant and gorgeously animated, and the atmosphere of the game struck me in a way that I haven't felt from an indie game in a long time.\nAt its core, this is a platformer that never forgets the fact, and never waters down the platforming to deliver story or test mechanics, but rather inegrates it fluidly and masterfully. The levels are non-linear, you walk where you want to and discover secret parts of the map as you please. The mechanics are very tight, and on the whole the experience feels reminiscent of 2-d metroid games.\nThe boss fights are unique and challenging in the best possible way, testing your reactions and skills as much as they test your wits.

It's here that the games principle mechanics of Positive (+) & Negative (-) charged platforms, electric barriers, and magical equipment that allow you to manipulate and control the oposing forces - begin to slowly unfold.\n\nAs you acquire new abilities like the Swift Shoes, which let you quickly zap forwards several spaces - the platforming very gradually becomes more and more elaborate & complex - with challenging puzzles that see you climbing your way to the top of Tesla Tower.\n\nAlong the way, the story is told using clever stage-play-like rooms and of course - the incredible artwork & paintings that make up the visual end of the game.  The music, which is more atmospheric at most times - is equally remarkable, and the combination fueled my quest to reach the top of the tower.\n\nThe game does have it's share of difficult sections - including the few Boss encounters scattered about, which require memorization of attack patterns, and the skill to actually preform whats necessary to defeat them - but I never found them so hard as I couldn't beat them, or at least further my attempts to do so.\n\nFor the completionist, there are 36 hidden scrolls to collect in Teslagrad which reward you with more of the backstory (and a hidden ending) - but you'll have to go out of your way to explore, and collect them - which may push your total time playing well over the 5hrs it should average to simply make your way through in one go.\n\n\nTeslagrad offers an engaging story, wonderful visuals, and challenging puzzles - well worth the average asking price.\n\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10","January 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It’s hard to not praise the visuals when they’re as good or even better than something straight from Ubisoft’s UbiArt Framework games, (Rayman Origins, Valiant Hearts, Child of Light)\n\nEven more impressive is the depth to every visual you see. Teslagrad follows the old adage of, “Show, Don’t Tell”. In fact there’s not a single word of dialogue throughout the entire game, yet you’ll uncover the history and story entirely through its artwork.  Artifacts and paintings adorn all the rooms and help you paint your own picture of who you are, and why you’re here. Broken equipment, and death still lingers in the tower, from a battle not too long ago.\n\nRight away you’ll be thrown into the deep end and forced to survive a series of difficult platforming sections. You will soon be complimented by an assortment of gear which you’ll use to manipulate the world around you. Puzzles take the form of Red vs Blue magnetic fields, and you’ll often be forced into interweave the puzzles with precision platforming. I was stumped more than once throughout the game, and have had quite a few sections with 30+ deaths. While it’s not another Super Meat Boy, this can certainly be a challenging game at times, which will test your patience.\n\nChances are if you ever read my review it’s because Teslagrad will be on sale at 85% on some Steam sale long down the road. It’s honestly too cheap. They could have released it at $15 or even $20 for the amount of work and polish put into it. Definitely an underrated gem.","February 5, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's here that the games principle mechanics of Positive (+) & Negative (-) charged platforms, electric barriers, and magical equipment that allow you to manipulate and control the oposing forces - begin to slowly unfold.\n\nAs you acquire new abilities like the Swift Shoes, which let you quickly zap forwards several spaces - the platforming very gradually becomes more and more elaborate & complex - with challenging puzzles that see you climbing your way to the top of Tesla Tower.\n\nAlong the way, the story is told using clever stage-play-like rooms and of course - the incredible artwork & paintings that make up the visual end of the game.  The music, which is more atmospheric at most times - is equally remarkable, and the combination fueled my quest to reach the top of the tower.\n\nThe game does have it's share of difficult sections - including the few Boss encounters scattered about, which require memorization of attack patterns, and the skill to actually preform whats necessary to defeat them - but I never found them so hard as I couldn't beat them, or at least further my attempts to do so.\n\nFor the completionist, there are 36 hidden scrolls to collect in Teslagrad which reward you with more of the backstory (and a hidden ending) - but you'll have to go out of your way to explore, and collect them - which may push your total time playing well over the 5hrs it should average to simply make your way through in one go.\n\n\nTeslagrad offers an engaging story, wonderful visuals, and challenging puzzles - well worth the average asking price.\n\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10","January 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Like Boss fights, because you have 1 life, and if you get hit once, that's it, respawn at start. The art is beautiful but sometimes the controls don't feel quite right with the platforming; sometimes where you are supposed to go, is just off of the visible screen, so you have to jump off to one side to figure out where the Hell you're supposed to go! It's incredibly frustrating because I really want to like this game because I love Metroidvanias, but this one just annoys me.

The game feels unfinished due to some areas having absolutely no ambient sound leaving you with absolute silence to stand around in while solving puzzles and yet others have a melodic atmosphere.\n\nWhat ruined the game for me was the complete lack of any sense of difficulty curve with puzzles varying from difficult to insanely easy and back again, one example was the puzzle which made me uninstall the game as it was the final straw where you need to use the field-cloak and diagonally placed field generators to repel you  up to the top of a room. If you miss you easily fall and have to start all over again. What makes it worse is that this is the first puzzle of its kind and the momentum needed to achieve the require velocity feels more like luck than actually being in control. There is nothing worse than knowing what to do but the controls not allowing for the kind of precision that the puzzle requires,\n\nIs Telsagrad worth a look? Not at all.

It is obviously all hand-drawn and is quite beautiful. However, as it stands, it is plagued by so many gameplay issues that it just isn't fun.\n\nThink of Metroid, in that game, you have at least somewhat some freedom to explore. In this game? Strictly linear. Also, backtracking is pointless and you might do it inadvertently when the one path to continue is undiscovered, wasting A LOT OF TIME FOR NOTHING.\n\nAlso, the puzzles are very annoying. VERY annoying AND frustrating. You die in one hit. You then need to redo ALL the blighted platforms all over again, or redo the damn repetitive bossfight pattern all over again. And again. And again. Until 1- You trial-and-error memorise the movement patterns PERFECTLY and avoid the myriad of one-hit deaths or 2- You yell f*** it and stop playing this unfun and boring game. It's not challenging or intense like Dark Souls, its just frustrating, feels broken and tedious. To be honest, the bosses just really feel out of place here. This is a puzzle game, so combat feels weird and clunky.\n\nAs for the music, while it is pretty at first, the tracks are very short loops and you'll be darned fed up real quick after you're respawned at the beginning of the section for the damned 10th time. And its a bit strange how some areas are devoid of music, then you enter a new area and TADAH a melodic tune. Why not have a unique tune for each area? Or a more elongated and captivating tune? And as for the sound effects... just meh. The Fox McCloud dash is a really cool feature, but the electric SFX really annoyed me. Is it enjoyable to have electric noise constantly in a game? The answer is simply, NO.\n\nAs much as I appreciate art in games and I highly promote it, I also cannot recommend a game that fails on so many levels to give a fun or interesting experience. You might be more patient than I, but if you don't have a lot of time to respawn countless times, or you don't have a controller, give this game a skip. At the very least, buy it when its on sale to encourage this developper to make a new game that surpasses this one's many flaws.\n\nSo yeah, 5 points for excellent art, 1 point for cool dash feature and some few fun puzzles, but -4 points for frustrating gameplay, repetiveness and control wonkiness and complete linearity despite a big metroidvania map structure.\n\nFinal note : playtest your game and find those sections that ♥♥♥♥ them off. Those are the reason I stopped playing. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a jump right. I just got tired of retrying tedious sections!","January 7, 2014","false","5.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

But as the gamer that I am, I had to get it. The artwork very reminiscing of the golden era of Disney films and comic strips from a bye gone era. Music very ambient and will mixed that gives you that Metriod vibe during the Prime era. No arrows or holding hand mechanics to tell you where to venture next. This game is pure and challenging, but not borderdown fustration. The gameplay reminds me of two titles. Shilloute Mirage, by Treasure and Metriod. Due to the stage layouts and the fitting tone to the music when it presents itself at the right moments. Even the upgrades are noticeable on the character you play, similar to Samus in Super Metriod.\n\nThe Shilloute Mirage referance has to do with the famous "Red" & "Blue" mechanic that Treasure implempted in SM and their famous top down shooter(SHMUP), Ikuruga. Outland, by Housemarque also use the same mechanic as well for their game. What makes Teslagrad different from the latter titles is that the game is not a shooter, but a platform puzzel game using electricity and magnetism to get through stages. The futher you go along, the more your reflexes gets tested, so does your thought process. And believe it or not, it happens rather quickly than you think. Now, on to the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros-\n\n-Amaing artwork and animation. Never seen anything like it using the Unity engine. The backgrounds have a watercolor feel to it.\n\n-Great use of SFX and music. Everything fits with the world, and well mixed.\n\n-Great use of the save feature. It leaves you where you left off.\n\n-Stage design. very well design, and it doesn't feel boring and uninspired.\n\n-Cons\n\n-Controls feels floaty at times, but not annoying\n\n-Camera. It needs to be pulled out. In certain areas, you'll have no idea where to go becasue you can't see the stage at times. You only can pan up or down, but not left or right. This becomes an issue after the second boss fight. You encounter a room where you can see futher ahead and not know when to jump off. And by jumping off randomly, you'll encounter death.\n\nWith all that said, this game is amazing, and it was the best way to start the New Year for me.","January 4, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HadBabits/recommended/249590/","HadBabits","HadBabits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HadBabits/","391 products in account","A fantastic platforming puzzle game\n\n\nTelsagrad is one of those games I've been keeping an eye on for the past year. It's got a gorgeous hand drawn art style, solid platforming (I especially like the tele-zap boots), and interesting puzzles and boss fights. You are a boy in a town being invaded by a red army, fleeing across rooftops until you enter a mysterious tower, which you must face many a challenge to reach the top and get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding it.\n\nThere's no text, the story is neatly rolled out over the game via paintings, automated plays, and just by observing the beautiful environments around you. It's a great example of how a story can be told through other more interesting means than by walls of text or dialogue. While it's style reminds me of Braid, there's a big contrast: Where Braid seemed to keep it's convulated story in little rooms between levels to glimpse at ("pretentious" comes to mind), but Telsagrad has a fairly simple story told piece by piece until you get to the part where you come in.\n\nThe gameplay consists of platforming and using your magnet powers to solve physics puzzles. You unlock more powers which results in new more challenging puzzles. You can punch blocks to change their polarity, (negative or positive) teleport a short distance, and take stock of your own polarity. The possibilities here are fully explored with the large amount of puzzles.  The bosses in this game can be puzzles in themself and really try your skill at your newly gained abilities throughout the game and are satisfying because of that.\n\nMy only real problem was the diffulty and redudance of some areas. While there are plenty of checkpoints, you die from any damage. Expect to do some areas a lot of times. And sometimes just falling off means trecking back a distance. And some of the bosses are controllers snappingly frustrating. Since there are no checkpoints during bosses, and they in themselves are puzzles, you'll die figuring out how to counter their next move. This lead to numerous deaths and a lot of frustration. But this is definitely not a deal breaker.\n\nIf there's any justice, Telsagrad will get a spot in the lime light with the other indie champions like Fez or Limbo, because it deserves it. It's a beautiful and challenging game, and I wholeheartedly reccomend it.","December 31, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The atmosphere is top notch and the puzzles are suitable brain candy. It features a haunting, engaging sound track and the graphics are beautiful. Overall presentation is also incredibly slick, both in menus and during in-game "cut scenes" which aren't really cut scenes at all, but simply zoom into certain moments of action subtlety enhancing the effect.\n\nIt's already been compared to both Braid and Limbo in other reviews, but for me only the Braid comparison holds true as the puzzles are certainly on a par with Braid.\n\nCracking platformer overall.

The art and animation are some of the most superb I've seen in a 2D platformer. It's also challenging, a rare treat for a 2D platformer at this point I think.\n\nThe developers took care not to let tutorials break the flow of gameplay. Most information the player needs to know, either about the controls, story, or world is conveyed through the back and foregrounds. That’s something I greatly appreciate and wish more developers attempted.\n\nIt has an adequate world to build on that is extrapolated on just enough to keep it interesting and fresh. It's not very long, maybe about 6 hours if you're taking your time, a little longer if you get all the extra items.\n\nIn addition to all that, it has a very catchy soundtrack that doesn't get old regardless of how often you have to reattempt a puzzle.\n\nIn spite of all that, I can't see the game remaining very memorable. Its charming as hell, but for one reason or another it doesn't have staying power.\n\nIf you like 2D platformers, you’ll probably enjoy this, but I imagine your feelings will end up similar to mine, eventually.\n","December 18, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall, I think this is a very beautiful and good game, but I guess not everyone will enjoy it. Like in old Sonic and Super Mario, sometimes you have to memorize the scenario in order to react quickly enough. Also, bosses follow fixed patterns of actions and you're expected to perform fixed actions too in order to destroy them, just like in old Donkey Kong and other platform games. This can be frustrating and that's why I think not everybody will enjoy it.

The game itself can be completed in roughly 3 hours assuming the player knows what to do and what to expect. For me, collecting all the extras, finding all the secrets, and completing the whole game only took me 2 hours, but it took me a couple of weeks on other saves prior to my speed run.\n\nOverall, do I recommend the game? Yes.\n\nIs there anything bad about this game? The difficulty is for the more experienced, but with practice it becomes easier.\n\nIs the price fair? Yes. Considering it's length, content, and the joy of playing it I think that 10$ is a fair price.\n\nLast comment: I hope the devs will release another game someday.","November 7, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a good story with perfect structure for narrating it. environmental storytelling is great here and if you want know more about backstory, you should collect 36 collectables which are in tough positions and reaching to some of them, makes you cry and are extremely hard. Main menu's score is such a masterpiece that never gets repetitive. it's level design is metroidvania and has some flaws, for example in some puzzles or platforming challenges if you miss the first try, you blocked and should whether do a suicide or load the game to start the scene again and there are some minor bugs too. Teslagrad's shining star is Game Design. All of the gameplay is created with 2-3 core mechanics and magnetic physics laws. It also has some great boss fights and 2 endings, 15 collectables required to facing the final boss and 36 to acquired alternate ending. Art style is another good feature of the game.

It has a good story with perfect structure for narrating it. environmental storytelling is great here and if you want know more about backstory, you should collect 36 collectables which are in tough positions and reaching to some of them, makes you cry and are extremely hard. Main menu's score is such a masterpiece that never gets repetitive. it's level design is metroidvania and has some flaws, for example in some puzzles or platforming challenges if you miss the first try, you blocked and should whether do a suicide or load the game to start the scene again and there are some minor bugs too. Teslagrad's shining star is Game Design. All of the gameplay is created with 2-3 core mechanics and magnetic physics laws. It also has some great boss fights and 2 endings, 15 collectables required to facing the final boss and 36 to acquired alternate ending. Art style is another good feature of the game. If you love tough puzzle platformers, don't miss it!","January 21, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Where to begin. A lot of people have already talked about how the silent storyteling in this game is great--and it is. There's absolutely no dialogue whatsoever. The music is, well, there are a few songs in the game that are good...but there's a lot of quiet sounds/none whatsoever, so for the most part it's just you and your polarized gear.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I enjoyed it. The puzzles are interesting with the polarity mechanic, for sure. Enjoyable, overall. The boss battles are a little bit...unforgiving. You die in a single hit (from anything), meaning you have to restart the boss if you get hit by anything at all. Personally, I thought this was a good thing. However, I've also played all three of the Metroid Prime games, so I'm used to tougher bosses. (Speaking of Metroid, Samus' helmet and a pair of Chozo statues make a cameo)\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it if you like Metroidvanias. The game took maybe 7 hours of investment from me, so it's a shorter game if you know how to handle it. Use your moves, fire the Tesla beam upwards (because you can, the one thing the game never tells you that you also absolutely need), and don't die. You know what you've gotta do.\n\nSo get Teslagrad, and fulfill your destiny as an electrical wizard.","December 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Throughout the game there was very little combat and more of a focus on story, setting, solving puzzles and avoiding hazards. And now, to the break down!\n\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nPHENOMENAL Story telling through Art and Music\nMuch like the opening scenes to Pixar's "Up,"  the story is painted for you through the use of images and music only - there is no dialogue! Instead, Teslagrad's expressive art style, the 'cut scene' sequences, collectible scrolls and notes scrawled on walls tell the story of how a once great society of inventors met their unfortunate end at the hands of a selfish and bitter king. A+\n\n\nSharp Physics\nThe platforming mechanics and puzzles involve a lot of magnetism based effects and it all felt very precise. Your abilty to super jump, levitate and fly all seemed very consistent for the most part (unlike some physics engines!) and collision detection was particularly detailed and precise. There were only a couple of times when things were moving too fast that I wasn't sure if there was some muddled reactions happening... but otherwise each detail, from the corners of ledges to the speed of levitation, all felt incredibly smooth.\n\n\nClever Puzzles\nWhile some of them took me a while to grasp, or were physically demanding to complete, the puzzles (mostly) felt challenging and fun. There weren't too many times I found myself completely bewildered or frustrated... so Teslagrad's developers win more brownie points for making their puzzles fairly intuitive.\n\n\nFlow of Motion/Noticeable Power Curve/Did I mention the physics?\nSince the physics of the game were so on point it gave you a great sense of flow throughout the game and heightens the sense of freedom over the environment... Particularly as you gain your power ups. You REALLY notice the difference toward the end of the game.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nHonestly, not too much to say here. I either loved or hated everything in this game, so thinking of 'meh' complaints was tough.  If I had to say anything, I'd mention:\n\nTimed Puzzle of DOOM!\nSo, arguably the most difficult part of the game for me, involved flying upward on a magnetic 'updraft' as fast as possible through a series of electrical beams in order to get to the top before a quest item became unavailable. It was extremely difficult.  But that seems like a personal complaint rather than a design flaw.\n\nSneaky Camera Angles\nMaybe twice in the whole game, it felt like the game was being deliberately abusive when it came to their forced camera angles. Typically the camera is focused on whatever you can see in front of you. However, for what I assume are cinematic reasons, your POV would shift in to focus on something plot-worthy. 99% of the time this was fine because you were somewhere safe, you expected it and you could walk away from this auto-focused location without issue. But once in a while, your focus would shift in such a way that you couldn't see a guard running at you (you only face gaurds twice in the game, btw) and you'd be insta-gibbed. Very sneaky! Very spiteful!\n\n\n\nThe DOWNRIGHT UGLY\n\nSo, two points of contention. Two things that the game should have done, but failed miserably.\n\nForced Hidden Collectable Quest\nI don't mind collecting trinkets (in this case scrolls) as a bonus, or for achievement or what not. But for god's sake don't force me to do it! There comes a point in the game where you can no longer progress until you have collected so many of these freakin' scrolls that are hidden throughout the game levels. There's still one more boss to defeat, more story to uncover.... but you have to pass through the gate with so many of these damn scrolls in your bag before it lets you through. Of course, this could have been avoided if....\n\n\nCommunicate, Communicate, Communicate!\nIf I'm forced to play hide and seek through the ENTIRE GAME MAP... at least throw me a freakin' bone as to where these things can be found! For a game that communicates its story, SO FREAKIN WELL, you'd think this would be a non-issue. Clearly someone missed the memo.\n\nIn fairness, I collected approximately 90% of these things because their locations were obvious... it was just a matter of having the right tools and figuring out the platforming puzzle. But the other 10% were blatantly hidden offscreen in secret zones, or through passages that blended in with the scenery. After about an hour I decided to look online for the remaining locations. All in all, not the end of the world... but it would have been nice to have some sort of indicator on the map, or a tone, or light or something that would mark a location as important to guide me back to it. Those other 90% were somewhat fun to collect since I had to explore.... but those last 10% were infuriating! >_<\n\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game with a fantastic story line! Just be prepared to look for help (unless you like playing through the game for an extra dozen hours banging your character against each surface, in each level, inch by inch).","January 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There aren't loadscreens either, gameplay is 100% uninterrupted as you play.\n\nThis game is beautiful.  The soundtrack, the art style, the gameplay it all flows really well and captures the time period and setting for the game.  The puzzles are ingenious and challenging, some really hard at parts.  That would be a big deal but it's not beacause of the wonderful checkpoint system.  Many fail and die puzzle frustrations are alleviated by this checkpoint system.\n\nPart of this game are easy and parts of it are difficult, the bosses are pretty cool but not overly engaging.  It's the standard patter recognition affair so until you get it down, you'll die.\n\nOne gripe I have is it had very weak controller support.  It has it, but you have to self-configure it.  It would have been nice to just have it auto-configure but once you configure it, you're good to go.\n\nThe map is also quite lacking and it would have been nice to see the full map at all times, like a true Metroid-vania.  The game is linear with the illusion of a Metroid-vania title but it all flows so well.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nRecommend.","January 20, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It looks beautiful, controls decently but a bit floaty, and the story is told through some pretty spectacular ways. It just feels like they didn't play test it. Some of the "puzzles" are just timing and landing jumps and dashes, and the controls aren't tight enough to feel empowered to do this. So instead you repeat a section over and over until fluking on it. Not fun, and completely disengages you from the story bits. I appreciate difficulty in games, but this feels more like unpolished/untested rather than difficult.","July 10, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Extremely dissappointed that the laser array at the top of the elevator is active ALL THE TIME, even after the obnoxious eyeball flies right through the damn thing. I was expecting to be done with it after I got the scroll, but that switch only activates the scrolls elevator, not the lasers. Which is ridiculous.\nBirdboss was nice up until the bombs. I especially liked the part where you zap inside it and punch its heart, and then it gets struck by lightning. The bombs though... Why are they homing timed bombs that explode on touch? I could understand any two of those, but all three is just being a ♥♥♥♥, especially with that explosion radius.\n\nI can only hope that you don't have to do the entire eyeball boss from the start if you mess up on the frankly idiotic segment where it manages to still attempt to kill you in freefall, and I can't help but think that whole part was only added so you're not watching it and the character fall for a solid minute and a half because there is nothing worth seeing all the way down.\n\nAll in all it seems like it's one of those 1 hitpoint games just because the added difficulty of a health system would be too much work, or making the animations of the character getting zapped but surviving would diminish the oh so very very dramatic storytelling.\nMore than a little let down that you can never on any occassion make two enemies different polarities and watch them try to untangle themselves, or at least change one polarity and make your own match so they struggle with an invisible wall\n\n\n\n\n\nNot worth full price, 50% or below is probably more accurate.

I don't know if I would have spent $10 on it, but I might have. This game is electropunk set in a slovic city. When you first start it feels like it's just going to be a platformer, but that is just to introduce you to the controls of climbing and movement. The graphics are really well drawn. The music is good, but the looping needs more work. You can definitly tell when the track ends and then starts up again.\n\nAnd then there are the maguffins/powerups. Not going to go into any detail because of spoilers, but they are cool as hell.\n\nThis game is a metroidvania in more of a loose sense. It is definitly a puzzle platformer, and it does that part very well, but so far the only backtrack I have done is to get unlockables, not powerups or to open paths I couldn't get to before to advance the game. It could just be that I haven't played long enough for that to happen yet though. Metroidvania fans I think would still like this game.\n\nTL:DR Definitly buy it on sale, probably buy it normal price, maguffins/powerups are cool as hell.","December 26, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/249590/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Metroidvania games are basically absent from the triple-A game space. While Konami and Nintendo used to produce some high-quality adventures, we're now relegated to the indie sphere to find any kind of action/adventure game in the vein of those classic series'.\n\nTeslagrad may not be the most diverse of it's kin, but it certainly earns a recommendation for it's quality and simplicity. You play as a boy who has dominion over electricity. This allows him to change the polarity of certain blocks, blink through thin walls, magnetize to specific blocks and shoot electric beams.\n\nThis all unfolds through a castle that subtlely reveals the story behind your character. You jump through obstacles, avoid enemies and death traps and collect capsules to clear up some of the backstory. This isn't too far removed from something like Symphony of the Night, often feeling like a spiritual successor at times.\n\nThe art style is very expressive and feels extremely fluid. It lends a sense of smoothness to the gameplay that always empowers you. Even when repeatedly dying, you never feel like the deaths were your fault.\n\nThat is, until you hit the boss battles. For everything the game gets right about standard platforming, someone forgot how to make bosses interesting. Taking a page from Super Meat Boy, these bosses employ a one and done style of battle. One hit and you restart the whole ordeal, regardless of length.\n\nIt gets super bad towards the end where you are required to hit the bosses a total of 9 times. Going through the motions of a 5 minute boss battle to fail at the end is almost enough to make me hurl a controller through a window. If it weren't for the wonderfully built castle, I'd have given up after the second boss.\n\nGetting through those roadblocks does feel rather satisfying and buckling down to overcome a fierce adversary is always a treat. I just wish more could have been done to alleviate some of the repetitive nature of those encounters. At least the platforming is always throwing new tricks your way.\n\nInterestingly enough, the achievements seem to matter in this game. There is one linked to each scroll you can find in the game. Finding all of these will give you the "true" ending. It's refreshing to play a game where, even without knowing what the achievements are, you end up collecting them all out of sheer fun factor.\n\nAt the end of it all, I really recommend this to people who are dying for another Metroidvania game. There are a few newer ones that may have more developed mechanics, but simplicity is always appreciated, in my opinion. I like having as few barriers in my way as possible when playing something.\n\n7/10","July 23, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/249590/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","A 2D side-scrolling puzzle-platformer, this game is lovingly hand-illustrated, but very minimalistic in some ways. You are… a boy, who is running away from… some bad guys. You are the last heir of Teslagrad, a bunch of… people in pointy hats who seem to harness… electricity? But not just any electricity – two colors of electricity!\n\nA game focused on navigating a 2D environment and finding secrets in the form of hard-to-reach scrolls, over the course of the game you gain the ability to punch to change the colors of blocks, surround yourself in a field which causes you to be repelled from or attracted towards blocks of the same/opposite colors, a flash-step horizontal teleport which can take you through most things, including some designated walls, and eventually a staff which can kill enemies and change block colors at range.\n\nThe entire game is set in a pretty tight little environment, a tower which has a central pillar you can use magnetism to travel up and down via a colored field beam. As the game progresses, you go through a number of themed areas and fight a series of bosses. Death is generally fairly cheap, starting over at the last checkpoint, which is in every room, and often after most significant obstacles within a room as well – though there is the occaisional exception.\n\nOn the whole, the game is centered around a variety of platforming puzzles which rely on your special talents. Some of these are reasonably creative, but after you gain the first three items, you go through several consecutive areas without unlocking anything new. While these areas are decent enough, in the end some of the puzzles do start to feel a little samey.\n\nFortunately, the game is fairly short – 100% completion took me 5 hours according to Steam’s internal clock – and the game does present some real challenge without being daunting. That being said, it is very simplistic and minimalistic, and while the graphics are attractive enough, there’s nothing in this game which really goes above and beyond – just a bunch of platformer puzzles which are decent enough, but never really cross the line into exceptional.\n\nI didn’t feel like I wasted my time with this game, but at the same time it is hard for me to recommend anyone else spend their time on it; while it is decent enough, its lack of actually excelling in any way means that there are other, much more memorable experiences you can have. The story is very bare-bones and there is pretty much no real investment in it, so all there is is the puzzles – and while they’re okay, it just does not excite.\n\nPros:\n\n* Decent puzzles.\n* Decent challenge level.\n* Decent bosses.\n\nCons:\n\n* Minimalistic story which creates no emotional connection to the action in the player.\n* Minimalistic design starts to hurt a bit towards the end as the puzzles start to feel a bit samey.\n* Does not excel in any real way.\n","November 17, 2015","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does have some anoying moments and learning the boss sequences by trail and error can be impossible without doing it 100 times over.

I went in expecting a metroidvania and got a platforming puzzle solver game instead. Although I was surprised, the game exceeded all expectations for me.\n\nThe entire game has no dialogue and the story is gathered from grabbing these battery shaped objects throughout the tower you are climbing. You solve puzzles with the power of polarities and some teleport magics. The puzzles are fairly simple with a few difficult ones here and there but the true challenge is solving the puzzles to grab the batteries for more story. Enemies are fairly rare and you will most likely die to the environment rather than being attacked by anything.\n\nBosses however, are the games absolute strongeset point. Given that you die in one hit regardless of the situation certain bosses become very difficult as they require accurate jumps, reactions, and knowledge to overcome. You will die probably a minimum of three time per boss. The later ones will cause slightly more headaches as the patterns have surprises added in. The game is difficult by no means and repeated attempts will probably result in victory.\n\nThe music is pretty good with some influence from Russian culture. The art is also quite pleasing to look at. My one gripe about the game is that navigating up the tower you are climbing to collect batteries you have missed is a huge pain. At the end of the game, you are required to have at a minimum of 15 batteries so for those who wish to avoid backtracking up a long climb I would recommend you collect 15 before the end of the game. The game also seems to use an excessive amount of power for what is present in the game. I'm not sure if it is the Unity engine or bad coding practices but my processor was certainly doing some work running this despite being a fairly good processor.\n\nI would recommend you buy the game and give it a run through if you enjoy puzzle games somewhat akin to portal levels of thinking and thrilling boss fights. I'm sure the game would be much longer than the three hours I spent on it if I actually made an active attempt to find all the batteries. Running through the game took me about 3 hours with some time spent backtracking for the 15 batteries.","January 19","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were a few weak points with some of the bosses and the final puzzles needed to 100% the game  being a bit tricky, but none of it was impossible. solid mechanics and a Metroidvania-like navigation system lend themselves really well to this game. A solid 8/10, for me, at least.","June 2","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is a puzzle-oriented and jump-based platformer, it would be ok if it weren't for the fact that the game is very non-linear (meaning you often have to back-track around the tower to find a way to progress), with basically no save slots, and in certain spots one wrong jump means you'll waste like ten minutes of gameplay or more. Much hassle to figure out how to get past a certain jumping section, then one wrong jump... and after an endless fall you end up in a room you visited half a hour before. If you at least died for falling from high heights and could repeat the last jump, but no... you'll have to make that half-a-hour trek again. Only if you are a very perseverant fellow and like this kind of games.","June 4","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
