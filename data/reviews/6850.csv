Be prepared to wait for good whiles to learn guard routes or for your target to be in the perfect spot; be prepared to reload often (if you're a perfectionist) when things didn't go as planned, or quickly adapt to your new situation.\nSo, overall, if you enjoy the thought of being the unseen angel of death that puts Altair and Ezio to shame, or if you played and enjoyed any of the other Hitman titles (and for some reason don't already have this one), this is a definite must-have.","December 28, 2013","true","7.1"," 83 of 86 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","83","86","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FloydTheWolf/recommended/6850/","FloydTheWolf","Floyd!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FloydTheWolf/","323 products in account","As my first experience with that genre, the Hitman series turned me into a stealth lover.\n\nI still remember back when I was in college, I borrowed  Hitman : Codename 47 from a close friend of mine. He told me : "It's an amazing game! It's non-linear, and you can choose the way you want to complete your objectives and kill your targets! For instance, there is that mission in which you can disguise as a waiter and poison the food."\n\n(And when I tried that very mission a few days later, I would just end up on the roof, and snipe the target from a little concealed window, because screw the poisonned food : Hiding on the roof like a coward was the way I did it, and it worked.)\n\nThis game was so much fun! I spent my evenings on it, struggling with the hardest missions, but enjoying beating them nonetheless. Eh. killing a drug lord with a minigun has its own benefits. Two weeks later, I gave the game back to my friend and said "Boy, it was epic."\n\nYou will easily understand how excited I was when he told me they did a sequel called Silent Assassin! The fangirl in me HAD to try this.\n\nBesides, I'd like to thank my friend Liam sooo much for gifting me the whole Hitman collection for Christmas 2012. Liam when you read this, you're awesome and I love you.\n\nI then got the opportunity to try the second game, which improved a lot from the first. More freedom, an incredible amount of missions, and a really clever plot! It's a must-have for all Stealth lovers around here, and some of the best Hitman missions are to be found in that second episode.\n\nI mean, you can even murder evil twins, one of them eating crisps and pizzas in the basement of a Malaysian airport, the other relaxing in his jacuzzi at the top of a highly guarded skyscraper. How crazy is that?\n\nThen Blood Money followed, and I was curious for the fact everyone recommended that game over the two previous ones. Graphically, it was a stunning improvement. But the gameplay was a lot deeper : body hiding, weapon customisation, beverage poisoning, etc... Blood Money is the core of all good stealth mechanics. And those custom newspaper articles at the end of each mission are hilarious!\nBlood Money is worth gold, and I really recommend your to play it at least once in your life.\n\nI finally acquired Contracts when it released on Steam, as known as Silent Assassin's spiritual sequel, which subtly links the events from the original game, with a certain chapter found in Blood Money's cutscenes.\n\nApart from Contracts being a much darker game than the others - although it fits the plot perfectly -, it's an awesome addition to the series.\nHalf of the missions are remakes of the memorable ones from Codename 47; and I do not allude to the "cheap" remakes based on graphical improvements. No, those missions had be redesigned completely, the objectives are the same, but the layout of the maps and the buildings have changed, and there's even more places to explore, and exciting ways to finish your job successfully.\n\nWell, I could talk about Hitman for hours, or relate my funniest anecdotes, but the best you could do for now, is try by yourself and take control of the well-known Agent 47 for the best assignments of your life.","September 10, 2014","true","35.9"," 76 of 79 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","76","79","5","0"

I think this game was the fruition of the stealth/action genre, and its effective implementation have inspired dozens of other games, including Assasin's Creed. Hitman 2 is my favorite, not because it's the best, but because it was one of the first PC games I fell in love with. The atmospheric mood, soundtrack, and art stylization really drew me in and have greatly influenced what I look for in the medium. While the gameplay has dated, the effective combination of other aspects have kept it consistently in my top 20, even a decade later.\n\nGameplay: 5\nIn a post Assasin's Creed world, it has definitely dated.  At the time, however, the controls and AI were stellar.\n\nStory: 6\nNothing revolutionary, but it serves to draw together the wide variety of locations presented in the game.\n\nArt: 9\nThe mood and atmospheres are incredible. No other game at the time captured the diversity of worlds so well with so little graphically, justifying literally hundreds of hours of slow sneaking - without ever feeling dry or boring.  This combined with the music makes it a classic.\n\nMusic: 9\nJesper Kyd is a master. At a time when most games featured popish midi synth, he had his soundtrack was performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra.\n\nShould you play this?\nIf you haven't played this before, you likely won't be impressed. But if you like classic games and want to see a bit of history, enjoy it for the fantastic environmental moods the game creators were able to capture. For those of you who enjoyed it 10 years ago, you'll appreciate a replay.","January 1, 2014","true","53.8"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","5"

Fans would highly recommend it as it is the better of the two chapters on the history of Agent 47 while those new to the saga recommend you try it, maybe at your neighborhood store, to see if the setting menus and commands may be to their liking. If you allow me, a final warning: do not be discouraged, this is a title designed to be extremely difficult, at times slightly frustrating (spend three afternoons trying to accomplish a mission may also get tired!)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAuthenticGoldenTrump/recommended/6850/","TheAuthenticGoldenTrump","General Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAuthenticGoldenTrump/","705 products in account","Basic Information\nTitle: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\nGenre: Action\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nPublisher: Square Enix\nRelease Date: 1 Oct, 2002\n\nGeneral Impression\nHitman 2: Silent Assassin is a stealth game, made especially for people who can keep silent. The graphics for the year 2002 are wonderful, the soundtracks are very enjoyable, the atmosphere varies from tunnels, buildings, cities and even more areas, also the countries vary, such as Russia, India, Sicily, etc. The gameplay is pretty much just to kill enemies, you have a lot of guns to choose from, such as pistols, shotguns, rifles, grenades and even melee guns, such as katanas, knifes, swords, etc. You can even get your enemy asleep for a period of time, with anesthetics. The story is about a Hitman who retired as a yard keeper, until the priest of the church got kidnapped by a Russian mob. He has to accomplish some tasks for his agent, Diana. After he accomplishes them all, he will have to fight through the church to kill the Russian mob and liberate the priest.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are wonderful for the year 2002, a big improvement from the game Hitman: Codename 47. They are well optimized, and they are wonderful even on budget computers. They are set in natural destinations (such as Japanese mountains), where we may see snow, trees, rocks, etc. well designed. The guns seem to be well designed, as well as the sky, the buildings, in the city destinations. Even in tunnels, the graphics are still well optimized, not dark.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe atmosphere varies from countries such as Russia, Italy, Japan, Afghanistan, India, Sicily and Germany. This game has many areas, such as subways, sewers, palaces, mansions, mountains, cities, deserts, etc. The variety of areas makes this game complex, proving that the developers had a lot of inspiration and were able to create a complex game. The weather varies from area and country, such as Afghanistan (desert) where it's sunny, or Russia (city) where it's snowy, etc.\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack of this game were composed by Jesper Kyd, a well-known composer for video games and movies. They tend to change often, such as if you have alerted the enemy, a shocky and dynamic music will play. If you are just making your way through, a calm music would play. The sounds of guns are pretty good, also the door closings and openings are realistic. We may also find weather sounds, such as raining or snowing. When you walk on snow, your walking will start  becoming noisy. Also, explosions are well designed to be pretty realistic.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is about a hitman who accomplishes tasks, such as planting bombs, killing important targets, eliminating all hostiles, introducing poison in an enemy, liberating characters, etc. In this game, you can not drive cars, which is a disadvantage, in my opinion. Hitman can kill the enemies in many ways, such as shooting him, punching him to death, killing him with a grenade, backstabbing him, or simply make him sleeping for a while. The enemies tend to firstly search for Hitman before killing him. If you give any clues to the enemy, such as a dead body or a wrong movement, they will be alerted. If they see you, they will start firing at you. The game has a lot of ranks, from Silent Assassin to Mass Murder. By making Silent Assassin, you will unlock better guns.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a retired hitman called "47" due to the code which was imprinted on the back of his neck "110706040147". After his retirement, he got a job as a yard keeper at a church in Sicily. In a day, the priest of the church has been kidnapped by a Russian mob. Hitman has the task to do his agent's favors in order to know where the priest has been kidnapped. He has to fight through many areas and countries, killing important people, such as Generals, business men, etc. The game has 20 missions, each one of them taking less than an hour to complete (depending on the difficulty and on the style you want to play with).\n\nEngines\nThe engines on this game are well optimized, I haven't met any bugs or crashes, neither screen freezes. The people's movements are realistic, starting from walking calm to running due to being alerted. The sky does not move, however, the snowflakes fall unlimitedly. The railings are also falling forever. In the cities there are a few cars moving normal. The water through the sewers can be well seen while it's flowing. In the desert, the dust can be well seen while the wind takes it through the air, among many other engines. This game can be played even on low performance computers, which give it a huge advantage.\n\nStrong Points\nPretty nice graphics\nNo bugs or crashes\nGood soundtracks\nAwesome voice acting\nOptimized engine\nProperly made AI\nMany environments and areas\nMany ways to complete missions\nMany weapons to choose from\nBeautiful ending\nWeak Points\nVery hard to complete SA rank\nEnemy snipers are too powerful\nNo multiplayer option\nNo displayed minimap\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 10/10\nEngines: 8.5/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 9.08/10\n\nNote: All ratings are being given in function of the game's releasing year.","March 4","true","17.5"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","40","43","6","11"

And what do the good sequels do? Fix what's broken, evolve what's working. And Silent Assassin does that...kinda. Unfortunately, not always right. The overall structure of the game remained the same - you have a map where you need to do something, preferably unnoticed, and then, usually, leave the area. But how you do it is slightly different. First of all, and that is important for more... kind, i guess, players like me, - you can knock out enemies with a chloroform instead of killing them. This also means, that now you can knock out innocent people in the area and use their clothes almost without any consequences. Almost, because knocked out people do regain consciousness (quicker on higher difficulty), and because there is a new meter. Yes, starting with this game there is a "suspicion" meter in play. And it's rather stupid, unfortunately. When you are seen by enemy/guard-type characters, their "suspicion" goes up. It's universal for the map and it can only be slightly changed by what you are wearing at the moment. But it didn't work as well as in later installments, with lots of smaller "if"s in play, where enemy/guard character could truly be described as "suspicious" and not "crazy and paranoid" and willing to shoot a hotel visitor just because he made a wrong turn (and yes, this can happen). What's also sad, is that the infamous jungle chapters from Codename 47, are here as well, only now you're in snowy Japan. Why would developers want to leave this kind of section in the game is still something i don't understand. But it's a solid game. Not yet as refined as Contracts and Blood Money, but not as raw and hardcore-ish as Codename 47. Definitely worth the play. P.S. Jesper Kyd's music is amazing as always. P.P.S. You can now save in the game, if that put you off in Codename 47. Amount of saves depends on the difficulty level. P.P.P.S. The game is ridiculous to play if you speak russian. Russian stereotypes in this game are amazingly funny. Game even starts with a very harsh russian profanity, it's the first thing you hear when you start the game.","December 24, 2014","true","32.4"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","36","42","5","6"

IO Interactive took the basic idea of Codename 47 and made it ten times better when they made Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. You'll be blown away from the main menu screen to the end credits. At the time I had never played a game that was so open-ended. You're pretty much thrown into a map, told to kill a guy, and it's up to you to figure out how you're going to do it.\n\nI had seen this game in a store but originally passed on it.

The original Hitman was a true classic and any follow up to that would have to be something extraordinary in order to meet the expectations.\n\nAs Silent Assassin starts out 47 has retired and now lives a quiet life, tending the gardens in a Sicilian monastery. This all changes rather dramatically of course as your friend and mentor is kidnapped and you are forced to once again, take on the role of a professional hitman.\n\nThe story in general leaves much to be desired and the extremely subpar voice acting does not to help it. The grating sound of foreign accents that might as well have all been done by the same American voice actor often takes you out of the game and it is a shame that the developers couldn't have sprung for a couple of authentic sounds along the way. The high quality soundtrack and some passable ambiance makes up for some of this shortfall but not all of it unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of gameplay nothing much has changed. You travel from mission to mission, picking your starting gear and then going about killing a preset target in whichever manner you find to be the most efficient. Silent Assassin introduces a new rating system at the end of each mission that rewards you based on performance. Unfortunately the highest rating you can receive is usually only given out for executing a mission in a very specific way and this makes it very counterintuitive to the otherwise very open-ended missions.\n\nThe mission areas are much bigger this time around and while this sometimes allow for more creative thinking in solving the missions it also tends to slow down the game's pace, particularly in missions where running might attract the attention of nearby guards.\n\nThe developers seems to have paid attention to some of the fan feedback of the original and Silent Assassin has now been given a save game system. Depending on your difficulty level you are given a certain number of saves each mission and while this is still a far cry from what really should be standard in PC games it is also a huge leap forwards from the complete lack of in-mission saves in the original. A number of new camera angles are also available to you at popular request.\n\nGraphically Hitman is still a beautiful game, not quite as big of a step forward as one might have wanted, looking at what else is out there, but still good enough that it adds to the experience rather than detract from it.\n\nAll in all Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is a good game, even a good sequel, but in many ways it is also a bit of a letdown. It doesn't do much to advance the franchise instead sticking with what worked in the original and mostly rehashing what was already there. If you liked the original Hitman then you are going to like Silent Assassin. Just don't expect it to do anything new or exciting.","June 3, 2013","true","30.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

Both due to the impressive new control scheme Hitman 2 boasts as well as it's theming.\n\nThe premise is after the events of the previous game. 47 decides to live out the rest of his life as a priest. However adventure calls back to him and he gradually stumbles upon an epic plot of religious significance. The soundtrack is simply sublime and is full of dark moody opera music. It's as if your a religious plague set upon the legions of man.\n\nAdd to that the series staple ranking system was introduced with this game. Unlike in the previous game you are not required to kill anyone except your target, and the game ranks you based on how well you complete a mission. The titular "Silent Assassin" being granted for perfectly completing a mission. Don't expect it to be easy though.","October 18, 2013","true","4.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

There are also multiple ways to finish most levels, which is neat. It also fixes a lot of the issues from the 1st game, like having better AI intelligence (1st game's AI was way too difficult, I often got killed for no reason, not to mention the fact that they have pixel-perfect accuracy since I never stood a chance against them in a gunfight). However, the AI is still too smart, in that sometimes even though I'm disguised I still get shot for reasons unknown to me, and more often, I get killed when I venture into areas I didn't know is restricted. There should be a warning system where, if you trespass, you get a warning, not shot to death.

So basically he's getting back to the killing business in order to save his friend.\n\nFor its time the game looks pretty neat, with good character design, decent textures, realistic and big maps for a lot of exploration. Same goes for the animations and sounds, not to mention the music. Its gameplay is a little more challenging than newer Hitman games and it's pretty hard to achieve the rank "Silent Assassin", especially in the harder difficulties (part of me believes that it's also the reason they decided to give the name Silent Assassin to this one). However if you do you get rewarded with unlockable weapons. Yes, you don't have to pay DLC for new weapons but to actually be good at the game. Then again there are multiple ways you can beat a mission so the stealth aspect could be considered optional. If you're mostly into the story and want to progress to save Vittorio, you can always go out guns blazing. So I highly recommend this game to everyone, whether you like stealth or not it's a great game that will keep you busy for a lot of hours.","December 19, 2015","true","29.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

However, that does not make the game easier, as the AI in this game are capable of seeing through your disguise if you even act one bit suspicious (and some of them are even capable of seeing it from far away, as the ninja's from the Japan level can attest. Dem Psychic ninja). This makes sure that the game can be intense as well as satisfying when you do manage to beat the level with Silent Assassin rating.\n\nThis game also allows one to take multiple way to eliminate 47's targets.

This game brings you into the world of Legendary Assassin Agent 47 who comes out of retirement and is plunged into the criminal underworld as the ulimate assassin all with you at the controls. The gameplay in this game is obviously quite dated by the standards of games today but in my opinion you should not let that deter you from buying or playing this game because the controls still feel great and are easy to learn and memorize.\n\nThis game possess great variety in the methods to which you conduct your assassination attempts throughout the various levels. The great thing about the Hitman series is that the game gives you alot of freedom in how your aproach it you are in no way stuck to a linear setup in the levels and as such this game grants you a great deal of replayability as you can choose to play the same missions many times but go about them in very different ways ranging from the coveted Silent Assassin rank or to other more brutal and straightfoward methods. In addition to this you can take lots of different routs and use different tools and scenario's to perform your hits.\n\nWith an exception level count of 20 missions which is the most in any Hitman game you will be playing this game for a considerable time even following a guide on how to go through this game still grants up to 15 hours play for just 1 playthrough but you could decide to take your time and study each map and try all the different methods which would great you up to 25 hours plus and that is just one playthrough you can do it a totally different way in another playtrhough.\n\nNow this game is not perfect and there are a few negatives such as glitches that can imped you from getting the best rank in some levels but they dont always happen so they are not to bad and also the AI can be quite finicky and strange at times which can be frustrating but once you learn the pattens of this its really not a huge issue at all.\n\nOn another note i should bring up the outstanding soundtrack by composer Jesper Kyd who quite simply creates an amazing soundtrack for this game which so wonderfully helps to immerse you in this very fun game to my way of thinking soundtracks and game atmosphere are very important to a successful and enjoyable game experience and this game delivers that with flying colors. All in all i would highly recommend this game for those who are thinking about it its a true classic it may be old but it is excellent and still holds up well in todays gaming if you ask me you have to really think about what you are doing and there is alot of variety to keep it fresh i give it a solid 7.5/10","January 12","true","14.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Ever since its release in 2002, the game has been received as a game that has a huge number of opportunities and ways to get your mission done. The storyline is not the absolute best, but it does not need to be. The game includes a very big amount of weapons and very distinctive, extensive level-design, that makes every level a big thinking exercise. Be wary of blood and gore though; if you're not a big fan of killing in a realistic way, this game might just shock you.

Having escaped the clutches of his evil father in the first game and found his inner peace he is once again thrust back into the world of hitmen for hire when his new best friend and mentor is kidnapped by the mafia. Going on a one man rampage may be the only way to save father Vittorio and restore his peace once more.\n\nSound like an action packed adventure? Well there is a reason for that. This game takes everything the first game did and improves it, more action, more espionage and more awesome. And unlike the first game the enemies aren’t all psychic, just most of them. So while stealth is completely possible in this game and super gratifying to pull off it can still be frustrating. That being said the full rampage mode is great, a huge variety of guns on offer and each can be taken into any mission and used to rain death down upon your enemies. Rag doll bad guys and high caliber weapons are the best mix.\n\nThis game is a classic and well worth your time. Pick it up if you love stealth or action and you will have fun for sure.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","April 7","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Now lets go to the good parts.\n\n- Lots of nostalgia are guaranteed from this game if you already played it years ago.\n- Very well designed for a 2002 game.\n- Cool story mode.\n- Beautifull soundtrack.\n- You are a assassin who is killing people for money, and you have to do your job undetected.\n\nThere are way more pros on this game, but I would take very long to describe all of them.

One day your friend get's kidnapped by the Italian Mafia, which is payd by a Russian General, who want's to kill some guys in third world countries... and Japan (makes sense, because all countries that aren't the USA are the same). Our protagonists then quickly changes his profession from harvesting tomatoes to performing high class hits on international Warlords, Gunrunners and terrorists in exciting locations such as an office building that has only two offices in it, a hospital, that people are not allowed to enter (the hospital obviously doesn't lack hospitality) and a ♥♥♥♥ing tunnel somewhere in Afghanistan. Conveniently enough all these hits are ordered by the guy, who kidnapped your friend. So this guy will have to die too... and your brother... because why not. As you can already tell the story is amazing and totally not a reskin of the first game, but what is the gameplay like? Well, first of all the game glitches out, when you play in windowed mode, to ensure, that you're enjoying the gameplay on your whole screen. Then the devs also ensured, that the player has complete freedom of interaction with the world. Getting shot, getting shot again and getting shot are only a few possibilites, that the player can experience. It is also needless to say, that the game is not buggy and that things like map glitching and sliding don't exist. Overall "IO-Not Interactive with our fans" has provided an amazing game with lots of fun to be had.\n\n2/10","December 20, 2015","true","79.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","3"

Maybe even more than Blood Money. The various reasons include the continued use of a mission based system, where Agent 47 has his hub at the church and doesn't come back until a number of missions later when he's finished at a location from around the world.\n\nAnd the story is really strong here. Agent 47 is set to find his friend and guide, Father Vittorio, whom is taken hostage very early in the game. So 47 comes out of retirement and works with the ICA again, for their resources, in hopes that he can find out who took his friend hostage and where they're located. As per usual, the agency has 47 take contracts from around the world. 47 visits Palermo, Sicily in Italy. Various buildings in St. Petersburg. Mountainous Japan. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The little village of Nuristan, Afghanistan and a military base outside of it. And Temple City India. I have to commend IO Interactive for constantly choosing interesting and different locations for the missions.\n\nThe missions range in difficulty. Some, I felt I had no choice, but to "Rambo" my way through (mainly the Japan levels where the ninjas magically see through your ninja outfit from fifty yards away). The rest are do-able, as there are many ways to go about fulfilling your contract. The last level is a big shootout. But all in all, great stealth game the outdoes the first game by...a lot. Blending in isn't always easy, but you also have to consider which outfits work better for a bald/white man.\n\nMusic by Jesper Kyd, as always, is amazing. The audio and dialog throughout the game have great levels, so no complaints there. The graphics are so-so. I'll give it the benefit of age, it is over a decade now and with a 1920x1080 fix, it actually looks pretty good. Level designs are sometimes small where you don't have to go far to finish the job, the at least they're open.\n\nGreat game though, absolutely loved the development of 47 from the first game.\n\n9.3/10","March 17, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hitman 2 will give you a big challenge requires your mind to think of what to do next to avoid the challenge that is ahead of you. It will take many resets and saves to understand the mistakes you have taken. If you are starting out the Hitman series and looking for one to play for fun and understand how the game works, I recommend this game as it will start you off with challenges.

(✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FigureofOptimism/","336 products in account","A classic in every sense of the word. Originally released on the Super Nintendo by Mojang, Hitman 2 has seen many variations over the years. I'm happy to report that this is the definitive version, graphics rendered in beautiful 9000p resolution, breathtaking vistas running at an amazing 1500 fps, WOW. They've truly outdone themselves with this port.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar to the Hitman franchise, you play as Agent 3.14159265358979323846264338327950 or Agent Pi for short. In your daily life as an assassin of the silent variety, you must take out high value targets while keeping a stable family. Be warned, this is not a game for the casual gamer. The game is a unique blend of a golf simulator, a Sims game and a first person shooter. When you start out, you will find yourself failing. A lot. You'll either mess up a hit and find your family murdered when you come home (Funnily enough, this scenario actually has a whole spin off dedicated to it known as Max Payne, I might review that some day) or you'll complete all of your hits but neglect personal needs and die of starvation. If you can get past the learning curve, you'll find a rich and rewarding experience full of many twists and turns. In my playthrough, my third born son, Alexander IV was diagnosed with lukemia. I had to spend all of the money I acquired from hits to pay for his medication and neglect my own needs for the highest quality cocaine. Yes, this game often requires you to make the difficult decisions such as : My wife is draining my wallet dry but she cuts the time it takes for me to disguise in half, should I really get rid of her?\n\nAll in all, this truly is a great game in every sense of the word. 1/10.","July 5, 2014","true","8.0"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","4"

Running is highly illegal but you walk/sneak/crouch so slowly it's like you're a 90 year old who lost their walker, which makes navigating the levels very, very tedious at times. Using silenced guns makes the game more like Star Wars with how slowly the bullets travel (Ninja tunnel level is most obvious). The AI are super touchy even without running, most interactions with guard AI result in either the guard dying or the alarm being raised and you restart or kill the whole level. This is on the easiest difficulty mind you. I got similar results in Blood Money, but that was on PROFESSIONAL for god's sake. Even then the AI was still more chilled, at least you can run without being immediately shot dead.\nOne other thing that is driving me insane is this bug I keep getting, sometimes the game slows down a LOT in certain places, like I just get stuck or something.\nPeople say they love this game, it's the best, fanboi the hell out of it but I must be missing something.","February 2, 2014","false","12.2"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","14","31","2","6"

Sadly, this is not true. Silent Assassin has terrible level design for a stealth based game. The first mission started me out pretty far away from the place I had to get to, and there wasn't many options to get inside. At first, I tried to kill a mailman, get his clothes and his flowers for someone...I have no idea who, because the guards opened fire right when I went up to them.\n\nThat's another problem, the AI. Guards are either ridiculously smart (up to the point where it just...insane, I don't know how else to put it. They are like gods.), or incredibly stupid (once, I was moving into an area, the guard pulled out his gun, started shooting, I went downstairs and was standing there, the guard comes down, he looks around like he was searching, looks right at me, and puts his gun away and goes back).\n\nAgain, the level design is not even designed for stealth. It's more like...well, it reminded me of Goldeneye, but in 3rd person. After mission two, where getting upstairs is literally impossible without getting caught and murdering everyone, I decided to go rambo and just finish the game. The next few missions seemed EXACTLY like Goldeneye. You had your sniper, the areas were open and very large (still no stealth factors, here), and I just basically shot everyone down that got in my way.\n\nHitman is not supposed to be this way.","February 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","8","20","3","6"

One of the best stealth games to ever be released. Its very fun killing people in different ways, taking their clothes and disguising yourself, and finiding a different path through the level each playthrough. Very fun, Challenging, and has plenty of replayability... However, the value of this game is exremely degraded by the PC version. Maybe its just me and i should re download it, but one big problem is that it cuts about 1 in 3 cutscenes short on its own, without me pressing any buttons. This could of curse be due to damaged files in my download, but its worth mentioning. The biggest issue i noticed, is that the mouse sensitivity is absolutely insane. turning it on the maximum setting is STILL below normal on a regular game. And you pretty much have to turn it up to max to make it bearable. But then as soon as you pause the game or attempt to do anything in the menu, well lets just say good luch clicking stuff as your mouse flies across the screen at lightning speed. No clue if this is fixed by using a controller. This is still very much a good game, and i got it for i think $0.99 on a sale? this version of the game is very much worth picking up if you see it on sale. 5/10 for these issues. the original version from PS2: 8.5/10. If you can find a way to fix thee issues, id reccomend this game. If not, dont pick it up for anything more then $2.99.\n\n-Edit: i fixed almost every issue i had with this game. except the mouse sensitivity. i get that its to aim better since theres no ADS but good♥♥♥♥ is it annoying. playing around with console commands i had a little fun. enough to raise it up to a 6.5/10 for thr pc version. however i still cant recommend it because its $7 normally. i got it on sale for $0.99 or less. this version isnt worth more than $5. IF youre trying the whole franchise or a die hard fan then pick this up. otherwise im gonna tell you what everyone else in the negative sections says: pick up the superior blood money over this if you have $7 to spare, and youre interested in a stealth game or hitman game.","January 7","false","5.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Go look for the demo online before you purchase this game as everyone makes it sound awesome but I have had the worst experience with it so far. In Blood Money it was possible to get Silent Assassin in every mission without a guide but in this game you might need a guide just to avoid killing everyone in the level. Check out the demo first, you have been warned.","January 24, 2014","false","4.4"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","8","24","0","1"

You can actually be creative about doing some of the missions, but there are still plenty of cases where there seems to only be one route to finish the level, and its just a matter of you executing it. It's not as bad as it was in the first game, but your ability to improvise is still limited.\n\nAnd there are new problems to face. Without the ability to (permanently) hide bodies or to have a briefcase to carry sniper rifles, you can get caught quite easily. A level early in the game where I got to use a sniper rifle to kill a target in a meeting was neat, but as soon as I picked up the rifle civilans freaked out and I had to kill them and some guards and take their clothes before continuing on to the target. If I had that rifle in a case so people didn't see it out in the open, I probably could have killed the target and nobody else. At least you don't get into gunfights as often, though if a body of someone you killed is found, expect to be spotted and attacked quite quickly.\n\nThe developers learned from the first game, but this game still has its issues. For that, I can't give it a "yes" recommendation. But it is a better made assassin game that you can actually have some fun with. However, I still believe that Blood Money is what you really ought to be playing if you want to play a Hitman game.","June 19, 2014","false","2.8"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","5"

I hate it so much. #MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, STOP CRYING#\n\nAfter buying the collection for 85% or so off and buying Contracts I wanted to play through the whole series.\nBut Hitman 2 just made it so hard. You can't run, disguises are practically useless (you get shot at even with clothes that completely cover your body, which doesn't make sense) and sooner or later one just ends up killing everyone just because\nthe game pees one off completely. The plot istn't that great (at some place in the story they just say "F**k Vittorio" just to pull him out of the ars€ again), nope, even that is sh!te. The first two, three levels are somewhat fun, although you figure out the best way so quickly for them, but the rest are just ars€ levels. The only reason I beat the game was because I needed that feeling of completion.\n\nTo make it clear, I like Hitman games, and I liked the first one, so the game being dated is not the problem. This game just plain sucks. Unless you are interested in the plot (which is, again, ars€), skip it and play any other game from the series.","February 11, 2014","false","13.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

This game is hands down in my top three most satisfying titles to have beaten vanilla, no cheats etc. I'm not even sure if there are cheats for this anyways.\n\nThis is a game for someone who actually has to think, plan, and fail and test their own patience. So if you're like I was when I was 14 and you quit playing Half-Life 1 for a month because you don't notice the switch next to an elevator, this game will make you throw kittens off a 3rd story balcony by the time you get to the second level.\n\nBesides that, this game can be a little wierd at times if you just walk in the place guns blazing. Sometimes guns send bodies hurling around like they're paper weights. However, there's nothing more satisfying than a clean kill with the disguised walk back where everyone's like WTF just happened?\n\nThere's multiple routes to solve problems, each level presenting options to completely master the art of assasination or completely butcher any sense of elegance and go from a perfect execution to a "F*ck it, you're all dead and I'm done with this level." Mindset, if of course you're close enough to your exit.\n\nFor it's time, this game goes down in my book as a masterpiece. I've beaten at least twice already and I bought it on steam because I know its going to take me months to beat all over again. There's times where I play a level once and don't play the game for a few days or a week. There's times I spend three hours failing at one level. But damn, does it feel good when you nail this SOB.\n\nIf you have patience and a desire for a strategic challenge that's well rounded and extremely satisfying, get this game. It's worth every penny and will have you longing for more even after you've beaten it. Awesome replay value in my opinion.

It was in 2006, more than 3 years after it has been released, I still got very addicted. Later, I play every hitman games, and even pre-purchased absolution, and I must say that "hitman 2: Silent Assassin" is the most revolutionary, the most intense, deepest, and thus the most successful game of the series. It corrects most of the mistakes that the first hitman "codename 47" has, and adds a lot of successful features such as the diversity approach to complete the mission, the alert system that enalbes the enemy to notice you even after you change your cloth(in hitman: codename 47 as long as you change the cloth, you wouldn't be noticed by enemy), and these features shine through hitman 3 "contracts" and 4 "blood money". Therefore, this game is also the foundation of successful the sequels, especially blood money. Plus, the visual effect is amazing back in 2002, and the music delivers more richer atmosphere to the game that it really makes the play get into the game, get into the world of 47. Unfortunately, absolution somehow throws out some very essential features. I hope IO and its new parent company Square Enix would fix it and combine the best of old hitman(1-4) and absolution to make the 6th hitman game much better!","March 23, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are vast and extremely open ended with more than one way to take out your target. You could play the same mission differently a dozen times.

The game starts where your in a church helping your friend which starts the game of when he gets kidnapped and brings 47 back to his old friend dianna from the agency where you follow ot contracts in order to recieve information about your friend.

Hitman 2 takes the social stealth element introduced by the first game to the next level - enemies who are familiar with a particular disguise are capable of seeing through it if you get too close to them or behave suspiciously, making your choice of disguise tactical. This makes levels far more tense and tactically complex, requiring more thought and planning on the part of the player to carry out hits in a clean way. The game also emphasizes cleanliness more - you get an end-of-mission rating that breaks down your activity, and if you get a perfect score (Silent assassin), you can get bonus weapons for use down the line. Whereas Codename 47 had several levels that encouraged combat on the part of the player, Silent Assassin has pushed the series far more clearly towards stealth and subtlety - and when the bullets do start flying, it's far more satisfying this time around. This game is still somewhat frustrating, but not nearly as much as the original - it's more polished in nearly every way, and the story is presented in a distinctly movie-like fashion, which suits it perfectly. Like it's predecessor, this game has a lot going on for those willing to put up with the occasional bad level or frustration - but not nearly as much as before. Also, this time there are mid-mission saves.","December 24, 2012","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are vast and extremely open ended with more than one way to take out your target. You could play the same mission differently a dozen times.

Hitman 2 : Silent Assassin has an easy-to-follow storyline and great level design. Not only that, the game allows you to complete levels however you want to. You could either blast away enemies while completing objectives or try to be sneaky by killing less people before you get to your assassination target.\n\nThere isn't too much missions in this game though. Only about 20-22 maybe and I was able to finish the entire game in less than 10 hours on my first try.

Hitman 2 takes the social stealth element introduced by the first game to the next level - enemies who are familiar with a particular disguise are capable of seeing through it if you get too close to them or behave suspiciously, making your choice of disguise tactical. This makes levels far more tense and tactically complex, requiring more thought and planning on the part of the player to carry out hits in a clean way. The game also emphasizes cleanliness more - you get an end-of-mission rating that breaks down your activity, and if you get a perfect score (Silent assassin), you can get bonus weapons for use down the line. Whereas Codename 47 had several levels that encouraged combat on the part of the player, Silent Assassin has pushed the series far more clearly towards stealth and subtlety - and when the bullets do start flying, it's far more satisfying this time around. This game is still somewhat frustrating, but not nearly as much as the original - it's more polished in nearly every way, and the story is presented in a distinctly movie-like fashion, which suits it perfectly. Like it's predecessor, this game has a lot going on for those willing to put up with the occasional bad level or frustration - but not nearly as much as before. Also, this time there are mid-mission saves.","December 24, 2012","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was in 2006, more than 3 years after it has been released, I still got very addicted. Later, I play every hitman games, and even pre-purchased absolution, and I must say that "hitman 2: Silent Assassin" is the most revolutionary, the most intense, deepest, and thus the most successful game of the series. It corrects most of the mistakes that the first hitman "codename 47" has, and adds a lot of successful features such as the diversity approach to complete the mission, the alert system that enalbes the enemy to notice you even after you change your cloth(in hitman: codename 47 as long as you change the cloth, you wouldn't be noticed by enemy), and these features shine through hitman 3 "contracts" and 4 "blood money". Therefore, this game is also the foundation of successful the sequels, especially blood money. Plus, the visual effect is amazing back in 2002, and the music delivers more richer atmosphere to the game that it really makes the play get into the game, get into the world of 47. Unfortunately, absolution somehow throws out some very essential features. I hope IO and its new parent company Square Enix would fix it and combine the best of old hitman(1-4) and absolution to make the 6th hitman game much better!","March 23, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are all about graphics and hate old games then go else where , but if you love the orignals of game series and you respect them for what they are then BUY THIS RIGHT NOW .

If you have heard this game is buggy its really not. It can be a bit on the funny side , but there are no bugs that make this title called buggy.

There's a lot of variety in the levels; some are small while others are large and complex, and between the varied locations and the game's engaging story, it's oh-so-satisfying to off each of the targets. Jesper Kyd, the composer for the game's soundtrack, is at his absolute best and makes every mission totally immersive, even with the game's dated visuals. Strongly recommended, but know what you're getting into; some parts of the game take patience, and aren't as easy as the sequels. Even still, it's a large step up from the original game.

This game is hands down in my top three most satisfying titles to have beaten vanilla, no cheats etc. I'm not even sure if there are cheats for this anyways.\n\nThis is a game for someone who actually has to think, plan, and fail and test their own patience. So if you're like I was when I was 14 and you quit playing Half-Life 1 for a month because you don't notice the switch next to an elevator, this game will make you throw kittens off a 3rd story balcony by the time you get to the second level.\n\nBesides that, this game can be a little wierd at times if you just walk in the place guns blazing. Sometimes guns send bodies hurling around like they're paper weights. However, there's nothing more satisfying than a clean kill with the disguised walk back where everyone's like WTF just happened?\n\nThere's multiple routes to solve problems, each level presenting options to completely master the art of assasination or completely butcher any sense of elegance and go from a perfect execution to a "F*ck it, you're all dead and I'm done with this level." Mindset, if of course you're close enough to your exit.\n\nFor it's time, this game goes down in my book as a masterpiece. I've beaten at least twice already and I bought it on steam because I know its going to take me months to beat all over again. There's times where I play a level once and don't play the game for a few days or a week. There's times I spend three hours failing at one level. But damn, does it feel good when you nail this SOB.\n\nIf you have patience and a desire for a strategic challenge that's well rounded and extremely satisfying, get this game. It's worth every penny and will have you longing for more even after you've beaten it. Awesome replay value in my opinion. Unless of course you're a walkthrough ♥♥♥♥♥.","January 5, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While Blood Money is technically better than SA, I think it's clear that SA is a little bit more inspired. The missions toward the last quarter of the game are each incredible in their own right. Jacuzzi Job should be in every Hitman game as a proof of concept for Hitman games. Excellent stealth, open environments to play around in Deus Ex: HR-like freedom but years earlier. At the end of the day there is wonky AI, hugely dated graphics, and some technical issues -- but the overwhelming joy and the number of stories that a tactical playthrough of this game gives you far outweighs any of that.","September 25, 2012","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only gripe with the game is the difficulty of it. In hitman codename 47, each mission was incredibly challenging even on regular difficulty. A couple of bullets and you were done for. In this game, normal difficulty is insanly easy. Some missions I could not sneak for a second and beat with ease. Your character has much more health and can take what seems like dozens of bullets before he dies. Therefore, if you want an experience similar to the original game, I recommend you play on one of the more challenging difficulties.","September 12, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I have played Contracts and I believe this game to be far superior. Although Contracts has the nostalgic factor of the first game, the plot is left widely unexplained, and you have to have played the original Codename 47 to get half of it. Also very many of the basic mechanics are simply broken to death and often result in rage. (*Cough* Beldingford Manor *Cough*)\n\nWhereas Hitman 2 pre-fixes that (pre-un-borks those issues?) and adds other elements which are kick-♥♥♥, like the soundtrack, the ability to choose which guns/gadgets to take into the missions, and practice with the guns...shooting birds in your hideout. Now that's some serious fun right there, just pull out your sniper and have some fun.\n\nBut on a serious note, next time this game comes on special, grab it, it's a great buy.","January 5, 2011","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Therefore, I won't be comparing the two games.\nNote 2: Just because a category is in a Good list, doesn't mean that it doesn't also have some Bad in it that I haven't mentioned (I hope I've mentioned everything).\n\nGood stuff\nAI - The AI is smart, and acts as you would expect, though they do seem to be rather trigger-happy when seeing 47 run (even if they have no good reason too).\nBugginess - Haven't run into any bugs (that I know of).\nLevel design - Most levels have an interesting scenario in which to assassinate your target. Otherwise, they're about reaching the exit. The levels I least enjoyed are the no-target ones set in Japan. I know that they're there to show how much power and how well-protected the target is, but at least make it so that you don't have your ID checked every 100 metres. Also, in some levels, it's impossible to get Silent Assassin a rating.\nLevel variation - The levels are nicely varied, ranging from infiltrating a mansion to infiltrating a castle, attending a party that your target is hosting to sniping your targets at a meeting.\nMechanics - You play as a contract-killer, and your only goal is to kill your target (except for some other goals). This means that you decide how you want to complete your goal, allowing for open-ended gameplay, the level being the playground in which you can tinker with. The game also lets you find disguises (found either lying around or on incapacitated NPCs), letting you into restricted areas that aren't available as a civilian, and to be allowed to carry weapons (that fir with the disguise). Being too close to another person in the same outfit (e.g. being close to a guard whilst wearing a guard disguise) will make them suspicious, causing them to follow you, and if more suspicious, shoot at you, blowing your disguise permanently.\nMusic - Great soundtrack, the different tracks that play in the different locations make for some great atmosphere.\nPerformance - Since the graphics are less demanding, the game plays very smoothly, even on a low-end machine.\nReplay value - There's another reason to want to replay levels, asides from just for fun or to try out new ways to take out your target. There's now a kind of base (I'm stretching the word here) to return to between missions, where you can collect and store weapons (which carry over between missions), or replay previous missions to get ones that you missed. You also get rewarded for completing a certain number of missions with the ranking 'Silent Assassin', which encourages stealth, though one of the rewards is a shotgun, so, uh, not very helpful sometimes.\nBad stuff\nStory - The story is not very good when playing the game, but is much more interesting to read about on the wiki (Maybe the story just flew over my head. I think it did, actually). Just a standard 'save your hostage friend from the bad guys', but ends with a nice sequel-hook. The cutscenes are pretty well-made, and thankfully, the story isn't at all intrusive.\nVisuals - The graphics haven't aged well, the player models very blocky looking.\nSummary:\nAn overall great game, let down only by its graphics, and maybe the story, but not that much, due to it being out of the way. Gameplay is fun and tense, and the open levels allow for a variety of methods to get to your target.","January 6","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To put it bluntly, this game excels in every area, except the AI department. Still, this only flaw doesn't really make itself noticed for most of the game; the only times where the enemy AI is a problem are the second and third mission of the Japanese chapter of the game, and that is only for players trying to achieve a high score - some may be put off from finishing the game because of them, but I highly recommend that you don't give up so easily. Anyway, now that the flaw(s) are out of the way, let's get to the good part. This game looked fantastic for it's time (not necessarily top-notch, but well above average), had a brilliant orchestral score (the same Jesper Kyd - the composer from the first game - is responsible again), a much-needed save system and also a new scoring system, which became a staple for the series ever since (depending on your performance on a level, the highest ranking you can achieve is Silent Assassin - this is where the game can be challenging, especially if you plan on collecting all weapons; also, the number of saves that are available depend on your difficulty setting - for the veterans, the only respectable option is the proffesional mode, which if I'm not mistaken doesn't allow any saves; the only exceptions are the bonus saves in some of the harder levels; oh, and did I mention that it makes the game harder by improving enemy AI?). I could go on forever explaining why I think this is one of the best games ever, but that wouldn't make for an entairtaining review now, would it? I'll only add that there's a ton of weapons to collect in this game (you can see them in your neat little shed), more missions than ever (this is by far the longest game in the franchise), more diversity than ever (this game takes 47 to Sicily, Russia, Japan, Malaysia, Afghanistan and India) and even the story is  lot more interesting this time around (although nothing can top Ortmeyer's speech from the first game). That's it. Now go and play this amazing game for yourself!","October 31, 2015","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But you can just go in there and shoot the place up (; you can choose how stealthy you want to be based on your tolerance levels but you may want to play through levels a bunch of times to make the most of them and learn the most fun strategies , a important thing to know is you only get 7 saves on normal and less on harder modes , this is because the game is really trying to turn you into a REAL hitman , you screw up you screw up, you don't have the amazing luck of reloading saves a min before, some players dislike this but give this game a chance , on sale it's only like the price of a starbucks xD and once you get into it's unquie and somehow realstic game play you'll want to play more hitmen games!, trust me..\n\nI myself admit only just been getting into hitman and blood money so far is my fav I highly recommend you get that one if you enjoy this one (=\n\nYou may have also played this game on ps2 by in the day!\n","March 7","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The limited times you can save during missions makes the game so intense. The ai is brutal in this game spotting you from a mile away it can feel unfair at times and the pace of the game is very slow because you cannot run while in disguise or you will be detected so a lot of patience is needed to play this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweatboyx8/recommended/6850/","sweatboyx8","SomewhatEgalitarian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweatboyx8/","34 products in account","Note: I haven't played Hitman: Codename 47, so I don't know how the game's improved. Therefore, I won't be comparing the two games.\nNote 2: Just because a category is in a Good list, doesn't mean that it doesn't also have some Bad in it that I haven't mentioned (I hope I've mentioned everything).\n\nGood stuff\nAI - The AI is smart, and acts as you would expect, though they do seem to be rather trigger-happy when seeing 47 run (even if they have no good reason too).\nBugginess - Haven't run into any bugs (that I know of).\nLevel design - Most levels have an interesting scenario in which to assassinate your target. Otherwise, they're about reaching the exit. The levels I least enjoyed are the no-target ones set in Japan. I know that they're there to show how much power and how well-protected the target is, but at least make it so that you don't have your ID checked every 100 metres. Also, in some levels, it's impossible to get Silent Assassin a rating.\nLevel variation - The levels are nicely varied, ranging from infiltrating a mansion to infiltrating a castle, attending a party that your target is hosting to sniping your targets at a meeting.\nMechanics - You play as a contract-killer, and your only goal is to kill your target (except for some other goals). This means that you decide how you want to complete your goal, allowing for open-ended gameplay, the level being the playground in which you can tinker with. The game also lets you find disguises (found either lying around or on incapacitated NPCs), letting you into restricted areas that aren't available as a civilian, and to be allowed to carry weapons (that fir with the disguise). Being too close to another person in the same outfit (e.g. being close to a guard whilst wearing a guard disguise) will make them suspicious, causing them to follow you, and if more suspicious, shoot at you, blowing your disguise permanently.\nMusic - Great soundtrack, the different tracks that play in the different locations make for some great atmosphere.\nPerformance - Since the graphics are less demanding, the game plays very smoothly, even on a low-end machine.\nReplay value - There's another reason to want to replay levels, asides from just for fun or to try out new ways to take out your target. There's now a kind of base (I'm stretching the word here) to return to between missions, where you can collect and store weapons (which carry over between missions), or replay previous missions to get ones that you missed. You also get rewarded for completing a certain number of missions with the ranking 'Silent Assassin', which encourages stealth, though one of the rewards is a shotgun, so, uh, not very helpful sometimes.\nBad stuff\nStory - The story is not very good when playing the game, but is much more interesting to read about on the wiki (Maybe the story just flew over my head. I think it did, actually). Just a standard 'save your hostage friend from the bad guys', but ends with a nice sequel-hook. The cutscenes are pretty well-made, and thankfully, the story isn't at all intrusive.\nVisuals - The graphics haven't aged well, the player models very blocky looking.\nSummary:\nAn overall great game, let down only by its graphics, and maybe the story, but not that much, due to it being out of the way. Gameplay is fun and tense, and the open levels allow for a variety of methods to get to your target.","January 6","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As Codename 47 was not well recieved at the time, and a pc only release.  The basic premise is try to infiltrate areas. Track your hit, figure how to take them down while attracting the least amount of attention.  Some levels are more open then others. The ones that are have numerous ways to to take out your target.\n\nThe graphics are far better then thier console counterparts, and the looks still pleasing for a game from 2002.\n\nThe controls are solid and was a real step up from numpad movement on Codename 47\n\nOchreastal scores are tense, the blending of moods and atmosphere makes every moment feel nerve wracking as you sneak up behind your target with your fiberwire pulled ready to pounce and drag your victim away to take his clothes.\n\nThe gameplay here was far more refined and stealth encouraged making every silent assasin rank thrilling to behold as you leave unheard and unseen.  This sheer joy is occasionally hampered by Japan and the middle east. These areas are hard and require tight timimg, This again does feed right back into the joy of firguring out what boils down to a multiple  choice puzzle.\n\nChanging disquises, posioning drinks, turning off the power, fake a fire, a deadly use of guns.  All as satisfying as they sound.\n\nIf you love stealth. This is a must have along with all the other titles, (excluding the newest one, and codename 47 as it is not as fleshed out from here on out.)\n\nThe only real issuies is jumpy AI that sometimes just goes bananas for no reason or stop their patrols and just stand somewhere you really need to go.\n\nAll in all. This was just a blip compared to what would culminate in blood money. A deadly good game.","March 26","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a 2002 game, it was ahead of its time.\n\nThe player gets to have control of a man who goes by the name "47."\nHe had worked as a hitman for quite some time after escaping an asylum in which he was born as an artificially made human clone, born and raised to be a killer for the wrong reasons.  He becomes accustomed to killing for the right reasons considering his targets wind up behind horrible people who do bad things.  However, his motivation seemed to be money and fulfilling his habit of professional stealth and murder.  But, he did eventually clear things up and manage to put an end to what was bad in the previous game.\n\n\nAt the start of the game, our once notorious protagonist is an ex-hitman seeking forgiveness working at a church somewhere in Sicily.  He befriends "Father Emilio Vittorio", who is eventually kidnapped.  The individuals who captured him leave a note demanding money from 47 in return for his priest friend.  47 is to then rejoin his employers at the "International Contract Agency (ICA)" and work with his handler Diana Burnwood.  Throughout the game, she gives the player a contract or hit to perform in exchange for the agency's attempts at finding Father Vittorio.  Within these levels, the player is to take control of 47 and take in really huge levels with plenty going on.  Not only is there a target (or targets) within the level, but there are probably guards, civilians, security cameras, et cetera.\n\nAfter realizing all this, the player must painstakingly calculate how he or she is going to get the job done and escape with as much precision and stealth as possible.  It is allowed to go in guns-blazing, however it can be pretty darn difficult, and it's not necessarily the ideal way to play the game.  If one were to play the game like it's normally supposed to be played by the means of stealth, there are rewards.  Such rewards happen to be new weapons that could be used to improve stealth abilities, or non-stealth abilities.  Every once in a while, 47 will wind up back at that church so that he could wait on another job by his work computer, or take a good look at all the weapons the player has unlocked throughout the game so far within the garden shed.  It is also important to know that 47 can take disguises on individuals that he either kills or knocks out, which is a feature in every Hitman game that is always fantastic.  It allows access to parts of the level that would be restricted otherwise.  But, if you're up for a silent assassin suit only challenge, be my guest.\n\nBy no means do each level feel the same or repetitive, for 47's job requires him to work on a global scale.  The excellent level design also helps make each level feel like something new and difficult.  And by difficult, I mean really difficult.\n\nEven though it is tough, there are many opportunities within each level for the player to improvise and figure out within every level, and it is well worth the time.  Such opportunities allow the player to pick and choose equipment before starting a level, as well as using things in the environment that can be found to assist in performing the hit.  That is awesome.\n\n---\n\nThe game isn't without its faults, though.  One thing that bothers me particularly are the possibilities of getting compromised and realized by enemies even when in a disguise.  It happens by the most dumb means possible...\nIf you were to run within a disguise (which is something players do in almost every game, because why would you want to be really slow...) you could be shot at.  And so, to avoid suspicion, you *must* walk when close to other non-played characters that happen to be guards or wearing the same clothes as you.  If you're in your original suit, you can run all you want.  But otherwise, nope.  And it does makes sense to get suspicion for it, but it doesn't make sense to be immediately shot for it.\n\nThankfully, every other Hitman game does not have this problem, and the idea of there being suspicion is done a lot better.  But it is something to think about and prepare for before playing this game.  You could preform a glitch where you can quickly switch between running and walking and not get shot at for it, but it really looks stupid and it kills the illusion that the game is not just a game, but something seemingly realistic.  This poorly designed mechanic is really annoying.  But, if you have the patience, it can be overlooked and the game could still be a lot of fun.\n\n\n\nThere is a notorious bad level in this game known as "Hidden Valley."  In this level, there is no target.  Which could have been okay if it were still fun and managable.  But it's not.  There is one disguise option.  If you get it, it still doesn't stop the difficulty of getting through.  It's not the fun difficult you'll get at every other time in the game.  No.  It's the stupid difficulty that only exists due to bad mechanics.  Every time a guard gets you in their sights, they run to you to check your "ID" or whatever, even though your face is completely covered up in a mask and you look just like one of them.  But for some reason, even though they could have literally run up the anybody else who looks the same and check their ID, they check yours.  I recommend getting through this misery as much as possible before you die of pain from trying to get a perfect "Silent Assassin" rating from completing it.  Ironically, there is no assassination in this level, making the idea of getting the Silent Assassin rating seem pointless.  Just get through it, and never play it again, unless you really want to, for some reason.  You might unlock a weapon from doing it, but you could probably find it and exit the level with it instead.  This is the worst level in the entire Hitman franchise, in my personal opinion.  Get it done.  Then move on.\n\nIt is really, really, bad.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that rubs me the wrong way is the fact that you awkwardly have to load a level you last saved in, then exit it to get back to the menu, then be able to pick a level in order to play whatever level you want.  After you beat the game, it does save, so it's not that you would have to beat the last level over and over again, and that's great.  But still, this is something that is a little annoying.  Thankfully, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, and the third game, Hitman: Contracts, are the only games in the franchise to do this.\n--\n\nThe atmosphere and vibe from each level (except Hidden Valley) feel ecstatic.  Even though the graphics are dated, they're still nice to look at and are far from ugly.  Even if you don't have a super computer that allows amazing detailed graphics and insane frame rate, the game still looks cool in gameplay and in cutscenes.\n\nThe levels are also beautifully designed, making almost every level a joy to complete.\nNot only did I feel like a professional assassin when I executed levels with intense precision and stealth, but I felt like one whenever the ICA moved me into these locations.  These locations range from being civil parties with wealthy scumbags to top secret locations where you need a disguise to not get shot on sight.  I always felt like I was on an important job, causing me to feel like a real professional.  If I wasn't a professional in the first place, I wouldn't be able to have the ICA send me on these jobs.  Trail and error is the key to success in becoming the professional this game will want you to be.  So have at it.\n--\nThe soundtrack is some of the best I've heard in a video game, let alone a form of entertainment.  It was composed by Jesper Kyd, and it is perfect.\n--\n\nOverall, the game is really great.  The game offers a compelling story revolving around a character who manages to be a cold-blooded killer and a human being seeking justice.  Buy it.","June 5","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
