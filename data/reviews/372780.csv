The unique asthetics and the design of the world is incredible. The mokos were insanely cute, I loved them to death. The soundtrack was great to listen to. Being able to sense the world form around you in shapes and colors really made me enjoy the game for it's entirety.\nBut therein lies the problem. The game itself is just too short. There is even an achievement for beating the game in half an hour. To me, charging $15 for a game that you can beat in half an hour is just silly. The game is very well made and absolutely stunning to look at, but there just isn't enough replay value or content for me to see that price being justifiable.\n\nThe demo came out over 2 years ago, so I was expecting at least 3 hours worth of game to explore. Yes there are small orbs to collect, and I do plan on going back and getting 100% of the achievements, but that $15 price is just too much for me. I would see paying half that much at the most.\n\nThis is the first steam game I have refunded.","October 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 56 of 74 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","56","74","2","0"

I really wish Steam reviews had an option other than thumbs-up or thumbs-down because Pulse is a unique and interesting experience that shows promise. I chose to give it a thumbs-down in the end due to (1) its extremely short length (less than 30 minutes), (2) its weak and confusing story, (3) its poor handling of enemies (the beasts were better utilized in the kickstarter demo than in the full game), and (4) the buggy AI pathing for the (very cute) Mokos.\n\nGiven the above factors, Pulse struggles to provide enough value for its $15 price point. As it stands, it feels more like a demo than a full game.","October 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

Also, this is my personal opinion on the game, based on my personal taste. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nThe idea and concept of the game were amazing, but, for me, it failed to deliver.\n\nFirst of all, the game is VERY short: I got the achievement to finish it in less than 30min on my first playthrough.\n\nSecond, the blind mechanic is quite frustrating: when you walk, there are waves of "sight" that come to the player, symbolising something like a sound echo, but it doesn't linger for very long. Therefore, when you walk, you have something like wave-space-wave-space-wave, and, at least for me, it was horrible to try and assert size and distance of things.\n\nThird: if you're going to take out your player's sight, give them hearing. The sound should have played a major part here, with noises that would guide you, and give you a feel of the world around you. Instead, the game relies oddly on visual cues, which feels completely against the idea of it.\n\nFourth, the overly vague story. It gives too many questions, too little answers. Instead of feeling like an interesting mystery, it felt rather pretentious, wanna-be-smart-and-cool-and-mysterious.\n\nAnd fifth, the mokos. Don't get me wrong, they're ABSURDLY cute and loveable, and you just want to hug them and take them home... and then you realise they're actually your tools. You can throw them to the monsters to distract them, or to use their bouncing to find your way around, but you don't want to do that because it feels like using puppies as throwing stones.\n\nAt the end, $15 is way too expensive for such a short, flawed experience.\n\nTL;DR: Short game, mechanics don't feel cohesive, story is too vague, throwing mokos feels bad.","November 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/372780/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Pulse is an interesting idea, and fun to experience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-VM-TfUwsg\nYou play as a blind girl who visualizes the world through the sounds she hears. The visual effects used to show this off are really cool. Wherever a sound is emanating, a wave of colour will light up the world.\nLuckily the devs keep the world from being too frustrating to navigate. There are usually a few loud objects in the world which keep small areas visible. Additionally, as you walk around, you leave footprints, which help keep your orientation on where you came from. Although, you might find yourself lost ever now and again, it isn't too hard to navigate the beautiful looking world.\n\nSpeaking of the beautiful world you don't get to see it much, but the glimpses here and there reveal a simplistic, yet interesting environment. The place is filled with ruins, vegetation, and some cute little critters. These guys are called Mokos. As you pass by them they'll follow you. You can pick them up and toss them around. When they hit surfaces, they make noise, allowing you to see ahead.\n\nThe game's atmosphere does a really good job and making you feel helpless at times. Loud noises will frighten you, but also light the way.\n\nAs for the story, it's kind of a mystery at the beginning. You start to get a better feeling of it as you progress through the game, and are talked to by some strange spirit-looking thing.\n\nOverall, it's a unique mechanic for a game, which I personally didn't get tired of due to the stuff the devs put in place to prevent you from being totally lost. The game is also not incredibly long. There's even an achievement for beating it in under 30 minutes. Granted, that's probably by speedrunning and not really enjoying the game properly, but it's still something to keep in mind. Still, I think it's a fun little experience!","October 20, 2015","true","1.8"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","30","48","3","0"

I personally found it to be a frustrating experience where I was basically blindly stumbling around in the dark never really sure where I was going or why. Ocassionally the walking was broken up by enemies that I never really figured out how to avoid and first-person jumping bits that I wouldn't have enjoyed even if I could see clearly. There were a few clever gimmicks and the colorful abstract-looking environments could be pretty, but the novelty wore off after a few minutes. There's a story, but it's purposefully vague and didn't ever grab my interest. The only reason I saw the game through to the end was because I knew how short it was from other reviews; I would have preferred it were even shorter.\n\nI also ran into some technical issues that I suspect were due to the fact that I played on a Mac. Neither my wired 360 controller or my Dualshock 3 seemed to function correctly. The y-axis on the right stick didn't work, nor did any of the face buttons. However, I'm not sure if the face buttons were meant to do anything as the controls were never explained in the menu or in the game itself. I was stuck on one of the jumping puzzles for several minutes until I went online and found out that there was a sprint key (Shift on the keyboard).","October 31, 2015","false","1.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Now, in 2015, when the game is finally out, it is an ever more beautiful tiny experiment, a glimpse into a great surreal experience that was never delivered.\nThe core mechanic makes the game gorgeous, it changes the way you perceive the game's world and move around it. This would have worked great as a stealth action, espcially if the enemies were as confined to their vision as Eva is to her hearing. Sadly, the game has just one stealth sequence, and I have no idea how it is supposed to be beaten: I just crawled around randomly until I got to the exit. It would have worked as a puzzle game, but the most difficult puzzle the game has is putting a hamsterlike furry creature into a wheel. If developers had no resources for a game with a gameplay, it would have worked beautifully as a walking simulator, a place to explore and marvel.\nInstead, the second core mechanic is first-person platforming.\nYes, you play as a blind girl who has to make presice jumps over the platforms she can't see. With glitchy collision detection.\nWhy.\nFor all the game's flaws, it's unique and is still worth experiencing. I can only hope that one day the team behind it would be able to make a next version, the one that fulfills all the promises of the current one.","November 1, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like when games try new things and that is definitely true of Pulse. The sight by sound mechanic is quite interesting and is a unique experience.  The designers did a really good job creating this mechanic since it feels like the sound you and the world make actually reveal different parts of the world. The visuals work really well with the mechanic as well.\n\nThe problem is that while the game has some interesting mechanics, it fails to live up to its' potential. Outside of the sight by sound mechanic, the game is a pretty average platformer. I wish the game would have created more puzzles that actually utilized the sight by sound mechanic.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the fact that it is short. The game is only around two hours long.\n\nWhile it could have been better, Pulse is still a good game and an interesting experience. If the concept interests you I think you will enjoy the game. Due to the length and the cost of the game though I would probably recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It's a fun puzzler as you use sound to find the path to navigate your enviroment. The use of gongs, crunching leaves, and growling monsters to paint your enviroment is beautiful and unique.
