"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/350740/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nEven in this time of indie games reviving game genres of old, the Pang genre hasn't exactly gotten a plethora of games. The Bug Butcher however does the genre proud, with its twitch gameplay doing its best to bring out the strengths of the genre. Great visuals complement action that forces you to keep shooting and killing, but being smart about it and not being reckless. While the game could use a little bit more variety for the long haul, what's there is extremely polished. Great performance plus loading times that are practically non-existent help in getting you right back in the action and keeping you there. It's a genre that gets to the basics, and The Bug Butcher is no exception to that. But small smart decisions regarding the gameplay helps make a game that kept me entertained throughout me playing it, and well worth the price point in question. Definitely a worthy successor in the genre, updated for the new age.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-8_5-Suh28\n\nLists:\n+:\nTight twitch gameplay that keeps the action going. Takes me back to the old arcade days.\nSolid controls that give you the right amount of control, and can allow you to be reckless and deal damage to yourself. That may sound weird to say, but part of the appeal of these games is the twitch gameplay, and consequences.\nStrong aesthetic that complements gameplay. Great use of color choice to make action clear for the player.\nGreat performance, and minimal load times. How an arcade game should play.\nLike the gravity mechanics with enemies and hitting them with your gun. It increases the skill ceiling especially with the combo multiplier.\nHonestly, the game is probably under priced, even at it's full price. Feel like for the experience, you get your money's worth and then some.\n-:\nDo wish there was a little bit more variety in the long run. A couple more weapons, levels, and enemy types would have done wonders.\nFeel like the upgrade system doesn't really do much other then add a bulletpoint feature to the game. Very basic.\nI really can't put my finger on it, but something feels missing with the sound design. I didn't see a real difference in gameplay when turning the sound off, which is unusual for games like this. But I can't say WHAT is missing.","January 20","true","2.5"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","29","36","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/350740/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","[Disclaimer: Key provided free by publisher/developer]\n\nScore\n✰80%✰\n\nPros\n~Well-animated characters\n~Balanced, satisfying and sometimes chaotic gameplay\n~High replay value\n~Free demo\n~Cheap\n\nCons\n~Lack of any advanced challenges\n~Lack of game modes\n~No online multiplayer\n~Menu navigation is a pain\n\nFirst, I would like to address the elephant in the room. Yes, this game is essentially a 90's arcade darling "Pang" with a fresh coat of paint. I used to love going out with my parents for dinner, because most pub restaurants around at the time had arcade machines. Pang was one of my favourites, because it was obvious just from looking at the screen what you had to do, so you needn't fear wasting your cherished pocket money just to learn the ropes.\n\nThe Bug Butcher takes the simplistic and enjoyable core gameplay of Pang and shakes it up just enough so that you wouldn't call it a clone, but you can tell from first glance that it is clearly paying homage. Actually, that isn't giving it enough credit, I would personally say that The Bug Butcher is superior in every way. It's faster paced, rarely feels unfair and has a much better aesthetic.\n\nRather than "harpooning balls", you play the roll of Harry, a badass bug exterminator, called into a laboratory that has become totally infested with giant mutant creepy crawlies. As Harry, you can only shoot directly upwards, which works out just fine because this is where the majority of critters come into his crosshairs. Most bugs either bounce off the floor over the top of you or fly around. Some will fire projectiles at you, while others will crawl along the roof and try to eat your scientist friends by snagging them on their long tongues. A lot of the chunkier bugs will split into smaller bugs after you've given them a good zapping, adding to the chaos.\n\nFortunately you rarely find yourself overwhelmed thanks to the wide range of weapons and power-ups available. These range from a high-speed rail gun to a freeze bomb that turns all bugs to ice for a few seconds. No matter what method you use to butcher bugs, each different weapon and power-up feels extremely satisfying, each packing a lot of power compared to your standard blaster which is itself still extremely punchy and enjoyable to use. This is probably down to a combination of audio-visual thump and some precise, responsive controls.\n\nEvery bug killed drops more coins for you to spend on passive bonuses that stay permanent throughout the 30 level main arcade campaign. These can increase your damage, power-up duration and increase your combo time. Personally, I always went with the 30% speed boost. The combo system allows you to rack up major points by slaughtering bugs in quick succession, the combo meter itself gets reset every time you take damage or don't land a kill after a couple of seconds. If you're aiming for a perfect rank on each level, you're going to have to get a perfect string of combos throughout the whole level. This becomes much easier when you play the levels again later after having invested coins into more firepower, but can be a source of frustration for the perfectionists when their combo breaks toward the end of the level.\n\nThere are two modes included with the game. The first is the Arcade mode, which puts you through 30 levels of increasing difficulty with a new environmental hazard introduced every 5 levels. These include things like floating platforms, laser walls, and a giant hammer that periodically smashes everything underneath. Completing a level will give you a score and a rank out of four stars. Three of these are awarded for reaching a certain score, while the fourth is awarded for a specific number of combos made. Unfortunately, these 30 levels will be over before you know it and leave you wanting more. There are also no boss bugs, despite what the trailer for the game claims. Although the difficulty curve seems to be highly polished, likely from player feedback while the game was in Early Access, I felt it didn't go far enough with the challenge.\n\nThe other game mode is called Panic, which will simply throw waves and waves of monsters at you until you are overwhelmed or run out of time. Time can be boosted in this mode, as bugs you've destroyed will frequently drop items that add more time to the counter. So far I've never come close to running out of time. I've found myself totally bombarded with bugs long before that happens. You can also buy power-ups and weapons in this mode from the pause menu, but they only last for the game you're currently in. There is also a two-player co-op version of Panic mode, where if one player dies the other player can revive them, but if just one of you perishes, then it's game over for you both. The multiplayer aspect shows a lot of promise, but it would be a lot better if there were perhaps larger maps for up to four players. It's also local co-op only, there's no online play here. Panic mode might seem like the answer to the lack of challenge on the Arcade mode, but you have to suffer through a lot of repetitive easy waves before the challenge starts to ramp up.\n\nThe graphics are sharp and colourful. Each type of bug has a truly unique design and are animated well. They also squish and burst in a way that feels immensely satisfying but doesn't gross you out. Add to that the sound effects which all feel base-like and appropriate for what's happening, from the sound of your gun, to the sticky squish noises of the bugs bouncing. Harry himself stands out well from the backgrounds and all the other objects flying around the stages. I never had an issue with knowing where I was or what dangerous thing was coming towards me. A combination of the camera tracking and Harry's character design, and his eccentric movement all helped. The game shows you in advance where bugs are going to appear from, giving you time to get out of the way if you're standing on a trap door where an insect eruption is imminent.\n\nAside from the bugs that are supposed to be there, I didn't encounter many problems with the game at all. I did experience a very irritating glitch on the final level of Arcade mode where no bugs were spawning on the final wave, while the background was flashing and glitching up, until I eventually ran out of time and had to repeat it. The UI for the menus is also a mess, with some buttons being labelled and others not. It was clearly designed for a touch-screen or mouse, yet the game itself is best played with a controller. Even without a controller plugged in, it will give you button prompts based on the Xbox controller layout. There are also no options to adjust basic video settings like resolution and refresh rate. The game will run at whatever your desktop resolution is set to, though this should be fine for most people (high refresh-rate displays also work just fine).\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a fantastic, highly polished arcade game that unfortunately feels a little barebones, like the framework for a highly re-playable and addictive game is in place, but needs fleshing out to realise its full potential. However, it's well worth the $8 asking price, especially if you have a friend you can do some couch co-op with. Really, the only major gripe I have with this game is that I want more.","February 8","true","8.7"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","28","36","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/350740/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Bug Butcher starts off as a tribute to 1989 bubble-dividing arcade game Pang, but quickly mutates into a turbo-charged, explosive twitch blaster.\n\nOn the surface it's simple - run horizontally, shoot vertically and blast everything before the time runs down. Shoot a large alien and it divides into two medium ones, shoot THEM and they divide again into two small ones. If you fail to mop up the smaller aliens, you become overwhelmed.\n\nBut as the game throws more types of alien at you, it becomes a game of tactics and timing. Can you dash under those five bouncing aliens to get to that crucial power-up? When do you set off the kill-everything homing missiles? Which alien is the priority kill?\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_sJdW4x58I\n\nSoon enough the aliens require your every reaction to deal with. There's a roof-crawling ant thing that blasts down a vertical pole of lightning for several seconds at a time. There's a leaping facehugger that means instant death. And one plant-like thing slowly sucks up your NPC friend in the background and, if you don't kill the plant in time it'll fail you the level. And so on.\n\nThe cartoon art is excellent and funny. The alien pests are full of bug-eyed charm, explosions feel satisfying and your hero Harry gets all the best lines.\n\nThe levels are scored in a very Angry Birds three-star system. You can progress just for completing the level, but getting just one star does hurt and you'll want to try again. The key to high scores is keeping a chain of kills (ie combos) going without being hurt. Some levels you'll unlock new weapons and power-ups.\n\nEvery coin you collect on a completed level earns you coins that you can spend on permanently upgrading your character (weapon power, power-up strength, speed boost etc). Flipside, there's less incentive to keep plugging away for three-star ratings early on when you know your character can be much stronger after a few more levels.\n\nThe levels are split into groups of six, each group taking place in one location in the research facility. Six feels like a lot - by the fifth, it feels a bit "this room AGAIN?!". But then the final level suddenly throws you into a confined elevator level, a kind of boss-style encounter where flames shoot from the walls. Each set of levels is sufficiently different, adding temporary barriers, platforms or a, er, kind of stompy thing. More levels and bosses are planned.\n\nThe game never feels unfair, even on hard mode where any contact with an alien is instant death. It's heart-pounding at times, with twitch reactions needed. The only real problem is that the core mechanic doesn't lend itself to huge variations in gameplay, no matter how many alien types are throw at you. It's best played for shorter sessions of score attack than trying to just plough through to the end as soon as possible (which, on easy, won't take too long).\n\nThis review is of the pre-release beta of the early access Steam version, with 18 out of a planned 30 levels implemented. Multiplayer is coming soon and should provide twice the laughs.","July 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/350740/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1505 products in account","The Bug Butcher is an action indie game with both singleplayer and co-op gameplay.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:If you're similar with Pang or maybe Bubble Trouble, this is exactly the same type of game. You have to shoot the enemies that are bouncing around the room and the only direction you can shoot at is upwards. You play as The Butcher, who specialises in killing monsters in this exact same situation.\n\nPros:    Gameplay | It's always nice to see when somebody makes a remake of an old classic game, but these remakes are usually just counting on player's nostalgia, instead of making a genuinely good game. Fortunately, this is not the case in The Bug Butcher. The gameplay is smooth and works as well as it should. It doesn't change the principle it's based on, but enhances it.\nGraphics | This game has a really nice colourful appearance that really makes this game stand out. I mean, just look at the Store page screenshots! All the effects look really nice, although they can get for a slight bit too confusing at times.\nWeapons | There are different weapons in this game and you can also get a lot of upgrades and pickups that boost your performance, for example faster shooting. Variety plays a really important role in this remake.\nCo-op | You can of course also play with your buddy, if you're having him in your home. There is also controller support, so you don't have to be cramped on the same keyboard.\nPricing | For such a nice game, I don't think $8 is a lot. It has hours and hours of gameplay, Steam Achievements and Leaderboards.\nStages | There are 30 story-based stages in different environments and there are also survival mission for both singleplayer and co-op modes. This is great if you want more fun after you completed the story missions.\nCons:    Controller Chaos | So, this game sometimes doesn't really let me play with my keyboard. The controls in game are always appearing as controller buttons, but in the options menu, everything is shown as keyboard buttons. This can be sometimes very confusing.\nLearning Curve | Although this game is very easy to understand, it becomes too hard a little to quickly. But that is just my opinion.\nThe final verdict:This game is a really nice remake of old classic called Pang and it's really well-made. The graphics are awesome, there is even some story included. The confusion with controller/keyboard controls are the biggest problem in this game I see.\nFor its price, I think this game is definitely worth checking out as it offers quite a lot of fun.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","February 14","true","6.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

You must clear the research lab of bugs in order to keep the scientists working there safe.\n\nGraphic design and visuals could be defined as grose and cute at the same time. All enemies you encounter are unique in terms of how they look and what they do, wrapped up in a cartoonish colorful look.\n\nBefore long you are freezing, bursting, frying and lasering hordes of strange-looking alien bug-beasts, and it feels so damn satisfying. Gameplay evolves around a static and unchanging environment where enemies dodge, crawl, fly, smash, bounce and even give birth to smaller versions of themselves.\n\nAs you progress through the levels you will acquire more powerful weapons, upgrades and power-ups. You will also collect coins from bugs you slaughtered in order to upgrade your stats and equipment.\n\nSoundtrack is absolutely amazing and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day we get a soundtrack edition of the game.\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a fine example of a old-school style of gameplay with a lot of fun-factor involved. Although it lacks some verticality The Bug Butcher will make you spend hours on end progressing through the well designed and easy to look at lab slaughtering relentless hords of interesting and unique bug-like aliens.\n\nFull review[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","August 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

But to my great pleasure this game is FANTASTIC.\n\nGraphically the game looks handrawn reminds me of games like Critter Crunch with the 2D art work, the bugs splatter, the blaster/power up effects look good, and the bugs themselves look really good for what it all is.\n\nGameplay wise it's fairly simple but challenging, the bugs bounce up and down across the screen and you're character runs across the same screen only allowed to vertically (up), now on paper this sounds fairly boring and standard, but when you consider other elements like; creatures breaking into smaller variations of themselves, some creatures shooting little beams that could hurt you, stage hazards and more, it adds variety and challenge to the gameplay all while you're trying to keep a combo meter and your high score rising in order to reach individual goals in each level.\n\nIt seems pretty simple but as i went on and was pushed to increase my combos and score I found myself becoming more agile and offensive in my appoarch against these bugs, as opposed to waiting for them to bounce and go on killing them, more often than not i would rush them before they even hit the ground once.\n\nThe audio in the solid as expected, the musical score isn't anything too blaring or annoying, and usually i'm too focused on keeping my combos up to really care about the music.\n\nFinally the replayablity in this game is actually quite excellent, mroe often than not I found myself repeating levels to hit each of the goals with in the levels, and even switching to a harder mode to challenge myself...I failed to mention this earlier but I actually enjoy how the harder mode mixes up the enemy spawns as opposed to just being the same as the lower modes with more enemies.\n\nAll in all, I love this game, the moment I played the demo, closed it out, and kept coming back to it over and over again, I knew I had to buy it, I reccomend that you do the same :)","January 19","true","1.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bardunmar/recommended/350740/","bardunmar","BarDunMar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bardunmar/","158 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFINALLY ANOTHER ENTICING INDY TITLE WITH BEAUTIFUL GRAFX AND FRESH GAMEPLAY!\nI just played the game for a bit over three hours straight until my fingers started to hurt. Let me say this: Normally I'm not a big fan of 2D platformers, but this title got me hooked from start to the last level of the current beta!\n\nIt has been a while since an early access indy title caught my attention. Last time it was "The Darkest Dungeon". In therms of level of polish this title reminds me a lot of the latter. But let's go into more detail:\n\nTHE PROS:\nPurely amazing grafics! I just LOVE the style of the characters, the enemies, their movement, the weapons, the FX. Let me tell you, there are AAA titles out there, which could learn a thing or two from this indy game... The first time I played "the darkest dungeon" was kind of similar in terms of grafics: You just don't expect THAT level of polish from an indy studio.\nVery interesting core loop: You can and will only shoot upwards and will have to calculate your movement and your weapon fire according to enemies movement. First it's pretty hard, but once you got the trajectories of the enemies mapped in your brain, the game starts getting addicitve! Also most of the enemies bounce a bit upwards, once you hit them. So after half an hour and after buying my first couple of upgrades I had the bugs basically dancing around my head without hurting me. - Very satisfying.\nThe power-ups in this game only last for a couple of seconds. But oh boy, if you make those seconds count you will really feel like a pro-exterminator!\nThe behaviour of the enemies is very well done and very well balanced. You have everything from lightning-spewing-firefly to big-♥♥♥-bug-birthing-blue-thing to scientist-eating-ceiling-crawler. Again I have to congratulate the devs to their top notch creativity and unique animation style.\nThe upgrades are promising. You can feel the difference after every upgrade you buy. I even unlocked the +30% speed perk and let me tell you: The game plays completely different after that. Much more agressive.\nTHE CONS:\nEven on "easy" the game is pretty hard! I've just seen a guy on twitch basically losing his nerves and nearly biting his constroller. The devs might need to work on the difficulty. Or they might just leave it as is. There are lot's of easy-to-play games out there.\nOn my high-end computer (2x Gforce GTX980ti, win8.1) I get a lot of interface bugs, like stars not showing up or the score not being visible after a match. The score is there, it's just hidden. But since it's only launch day and this is an early access title anyways I think the devs will have this fixed pretty soon.\nThe game is pretty short at the moment. After the first three areas it says "end of beta". Took me about 2 hours to play through on "easy".\nYou can play the game with the keyboard, but with a controler it's just much more fun.\nAll in all I can totally recommend this game, even with it being an early access title. It's wonderfully crafted, has good game design, a lot of challenges. Go for it, especially at the launch-price of 7,99 euros it's worth your while. With that price it cost less than the last movie ticket I bought (for Ant-Man, LOL) and was way more fun than that movie ;-)","July 20, 2015","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This Michael Jackson song came through my mind when i found out my wife and me had already been playing "the bug butcher" for more than total 26 hours. My first impression: "very nice graphics, cool sound and must be a simple game."\n\nBut wait: your enemies are getting more and more and stronger every level, there is a time limit and a limited number of lifes, you can "only" shoot veritcally  . ..  so you need the perfect timing, tactics and lots of coins (you earn them with an awesome combo feature) to upgrade your weapons and speed an skills from level to level . one mistake and you are dead - thats cruel - but for me the main fun ... you just cant stop playing before you killed this damn stage boss.... so you have to go through the whole level again and thats how you develop your skills until you are a real master ....\n\ni highly recommend this game to anyone who doesnt only like to play but likes to watch someone else playing - i had so much fun watching my wife die and die and die and die .. but she just couldnt stop playing. same for me...   so if you want to spend some fun hours playing a classic 2d side game this is the perfect game for you !","July 25, 2015","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madara_nl/recommended/350740/","madara_nl","Madara_NL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madara_nl/","1227 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's really hard to recommend this game. There are external problems and minor annoyances (menu isn't that user friendly with a controller) that would prevent me from recommending this game. However looking past these problems and only considering the quality of the game itself (in particular the graphics and the gameplay), I can do nothing else than recommend this game.\n\nIt's a very beautiful game, it runs smooth and the animations are great. I haven't had any performance isssues and it runs at a smooth 60 fps. The core gameplay is very solid. It's a vertical shooter where you have to defeat wave of increasingly harder (and different) enemies. It's easy to get in a great flow and there is enough of a challenge to keep you entertained.\n\nSo why is it really hard to recommend this game? The developers say the game has 30 levels (although only 18 are available in Early Access) and though it's technically accurate, it isn't really true. The real levels are called floors, of which there are only five. This results in very repetitive environments. The things the developer calls levels is just increasing the number of enemies (or adding another type) after a series of waves (four or five waves per level). This means there is a severe lack in content. In Early Access this is even worse.\n\nA lack of content doesn't have to be a bad thing (if the quality is good, which is the case), but the game has to be priced accordingly. This however isn't the case. The price of the game is way too high. The developer even says they plan to increase the price of the game after Early Access. This would be a grave mistake. Even with the planned features it simply isn't worth € 9,99, not even by a long shot. This is a game that shouldn't be priced above € 4,99. I wouldn't even consider buying the game at € 9,99. If by mistake I did buy it, I would have asked for a refund based on the lack of content. I don't think I'm alone in this and the developers should really consider this. It would be a real shame this game would fail, because the developer didn't understand the value of the game. It shouldn't fail based on quality, but it will fail if the price isn't lowered.\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Should you buy the game in Early Access: No\n- Should you buy the game for € 9,99: No\n- Is the game worth playing: Yes\n- Should you buy the game if has a lower price (€4,99 or below): Yes\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I have recieved this game for free from the developer.","September 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This does not affect my review.~\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618734384\nTags: Indie, Action, Shoot ‘Em Up, Co-op, Singleplayer, Arcade, Local Co-Op, Fast-paced, Cartoony, Sci-fi, Difficult, Great Soundtrack, Bullet Hell.\n\nIntroduction:The Bug Butcher is an Indie Arcade shoot ‘em up developed and published by Awfully Nice Studios .\n\nThe core mechanics hold old ties from the classic arcade shooter “Super Pang” where you shoot vertically, but with modern day twists. You are Harry, a brash and tenacious exterminator who has a knack for decimating bugs.\n\nWhat I noticed at a first glance:The controls are very tight and are simple enough for new players and complex enough for those who wish to go more in depth.\nIt’s a 2D, side scrolling game with a twist: instead of shooting across the screen at enemies, you shoot vertically.\nUnforgiving difficulty that punishes you when you mess up. Not unfair; if you die, it was most certainly your fault.\nThe power-ups. There is a great variety of these, ranging from increased damage, attack speed, and freezing enemies. There are also weapons that can spawn in crates, each with its own advantages.\nTons of available upgrades to increase different stats and perks.\nImpressive soundtrack and sound design in general. Electronic, sci-fi music mixed with the pew pew pew of your laser gun.\nThere are 3 game modes. Arcade missions act as a campaign mode with 30 levels. There is a set amount of time/waves of enemies that spawn. Panic (singleplayer) is a sungleplayer survival mode and Panic (co-op) is survival with local co-op enabled.\nEnemies varies depending on level. Each has their own attack patterns, which easy to learn, making them somewhat predictable (and killable)\nCartoony, light-hearted art style that makes pest control in space seem more appealing then you ever thought it could be.\nLevels are confined to a small space. I would enjoy a more open, free game mode where exploration was mixed with alien pest control. This may just be me, but I really enjoy games with certain aspects of freedom that allow the player to create his/her own unique experience.\nReplay value to get achievements and beat your old scores.\nSummaryI was impressed with the quality of this game. The controls are tight and the difficulty is unforgiving. If you have any interest in arcade shooters or games with big guns and lasers, I would highly recommend you at least check out the demo.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 7.5/10.

Addictive? Check. Funny? Check. Soundtrack? Checkmate. The Bug Butcher in a nutshell? Amazing.\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a action shooter from Awfully Nice Studios. Currently, in Early Access on Steam for $7.99 (on sale from it's launch price of $9.99). Just having finished my first look of the game I have to say It's been awesome.\n\nYou see I've been following The Bug Butcher since around February when I found it had been Greenlit through Steam. While following on Facebook I was able to see this game developed over the last several months and with each animated enemy gif they posted I would get more and more interested. The art style alone is enough to want to give it a shot.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FDTSpLUNP64?t=16m50s\n\nOn the surface it seems that The Bug Butcher is a stylized shoot 'em up. Where the enemies are a series of very well designed bug alien creature thingies (I imagine this whole thing takes place way in the future on the bug planet Klendathu but that's my fantasy). Your ultimate goal is to splatter their gooey insides all over this space station and save the day.\nYou are fighting against the clock, leveling power ups, leveling perks, and frantically building your power up meter to beat the round. Trust me you'll need the power ups in the harder difficulties as you only have 1 health. As you finish each level you are awarded stars based on your final score, there are a possible 4 stars per level. You are also given coins, these coins are used to purchase upgrades to the aforementioned perks and power ups. The power ups are random and unlock at certain levels, the two I came across were rapid fire and freeze grenades.\n\nFor an early access game The Bug Butcher is polished very well. All the animation, sound production, and gameplay is tight and well done. I didn't come across anything that stood out as "broken". It gets an A+ there. Having followed the development over the last few months I'm excited for the rest of the content, which includes a split-screen head to head multiplayer mode. From the looks of it, it reminds me of two player Bubble Bobble or Tetris, where you are both playing the same map simultaneously and as you do better it hurts your opponent.\n\nOverall, I think The Bug Butcher is a great early access title worth your time. It looks great, sounds great, and plays great.\n"The Only Good Bug, Is a Dead Bug!"

They look slick, but elements break apart and hidden elements are shown when scaled wider than 16:9. The menus support keyboard/mouse/controller, but it seems like a mashup of shortcuts that work well on some and not on others. It’s really quite a mess beyond the first glance, and while none of this effects the gameplay, it does cause resetting the level to be a pain depending on your input method. A Keyboard-only level reset takes 13 inputs... There's plenty of room for a reset key; it would alleviate a ton of the frustration during the more difficult stages.\n\nKey rebinding is present but isn’t complete, and controller is limited to one default mapping which I don’t find to be all that optimal. I opted for the keyboard for all of my play at the end of the game, as the default mapping played well, and was the most responsive considering the movement is digital rather than analog. Local Co-op is playable with a a single keyboard and/or controllers. Co-op keyboard defaults make little sense, but can be rebound separately from the singleplayer controls.\n\nThe game supports at least 144hz and forces v-sync. However, the camera and walking enemies update position matching the refresh, while the bouncing enemies update around 60hz and will appear to stutter.\n\nGameplay\nThe core gameplay across all modes entails walking along the floor, dashing, and firing directly upwards, as bugs crawl out of every surface. It's similar to a traditional arcade shooter (Galaga / Space Invaders) but the dash and variety of enemy movements/attacks make it quite unique. Each bug is color-coded, contrasting strongly with the background environments. This is key as their movement, attack, and self-replication patterns are consistent; reading them becomes essential when trying to perfect a level. None of the bugs actively seek you out in any way; you position yourself to avoid collisions and line up attacks. You can use your dash to put yourself in the way of danger to kill faster; you’re rewarded for that risk. Dashing won’t trigger while holding the fire button, so you can’t be sloppy with your inputs.\n\nThe main single-player mode consists of 30 levels across 5 areas, each with score targets for 1-3 star ratings and a target combo, achieved by killing bugs in succession before the 4 (6 w/ perk) second timer ticks down and without getting hit. The difficulty options simply adjust your maximum health, allowing you to take 1, 4, or 8 hits before death. You can survive through the 30 levels pretty quickly without too much trouble, but he challenge is meeting the score and combo-count requirements for each stage. While the difficulty setting has no impact on score, taking all of those hits and losing your combo each time will likely see you falling short of those goals. Losing the combo once in the middle of the stage could cut your final score by more than half, and leave your maximum combo under the target, as it’s usually seems tailored to 50-80% of the spawned bugs.\n\nAll of the bug spawns are orchestrated; you can memorize the patterns and will likely need to when perfecting the final few levels. I believe power-ups and weapons are dropped from specific enemies, but the actual item you get is randomized. There are coins to collect, and while they add slowly to your score, their intended use is buying upgrades to the weapons and power-ups, as well as 3 perks. Again, because of the score-attack focus, I don’t see why there is any progression system at all, though you’ll have the money for every unlock before you finish a single run through. It becomes irrelevant before you go back to complete all the score and combo targets. A better use for the coins in my mind would have been costumes for the player character; still something to unlock and look forward to, without putting you at an immediate disadvantage.\n\nPanic, the only other mode at the moment, is an endless score attack and is playable with one or two players locally on the 5 maps. Players can revive each-other by spamming the A button over their body during a small window after they’re downed. The coins here are accumulated during the run, are reset upon death, and can be spent in the pause menu to enable all of the power-ups and passive buffs from the singleplayer. A deploy-able bubble shield is also added to the roster of power-ups. There are no achievements or unlocks tied to this mode, but kills during do contribute to the achievements, and it was good fun with a friend. A local VS mode was shown off a while back, but doesn’t exist in the current build.\n\nOverall it's very tight and satisfying, but there will be certain moments where you feel cheated. I came across instances of glitches and inconsistencies that forced a reset. It’s all somewhat excusable, until it happens in the run you were nailing, ruining it and and frustrating the experience. Questionable choices involving components in the levels that can redirect enemies unexpectedly, bug out and block shots, or even kill you directly. Certain power-ups can also cause certain bugs to spaz out in unpredictable ways. It’s largely a fair and rewarding challenge, but when those conflicts can get to you. It's minor and only really appears in the end-game, but still something to be worked on.\n\nPresentation\nA mix of Jetpack Joyride, Castle Crashers, and Awesomenauts, the visual aesthetic is exceptional. There’s a small amount of aliasing on some of the assets, but it’s largely crisp and defined, with excellent color choice. The bug designs, while nothing iconic, all have a goofy charm and wear bright colors that both assist in gameplay and look great. In hectic scenes, you’ll have many colors going at once, yet it remains unified because of the contrasting but not clashing color choices. The core sound effects are well defined, but the thumping electronic music was hit or miss for me.\n\nConclusion\nThe Bug Butcher is a satisfying and unique 2D arcade shooter, where speed and precision are heavily rewarded. It’s charming, vibrant 2.5D cartoon aesthetic is very appealing but also helps keep hectic situations readable. While relatively light on content, it’s score attack format and achievements had me enjoying myself all the way to 100% completion in around 8 hours of play, with only a small amount of frustration perfecting the final few levels, stemming from small glitches or inconsistencies. The menu UI needs some work and though the port is nowhere near top-notch, it’s good enough to be enjoyable on ultra-wide and high refreshrate displays. Co-op functionality for the 30 main missions, additional modes in general, and small enhancements like visual character customization would be greatly appreciated if development continues. In it’s current form it’s a good value and is well worth a look.","February 7","true","12.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

You are armed with a pewpewpew blaster that you will consistently hold fire for and scream as you keep note of your position on the monitorby watching where your shots land. The mechanic used here is extremely simple, but done so well that it will keep you playing for awhile. Personally, with games like this, I can't really play them for hours at a time. This is the type of game that I jump into and play for a half hour or so, put it down for a few weeks, then pick it back up to do more pewpewpew'in'\n\nAwesome sound direction.\n\nIt appears that developers have gotten way better at sound design, soundtracks, and the details those are meant to enhance. The soundtrack for this game is fan-dagnabbed-tastic. It sounds a lot like the creator of this soundtrack listened to a lot of Deadmau5 and Feed Me and decided to base a soundtrack around it. Along with the sound effects and little yelps, yipes, blips, and pewpewpews, it adds up to a very directed and cohesive effort. There's nothing about the soundtrack that doesn't work. You will not get tired of it. You WILL be willing to buy the DLC just so you can have it. Truly fantastic, and probably my favorite part of the game. That may not seem like a big deal, but it is.\n\nCharacter design.\n\nFriggin' adorable, and I don't have anything else to say about it other than that. If you want me to elaborate on it: Even the gross stuff like one of the big fat bugs spewing a bunch of little baby blobs out of its belly butt manages to be friggin' adorable. The squishing sounds add to this. There, happy?\n\nBuy it...\n\nIt's the opposite of sucky, and even if some fat fascist jerk face downvotes my review because they rig their group giveaways and can't stand that I'm writing reviews for a group 7 time the size of theirs now, you can understand why this is a good purchase.***\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!\n***This does not reflect the opinion of anyone in LoG except for me.

Ohh yeah, it's bug Butcher time!\n\nIf you're a fan of shoot'em ups of games like electronic super joy, you're probably going to really enjoy this. There is a lot of action on the screen at times and while to the extent of something like Ikaruga, it does provide a welcome alternative to the space ship shooters without the need of a platform jumper.\n\nHowever, those looking for a class Pang remake may be a little disappointed at first, but surprisingly pleased by the out come. It gives a nice, faster, more up beat game play as well as a few new weapons to play with giving a refreshed feel, if you don't mind the missing ropes.\n\nGameplay wise, there isn't really much in the way of upgrades for the character. I think I managed to max out everything I could in the first few hours. The game has a nice tutorial to get you into the swing of things and you'll soon be awarded with new weapons to use and upgrade.\nAs you progress you've presented with new bugs to kill, each with their own abilities and things you need to watch out for and different means of dealing with them. Some rooms have different envo hazards you need to watch out for, or use to your own advantage.\n\nI've like to see Steam workshop support added, a basic level editor for community levels to make things interesting. Right now there is the fixed path of the single player mode, that once beat on hard (it is btw) you'll only be able to get higher scores againt world and friends. The alternatives are co op and the endless mode where you kill bugs for extra time pickups. You play until time runs out or you die. The Co-op is nice and is well suited for TV gameplay.\n\nAs it stands, it's well worth the asking price.","February 11","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each level is a fairly small contained area, and like most vertical scrollers, most enemies come in from the top, and you can only shoot up, however the enemies stick around until they are defeated and there is a floor which many can bounce around on, and some stop and rest on. Player movement is constrained to just left and right on the floor. The lack of a jump in this perspective seems like a bit of a strange choice, especially since it would come in useful on occasion for evading incoming attacks when there's another enemy sitting next to you. Some enemies are capable of firing projectiles, some just a few at a time, but others do 10s at a time in patterns, although the enemies bouncing around the floor are usually the primary threat to your health. The game is usually quite hectic keeping a fairly quick pace with a large amount of enemies at most times. The player can dashsideways to help dodge, which recharges very quickly. It took a while for me to get used to dashing, as buttons to slow your movement tend to be more common in vertical shooting games than speeding up, and you must stop shooting to dash, so you can't just hold shoot forever. I was a bit hesitant about whether I wanted to try this at first, as trying to run under jumping enemies in most platformers tends to be a source of frustration and difficulty, however I didn't have an issue with it here. Enemies jump high enough and are floaty enough that you have plenty of  time to manuver below them, and most slow their decent when hit, giving you more time when attacking. Once I got the hang of this, I was able to play much more aggressivly than I originally thought would be possible, dashing underneath falling enemies and shooting, and if necessary dashing back out before they hit the ground. This may actually be required, as you may get overrun otherwise, and this game is quite difficult. Different arenas have different gimmicks to them, and there is a large variety of enemy types, each of which attacks and moves differently, so the game stays fairly fresh despite it's simple mechanics. The player handles well, and the collision works as it should, I never felt as if I was screwed by oversized hitboxes. The soundtrack is great and fits well with the theme of the game. Unfortunatly the coop is local only, and therefore worthless to me, however there's still plenty of single player content to do.","February 12","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If this game looks remontely interesting to you, try the demo. If you like that then buy the game - you won't be disappointed. It is short (30 levels) but unlike many other games it never becomes tedious or starts repeating itself to give you 10,000 hours of playtime. The controls are great, the music fitting, and each level adds a new component or combination not previously seen.\n\nThe game has an appropriate level of challenge where you know you could have moved your exterminator better or used a power up or shot a different bug so you will be compelled to try a level "one more time" after failing - at which point you're hooked and end up beating the game in one or two sittings.\n\nIt's also not difficult to get all the achievements.\n\nA big thumbs up for simple, smooth enjoyment.\n","February 14","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

An interesting effect of this idea is that you must get underneath your enemies to kill them, but that also put you in a compromised position as if the enemies will also be in position to land on you and do damage. The game isn't too complex. You hold down the shoot button, building up your combo meter for a high score while building up a power meter so you can unleash your special attack.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNHe17ejeds\nThe visuals are nice with detailed and well animated 2d sprites, and the game has a good sense of humor about it. The music and sound effects are of a great quality that helps compliment it's visuals.\n\nAlthough my time with the game is short (as of this review) I had a good time.

I have to say, this game's art and animation are very well done and in general it has a lot of polish.  I was happy to see that it had co-op and played with a friend which was a major selling point for me.\n\nI had about 30 minutes of fun in co-op but the fun dried up quickly.  Mainly because I found the upgrade system to be not very well thought out.  The choices are not very strategic since the weapons drop at random, and the more upgrades you buy the less you know what will drop.  You cannot buy more then one shield (you should be able to but with increased cost) and some of the upgrades are confusing like the "extra health".\n\nAlso, why can't you play the normal levels 2 player?  I really think that would have given the co-op a lot more staying power.  Overall I say if you watch the trailer and it looks cool, go for it as long as you are not buying it for the co-op.  It's a very nicely polished game and a lot of people haven't played buster bros, so it's good we have a solid example out there to cary the torch.","January 26","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is addicting, in a good way. It can make you play for hours, time flies by.\nThe Singleplayer is short, but stays the same. I recommend playing it either on Medium or Hard, which is pretty decent to play. Panic Mode is awesome, waves and waves of enemies, trying to kill you. Getting harder every wave, more and more to dodge. Co-Op is the last gamemode, which I didn't try yet. But if it's the same as old time games like these, I'm sure it's really  ♥♥♥♥ing awesome together. Up to 2 players, on 1 keyboard, just like old times, no need for a second keyboard or controller.\n\nPros\n- Good old times\n- Simple but fun concept\n- Positively Addicting\n- Co-op\n- Upgrade System\n\nCons\n- Co-op only 2 players\n\nRating\n8.5/10\nIt's simple, small and reminds me of good old times. Addicting and fun for hours.\n\nRecommended?\nYes, I highly recommend it. For this price you've got a new fun game, which will be fun for hours and hours. Even with the Leaderboards, you can always show off to your friends. Try playing it with a friend together, it would be even more fun then!\nVery well done and a big thumbs-up for the developers of this great game.","February 4","true","1.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

You'll battle nerves, frustration and bloodshot eyes as the luxury of blinking goes out the window.\n\nThe inability to map custom buttons is a real drawback and the menus (all of them) are atrocities to convention and miserable to navigate. Thankfully you won't spend too much time in them, and overall it's not exactly  a deal breaker since they're most likely working on bigger problems atm.\n\n\n+ 6.5/10\n+ Grab a friend to truly unleash the games potential.\n+ Good Xbox 360 controller support.\n+ Decent powerups provide enough variety with which to dispatch the vermin.\n+ Well designed enemy mechanics.\n\n- Lack of button mapping is a drawback (put that dash button on RT guys!)\n- 2-player panic mode has a UI flaw that lets the player restart the game without a confirmation.\n***You don't know how badly this needs to be fixed asap. Better to map the option to one of the start buttons all together.***\n-The main title screen is drab and could potentially lower expectations from players from the get-go as an unfinished and cheap title.\n\nFix these flaws and spice up the level design/art and you've easily got an 8/10 game on your hands.","December 12, 2015","true","16.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You tapped the fire key with a deliberate rhythym to hit just the thing you wanted, and because you normally could only have one shot on the screen you were defenseless for a while if you wasted a shot.  You don't play Bug Butcher that way; you play Bug Butcher with the fire button held down, you shoot everything you can until there's nothing left, and you do it fast and loose and sometimes you take some damage (in Super Pang, you died in a single hit, which really changes the feel).  Both games have bouncing things, but deep-down they're very different games.\n\nBut anyway, yeah, Bug Butcher is a good action shooter; sometimes it feels like sort of a "bullet hell platformer" maybe?  Great music, fun atmosphere, really satisfying powerups, and good variety of enemies and challenges.  Solid game.","February 21","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely got the "spiritual successor" vibe down and unlike Super Pang, it gives a lot more variety not only in complex gameplay, but in the backstory of where you are in the game. You don't have to think too hard to play this game, but it's just the right amount of intensity that'll have your nose up to the screen with such tight focus. The theme is sci-fi (true sci-fi, not the sci-fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you usually see in most games) and I love it. Tight controls, though the dash requires some mastering. Other than that, just imagine some tight retro "wave" gameplay with a cartoon adapted style and you have yourself Bug Butcher.\n\nDon't get it if these things aspects don't peak your interest.","February 27","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't like highscores, skip it. But if you do like it, you'll spend many hours trying to achieve that one combo score or trying to get higher in the world ranking. There's a bug (pun intended) in the localization, and some placeholder texts are still there. But these are minor flaws: it's about hectic gameplay, not about story. Nice start for this new indie team!","February 28","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For $8, you are getting a LOT of action. I want to say its about 30 levels and the game has special challenge modes too outside of the story. The characters are witty, fun, have a lot of comedy, and are well scripted. The animation and art style is great, reminding me of a 2D cell shading or comic-book look almost. The gameplay itself may look repetitive, but it's intense and fun. Co-Op makes things even better as you play with a friend to clear out waves of enemies. All of this for $8, what a steal!\n\nCheck out my full video review here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCh2AJ95M4","February 2","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
