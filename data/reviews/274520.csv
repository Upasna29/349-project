Playing as an Indonesian schoolgirl with a magic phone, an archeologist with amnesia, and a toddler with diapers full to the brim has had an ill effect on me. My heart just can't take it – my mind just can't take it. The filaments that hold my fragile psyche aloft are pulled taut, straining as each frayed fiber falters and my sanity slips closer towards the cold, dark depths of derangement. Which isn't super great, really. But I'll gladly surrender my faculties for a game as fun as “Darkwood.”\n\n“Darkwood” isn't a “Slender” or “Amnesia” clone. This is a game in the vein of old school horror where atmosphere was king – you'll hear lots of comparisons to the “Silent Hill” series. The key to good horror is cultivating a crushing, foreboding world environment... one that fosters paranoia and unease the whole way through. Sure, jumpscares are necessary to finally break the tension, but the best horror games are dripping and oozing in atmosphere. The whole world should FEEL hostile, not just the denizens that inhabit it. This game doesn't want you playing it, no. It wants to play you.\n\nHere's what you can expect playing “Darkwood:” your hands should be clammy with an itch you can't scratch, not now. Your face should be inches from your monitor, blinking only when necessary, scanning wildly back and forth for something, ANYTHING, to betray the game's ill intent. As you talk with each bizarre NPC you should feel nervous, wondering when the conversation will go from benignly creepy to malignantly violent. And when you finally encounter an unspeakable horror, you'll have to make that gut decision whether to run or stand your ground. I recommend running. Like with all survivor horrors, you are at a notable disadvantage. You'll also be able to set up hasty barricades... rocking back and forth as claws scratch and jaws click outside, tearing your defenses down piece by piece.\n\nThere are a lot of cool things happening with this game. Your vision is funneled, forcing the aforementioned wild scanning. You can see the world generally in your “peripheral vision,” but you have to be looking relatively dead-on to see any actual threats. They'll be effectively invisible otherwise. You'll inject yourself with concoctions extracted from fauna and flora that provide mutations. They will grant a boost in one way and a hindrance in another. There's a crafting aspect that's pretty basic right now but feels natural... rough and raw. Besides health you have a stamina meter, one you'll have to keep an eye on when deciding whether to fight or fly. Graphically speaking, “Darkwood” isn't exactly next gen, but it is highly stylized and creepy. It's a beautiful, dark, Gothic painting – like the ones where the eyes follow you wherever you go and it talks smack about your mother. And the music will chill you to the bone. If the environment and enemies start to give you a little break, don't worry. The music will swell and put you right back on edge, or the heavy creaks and sudden cracks of the sound design.\n\nLike any good horror this is a challenging game. I do recommend playing with permadeath on. Adds to the spook factor! Anticipate shedding lots of your own pixelated blood. My biggest gripes? It's hard to determine sometimes (between how dark the game is and how... generally dark the colors are) what  I can search and interact with and what's just a creepy thingy. The controls also take some getting used to, but that seems appropriate considering the genre.\n\nNow seeing that this is an Early Access title my recommendation is tentative and subject to change. But at the moment there is nothing out on Steam quite like this. Every day you hear people bemoan the death of “true survival horror,” myself being one of them. Well folks, it wasn't dead. Just waiting for the right moment to sing its siren song... and draw us in at least once more, into those dark and dreary woods where light dares not penetrate and your screams can't quite escape.","July 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 895 of 964 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","895","964","3","39"

I thought death would be a release, but it's only a continuation of the torment. In what I'm sure is a futile effort to keep my sanity, I will try to catalogue my various deaths.\n\nDeath 1:\nNo weapons in sight and night is falling rapidly. In a misguided attempt to make the animals friendlier towards me, I've brewed a strange concoction from the local mycological flora and injected myself with it. The only effect I've seen towards my original intention was that the rabbits have stopped gnashing their teeth when I approach and have opted for a more subtle, indignant sideways glance. Night fell and I drank the well water as I was told by the nonchalant wolfman (nonchalant in that he seemed to have no compunctions that he was a freak of nature) that woke me up. The generator has failed and my only light is the mocking phosphorescent glow of my last flare. I hear things approaching. Hungry things. I've pushed my wardrobe in front of the window in the hopes that it would stop them. It did not, and a howling naked man has bashed my skull in and, presumably, eaten me.\n\nDeath 2:\nWoken up by the wolfman again. He doesn't seem to remember me. I show him the dogtag as before and, as before, he tells me to seek out the chicken lady. My travels this time have been more fruitful. I've discovered several nonfunctional vehicles nearby, each containing a substantial amount of fuel. Hopefully this will help me keep the generator running this time. I've also found enough material to fashion a crude weapon for my inevitable self-defense. On top of that, I've found a bear trap with which to lay a trap for any more au naturel forest men that want to avail themselves of my sweetmeats. Once again, night falls and I drink from the well. I'm somewhat prepared this time. Again they come. I catch one in the bear trap and proceed to beat him into submission. Shortly after, another bursts in behind me, catching me by surprise. A pitched battle erupts, with me barely surviving to fell my opponent. I'm bleeding badly, but have enough rags to fashion a welcome, if somewhat unsanitary, bandage. Eventually morning arives and I stride wrecklessly back out into the forest, perchance to happen upon more provisions and survive another night in this hellish place. I happen upon a corpse, seemingly hidden under a jagged thicket. Immediately upon poking it, it explodes and I'm slain by its cadaverous stench.\n\nDeath 3:\nAgain the wolfman comes. I think he's mocking me. Is it a he? It sounds male. I have little luck in finding anything useful in my wanderings. The woods are crawling with wolves (the normal kind... I didn't think to stop and check their gender), and I have to skirt around them constantly. I find some alcohol, rags, and a lighter, but little else. At least I can keep warm with this, one way or another. Night falls and I drink the water. I'm beginning to wonder if I should be following the wolfman's advice at this point. For all I know, it's the well water that's keeping me here. I can do nothing but sit in my dark house, hoping they don't find me and tear me limb from limb. My hopes are completely unfounded. Having no other weapons, I quickly fashion a crude Molotov cocktail and hold it at the ready for when something crashes through the window in front of me. Alas, one crashes in behind me. Panicking, I drop the freshly lit incendiary at my feet, immediately catching myself and the wildman ablaze. I'm not sure which of us died first. I can now officially say that immolation has been my least favorite way to go.\n\nDeath 4:\nBanshee... or witch? I'm unsure at this point.\n\nDeath 5:\nPack of wolves. Gender unknown.\n\nDeath 6:\n%$@&ing CORPSE BOMB!\n\nDeath 7:\nOk, this is getting a little ridiculous. I'm just going to sit in my house and pretend I'm dead. Maybe the universe, or whatever cruel deity placed me here, will forget that I exist and move on to torment some other poor soul... Nope.\n\nTen out of ten. Would die again!","July 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 265 of 302 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","265","302","2","15"

This is also my first review for any game, which should give a hint right off the bat of how strongly I feel.\n\nThe most common complaint I've seen is that Darkwood is too hard. And this game is, in fact, HARD.\n\nHARD.\n\nHARD.\n\nGot it? Good. I'm not joking! Unless you play stuff like Dark Souls (a direct inspiration for this game), then this will likely be the toughest game you'll ever play. Period. It will also likely be the scariest. Playing on perma death only, it took me 40 hours just to beat the game. And I've yet to turn over every rock, discover every secret.\n\nBut I don't think that it's fair to give the game a negative review because it's too difficult. If Darkwood was any easier it wouldn't be Darkwood. It would be Flaccidwood, and it would be boring and not very scary.\n\nIf you play the prologue, you will not be in the Dark (pun intended) when you first awake in your little hut. Granted, you will need to move quickly, explore locations as you find them, and avoid anything with teeth, BUT you will be able to do so with a grasp of basic mechanics and controls. Just make sure to return to your hovel before nightfall. Believe me, I've played games with far less introduction and instruction.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, it's time to talk about the game, the real meat-and-potatoes. The concept is simple -- escape a little slice of densely-forrested rural Poland. Standing in your way are packs of roving mutations, insane NPC's, and a whole lotta beartraps.\n\nThere's a lot of ways to die. Mauled by ravenous dogs, mauled by *bigger* ravenous dogs, beaten to death by naked dudes with sticks, pelted with rocks, torn in half by creepy-crawlers with a whole bunch of teeth,, poisoned by shrooms, stepping on beartraps, and, if you're like me, you'll probably end up setting yourself on fire a few times.\n\nBut it's not all bad news. You can cook the indigenous mushrooms growing around the forest and shoot them up to improve your skills and such. Well, I mean, you'll suffer from terrible drug-induced nightmares in the process, but now you can put more stuff in your hotbar! Hooray!\n\nOh, and did I mention the Banshee? Yeah, wait till she pays you a visit. It took her about 35 hours to find me, but when she did, I didn't sleep for a few days afterwards.\n\nAnyway, Darkwood is really, REALLY scary and unique. So pick it up. And say hi on the forums :). The devs are very active there and are always looking for suggestions.\n\n-- UPDATE #1 --\n\nWow, it's been a while. I knew I would have to update the review as development progressed, but I decided to wait until a huge update before adding on. Well, this is the time!\n\nDarkwood is now in Alpha 7.0 -- 3 versions past the build this review was written for.\n\nThe changes are simply too numerous for me to point out in this review. So, I will instead try to give you, the potential buyer, an idea of the sheer scope of this game's continuing evolution:\n\n-- Entirely redone and rebalanced crafting that now revolves around your workbench\n-- Complete overhaul of the (previously unstable) weapon balance\n-- Complete revamp and expansion of NPC dialogue and the story\n-- New minor locations\n-- A new village area with a ton of NPC's and background story\n-- New nighttime events\n\nSmart money is betting that Chapter 1 is nearly finished, and thus Chapter 2 could be coming shortly. Better yet, with all of the groundwork and mechanics finished, work on the following chapter(s) should progress quickly.\n\nDarkwood is a prime example of how EA should be done -- a dedicated dev team taking the community's feedback and continuously using it to build the game up. I look forward to what the future of Darkwood holds!","March 29, 2015","true","75.9"," 76 of 79 people (96%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","96","76","79","18","4"

Creepy, immersive, rogue-like and  top down horror game with sounds,art and gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your feet, you'll also die alot. because this game is absolutely brutal with permadeath on.\n\nTo start off you'll have a couple of save files you can choose from with the ability to skip the entire prologue or play it. You'll also be able to turn on or off permadeath, the real way to play but that is up to you ;).\n\nThe game starts you off with explaining to you about a man with a dream, You'll be treated with some seriously scary art and  you'll be  very confused. You'll search around a bit to find an axe to break a passage but at the same time find your dog dieing and you'll have to make a choice, to end his suffering or to leave him. Now back to the  log and you'll learn the tutorial of the game, the basics of attack and how to craft and the things you need to create to survive int his horrible hell. As you head south you'll find a cabin and there you'll meet a man inside which will begin the entire story of DarkWoods.\n\nDarkwood is very immersive and scary, You'll feel it as you move your character around this living breathing world. The sound is downright phenomenal and done brilliantly to give  so you can feel the world. It will scare you when you turn corners in this game. From the winds blowing across  the trees, to the moving shadows, and the eerie noises around the woods. The characters you'll meet in this game is also very creepy, with well animated features  drawn with personality combined with decent dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay is a survival top down game horror game that takes place in the woods somewhere in russia where theres day and night cycle with items and locations in the woods randomly generated and randomly placed. The story and building layout is usually the same, so are the quests but the amount of randomization is enought to keep you satisfied. Everything is done well to give you the feeling that everytime you step out its never the same. Also read everyone's dialogue or read your journals, yes Dialogue will give you hints of location changes of certain npcs you'll want to take advantage of, especially the wolf merchant. The further you go out into the woods the darker and more dangerous it'll get So keep your base in check because the map in this game doesn't tell you where your position is. You'll have to remember the way back. Also BE WARNED OF THE WELL MECHANIC YOU MUST DRINK FROM THE WELL TO SURVIVE EACH NIGHT or you will suffer death hence forcing you to return to base every night. The goal of the game at the moment is To explore the quest and survive.\n\nThe game mechanic works by your character facing a direction you'll see a frontal cone view,  You can only see where you point your mouse and whats under certaint trees with the cursor on it, even if an enemy is behind you you'll have to look behind otherwise your vision is obscured. You also can't see past trees or buildings which will give you  you immersion and realism. You'll also have to be on your feet and aware at all times.\nThe top left displays your health in red, stamina in grey and buffs along with debuffs go the very top left. Use up too much stamina and you'll move at a very slow rate so sprint wisely otherwise become easy target for monsters. Also at the same time the crafting and inventory is limited, but as you progress in the game you'll be able to discover recipes to craft things such as  barricades, torches, traps, healing items and weapons and collect mushrooms to inject yourself so that you can improve your trait, later on with this feature you'll have to sacrifice a certain trait to gain a new one. Some will help your vision, some seems sorta useless at the moment.\n\nYou'll also be able to interact with objects to move it around like book cases to cover door etc or pick locks or even break down doors. To attack you'll have to equip an item into the limited 3 hotbar slots and then hold down right mousebutton followed by pressing left mouse button so the controls feels very unique and fits the game perfectly. It will take time to dig into your inventory, pull out an item and to actually use it, Also note to set up a trap it'll take time to set up along with searching large cases or items. Everything in this game adds to that realism and hardcore of survival games.\n\nThe game is hard, the elements of the woods will get to you, There are things you can accidently step on such as mushroom and bodies that will poison you if you don't watch your footing, patrolling  monsterous  dogs and creatures from the very depth of your nightmares which screams in the middle of the night out for your blood.  When day turns to dusk it is time to go back to base and hold out as long as you can until morning to continue  your survival. Currently the best way is to probabaly cut line of sight from monsters in the dark and pray that they won't find you. Probabaly will need more work ont his mechanic to give it a little more to do than just hiding in corners especially on permadeath mode.\n\nThis game is a survivalist horror hardcore dream and it was worth the wait, it is currently in alpha 1.0 and it is pretty solid gameplay save some bugs here and there and the fact that it is unfinished. The woods might be very dark and seeing things might require a gamme adjustment, Inventory is very scarce so be ready to horde since many items do not respawn so it can be tough to find those supplies. Be warned that you will die. I've played  hours and only survived 4 days, most of my friends are stuck at 4. You'll be playing this game quite a bit my friends but that is what makes it so great.\n\n+ Phenomenal Sounds that is immersive, the heavy breathing, the monsters and the woods itself gives it life and horror at the same time really powerful sounds and brilliantly done.\n+ Rogue-like environment placement of items and places of discoveries\n+ Realism from what you do, searching, crafting, setting up traps, learning to fight your enemies, the interaction between items. Also the\n+ Creepy, animated art from the nicely designed characters and the map itself, everything is alive including the trees waving, grass blowing.\n+ The difficulty of this game is Hard, Brutal, and you're absoulutely dieing.\n+ immersion level +++\n\n- Need more ways to fight back monsters, Corner surviving at night in corner with vision blocking is fun and scary but can get really overplayed.\n- Multiplayer!\n- Game still in beta, things in work\n- Dark, too dark hard to tell if you throw something off sometimes.\n- sound is a little loud, even when turned down but its damn  good\n- Game isn't done so don't expect to finish the main story.\n- Bugs here and there but very minor\n- Characters should have voice acting to those dialogues, creepy voice acting.\n- loading time in the beginning takes a bit of time, due to generatings of the rogue-like environment even for my pc.\n- Needs auto Check for skip prologue, sometimes forgetting to hit it is annoying\n\n\nCurrently trying to pass day 4 on permadeath","July 24, 2014","true","25.8"," 151 of 187 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","151","187","0","7"

It oozes atmosphere from literally every crevice, and darkness looks and feels like a living thing, like it's out to consume you. However, once I got past the equally atmospheric prologue and was thrown out into the world to fend for myself, I started to worry. I went out and got some supplies during the day, and once night came along, I ran back to my hideout and hid. Then I did the same the next night. And the next. And the next. By day 5 I started to get bored from the constant repetition. It seemed like the only thing I had to worry about in the day was wolves, and once you get over the initial fear of being attacked, they're pretty easy. Then I'd just stand in a room in my house for a few minutes and rinse, repeat. It seemed like as long as you hid in your hideout, you were free from harm. However, not long after, the game showed it's true colors.\n\nDuring the 2nd night of my 2nd playthrough (the 1st playthrough had ended from a moment of panic and a badly misplaced bear trap), I heard something shuffling around in a room next to the one I was in. With the only light source in the whole hideout being a flare on the ground, I decided the best idea would be to go into this completely dark room to look for it. It was so dark in there that I couldn't see anything even inches away from me, which was all the distance the zombie-like creature needed to slash me in the face and take away about a third of my health. I freaked out and ran into the other room, slamming the door right in the ugly ♥♥♥♥er's face. It then proceeded to casually push open the door in less than a second. I had no intention of fighting it, so I ran away in a panic, not really registering that there was literally nowhere to run except past my flare and straight into even more darkness. Once I passed the flare my running devolved into blind stumbling, and before I could stop shoving my face into the wall trying to find the doorway, the monster hacked away at me from behind and and I fell to the ground. Dead on day 2.\n\nAll the playthroughs after that, at least one monster got into my hideout by day 4. It's basically inevitable that something will get in, I just had literal beginner's luck, and got to enjoy a few extra days of life before my so very inevitable demise. Once you realize you're not safe in your hideout, the game really succeeds at the classic survival game goal of turning you into a paranoid schizophrenic. Even in daytime, the game basically becomes 360 turn simulator 2015, with you constantly looking around to make sure there's no bear traps or wolves nearby, obscured by trees or your own narrow vision cone. And before long (like "before the first week's even over" long), you'll start to run low on supplies in the first section of the map, and will have to venture out into the more.... unsavory areas. We're talking areas where all those creatures that hack you to pieces at night occupy the WHOLE place during the day. And this isn't a game where you can level up and laugh in the faces of the enemies that used to give you trouble. Oh no, this is one of those games where you're always feeble and weak, and you either find a better weapon so you can stand a better chance against ONE enemy, or you hide from and outsmart them. Although the combat's very fair, and gives you small openings in enemy animations to attack, it's by no means easy, and you can't just murder everything in sight once you've got their patterns down.\n\nLast, the game has an amazing sense of discovery, also due in no small part to it's incredible atmosphere. Since the world feels so threatening, but you desperately need supplies, you get a mix of elation and anxiety whenever you find a new point of interest, and exploring these new places is one of the most tense parts of the game. Whether what you find in these places want to kill you or not, you'll always find something interesting and unpredictable.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a horror game where death is actually something to be afraid of, unlike, say Amnesia, where the murderous creatures managing to kill you only lowers your immersion, then this game is a gift from the heavens. And don't let the early access label scare you away, this is the most complete feeling early access game I've ever played. As it is, the game could be released right now and feel complete. It's definitely worth the buy.\n\n\nAnd yes, it is scary.","January 14, 2015","true","19.8"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","72","75","4","1"

My flashlight trained, not on the sounds of wet acidic undergrowth that has taken over what used to be the foyer to my hideout, but the splintering door hanging to its frame on the far side of the room from me.  The only taste for flare in this room is a stool I have jammed against the door as one last final barricade.  This was my last stand and I’m ill equipped to face the horrors that have been tearing their way after me all night.\nIn Darkwood, the night is a stressful 5 minutes of gameplay where you shore up your defenses and hope that the creatures of darkness don’t tear you to pieces before day breaks and you are once again free to unravel the mystery of the plague afflicting these lands.  Your only clue, a doctor who still lives somewhere nearby with the forlorn mission of curing the local villagers of their blight. The most respectable villagers’ bodies have rotted and their minds have frayed.  Their gruesomely drawn images are ghastly warning s of what happens to those who linger in the Darkwood too long, a thought that scratches at the back of my mind with each passing night spent in your hideout.  To survive you consume odd mushrooms and tainted meat which granting powers to cope with the cruel forest in which even the trees seek to claim you by clawing at your line of sight with crow laden branches.  Your tainted new powers come with a price, nauseating side effects and warped hallucinations that could be clues to what went wrong in these woods or signs that your mind is decaying like those around you.   Darkwood is a cruel game but no more than a true horror game should be, it challenges the player with every encounter but if you really want to get the full effect play on permadeath.\nDawn is almost here now, I think that I should be able to make it through the night when the doorknob turns and the door creaks ever so slowly open and rather than raining open in a hail of splinters like the horrors have done to the rest of my house.  Monsters are wiggling their way through the crack and pushing my barricade effortlessly to the side I aim my pellet gun in hopes that I can survive through one more night in the Darkwood.\n","October 16, 2014","true","30.1"," 83 of 93 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","83","93","0","0"

All of the inhabitants are after you, want something from you, or haunts you with their presence.  All are ravaged, infested with darkness, except for rabbits that hop in front of your path, scurrying away because they know too well that Darkwood is not a safe place.  It is not something you have figured out yet, but soon, you will become one with Darkwood and all of its manifestations.  One nightmare after another, you wonder if this is all a nightmare that you manifested in your mind, or is it all real?  You embark in this dark journey to put the pieces together, scavenging to survive through the night and one night only, because that is your main fear.\n\nDarkwood is a survival-horror, roguelike, sandbox game with a story.  The player can choose to venture into Darkwood using permadeath or no-permadeath.  It is highly recommended to play Darkwood with permadeath.  It increases the tension, vulnerability, and sense of dread which all add more to the atmosphere and overall experience.  Darkwood is unforgiving, merciless, and it is not for players with a weak heart.\n\nIt is important to note that Darkwood does have a story.  The player can explore, unravel secrets, and the other mysteries in the dark forest.  In your dark journey, you will meet the inhabitants of Darkwood.  The residents of Darkwood consists of different, unique, twisted individuals.  You will meet characters that you would never expect to meet in all shapes, sizes, and forms, equipped with unique personalities.  Some are informative, some of them may want or demand things in return, and some work on incentives.  They make some of Tim Burton's creations seem tame.\n\nThe visuals, art style, and graphics in Darkwood are easy on the eyes and they lend themselves to the atmosphere. The visuals are up to standard for an Indie game and especially for this particular type of game in this genre.  While walking through the forest, the shadows create imagery that look almost like hallucinations.  "Am I really seeing this? Or is that a corpse that I am seeing?"  In Darkwood, trust your instincts more than your vision.   The color palette suits the environments and the atmosphere.  It creates a dark tone and an overall sense of dread that looms over you.  Dark areas can be lit up with a light source such as a torch, a match, or a flare (items so far in the game).  They light up the path for you to explore and gain access to new areas.  But explore with extreme caution - you do not know what is around the corner.  You may step on troop of mushrooms and become poisoned.  Wander too far and you may become lost, run out of any light sources, and distance yourself further away from your base and safe haven.  But is it really safe?\n\nDarkwood is played from the top-down point of view with a cone of vision.  While the cone vision is not a light source, it does show the player what you "can see."  If a "horror" is chasing you and you are running away from it, your cone of vision will be in front of you because that is what you can only see while you are running away.  The enemy that is chasing you from behind will not be visible to you; not until it is inside your cone of vision.  Even if the foe is out of the range of the cone of vision, it will not be visible either.  This adds suspense and it makes it more challenging when you must "fight or take flight."  In Darkwood, you will need to pick your battles.  You may wonder: If it is from a top-down perspective, wouldn't you be able to see everything?  And wouldn't that reveal all of your surroundings and everything in it?  No, that is not how it works.  Your cone of vision gives you some visibility, but you will need your light source to penetrate the darkness and light your path.  The rest of the areas that is not within your vicinity will be dark.  It is not as dark as an auditorium with a spotlight on a person, but it is really dark.  Often times, you will not see an object until you get really close to it, even with a light source.\n\nSo far, there are several items that you can loot, a few weapons, and crafting recipes in Chapter 1.  I have found three weapons so far - plank with nails, an axe, and a shovel that are melee weapons.  Other helpful items that could be used as weapons or hunting, is a bear trap.  You can also make molotovs.  And with glass bottles, you can break it into shards and use it as an immobilizing trap.  One of the coolest game mechanics that I found very interesting was the use of mushrooms or cooking mushrooms turning it into a drug/chemical substance.  When you explore the forest, loot all the mushrooms that you find.  Gather them and you may have enough to fill a syringe.  Once the syringe is filled up, use the injection and it will grant you a new skill.  I thought this was a really unique game mechanic and I cannot recall it ever being used before from my knowledge of many years of gaming since the 90s.  It certainly took me by surprise and I just loved it.  Further, there are recipes hidden throughout Darkwood like a recipe to make a "lantern" that I found along the way.  This of course will require you to explore and search for the materials to craft and make a lantern.  In your inventory, you can experiment and try to combine items together to create a new item from that combination.  Just a tip:  you can eat mushrooms!  They heal you.  Also, drinking water from the well at your base will heal you as well.  Some of the most essential items are wood logs and mushrooms.  Loot them all the time.  If you find yourself running out of inventory space, craft what you can craft, and store away items at your base in the crates that you do not need at the moment.\n\nThe movement, movement speed, and combat feel fluid and responsive in Darkwood. If there is one gaming pet-peeve, that is clunky controls. You can sprint, but your character uses up stamina or endurance.  In combat, you can hit harder by simply holding the right mouse button (RMB) to pull back and swing harder.  It uses stamina as well.  You can click LMB without the hold to make a light attack.  With careful timing, while strafing, you can time your attacks while dodging attacks (there is no dodgeroll, don't worry!).  So far, I have only used melee weapons and the bear trap, although I have found a gun clip and materials to make a molotov.  Combat was surprisingly satisifying for a top-down game.\n\nYou can hear (audio, sound) every thump with every hit you land on an enemy.  Weapons do deteriorate indicated by the item going from white to red on the weapon icon.  I have found one NPC that you can trade items with and make deals.  Since there is no money currency, because why would you have any, trade is on a barter system.  For instance, if you find a piece of valuable jewelry, you can trade that for an item that you may need, or you can trade it in for information.  Other NPCs will want information as well, so you may have to search and uncover information that you could trade for an important item that may be of aid.\n\nDarkwood works on a level design system of randomly generated levels.\n\nThe audio, sound design, and soundtrack are fantastic.  The music sets the dark mood and tone.  And every crack of a melee weapon can be heard with authority.\n\nThere is so much to talk about and Darkwood is barely in Early Access with only one chapter!  As you can tell, I am very pleased with the content that is available at the moment.  It not only has surpassed my expectations, it already has me hooked with its dark charm and vast potential. I genuinely hope that they continue to support and add content to the game well after the final release.","July 25, 2014","true","4.3"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","63","69","0","8"

Never encountered a game breaking bug. The content updates are not weekly or even monthly, but it's already a great game, and they're mostly balancing it out. Personally, it's always been for the best.\n\nDarkwood is a great mix between linear progression and randomization.\n\nThe devs keep changing the game mechanics here and there, but it's never a bad thing. They want to keep you on the move, while keeping you on your toes.\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is just incredible. During the day, you watch every single footstep you make. You never know when there's going to be a creep, an angry animal or just some poisonous mushrooms for you to step on. Some people don't like it, I love it... it makes you watch your every step... every step of the way.\n\nDuring the night, you'll wish you scavenged enough wood to board up the windows that got destroyed the previous night, and just hope to god or whoever you believe in that it's going to end soon.\n\nWhile the learning curve is not always easy, the game doesn't force you to move on to more difficult areas. You can stay in the beginning area (the Meadow) for as long as you like, and come back to it and spend some time there as much as you want.

I push a cabinet on the passage, to block any of those things from coming in at night. Then I lock myself in a room I previously barricaded the window, and put broken glass outside, in the living room, to hear when something is attempting to enter. I hold my plank with nails as if it was a saint.\n\nThe night is alive, the house creeks as it breathes the unnatural night wind, a feral dog that almost killed me during the day is barking outside, as the devil himself was smiling to him. Then the dog dies with a loud screech. Something otherworldly feminine screams...  The cabinet is pushed back with a loud noise. And the only sound that will make me lose it is the broken glass being stepped on.\n\nI can't see anything in the dark, but I desperately try to, with my back to the wall to avoid unnecessary danger. Then I hear the door opening, and my hair follicles erecting on my arm tell me that something is in the room with me. It didn't make any noise on the broken glass, because it floats. It's a ghost, and its scream is hellish.\n\nDarkwood is one of those rare games, that when you purchase, you will feel an experience you'll never have, to be in another world, to suffer things that don't exist.

Monsters are everywhere, and gathering firewood becomes a frightening task. By now, you'd suspect I'm getting used to nightfall. This day I'm more prepared than any other. I've found a fireaxe on the floor of a crazed pig lady's house, and all I had to do is kill her to keep it. In this world, I'm growing used to not have sympathy for anything. In her house, I loot a bear trap still in good condition, some empty bottles, and mushrooms growing in the corners. I know by now that it's more useful to leave broken bottles on the floor as traps than thinking of carrying water. With a few belongings, I head back to my home, where the story requires me to drink from a fountain before nighttime if I am to survive.\n\nI begin preparing for the eventual nightfall. I had half a gasoline jug left, and I pour it into my generator, only for the comfort of light and electricity during the night. As for defense, I keep a room fully barricaded to keep myself safe. There are three windows, and a doorway to the rest of the house. All the windows I have covered in wooden planks, but the door I leave open, if I need to make an escape. To keep the doorway defended, I dragged over a filing cabinet from another room and placed it in front of the doorway. In front of two of the windows, I have other things blocking the way along with the wooden barricade; that being a stool and a safe. Not the best at blocking the way, but it's all I have. I scatter broken glass in front of two windows, and the bear trap on the third.\n\nDusk is now turning the world red, and I begin the final steps of preparing for the night. I turn on the generator and the lamps inside all switch on. As of now I'm still uncertain if light attracts the monsters or not, but I feel safer if I have a lamp with me. The night comes, and the well water level has risen far enough for me to take a drink. As soon as I drink, I run through the now dark house and bunker myself in the room. I push the cabinet in front door, turn on the lamp, and begin to wait in the corner.\n\nAt first, the night is quiet. I believe that this may be a safe night, and no curious monsters will want to come for me, but that soon changes. I can hear creaking coming from the hallway, and then, a knock on the door. It starts to bang, the whole room shaking, and I run as fast as I can to push against the other side of the cabinet and begin to push. Wood starts to splinter off from the door, again and again, until the door bursts open. The cabinet is still in the way. It begins to push as I push, me trying to keep it steady. Then I start to hear another windows barricade getting attacked as well. I lose control of the cabinet, and it begins to slide sideways, as I push too hard on one side and it pushes on the other. It's now in the room. I back up, turning towards the bear trap in hopes to get it caught. Then I see it, a humanoid beast split down the center, from the head to its belly, filled with blood and teeth. It's the first night that I see these types, and my strategy for them has to be learned on the spot. I raise my axe and get a direct hit. Then another hit, but this time it knicks me too. I step back, and as it leaps to me, it falls into the bear trap and gets itself killed. I didn't feel safe just yet, as the crashing from the window was over, and as I looked to the side of the room, all I could see was a broken, open window, and my piles of glass, now filled with blood, with no dead monster. It jumps me from the side, taking out half of my health. As I turn around to fight it, there turns out to be not one, but two humanoid split beasts, too much for me. By now, my heart is pounding out of my chest. I run out the door, trying to shut doors that I can, some sucessful, some not. Outside is pitch black, thundering and raining, and hopelessly I try to reach the shack with the generator.\n\nI manage to shut the door behind me. I'm bleeding out, and I left all my bandages in the room. The generator turns off. A monster hiding in the room kills me from behind.\n\nI wake up.\n\nDay 11 begins.\n\n\n\n\nEvery single day of this game is a thrilling nightmare. From exploring and trying to survive, you're always on the edge of your seat, worrying just how you're going to get killed this day, and how far can you push along the so far intriguing story. It's the first early access game that I can truly reccommend, and it is totally worth buying today.","July 29, 2014","true","8.1"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","53","58","0","1"

It is in Early Access and this means many of the features are missing, but the developers have said they will be adding plenty of more features in upcoming updates. Putting the fact that the game is not finished aside, I really can find much wrong with Darkwood. One of the main things is that I would like to see controller support. I like playing top-down games with a controller, but this doesn’t mean the keyboard controls are bad. (They are rather good) The Developers answer the question  “Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?  with this  “About a year (counting from July 2014), although that depends on a lot of things which will become clear during Early Access.” . With this info in mind, they have a long way to go in a short amount of time.\n\nPros\nProcedurally generated maps\nCrafting\nCombat feels impactful and smooth\nLeveling system\nDecent amount of graphics options\nThe main concept of Darkwood is very promising\nAmazing atmosphere\n\n\nCons\nNo controller support\nFeature are limited in this stage of development (Will be fixed in the future)\nNo tutorial (Devs say this will be added soon)\nMay be too HARD\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDarkwood is a very promising, atmospheric and insanely hard survival game. If you are into the super hard/rouge-like games, Darkwood is definitely for you. Before you buy this game, just keep in mind that it is in early access and it is missing a large amount of content at the time of writing this review.

They got close to it at first, but... almost two years later, we're only on alpha 7. Probably 8 soon. This game really hasn't made much progress, and its STILL on the first chapter.

Only a few hours in and it's everything, thus far, I've wanted it to be.  The controls are like butta and in fact maybe too much at times when you over-run something important or "teethy".\n\nFirst hours were spent exploring the general starting area to get an idea of what and where I was placed which led to quite a few moments of enjoyment as well shock and awe.  Like any good survivor I took my licks and pushed forward.  My last rest stop was with a curious old lady and an inspiring musician.  I fear I may not get back going this far as the night is quickly coming.\n\nThe game continues and likely evolves and if you have the time and the scratch (money for those younger gamers) it may be something you would like to pick up.  Optimal setup is a darkened room, quality headset and gamma set appropriately; not pumped way up in an attempt to defeat it.  Let the darkness in, let it sweep you away..\n\n[Will soon update for Alpha 3 gameplay!]","December 5, 2014","true","17.2"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","37","40","0","0"

But as it stands, I think Darkwood really delivers on a Retro-tastic, creepy video game, complete with great atmosphere, chilling cut scenes/NPCs (come on, the violin kid?!), and great music/sound.\n\nSpending the night cowering in the corner, hoping that the monsters outside won't notice your ambient light and attack barricaded doors/windows, does lend to something of a lengthy pause between "action times;" But, unlike other posters, I don't feel that the suspense is completely diminished during this time. I've had nights where nothing happened (other than creepy ambient noise throughout the night); I've had nights where something decided I needed to die, and a battle ensued.\n\nI actually like the random map feature, if only for the replay value. Sure, you'll have bad spawns where things are too clustered together, but thus far my key locations have been very well spread out (I'm STILL looking for the church in my latest game). I also like the permadeath is an option, because during a first-impression kind of session I want to see as much content as possible without replaying the same early days -- later, I'll enjoy permadeath mode.\n\nI am 100% satisfied with my purchase of the game, and the hours I've already logged. Given a LOT of Indie games I've purchased on a whim, that's 100x better than the recent experiences. I fully intend to play tomorrow and beyond, and along with the updates, while giving feedback and enjoying (or even ranting about, depending on the situation) Darkwood with my fellow players on Steam, Twitter, and elsewhere.\n\nDo I think it's worth buying? Absolutely! Do I think it has a ton of promise, moving into further development? Without a doubt. Do I think you need a little patience, a love of creepy survival-horror style games, or a nostalgic love of Retro titles to enjoy this? Not necessarilly -- but it helps (as with any other top-down, RPG style game with "older style" graphics). I happen to love all these things, but Darkwood manages to deliver with a nice, intuitive interface and play style that improves upon those classic titles.\n\nHonestly, I love it, and I can be a VERY snobbish when a developer releases "Retro" inspired games. I do wish the map was a little more useful, but at the same time it lends to the desperation/time management/frustration of wandering aimlessly through the woods. The crafting supplies (and general supplies) are not hugely abundant, and the combat isn't too easy to be challenging nor so hard that permadeath is a little too hardcore.\n\nTips:\n*Seriously... respect the mushrooms. This game could also be called, "Mushrooms -- my precious."\n\n*The second alternative title could be, "Where the @#$% am I?"\n\n*Don't assume that you can recover items you use prematurely; don't waste supplies, because unlike some games there isn't an abundance of everything you could need.\n\n*Bugs are going to happen in Alpha -- be patient, and send feedback. Come enjoy the process with the rest of us!\n\n*Embrace the fantastic atmosphere: Turn off your lights, turn up the volume, and listen to the troubling noises lurking in the shadows.\n","July 24, 2014","true","10.7"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

I push the lamp next to his doghouse to give him some comfort, I look around for something to help him. I am unable to find any bandages or aid... The dog is in serious pain and suffering badly... I found a large axe... I can't let him suffer like this... goodbye old friend...\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nNow upset about whatever did this to my dog I tear off onto a path that leads into the woods. I aggressively Paul Bunion apart a tree that has fallen and blocked my path and continue outward.

I search him and find a few supplies. The path ahead takes to a new level of darkness, The very light from my current device is engulfed by the blackness. It's similar to shining a light into the water on a dark night, its completely absorbed... I craft a torch from the supplies I picked up, now that I can at least see a bit I can proceed onward. Thick black branches reach over the path creating a canopy of sheer ere terror, I feel like there is no edges of this path, everything past the edge of my light is darkness... I keep moving\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nI've now come across what looks like an old fence leading up to the side of a building, I can see the window but its too dark to see whats inside, I swing around the side to get a closer look.

In this case, wanting to support the studio and having followed development for a while I took the plunge and bought it. And even it's current state I'm not disappointed but there's ample room for improvement.\n\nThe game evokes feelings that I haven't felt since my first playthrough of the original silent hill, the atmosphere is thick and unsettling, the player character is a little helpless but not defenseless (sometimes) and just around every corner lurks the threat of the unknown. The game succeeds in building tension and the narrative is sublimely creepy.

It's contain all the most important things: sound, game design, mystery story and nervous gameplay. Lots of interactive items and options. Awesome characters and creatures, nice weaponry arsenal. It's playable now, and i am glad that it's only alpha\nThis game is Good\nYou know, i always want to have own half-ruined house in CREEPY GOD DAMNED PLACE among forest. The start place is dark and depressive as f*ck, so i didn't even expect that it's REGULAR DAY. I was running around my house trying to grab everything that i can find, when suddenly it seemed to me that environment gets darker. Then i ran to sawmill, then to my room,then i start to barricade door and near windows in panic. Generator wasn't turned ON. I sit over 10 minutes in fear, awaiting some sh*t, and i get it, as soon as i understand that i sit whole DAY here! I am goes mad when it's start to  REALLY GETTING DARK !\nI won't tell you what the sh*t actually happens at night, but it's f*king creepy. Don't even know. You never know what will come to you, together with night.. Will it's just big dogs or mutants, that will crush your barricades and rip you? Okay, you always can barricade yourself pretty, and keep surviving to get serious weapons and light sources.. But what if this night you will be visited not by monsters, but something other? Something, that can go through doors, windows and lights? Listen to the silence of the night... Look through barricaded windows and fog behind them... Can you hear whispers, quiet cry of lonely woman?\n\nBut don't worry, man with wolf's head and AK47 will help you, and also, give you some bullets. For half of your poor inventory, of course.\n\nEven in alpha, every night prolongs game pretty good. Hope developers will continue to make this game. There's only 1 chapter in game right now.

No ridiculous jump scares, no overused appearances. Just amazing atmosphere and the fact that once you die, it's all over, just like in most rogue-likes. It's unforgiving and punishing, challenging and at the same time very immersive and eerie. Every house you go into is a possible death trap for our dear, faceless protagonist and the game lets you know that very well. You are not the hero here, you're not the tough guy. Every single enemy poses a threat and no, not the type that scratches a tad of your HP. I'm talking about killing you easily, from simple wild dogs to deformed walking monstrosities.\nEven though the game is 2D, the artwork is wonderful and the characters you meet and engage in dialogue with feel very alive. The writing is good and the animations, both while in dialogue and in combat/walking/inventory management and so on are of high quality. Even though it is 2D, do not be tricked, you know nothing of what is going on and it will take keen and careful observation of your surroundings in order to live to see another day.\nThe story is very interesting and can easily catch your attention, although progressing through the story is not easy, as the tasks to success are packed with things you'd rather not see.\n\nThe developers have done a truly amazing job and even though the game is currently in alpha, it is very much playable. I can only imagine what they have in store for us with the finished product.","July 26, 2014","true","39.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","10"

"finished", sometimes expensive survival horror games out there today.\nIts also very polished, and by far the most bug free and functional pre-release game ibe seen. The only reason you know its an unfinished/early access game is because it sais so on the main menu. If they removed this legend you really wouldnt notice, as i have yet to find a serious bug or problem with the game.\n\nIt has great atmosphere, great immersion, smart & simple crafting mechanics, ZERO handholding (key for a survival game), no "objective markers", "magic GPS like" positioning on the map (you actually need to keep track of where you are or youll get lost & die!), This game actually makes you feel "uneasy" (or just plain scared if you scare easy) during the nights, when you are standing in the corner of your room, behind your barricades & traps, praying that they manage to keep the evil creatures outside.\n\nAnother thing i like is that besides being a survival game it has a story. I have not finished the game yet, but so far i like the story.\n\nBasically (setting the story aside) the gameplay is you need to explore the map to find resoruces (gas, wood, metal parts, building materials, etc) to secure your house for the night, and you must do this during the day, as going out at night is suicide. Then setup your defences and survive the night, the time when ghosts, monsters and evil creatures (no zombies this time THANK GOD!), will try to get inside your house and kill you.\nDo you turn the generator on for some light in the night (at the expense of gas)? or do you set traps, barricades and stay perfectly still on a corner IN COMPLETE DARKNESS without making noise, hoping they wont notice you? Either way you need to remember you are not some kung-fu expert, RPG welding rambo who can kill anything, and the best way to survive is to avoid combat as much as possible, so if you want a combat game, this is NOT it. This one is about smarts, survival, planning and managing your time wisely.\n\nI almost forgot, if you think that because this game is "top down view" youre gonna be able to exploit this to your advantage (like see whats behind you), youre in for an un-pleasant surprise. You have a vision "cone", and tough you can see the map arround you, can only see whats in front of you. Just like you would in a First person game.\n\nIf you like survival horror games, you will most likely love this one. Be warned thoug, its game is HARD. like i said there is no handholding, no "radar" or "minimap" and one wrong call might me your last.\n\n10/10 totally recommended!","January 4","true","30.9"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","0"

When I first got into the game it was a little weird to be because I've personally never played a game with this perspective before, but once i got the hang of it and found myself venturing into the creepy woods, I saw how immersive this game was. With the creepy noises of stepping on branches and the barks of rabid dogs I found myself scared for my life. This game also has a really nice crafting system where you can find abundant items like clothe and wood and mix it with some more rare items found in chests to make very useful items to use to your advantage or sell to the wolfman for ammo or other items. The lighting sysetm in this game is genius as well, where in a house your flashlight only shows a little of the room but when u turn on a lamp it brightens most of the room where you are looking. And when you explore the woods your light grows dimmer and dimmer the further you go until you need to craft a torch to see anything. some minor bugs were found in the game but you must expect that from a Early Access game. With all this in mind I give this game probably a 9.5/10 in its current state because of how amazingly done this game was. The immersion effect of this game is close to if not better than the Amnesia series and even the Slender games.

I'm not kidding everything about the sound for this game is 10/10\n\n2: Its a 2D game that made me slam me knee into my desk because of a jump scare, dude bonus points. like how does that even happen?\n\n3: An early access game that is actully fun and the devs care about so it will get better.\n\n4: NPCs and differnt locations\n\n5: A interesting level up system (This is also a con) with the ability to choose various perks, both negitive and positive.\n\n6: I dig the graphics on this.\n\nCons:\n\n1: Remember the negitive perks I mentioned? Well the first negitive one is ruinous to the game, it is down right horrible. If you're in the dark to long "Shadows" start damaging you. In a game where light source is limited this is a horrible idea. The looping sound effect and forcing you to be in the light completely takes away the scare factor. The devs NEED to ditch this idea.\n\n2: Poisonous mushrooms. OK this one is right up there with the shadows in the "Devs why on this good green Earth would you do that?!" department. They are EVERYWHERE and touch them and BOOM, you're either gonna move slower or be somewhat blind. On top of that you will be poisoned, do we really need all these exploding mushrooms?\n\n3: There is so much blur and bloom in the distance its almost light having poor vision and it kinda hurts your eyes a bit.\n\n4: I have played this game for 4 hours at this point, so I dunno I have prolly been through I'd say around 8 nights. Never once has something tried to attack me in my hideout. No busting down doors, no running, no fighting. Although once I heard something murder a dog outside the door (Which was freaking creepy and fantastical by the way.)\n\n5: For God sake man, let me at least punch. I mean for real, he has been given a fist for a reason, use it.\n\n6: Not being able to harvest items is a really kind of frustrating but I would assume we would be able to in the future.\n\n7: Due to number 6 con, the crafting system is a pain.\n\nThe Con of every horror game ever made: The protagonist being quite out of shape, only being able to run 20 feet without wanting a whopper.\n\nMixed feelings: The well mechanic of the... Each night you must drink from "The well" to keep yourself from decaying each night. While I like that it forces you to go outside each night I hate the fact that I have to get to it in a short time of when "The thirst starts." As I said I love that you can't be a weiner waiting for dawn inside, but I want to explore at night. Like if there was night only quests that would be awesome.\n\nIn short, its early access, its already fun. I can almost say for certain the devs will improve this game. (Step one less mushrooms and remove the freaking shadows.)\n\nI'd recommend this game and I'd say it a good idea of how EA should work.

You can barricade your shelter. you can smash bottles to alert you of enemies when they walk on them and set traps to keep them from getting you for only so long. But what you WILL do is wish for night to end, pitch black, noises rustle in the darkness as things bump in the night. The game gives you a perfect sense of living in a nightmare and needing to keep yourself in check at every twig snap and distant growl. And when things are quiet the twistedness of the game never ceases, you will be forced to take companionship (or not) in the few mutated characters that remain "sane" and friendly towards you allowing you to trade and share gossip about the world you will be staying in. Of course you can kill these people at you leisure, but it never realy helps to kill the few things that seem sane, if not ever so slightly. The game allows you to choose how you wish to handle things.\n\nDurring the night sagments the character must go home to not only seek shelter from the chaos of the night but to drink from a well to stay alive or they will die slowly and painfully from "the thirst", the well however is a mystery as to why your character needs the water from it. While you're at the house you will be able to combine the mutated mushrooms you find in the wild to inject yourself with mutations to give you new abilities (and weaknesses later on) that allow you to pick and choose what you think will help you best as your body changes for the "better".\n\nThe crafting system is pretty deep even for Alpha, allowing yout to craft molotovs, pellet guns, laterns, torches, bandages, The typical survival stuff. oddly enough the character dosent need to eat so cooking food and crafting that isent a thing. (Yet?)\n\nMy first time playing was pretty nerve destroying, I ended up getting attacked by an enemy (You're no tank of course) and going into a bleeding state, so my first instinct is to run the hell away leaving a massive blood trail as they swarmed me. Some sort of mutated crab things. Paniced I ended up running through some poisonous mushrooms to further add insult to injury. Coming up upon the games starter house I took a sharp turn around a tree, got caught in a bear trap. My character freaked out and tried his best to remove his foot from the thing, Night time approached as my characters vision cone was gone, busy looking at his feet to get the trap off. Before I knew it I was swarmed in the darkness.\n\nAnd thats the end of the first time I played.\n","July 27, 2014","true","31.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

Allies, enemies or neutral NPC's are all richly crafted with impressive art styles.  Even the clues you find around the world are often unnerving.  It's in Early Access with only one chapter available but the game offers hours of intrigue and 'side quests' to complete each with their own rewards and/or consequences.  Each one feels like a new faustian deal.\n\nAll enemies are potentially lethal but with the right knowledge and preparation they can be ended just as fast as they can end you.  But one mistake can cost you dearly.  Surviving the nights and managing your resources carefully in a hostile environment adds to the tension of your imprisonment with these monsters.\n\nThe game also offers a double edged perks and flaws system.  The more you dose yourself up with the mutagenic flora the more potent perks you gain access to but with those perks come equally debilitating flaws.  The choice of how deep you wish jump into this doomed progression is completely up to you.\n\nAs a long term fan and writer of supernatural thrillers and atmospheric stories I recommend this game to those also interested in such.  Despite its simple appearance and modest development team it follows through.","June 16, 2015","true","92.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

But be warned, this game isn't for the faint hearted. But if you're looking for a great blend of survival and horror, this game may be what you're looking for, even in it's early alpha stage the game has quite a lot of content and replayability for you to enjoy.\n\nThe thrill of this game comes from a blend of sources, one being your own paranoid fear. The game has absolutely amazing atmosphere and uses a mixture of sounds, graphics and in-game mechanics to trigger and sustain a terrifying sense of forboding. Every day is spent preparing, preparing for the coming days, preparing for your future expeditions, preparing for the terrifying night to come and each update brings with it, it's own small sense of dread as you wonder whether or not it'll be a small fix or something that adds another horror for you to expeirence.\n\nWhat little titbits of the game's universe I have expeirenced thus far have helped to produce a fractured but vivid scene of horror and mystery. Playing this game I feel compelled to save and quit, shelf it for another day due to the eerie vibe and horrors, but my curiosity gets the better of me and promotes me to push on for just one more day and since surviving each night, despite it's lack-luster tasks needed to do such a thing early on in the game, feels like an over-whelming achievement at first, it's hard to not take advantage of the day light you've just 'earned'.\n\nI maybe over-selling this title with cheap emotive writing, but I have a love and bias for horror games with a terrifying atmosphere and this game fits in that category perfectly. Regardless, if I've interested you in any way, I strongly suggest you take a look at a more objective review of the game before deciding, as my goal with this review was to give you my emotive perspective after enjoying the title for a bit rather than my objective perspective. As always, knowledge and experience is a fear killer, so try to avoid looking at spoilers and playstyle guides until you get to experience a few days in-game by yourself first! Though if you're anything like me, the thrilling sense of forboding will always be there in some form or another.","September 23, 2015","true","11.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Traveling due north, for fear of getting lost, I come upon a labyrinth of shrubbery. Deciding to take it upon myself to delve into the laberenth in search of loot, I enter. After losing myself for a while, I found what I've looking for, a chest. Picking the lock, I open the chest and rejoice. However my rejoice was short lived, the sun was setting.

I look to my feet and see several skittering bugs. Suddenly I noticed my health being leeched away from me, thats when I saw the growths around my feet. I took a step to the left thinking it wouldnt alert passers by on the other side of the door. The sun rose.

Then all of a sudden, you hear a scream, and what's that? Your furniture is moving all by itself. It's ok though, you're safe, in your barricaded room and there's only another few minutes of night time left. Oh, wait, they're knocking on your door, you can see the barricade splinter...It's fine, daylight will save you. Argh, but here they come, relentlessly banging on your door and it's one hit away from being broken. Phew, daylight is here, but you have no wood left to barricade yourself in when night time comes again. You have no weapon so you need to go out into the woods to scavenge and prepare yourself, but you know they're lurking out there too.\n\nDarkwood does this brilliantly, it builds up so much tension that even when nothing is going on, you're still on edge. Sure, there are a few bugs still in the game, but it's an early Alpha release, and the devs have acknowledged that a few things here and there need to be fixed.\n\nDon't let the bugs take away from what is a stunning survival game, and a survival game that builds up the horror through it's atmosphere like no other that I've played recently. Reminiscent of the old Silent Hill games in the way that it builds tension, it builds you up and then knocks you down but it's not frustrating.  You don't mind meeting your maker, even though you lose your precious mushrooms, because you learn a little each time you die.\n\nThe game looks beautiful, the lighting is glorious and really helps set the tone when you're out to discover new things.  Your cone of vision can either help you out or destroy you if you're not vigilant enough, but it's something you get used to after a while.\n\nThe crafting system works nicely, and is clear and easy to use, but sometimes the amount that you can carry becomes a little bit of a problem, that said, it doesn't take away too much from the experience.  If anything, the frustration is outweighed by the fear that you won't have enough to survive the night, making the game more tense.\n\nThe world is randomly generated on each play through so you will never get tired of exploring the same old places again and again.\n\nThe characters in the game thus far have enough depth to influence how you behave toward them, but enough mystery that you never really know what to expect from them the NPCs are great fun to come up against whether you're ready to fight them or not.\n\nDarkwood is something that any survival horror fan should try out and if at first it seems a little slow, I'm sure that it will grow on you and eventually you will approach each night filled with terror and worry that you've missed something and they can get in your safe house while you're completely defenseless because you didn't have time to craft a new weapon before you had to lock yourself in.\n\nIf you're still unsure whether to get the game or not, then please check out my playthrough and see how I experienced the night terrors (and the day terrors for that matter) and then form your own opinions, and hopefully learn from my mistakes if you do decide to get the game!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu_isSnkgGw&list=PLsbPERuyqhxzTT5boLH8lsNwG6W7NYllF&index=1","October 25, 2014","true","30.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

When I first played this game, it scared me so beyond my wits' end that I didn't play for another half a year. Implying that I played Darkwood again (credit goes to my girlfriend who just loves horror games - and seeing me die a little, ongoingly), I reinstalled the game and began tackling this monster.\n\nHonestly, I adored Don't Starve for its unique gameplay and mechanics but I always felt like it lacked optimisation; Darkwood hits the genre right on the head and then doubles on that in its atmosphere.\nDarkwood is brutal. Darkwood is complex. Darkwood is full of intrigue, plot (which is unique in this genre), very interesting combat mechanics as well as stealth mechanics, mystique--but mostly, Darkwood is tantalising~.\n\nThe only catch is: you'll want to read a community guide for the basics - the game is still in Alpha (I can't believe that there's more content and polish to come...), so it doesn't have a tutorial entirely.\n\nBuy this game--it's damn cheap for one of the best games you'll ever play.","June 5, 2015","true","45.2"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","0"

The game forces you to rely on hearing to determine locations of enemies invading the abandoned building you use as a safe house. The forest is so thick you and your neighbors are trapped without escape. Sometimes you hear a monster in the night, sometimes you hear a npc going mad screaming into the night.

This game has the atmosphere of stalker, with amazing sound design and oppressive lighting the moment I started the game I could feel the game assaulting my nerves and playing with my mind. The woods are amazing it constantly feels as though the woods themselves are your primary antagonist and your deadliest enemy, not the monsters you encounter in them.

My favorite genre is rogue-like, survival, and strategy, so low and behold this would be of interest to me.\n\nI know what survival games entail. Luck and balls. Walk out, get the stuff, get back before dark. Not much to it, but it's still entertaining. The one thing games like that, in general, lack is reality. Darkwood takes things some much further and differently.\n\nDarkwood is the freeroam, pain-stakingly hard game I've searched for for a long time. They play on fears, and best of all, make things very new and real. Everything is made to scare you. Your map is realistic, where you don't have your exact locations, but you navigate via landmark. Combat is difficult, fair, aggrivating, and rewarding. Permadeath features (the rogue-like special) keeps things fresh and more valuable.

Some demonic things are going on in the woods and danger is behind every..... tree. As I understand only one chapter is finished as of right now otherwise it's just a giant sandbox to play. This game has great potential. I recomend it. If you wait for full game so be it,  just give it a go sometime. You won't regret it! If you do buy it early access, you will be happy to know it runs smoothly, and I haven't seen any game breaking issues as of right now. Only thing I hope they implement is controller support. It feels as though it's meant to be played dual stick.","July 27, 2014","true","15.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

This game will keep you wide awake at night & in the morning (from experience). I get so scared in the house/cabin at night even when I'm protected with traps, weapons & barricades because if I move I'm scared they will find me XD I just make a base with my supplies,wardrobes & light sources in a small room or corner in the house. Even in the day the sound of anything makes you paraniod. Better get to your house in time! Don't want to get stuck in the rain expecially at night you need that water from the well at night The devs put effort into this masterpiece MASTERPIECE!!!\nThis great team of game developers should make more games like this in the future..........maybe perhaps a multiplayer or co-op game?

I have had it since 3.1 and have been paying attention to its development ever since. The psycological horror in this game puts you on edge and many other games out there dont have that type of horror. However the ones that do, dont do it as good as Darkwood does. In the first two zones of the game (Dry Meadow, Silent Forest) you have relatively good safety during the day and are crying in a corner at night. Just be ready for the Old Woods. This area has roaming chompers even during the day. At night you will constantly question your survival and you might even become paranoid. Just make sure you dont feel like a badass when you get a gun, cause those chompers will charge you and f*ck you up even if you have a line of sight. Whenever this game is updated i get pretty excited and cant wait to see what they added. The bad side though and i hate to critizize the people who made this, but they need to spend more time on this game's development. So many people think they abandoned it and dont give it any attention because of its largely spaced out updates. I mean for christ's sake, the description of the game says it will be released in 2015 (Last Year). I really hope in the future they will put more time into the game. I know they are trying to perfect the story, but this is just unacceptable with the amount of time it has been taking. It has been in early access for 2 years. Overall, if your looking for a game that mixes constant psychological horror with a threatning task of survival, this is the game for you. Just be prepared to wait until this game is done which will most likely take another year.","March 16","true","66.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Really I played it for 10 hours the first day I got it. It's like silent hill except without a linear plot. Basically the protagonist's job is to do what any human being in the same situation would do: gather supplies, find information, survive and try to escape. Additionally the angles don't deter from the creepiness or the shock factor.

Modern day 'survival horrors' have this awful habit of spoon feeding players with abundant resources and frequent saving opportunities. This isn't the case with Darkwood; you have to scavenge for what little you can and you will struggle. The devs have done a brilliant job of balancing this game and ensuring that, all the while, you are absorbing the creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe style and overall feel of the game is a real tribute to old-school survival horrors. The visual effects are dark and gloomy; the music and sound effects are eerie and build the perfect amount of tension. Hearing an enemy breaking your barricades in the silence of the night is truly terrifying. The controls are a refreshing change and combat is challenging, but engaging and actually quite fun.\n\nAlthough at the stage of posting my review we're only able to play the first chapter of the storyline, I can confidently say that you are immediately drawn in to the true spirit of the survival horror genre. Yes this game is challenging and yes you'll probably die a few times on your first try, but it's a welcome change.\n\nI'll be keeping a close eye on updates to Darkwood. The devs are actively improving this game and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us. Even from playing just the first chapter I am intrigued to know more about what happened in Darkwood.","November 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Version at time of writing: Alpha 7.1\n\nTL;DR: One of only two Early Access games I didn't feel cheated out of my money on, and in fact highly recommend. Please fund these guys.\nDarkwood, from The Acid Wizards, is based on atmosphere and tension. Rather than resorting to jump-scares it relies on psychological horror and organic scares in the sandbox. It's also a game whose mechanics are kinda hard to describe or summarize without spoiling. But I'll try:\n\nThis top-down title achieves 'scariness' partly due to great artistic style and sound design, but mechanically it's because of your line-of-sight - the way that light and your LOS interact to affect your ability to see in the dark is reminiscent of the foreboding feeling most people got from Silent Hill 2's fog.\nSpeaking of darkness, Night is probably the most important mechanic other than light and sight so far. At the end of each day one must survive through the night. Hide in a corner behind a wardrobe you dragged over and barely scrape by - or take the fight to those who would hunt you, and enjoy the spoils of war. Combat is rather precise and unforgiving like the Souls games or CRAWL, but in sandbox fashion can mostly be avoided by hiding well or fleeing. Firearms are an expensive resource, but will give those struggling with melee far more than just an edge.\n\nBy day, you explore the world for crafting items and NPCs using landmarks automatically marked on your map once close enough. Some landmarks and areas have function or loot, others are solely for navigation. The shape of the world and the location of, and loot in, each setpiece changes each new game (with few exceptions). Combined with the permadeath difficulty, a very satisfying rogue-like experience is available.\n\nWhen story isn't extracted in a Dark-Soulsian way (by the player inferring things from the environment), it comes from artistic cinematics, or the flavourful NPCs. While they communicate in small walls of text, they're aided by an unsettlingly animated portrait. This is shared with the greater world, where some lootable bodies, hostile flooring, items needed for XP, and even some idle enemies have strange and twitchy, but creepily organic animations.\n\nAt current the game's first chapter ends rather abruptly, leaving the player to free-roam the map, but this is somewhat made up for by the number of places one can explore, and the bi-monthly(-ish) updates that either provide a shovel of new content or reworked game mechanics, requiring players to find more efficient playstyles under new rules.\n\nSummary: Darkwood might be an incomplete game with [literally:] one or two flaws, but I believe the art, atmosphere, gameplay, and effort are more than worth anyone's time. I'd put it on-par with a few of Steam's other indies like Nuclear Throne, CRAWL, or The Curious Expedition, in that playing Darkwood is doing yourself a service.","February 8","true","77.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I'll start the basics.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGood, but a bit choppy (probably due to my computer) and a few glitches here and there. But considering it's still in Alpha, that's looking pretty optimistic. Combat is tough to get the hang of, but satisfying when you finally land a powerful blow right on that annoying mutant wolf's snout. I can't seem to figure out whether the game wants to punish you for or encourage you to explore and experiment.\n\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nExcellent 2D graphics that add even more to the game's already gripping atomsphere, but due to my terrible computer I have to run it at the lowest resolution.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE:\n\nSuperb. The eerie sounds of the forest blend with the crunching of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath your feet to form a permating feeling of spookiness. The enemies are a perfect mix of weird and downright freaky, and I found myself fighting the nearly irresistable urge to turn around and flee while exploring some areas. I jumped at nearly every out-of-place sound, especially at night.\n\n\nSTORY:\n\nWhile I have encountered very little plot to speak of so far, the game is very early in development, and I assume much more will be added in the near future. I also think there's quite a bit that I haven't yet discovered on my map.\n\n\nOverall, I give the game a solid 9/10.

This is hands down the most crafted, perfected, and enjoyable early access experience that has been released in the history of steam's early access system.  I have dumped around 17 hours into the game, and I would check in and play a little after every update to see the changes that have been made.  Amazingly, the devs have kept up incredibly well with updates, and in the many months that I have owned this title, it has become a very different game, and all for the better.  The atmosphere is incredible and haunting right down to the core.  This is aided by the fact that your character has a limited cone of view.  How so, you might ask?  Though you can see things like trees and large rocks outside of the cone, you cannot see things like items, characters, or enemies, meaning that one of the many creative and challenging enemies in the game can still sneak up and attack you if you are careless.  The way this is implemented is masterful to say the least.\n\nThe game demands that you be conservative with your resources, often making you choose between upgrading your weapon, upgrading your workbench to allow you to create more weapons and items, or fortifying your base to keep the mutated nightmares at bay once the sun goes down.  And the night time changes everything in the game.  Whereas in the day you can travel in relative safety and strategically kill or avoid most enemies that you come accross, the night turns you into the prey of the creatures that lurk through the forest.  Not only will monsters invade your home and attack you at night, but depending on whether or not you have any fuel in your generator, dark shadows will close in on you and kill you, and are a threat that can only be fought off with a light source.  While the early game will find you cowering in your home praying for morning light, you will later gather the resources and the courage to venture from your home at night, during which special and unique items and resources may be collected.\n\nLastly, the sound design: HOLY HELL, the sound design in this game is PERFECT.  From the hair raising squeal that grounded objects such as stools and wardrobes make when dragging them accross the floor to the haunting moans and screaches of the night, this game will keep you scared and on your toes, especially at night.  Take it from me, when you are cowering in your room with the door baricaded with the wardrobe while not straying more than two feet from your light source, and then you hear the slow creaking of the other doors of your home opening at the will of murderous, rabid invaders, you will feel a fear for your life the likes of which very few games can produce.\n\nIf I were to summarize this game in one statement, I would say that this is the most fun I've had from a horror game since Dead Space.  At $15, this game is currently an absolute steal, and even more so when the final version is released.  If you want a horror experience that is original, extremely well produced, and scary as all hell, do yourself a favor and PICK THIS GAME UP.","July 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Not a native speaker here, sorry!), so don´t look on gameplays much, if you want to buy it.\n\nThe camera from the birds point of view is also very nicely done, like for example when you are stranded in the forest, you can see the branches of the trees and fallen trees and the effects like: lights and shadows in buildings are very nice. There is also physics, that adds interesting mechanics like: pushing various objects to barricade yourself from an enemy that is chasing you,\nor pushing against doors when something tries to walk in.\nAlso you can barricade with planks and nails of course, when you have the time.\nOr if you throw something it will slide on the ground, so you can see the physics in action.\nYou can also run into the doors to break them open, when you are running from an enemy.\n\nIt has of course a good amount of bugs or glitches, like light problem when some parts of the forest will flicker for a second so you can´t see, and also dissapearing enemies, that occured to me quite often with chompers.\nTo explain you the glitch/bug: Sometimes when it was chasing me it would dissapear and stopped attacking until I bumb into it accidentally or look in other direction for it, then it would quickly appear and almost kill you or start chasing you)\nAlso I would change the fighting system a bit (it is really hard to hit something with the axe and or shovel, because it just takes too long to ''charge'' the attack) and breaking of the melee weapons (they break unnecesearly/unrealistically often) and the crafting system is very small and simple, maybe add more variety and complexity, like new barricading structures and weapons.\n\nThe developers are quite active and responsive also the updates are every month (more or less).\nSo everything will get better and the game will get bigger after some time.\nThe developers will have to do their best as the game is far from completion.\n\nAlso this game is rather hard and will not hold your hand.\nThere is a prologue, that will teach you few things, but then you are on your own and you will have to act like you would act in that situation, you must adapt to it.\n\nIf you are searching for some new horror-survival game and if you are a fan of deep atmosphere and story games, that is not only about the blood/gore and jumpscares GO FOR THIS ONE, you won´t regret it!","January 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

The epilogue (which is absolutely brilliant) gives you some basic hints as to how combine items, interact with the environment, swing an axe and that is basically it. Then you wake up in a shabby old house with one wall missing, meet a mysterious wolf-man and head out to explore.\n\nAnd you die.\n\nThen you wake up again, make a mental note not to ♥♥♥♥ off any dogs, and set out again.\n\nThen you die once more – another note made – and you already know it’s going to be one hell of a ride.\nThing is, the game is rather difficult and at times can be truly challenging and unforgiving. However, If you die, you die because you made (a) mistake(s), because you were unprepared or just because you lacked experience (and I don’t mean leveling your character). It takes time to get the hang of it and actually start surviving for a change, but then again this learning process is damn rewarding  – no one is holding your hand, nobody tells you where to go and what to do. Thus, every little accomplishment feels good. Really good.\n\nDarkwood is all about exploration, survival and atmosphere. The world is a twisted, dream-like place (partially randomized) where you’re bound to get lost. There is a map,  yes, but your current location is not marked on it. You have to pay attention to landmarks, remember where you’re going and where you came from. Otherwise you won’t be able to make it home before nighttime. And, believe me, you don’t want to be out when the night comes. You want to barricade yourself at the (not-at-all) safe-house, set some traps, hide in a corner and hope to gods the monsters leave you be. And perhaps cry a little as you hear scratching, howling, barking and what not coming from the other side of the wall. If the monsters do get in and you find yourself poorly equipped, you’re dead. You feel surrounded and helpless, and yet ready to try your hardest to make your stand until morning when all the horrors disappear like a bad dream. Sometimes the nights can be soothingly calm, but you’ll keep sitting in that corner of yours all tense, anticipating the worst. Sometimes a banshee just walks around your hideout, opens doors and move pieces of furniture around, not doing much harm (unless you attack) and still scaring the living crap out of you. You never know what to expect and it makes the whole experience even better.\n\nIf you happen to survive the night, you’ll wander off again to replenish resources (which are scarce and don’t respawn), eventually venturing into darker, more dangerous parts of the forest. There are guns (some are difficult to find though) but don’t get trigger-happy as ammo is hard to obtain and expensive. You’ll be forced to go melee most of the time. And, don’t get me wrong, you’ll probably try to avoid fighting all together anyway. This is NOT a beat’em up kind of game. Dying is easy.\n\nIt is also NOT a horror game as such. The mood is heavy but don’t expect cheap jump scares. There might be some, as your cone of vision (another sweet idea) allows you to see only a bit of what’s in front of you and leaves you exposed to all sorts of dangers lurking in the darkness, but it is not scripted. If you get jump-scared, it’s because you were not careful enough. Most of the times.\n\nThe game in its current version (1.3) offers only the prologue and the first chapter but it is a fairly long trip and holds great replayability value. Also, it might be the most polished and bug-free alpha game I have ever played and I have played quite a few. Give it a try and see for yourself.\n","August 12, 2014","true","75.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I was impressed by how not-early-access it felt. Many games these days are released as early access, people pay money, and they get a messy incomplete game. Like The Fifth Day for example. Darkwood is not like these games that just seem like a cash-grab for developers. The game thus far is very well made. I don’t recall encountering a single bug, there’s actually story, and there are things to do! I was really impressed by how well the developers, Acid Wizard, captured a creepy, eerie, dark essence to the game. It really immerses you into this freaky, weird place. The game is also very challenging, it is not a brainless walk in the park by any means. In fact, I struggled to even get much of anywhere into the questing and story in the six hours I played. I am not sure why but I could not find the violin boy’s parents house at all. The “not far” part of the message is misleading because I searched everywhere the entire time I played (two different games) and never could find it. Perhaps it is just the luck of the randomly generated world, a feature I think makes this game fun and adds a lot of replay value.\n\nOverall, the game in its current state is solid and worth the $15 price tag. If you’re a fan of darker survival games, I recommend giving Darkwood a try.","July 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is beautifully done, even though it is in an Alpha state, and has a great story telling experience that keeps the player hungry for more. I highly recommend this title for anyone who enjoys surviving against mind-bending monstrosities, loves feeling vulnerable during survival experiences, and enjoys twisted visions of a gloomy forest atmosphere.

So here it is:\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10 - Oh boy the graphics! By far the best rogue-like graphics I have ever seen. the dark, creepy and grainy effects really put you on edge... Not to mention how void of colour it is (Not a bad thing as it helps the tension and atmosphere) and oh god the lighting is amazing...\n\nGameplay: 8/10 - the crafting is very straightforward, but efficient, the combat is very tough. I struggled on my first enemy! (MLG) But it works. It also really reminded me of RE4 (Resident Evil 4) which is one of my fav survival horrors out there.\n\nSoundtrack 9/10 - Wow. That's the only way to describe the amazing soundtrack. Just, Just WOW.\n\nBugs 9/10 - I've only spotted a couple bugs so far.. text out of place,etc.\n\nOptimization - 8/10 - Man it's good.

This is one of the first games i've seen that make it absolutely imperitive to return to home base every night and it adds a sense of urgency and panic when night begins to set.  Nighttime, while easily one of the most difficult parts of the game, loses it's horror scariness but nothing gets you more panicked in this game than when you have no weapons and you hear something beating in your barricades.  to any survival/horror game player, i would recommend this 10 times out of 10 and i eagerly await the updates to come.","November 19, 2014","true","7.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game takes an underrated perspective, and makes it work well again. Most games that have been released with such an art direction as well as perspective have been highly lack luster. this game marries the concept of ambience(via lighting, audio and environment generation) with the idea of having a false sense of awareness in the space that you currently occupy to create a sense of fear that has been hard to find since the original resident evil games. notably, this game is a true Survival Horror game with a psychologically engaging story told in the most spectacular way. The story is told in a very david lynch~ish style, similar to hotline miami.... but lets not make that mistake and get the two mixed up as they are both two extremely different game.\n\nto cut everything else I would say short... because there is plenty I can say about this game...\nGet it... It is definatly worth its price tag in its current state... the story will build an anxiety that will make you beg the developers to some how travel into the future, steal the finished copy... and release it now... which would cause some sort of crazy ♥♥♥ paradox. the gameplay is soooo solid in its current state... I wonder what else they will add as I am quite satified with it as is. and last... The sense of fear and just truely feeling lost at times in the forest is truely nerve racking especially as night fall comes.\n\nKey Elements:\n~Intense Combat Mecanics which are also used to interact with the environments in various ways.\n~Object interaction... Multiple options to interact with objects via "drop Down menu" like most D&D games.\n~Lighting, Creates a horrifying tone espeially when the developers literally take all light away during the night... Insanely scary, dont change that.\n~Atmosphere, The sound creates a dread that will haunt you and keep you on edge for your entire play through.\n~sense of exploration, The map system is actually an interesting one as you have no idea where you are until you discover something aside from your hideout... giving you a "sense of direction, It totally works for this game.\n\nGet this game... its worth yur time and money..\n\n~Mike.M\n\np.s.\nsorry for the late review, I bought the gae over the summer... looooved it... and played it recently and just...

It feels like you’ve stepped into a Silent Hill storyline, but crafted by David Lynch.\nThis makes exploration a much more enjoyable experience as uncovering parts of the story really add depth to the game\nThe game is really difficult, which adds A LOT to the tension of each decision you make. The lack of resources and constant sense of dread creates an experience similar to playing Dark Souls, except just way scarier (quite a feat, I know).\nRandomly generated maps help with the sense of disorientation each time you play and adds to the replayability of the title.\nThe crafting aspect to the game is very deep and intuitive. As I mentioned before, resources are limited, so finding a stockpile of items is a very rewarding experience.\nCrafting also lends itself to the defense building that needs to occur every game night, which if you find yourself itemless during well… just make sure you have plenty of wood and nails.\nThe music and ambient noise is appropriately creepy and adds to the horror of playing.\nCombat is easy to grasp and works very similarly to Hotline Miami, which can lead to some frantic combat scenarios.\nThe intentional lack of hand-holding in the beginning of the game can create a constant sense of discovery not unlike Don’t Starve.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nAs expected for an early access title, the game has bugs and glitches which can ruin the immersion at times. Though definitely not as bad as other early access titles.\nOne example of a bug was a loading problem, which caused some difficulty picking up where I left off when trying to access a saved game. This has since been addressed.\nAnother bug (as the dev team has referred to it as such in the forums) is the excruciatingly long initial world generation time. I had thought that the game had crashed the first time I played, though stuck around luckily due to the music still playing. This is something they are working on.\nCurrently only Chapter One is available, which is bad only because I want more of this amazing game!\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?\n\nNo… Just no.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nI finished what was currently available, which was Chapter One.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\nThe content that is currently offered is well worth the asking price of $14.99. The experience is a horror game fan’s terrifying bliss. Darkwood has mysteries around every corner, frightening sounds you feel like you imagined, fearsome creatures that don’t relent, frenzied combat that leaves you breathless, and panicked defense building which all come together to create a phenomenal gaming experience. Knowing there is more to come is just icing on the cake.\n\nA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:\nwww.gamersglance.com","August 17, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only things here are some nails and boards, and that rusty old bear trap on the wall...\n\nDay 2\nIt started last night, the thirst. It's hard to explain, it's like an uncontrollable urge. As long as I have this strange well I should be fine. I have barricaded most of the house, and put a bear trap near the gaping hole in the wall.\n\nDay 3\nIt appears the local fauna have chosen to stray closer to my cottage. Unfortunate.

Wretched foul monstrousities. The guttural wails of the half-dead and the better-off-dead. Savages made from the displacement of humanity. Beastial dogs and creatures that can only be found through the utter putrification of nature. This is what Darkwood offers. It offers something, wholly unique. It offers a world of terror and fright that some people would pass off because of it being a 2D topdown survival horror game. And as a person who has been playing it as long as I have (I think the week it came out) I remember all the phases.\nI remember the wells at night and the mad scrambles you would make to get home. I remember scavenging through the woods and the zones trying to forage the necessary equipment to keep yourself alive. I see now, that the game has only gotten better. I remember being lucky enough to find the mirror and knowing I am nothing worse than the ghosts that surround me.\nWhen I heard it received a series of updats, I was so delighted to return to the same grim, familiar surroundings. Wolf, Chicken Lady, the poor violin kid and all the the other horrors lying in wait, with baited breath and hungry teeth, all these things made me want to come back with utter determination.\nI got his violin, I dragged myself a chair, I brought the Lynx back through the whole forest murdering everything in my path and contemplated murder so many times on Wolf's behalf. I met new people with nothing to say, like The Three, and fought new enemies, like the horrfiying Elk.\nI traversed the corn maze and I went through, carefully picking and choosing my battles until I made my way back into the same, awful woods I slithered from where I lived in the lap of squallid luxury.\nThis is a game, where nobody is good, they are merely doing things for the sake of themselves. You can feel pity, but there is evil in everything.\nThe cost of fresh pork? Experience a beast you can only slay by talking to a Rocket Man.\nThat violin? You will learn what you must face to redeem the price of a sad child..\nThat prized sow that belongs to the chicken lady? You will see the price of fresh milk in a place where nothing grows.\nThe efforts of the Black Box? A careful eye will reveal its secret.\nA Red Swing. A Black Box. A White Dress.\nAll the secrets of an apocalyptic bastion of woodland can offer you. The game is unfinished. But it's definitely worth your time. I buy and play a lot of survival games, and with the modern few I love like Frozen State, Sheltered and a few others, I offer this game a very special place in my heart.\nI can't review it, but if my views on the game here are any insight, buy it. Buy it cheap if you're thrifty, but buy it all the same. To me, this was like... Playing Darkwood is like planning surgery. You prepare yourself in lackluster scrubs, you enter the operating area half dazed by all the blood, and you hope to christ you don't die in the process of accomplishing your task-at-hand. It's the effort made whether you live to the end of the day, or die in a single run.\nGetting a gun is nice, but it doesn't kill everything in a single blast. Getting fully upgraded melee weapons is an accomplishment in and of itself but using them and surviving is what feels good.\nTaking on your first fight with a Chomper and winning? That's what makes the game all the worthwhile.\nSure there are bugs, but I haven't a doubt in my mind they'll get fixed. Just as more mystery is made, more problems must be solved. And with any amount of effort made, I can only stand by the game being utterly, and totally satisfied for the low, low price of 15 dollars.\nThe many ugly and unwholesome secrets of Darkwood lay ahead, awaiting your arrival. Why don't you sit and stay a spell? Don't forget your nailboard and bandages, because it's going to be a rough ride into madness friend.","August 14, 2015","true","62.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A REALLY brutal game.\nIf you love challanges, this game is definitely for you.\n\nIf you're into zombie/scavanger type survival games this is definitely a must have then.\n\nLet's start off with with this game is\n\nDarkwood is a horror game that only goes well if you plan ahead of time.\n\nAfter the prologue tutorial, you play as a man with very little amounts of resources to start off with. You run around in the day time looking for wood, nails, just about anything you can fit into your invetory screen as almost all of it is important. Eventually, you'll notice that you have to go back to your hide out before night fall to drink from a well and hole up in your home. This is where it get's really interesting, and where most of your strategic planning comes into play.\n\nDuring the night, you'll be forced to drink from a well just outside your house, which enables you to live through the night. If you don't drink from the well in-time though, you'll start losing health untill you do. So don't travel to far out without a watch (Which you must find, or buy. You don't start off with one), or a decent sense of how long it takes to reach night time. After you drink from the well, you're most likely going to run back into your home. You can close the doors, block the hole up in your house with your furniture, and barricade the doors and windows with either panks of wood, or just more furniture. Next, you can lay traps that you may have found on your journey, arm yourself with any weapons you have crafted or found, and after alllll of that, you're going to sit, and wait for morning. And wait... and wait... oh god what are those foot steps I'm hearing? What is that growling sound? Jeezes what's with all the crows? Oh ♥♥♥♥ something is inside the house\n\nWith that being said, the game has a stealth mechanic to it. Monsters have to know where you are in order to attack you. Sure they spawn outside the house at night, but they don't know your exact location yet. First off, monsters listen for your foot steps. Step to close to one that's just on the other side of the wall, and he's going to know where you are.    break into your house, and start looking for you. You can hide behind furniture, or lock yourself in another room though, maybe set up a trap at the door way.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, during the night, assuming you've already found out how mushrooms and leveling up work, you're going to occasionally be attacked by shadows. It won't happen every night, just every now and then. Every hide out has a generator that produces electricity for your lamps. You need gasoline (fuel) to make it work though, so don't forget to turn those things on before you go into hiding. Any source of will keep the shadows from hurting you during the night, be it flares, flashlight (Though that requires some aiming) or just lighting a fire with some gasoline.\n\nAfter every night, during the morning of the next day, you're going to be visited by "The three." These guys are going to end up being your main source of resources later on down the road.  And time for the game will freeze for the morning, meaning you have time to replace those busted barricades, and rearange your furniture for the next night.\n\nNow you can travel outside during the night. In which case you'll find more mushrooms growing about then usual (These also grow in your house) , as well as a plethora of deadly enemies. (This is not recommended at all. At any point in the game. Seriously, don't leave your hide out.)\n\nYour day time scavenging is done once again, maybe you finished a quest line, and now you're prepared to wait out the next night... Oh joy, the fog is here and the shadows are approaching! ... wait, where are the shadows? And why is the house making all kinds of shaking noises? Why is all the furniture moving?! I need those!! HOLY SH-\n\nThis game will scare you, endlessly. It will kill you, repeatedly untill you figure out how to really survive. You will be paranoid about every place you go and every night you have to live through.\n\nOh, did I mention this game features a perma death mode? If you thought this game was scarey before, try playing it without dieing once. That makes it more heart pounding then ever, as one mistake could be your last, and you'll lose every bit of progress you had made. You don't have to play perma-death, you can leave it off. When you die, you'll be able to loot your corpse, and just continue on with the days. This isn't always helpful though, if you die far off from your hide out around a heavily guarded area, you're going to have a really hard time getting your stuff back and might just have to go on without it for a while.\n\nThis game is one of the most interesting survival horror games out there, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare and action/creepy/strategically decided adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 29, 2015","true","91.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I didn't find any bugs or glitches, and the game never crashed. It does suffer from some optimization issues, mainly the long load time. As for the game it self, it's pretty enjoyable, if not, at least a unique experience.\n\nDarkwood takes the survival horror genre and put it into a top down perspective, with an excellent aesthetic style. Visually the game is of a high caliber. The background and foreground elements are detailed and stylized, while still maintaining visual clarity so the player can easily decipher what items are interactable. The game's sound design is equally admirable. Your footsteps sound realistic and heavy, with the ground it treads on matching the steps you take. You'll hear random twig snaps, and kicks of pebbles. Crows in the distance, and animals in the shrubs, with a light but moody sound track to kick in the appropriate moments, and you have a game that's a real treat for the ears, as well as the eyes. The game's sinister atmosphere is further echoed by the use of light, both for visual interest as well as using light as a mechanics on it's own.\n\nThe game also features an interesting chapter by chapter story structure as well, with the current build being the prologue. With out giving too much away, let's say at the game's first turning point, a fairly major and unexpected reviel will instantly grab your curiosity.\n\nThough the game is quite enjoyable even at this early stage, it's not with out it's faults. On the technical side. long load times can drive a person's patience, and the game's lack of features and options is also worth noting. Mechanically speaking once you start playing with the more sandboxy elements of the game, you could find yourself in long stretches wandering seemingly aimlessly, wondering where your next objective is, or if you're even going the "right" way. To be fair, this isn't so much a problem with Darkwood it self, but rather, a common issue with survival games in general.\n\nOverall the game is a quality product already, and I can only see it getting better with time. I believe I can safely recommend Darkwood if you are interested in the idea of a top-down sandbox-ish survival horror.\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Interesting plot\n- A new take on survival horror\n- Great sound design\n- Good lighting\n\nCons:\n- Long load times\n- Can get boring when searching for next objective\n- Limited features and options","July 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's difficult enough to make you think about whether you want to barricade that window or make a weapon, but it's easy enough that you don't get discouraged.\n\nSo far I have found very few bugs, and all of the game mechanics seem to work flawlessly.  The best part about this game?  It's still in early release so there are many more features to come!","December 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not only must you hide from savages lurking around your hideout, but the shadows that want to consume you. Grab a torch and pray for the night to end!\nThere are three sections in the map: Meadows, The Forest and The Old Woods. Each of these zones are harder than the other, and the farther you go, the more interesting locations you can find.\nAfter strolls around the woods harvesting odd mushrooms and meat, you can return to your hideout and cook it into a liquid substance and inject yourself with a dose. This lets you choose one skill from the first tier, however, each tier has its negative skills aswell, such as the shadows, mentioned before.\nYou'll find yourself dying alot, the map may be hard to use as it doesnt show where you exactly are unless near a certain location, but worry not, it shows where you died and lost your inventory, so you can try to retrieve your precious loot.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to people who want some hardcore horror survival!\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","30.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even that there are no voice overs in the game fits the artstyle and atmosphere. It is intense as hell.  I just have to get used to the controls a little bit though.

Note that I have only played the game for about an hour, this was so that I don't get bored of the game before it is released like I did with StarBound, so take this review with a grain of salt. The game so far is what I would call a true survival horror experience, the atmosphere is dark and oppressive with ambient sound that constantly keep you on edge and constantly checking your back, thinking something is going to constantly going to murder your horribly. I have seen one or two jump scares, mostly something behind me I didn't notice. These, however, weren’t bad jump scares, they happened during times when I was fully immersed in the game and I was already scared. One of the problems I had are that some of the controls are a little clunky. To swing a melee weapon, you hold down left click to raise the weapon, then right click to swing instead of letting go of left mouse. This feels intentional, like how Silent Hill 1-3 had awful combat to hamper the player, but it is still awkward, not too awkward and you get used to it, but it may cause a few deaths. The game is buggy at sometimes as well, I once was stuck looking in a box because a menu failed to pop up. I was stuck until a cosmic monstrosity decided that I was looking tasty, which did scare me, but it does need to be fixed along with others that may show up. From my experience, I'd recommend the game, but I'd wait until the full game is released, unless you like taking part in Early Access games or you wish to support the developers. I'd like to see how the game improves over the Early Access time to the final release.","July 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 38 of 72 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","38","72","0","1"

If you're looking for a perfect blend of sandbox and horror then this game will definitely tickle your fancy. I highly recommend it even if it is early access. Normally I hate early access. People throwing out unfinished games to the masses. This is the one exception. Don't hesitate in getting this now if you're interested. It's damn good and feels like a finished game.\n\nDay oneFirst day of the game I was terrified. I had no idea when night was coming. My inventory was full and I quickly realized my map doesn't show my exact position. I had to figure it out on my own using landmarks I've located. This was my first major mistake. I was lost. I could see the sun was beginning to set and I was still lost deep within the woods. I was so cocky. When I first booted the game I turned on permadeath thinking I could ace this game like any other horror or sandbox game I've played. None of them set the atmosphere quite like Darkwood did. Nothing frightened me more than seeing the sun come down. I began panicking, sprinting my way through the forest hoping for any sort of shelter. Of course I didn't find any. I did find the road however and with it, eventually my home. It was pitch dark outside and I made the huge mistake of leaving the generator on. I was so stupid. I assumed the gas I put in it would last longer or it'd just stop using fuel during the day. The typical gaming conventions I was used to wasn't present in this game. Not even the sight of my own home made me feel any relief. I'd made another horrible mistake. I hadn't had time to barricade the windows during the day. I shut myself in one of the rooms and pushed all manner of furniture in front of the doors and windows, hoping it'd keep whatever was out there away. I had no idea what I was up against. But I could hear them. I had run out of furniture to push against any openings. There was one window I had to keep open and for the rest of the night I stared at it from across the room. I spent the whole night, weapon raised, staring out that window terrified for my life.\n\nReviewI've watched this game in development for a while and I was pleasantly surprised to see a developer actually deliver an amazing game for early access. I had my doubts. I really wanted to get this game when it was finished so I could get the whole experience but I couldn't resist any longer. Boy was I impressed though. It felt like a complete game. Of course I bought it shortly after most of the bugs had been squashed so I didn't really get to see how buggy it may have been early on. They've already thrown out so many bug fixes in the short amount of time it's been released that I definitely have high hopes for its development.\nA lot of "survival horror" game developers just don't get what makes a horror game truly terrifying. I've seen countless of these horror games that rely solely on jump scares or just putting the character in a dark room with a flashlight. And what few games have that right kind of atmosphere have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game-play. Darkwood does this flawlessly. Not only is it in a terrifying setting, but it's also fun to play. The most important thing to any horror media (be it a movie, book or game) is setting the tone. You need the player to feel immersed in this atmosphere or they won't give a damn about the character's well-being. I was genuinely scared I wouldn't be able to make it home the first night. I had absolutely no idea what I was up against and I didn't want to know. All I knew is that it wanted me dead. I wasn't even sure if the dressers I pressed against the doors and windows would even protect me from them. Its that mystery that makes the game so effective at being scary. Not once did I feel like I was truly safe. Even as the sun came up.\nAll in all this was definitely one of the scariest experiences I've had with a game. I highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for horror. Darkwood will forever be my measuring stick for judging what a true survival horror game should be.\n","August 9, 2014","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the locations themselves are always the same once you get to them.\n\nAlthough there's a way to save your progress, new game versions tend to wipe your saves so you end up having to start over.

Gameplay consists of searching for resources during the day and defending your hideout at night.

However as of patch 4.1 poltergeists throw around the furniture if you do this and the noise attracts more monsters. Players can survive by barricading windows and doors, setting traps, lighting the house with a gas generator, igniting enemies with strategically placed gasoline and a lit match, and fighting with a variety of melee weapons and if you are lucky maybe a gun\n\nThe game has optional permadeath and the enemies are extremely dangerous. You never feels safe and every day feels like a mad rush for resources. However for me this was a negative as the constant day to day rushing made me feel like I don't have time to soak the atmosphere or proceed with caution. Days are slightly longer in 4.1 however... I would like to see a system where time passes as the player advances from one location to another and once the player reaches a location like, say, the burned houses then time becomes normal until the player leaves, giving the player time to explore carefully\n\nIt is in mid alpha right now, and I feel they should have progressed to beta by now but not that it is way too slow either. The devs are very communicative and take criticism into account very well. They tend to reply to post in most topics and never get mad even at people who are trolling\n\nI'd say this is one of the games worth paying to get at early access, but I don't want to encourage early access so for those who like games like dark souls, survival games and roguelikes definetly get it when it is released :D","March 28, 2015","true","48.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Players can survive by barricading windows and doors, setting traps, lighting the house with a gas generator, igniting enemies with strategically placed gasoline and a lit match, and fighting with a variety of melee weapons and if you are lucky maybe a gun\n\nThe game has optional permadeath and the enemies are extremely dangerous. You never feels safe and every day feels like a mad rush for resources. However for me this was a negative as the constant day to day rushing made me feel like I don't have time to soak the atmosphere or proceed with caution. Days are slightly longer in 4.1 however... I would like to see a system where time passes as the player advances from one location to another and once the player reaches a location like, say, the burned houses then time becomes normal until the player leaves, giving the player time to explore carefully\n\nIt is in mid alpha right now, and I feel they should have progressed to beta by now but not that it is way too slow either. The devs are very communicative and take criticism into account very well. They tend to reply to post in most topics and never get mad even at people who are trolling\n\nI'd say this is one of the games worth paying to get at early access, but I don't want to encourage early access so for those who like games like dark souls, survival games and roguelikes definetly get it when it is released :D","March 28, 2015","true","48.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doraaregames/recommended/274520/","doraaregames","Dora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doraaregames/","357 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile I would recommend this game for fans of atmospheric roguelikes and horror mysteries, I have to do so with a few big caveats. The top-down dark view the game uses makes it extremely difficult to tell what you're looking at to the point where half your time is spent bumping up against big gloomy objects. The day/night cycle isn't clearly defined so you never know when night is coming and you need to get back to your base, though I'm not sure it matters since there doesn't appear to be any penalty to dying so you might as well use it as a sort of quick-travel to get home. Combat is pretty clunky to the point where it feels awkward and punishing in a way that has nothing to do with difficulty.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere and mood are absolutely stellar, especially in the opening prologue of the game, and the character artwork is amazing. It's clear that there's been a lot of thought towards making this a tense and difficult survival simulation with a real story to it, and it's a story that's a genuinely intriguing one too. The concept of exploring, hunting, scavenging, and barricading is solid, but at the moment my concern is that it seems like the biggest emphasis has been on style instead of polishing the gameplay mechanics. Yeah, I know, it's Early Access. I funded this last year. But playing a game, even a game that's intended to be a difficult one, shouldn't feel like an uphill battle where the game is fighting you instead of challenging you. With tweaks to its UI to provide more helpful feedback and a less obtuse combat system, Darkwood has a lot of potential, and I hope it lives up to it.","July 24, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With each build come new improvements to everything across the board. By now it can be hard to tell that this is not a finished product! Please help fund it. Buy it now while it's "finished" but under construction and help a cult classic come into being.\n\n---\n\nI waited since this was announced on Greenlight, and boy was it ever worth the wait.\n\nFirst off, the ATMOSPHERE. It is amazing. I didn't think a top-down experience could really capture it so well, but it does because you can see the environment around you, sometimes eerily twitching or waving if you aren't looking at it directly. You can hear the wind, an occasional shriek, eerie ambience and the occasional crunch of a branch that might make you jump. Be careful, the noises you make can attract horrifying things, and the oppressive environment makes that delightfully clear the moment you see it. Who knows what might be hiding behind those wavy branches in the background?\n\nNext comes the exploration. Getting lost is VERY easy to do, so once again the location and feeling of real fear is stressed by this risk. You must make it back by dark or you will die, so be sure to know your pathway back, and hope to high hell there aren't any -things- to block your path on the way back. Look for materials for crafting, barricading, repairing or boiling mushrooms into a drug of sorts that gives you skills (A sort of leveling system). Craft a weapon immediately when you find what you need. But even with that, you're bound to want to run and hide from most threats.\n\nThe characters that I have seen so far have also been extremely interesting. Well designed, excellent art illustrates them and unsettling dialog helps highlight what remains of the populace in this story.\n\nHOWEVER, there -are- bugs, as to be expected from an alpha, and the best way to play is just to expect the unexpected and report something if it blocks your progress, quit and reload. The dev team is very on top of everything and listens well to the playerbase. With the arrival of Alpha 2.0, it's clear they love their game and are serious about making things better for the players.\n\nEnding thoughts - Worth a buy if you like to support indie development and love a good, unique horror game, because there really isn't anything else like it out there, and you'd be supporting something great.\n\nNOT worth a buy when not on sale if you can't tolerate bugs and would rather have a finished product, but this one's going to be a hit. Grab it if it happens to be cheap at the time.\n\nThis is something worth supporting. There aren't many indie teams out there with such passion for their product, and I believe it's already showing with each small patch.\n\nSo far: 8/10, and only because of bugs and missing features.","July 25, 2014","true","61.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In regards to other games within its category, there is still a lot to be desired. There really isn't this sense of an active world, but, rather, set pieces that are very nicely done. Characters are interesting and I enjoy the look of em, but they never really do anything within the world. Combat feels nice. Atmosphere is excellent. I do have issues with the mandatory well mechanic in which you must drink from your specific well to not die. This prevents really any long term exploration or, what i would call, travelling and living as a nomad. It also seems rather arbitrary as no one else appears to have to undergo this same process despite also having wells <all broken>. There is also the issue of having nothing to do when waiting throughout the night. My experiences have either been immense boredom <which happens when the night noises become routine> or small moments of stress at later nights. But, for the nights, there is never this sense of productivity, just waiting.\n\nAs it stands, for what it wants to be, it is excellent. Would I play it over games like Pathologic?

First time into the game before literally moving about in the tutorial; incredible. I had honestly never been so terrified in a 2D horror game like this in a long time. It is old school horror, something I praise so much to see and you absolutely feel frozen fromthe sounds, atmosphere and the unknown this game offers (I literally was pulling my hair during my first night, screaming "what the hell are those sounds, is it coming, please don't let it get me!")\n\nPlaying into the game; the tutorial helps you a lot with the rope and it's straightforward. It even allows some freedom on experimenting before continuing (had fun testing out some items before the tutorial ended). First time playing, you have the freedom to follow the story (which I have to say is very interesting and I am curious just to go through it completely) and/or survive as long as possible in the Darkwood. The more you play, the more you learn how to adapt to survive. That hasn't frustrated me at all and with each death I endure by whatever is roaming the forest, I come back wanting to do better in survival. And mind you, this is still an early access game and there is a lot more I believe I'll be learning from this game.\n\nDarkwood, hands down, is by far for me, the best survival horror game I've ever played. If that alone isn't enough, here is a list of what happened to me and what's cool to me:\n\n* The characters you meet, are brilliantly designed and creepily cool! Every one I've met so far, I really like them! Especially the guy who you can give parts to (exhaust plug, wheel, etc)! :D\n* I tossed a flare onto some posionous, flammable vines, caught on fire by it, bandaged myself quickly to dull the burn effect, went in to jump in my seat to see a rabid dog inside the very room the vines were protecting. BEAT IT TO DEATH in a panicked state.\n* One night, I thought I heard someone was WALKING INSIDE MY SAFEHOUSE. Next morning, I look around to find my windows still barricaded and nobody around. I KID YOU NOT!\n* Another night, some BIRD SHADOW CREATURE appeared right in front of me. I screamed so hard in my seat and whacked it with my nailed plank to see it reduced to ashes. Since then I have been ramming my brain how it got inside.\n* Longest time: 5 days. Had some ravenous antlion thing coming through my barricaded window and just waiting in front of me, taunting me first before the kill. I just begged it to get it over with it!\n\n10/10.

Well, for starters, Darkwood doesn’t hinge on jump-inducing surprise-scares for its sense of tension (though it promises its fair share of these moments, anyways). Instead, Darkwood places you in a procedurally generated forest in a deeply twisted perversion of Soviet Russia. From there, the game’s dismal lighting, grotesque ambiance, and overall eerie atmosphere create the horror themselves.\n\ndarkwood horror survival game gameplayIn other words, Darkwood doesn’t rely on cheap scare tactics and bursts of adrenaline to generate its terror. Darkwood’s brand of fear is the type that starts as a knot of unease in your stomach, a knot that grows tighter with each door you push slowly open, with every backwards glance and each spectral groan that floats out of the fog. Darkwood doesn’t try to scare you in the traditional Western sense – it tricks you into scaring yourself.\n\nOf course, we can’t talk about innovation in the genre without looking into the very thing that made the game stand out to me in the first place – its choice of perspective. Where most horror games seek to attach you to the protagonist by making you look through their eyes, Darkwood is the embodiment of detachment. You look down on your character from above, your line of sight limited to the swath of your flashlight beam.\n\nThis means that behind you, inside buildings, anywhere that your light can’t reach, is blanketed in darkness. Nightmarish things lurk outside the light, things that you will be forced to encounter as you drift through the corrupted forest. Whether or not you survive these brushes with the frightful unknown is entirely up to you.\n\nWhat Else?\n\nIn addition to the top-down view, Darkwood introduces some more interesting ideas. Its design has been inspired by rogue-like, adventure, and role-playing games alike, giving it a unique and nuanced feel that it seems only indie games can achieve these days.\n\nIts diverse inspirations give Darkwood a well-rounded approach to the genre, providing something enticing for every flavor of gamer. Its RPG roots have inspired the developers to include a skill-tree to the game, allowing character diversification and specialization. The looting and crafting systems are reminiscent of many survival games, from Minecraft to Fortnite, but are presented in their own uniquely gritty ways.\n\nMy Rating\n\n8/10","August 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finally I was able to scrounge up enough wood and nails to baricade a door and window and fashion a makeshift nailboard. I spent the night huddled up in the dark listening to the sounds from outside, jumping at small movements. Just when I thought I would make it there was a terrific crash as something began to batter down my baracades. I had no choice but to stand there, board raised waiting as the barricades duribility ticked down. But at about a quarter strength something happened there was a new growling from outside and what sounded like an attack. The beating on my barricade stopped and when morning came and I went outside there was just a few bloodstains outside the window. Terrifying sound design.","July 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound design is fantastic, and it helps to convey a sense of impending doom during the night sequences, when you're hunkered down in your choice of shelter. You can hear the beasts skulking around in the rooms around you, banging on barricades, stepping on creaking floorboards, and howling into the dead of night, while you remain huddled in a corner, wishing for the light of day.\n\nIt's the night sequences coupled with the pitch black segments that really make this game for me. The lack of light, and the removal of your field of view really makes every moment incredibly tense. Coupled with the hectic, brutal combat, moment to moment decisions are crucial to your survival.\n\nFor an early access alpha game, Darkwood has an incredible amount of potential. I'm truly looking forward to what the devs have to offer in future iterations.","July 25, 2014","true","55.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a lot of content for being just recently greenlit. It's very hard, which provides the challenge that I love. It includes the ever growing genre of survival, where you have to collect and craft items in order to continue. Very little information is given and there is absolutely no hand holding, so if you like dicovering things on your own, then this is a title for you.

My watch starterd beeping. 12:00 it said, midnight. The tv screen was glaring at me for some time with the only vivid colours I can remember. My heart started to race as I was a few minutes away from my home base. I thought to myself that right now would be the best idea to trod back. Nightfall emergers and my breath becomes a bit more shorter than the other breath. I can't contain myself, I'm very anxious about this event. I doubt I'll even make it through.\n\nThe well has prompted me to drink from it, I tell myself, close the curtains and put some headphones on, it'll be fun. I did as what my head told me to do. It begun, I cornered myself on one end of the room with all beartraps hanging about. I feel nervous at the sight of these things as they might turn against me at one point and time. The growling begun. My heart was pacing faster, I mean, what could go wrong right? Well the barricaded door north of me corrected that sentence as something is chomping it's way through my doors. "BANG BANG BANG" It went.\n\nThe growling was louder than before. I can't help but to hold my breathe as the events unfolded in front of me. I decided to position myself as far away as possible from the door, but guess what? It's not over. Just south of me the door started to get attacked. It felt weird, I was feeling neither fear nor anxiety. The mix of horrible emotions was too difficult for me to handle. "BANG!" The door on the north gave way, gave way to something so terrible words cannot explain. But alas, the bear traps teeth GRISLED the thing. By the grace of god, I cleaved the infernal being in half with my axe, surprisingly with one blow it faltered, embracing the cold planks which I stood in. As the southern door broke, I see a faint light fill my room. It was daybreak.\n\nWaking up knowing tomorrow is going to be a more horrible day, I start my daily cycle.

For being a top-down game, it has gorgeous graphics that make the most light and shadow to give the game world texture, and the visuals are backed up by excellent and skillfully used sound effects that give you a reason to turn up your speakers. Gameplay is harsh, and random, and a healthy dose of caution is required doing most anything. It's a good game to play around in the sandbox or pursue the story elements, but which ever you do, it will be a shadowy and blood-soaked nightmare of an experience. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes horror, adventure, survival or RPG games, or any mix of them. The difficulty IS an acqired taste though, be forewarned.\n\nSo far in Early Access, I've experienced no crashes and only a few minor to moderate bugs.

He has given me some insight on the situation and told me about a crazy chicken lady who I shall seek out later but first I decided to look around my hideout to hopefully find a weapon.\n\n10 Minutes have passed and no weapon or anything useful. I hopped out my window to look for the well. I found it moments later but something else appears to have found me, something terrifying began staring at me with it's cold bloodshot eyes. We stared for what felt like hours until it scurried in my direction. I did the only thing I could...Turn and jump through the window. I thought I would be ok but I was wrong, it followed me so I jumped out the window to the outside and hurried into the generator room. I turned it on hoping it would deter the beast...It did, or atleast my hiding skills had made it loose track of me.\n\nA while past and I noticed it was getting dark so I headed back inside where I waited till the well was ready to be drunk.\n\nFinally the well was drinkable so I drunk as much as I could when suddenly I heard a loud noise so I hopped back inside, ran to the generator and switched it hoping to deter whatever it was.\n\nIt's pitch black outside but my lamps are doing ok at keeping it lit inside. For safety measure I have placed a stool next to the window to make sure no one could possibly get in. I waited...And waited...\n\nI walked around the house aimlessly when suddenly I noticed the worst thing imaginable...The lights went out...I heard some inhuman laugh or noise, whatever it was I knew it was now coming for me, in hopes my hiding skills would once work again I hid in a corner... *Creeeeeeeeek* The door went as someone entered my house. *Cshhhhhh* went the stool as someone or something walked past it. The footsteps got louder AND louder AND LOUDER until they were inches away from me. *Shinkkkk* went the blade that cut, piercing my skin. I screamed and ran for the window where I hopped out and closed the door hiding myself once again inside the generator room. 'I'm screwed' I thought as I listned for any movemnt...\n\n\n\nI waited and waited until I noticed light beaming lightly through the hole in the wall. I went to the door and opened it...It was day...I survived...'But wait!' I thought. 'What if it was still out here?' And as thoughts raced through my mind I did the only thing I thought I could do. I ran for the chicken ladies house. I remembered it was east so I ran as fast as my shaking legs could carry me. But without focusing properly I heard the worst noise imaginable...'Cshhhh' went the sound of a few mushrooms crushing beneath my feet. 'No......' I thought. I almost began to cry but I thought that if I got to her house maybe, just maybe she will have something to help me. So I ran once again as fast as I could. I saw a structure. 'Yes YES!' I shouted. As I closed nearer my heart stopped...It was the pig place...I looked left and right furiously as I felt my legs about to give way. I turned and ran north as fast as I could but it was to no use. Within seconds my legs gave way and I fell flat on my face where I layed...To die....","July 26, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What accualy killed me was not a monser, but the fact that you need to drink form the well befor you buckle down for the night, or you will slowly die. This bothered me some as i didn't know i was supposed to fix the well, or i just didn't bother to pay attention to the warnings. I later awoke to find that i was the second say, I was disapointed to find that the buff i had worked for thorught gathering mushrooms was gone, but whatever i had found yesterday was still on me.\n\nmy accual review? this game blew me away, I was expecting allot, but not this much. the gameplay was smooth, the lighting and enviroments are perfect, and i'm considering boarding up my bedroom window out of fear of a shadow monster crawling in. I was a little unhappy at first by the pixely graphics, but it didn't bother me at all later in the game. I'm having a great time playing this game and so should you.\n\n4.75 / 5","July 25, 2014","true","45.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a combination of Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, Amnesia and Hotline Miami. It is so atmospheric and immersive. Not only that, it is damn scary at times. I screamed more than once and not because of carefully crafted jump-scares either; these were emergent and organic scares with plenty of build-up in a distinctly non-linear world. Brilliant. The story is intriguing too. The difficulty however is the great part for me. No handholding (a decent tutorial in the form of a prologue but that’s it) and lethal enemies. It is extremely hard, which makes every victory, no matter how small, seem immense. Seriously, buy this game.

You are a greasy hobo living in a shack and your goal is to navigate a randomly generated verdant plot of land and eventually escape it.\n\nThe games prologue is a short tutorial but frankly it doesnt do a good job of preparing you for the game. Many mechanics such as cooking, leveling up and using perks is not explained.\n\nVisually the game is simple and draws alot of inspiration from Slender and Silent Hill for tis spooky atmosphear which it pulls off pretty well.\n\nThe sound minimal however it effectively punctuates the highs and lows of the game. The sound effect are really well done and go a long way to enhance the atmosphere.\n\nAs nice as it all sound the game is still an alpha and after playing for 11 hours it still needs a long way to go before being anywhere close to enjoyable.\nWhile the ideas are solid the game suffers from quite a few game game breaking bugs. Crashes and black screens are common and so are various glitches which you should familirise yourself with if you intent of getting anywhere in this game.\n\nThe odds are stacked heavily against you and dying is a common and costly occurence. You are defeceless when unarmed and unless you restarded the game a few times it will a be a while before you get your first weapon.  Sadly even then your chances of remaining unscathed are pretty slim. Most enemies have either a longer reach a lunge or plain old stunlock though a flurry or blows so getting to know your enemies is important and in most cases you cant take on more than one baddy at a time.\nYour weapons seem to be made of styrophoam since most of them break after every fight and rapairs or resupplies are very costly. Despite te starting vendor selling ammo for various firearms I have yet to see most of them. I have only used the double barrel shotty and the pellet gun both of which were jaringly inferior to the axe.\nIf you are getting the jist that this game is hard you have heard nothing yet. The game uses a day and night cycle ( aprox 15/9 irl min) During the days you forrage and complete quests and during the night you fend off baddies enmasse.\nProblem is if you play the game as intended you wont last more than 2 days so you have resort to an exploit of hiding in a corner under total darkness in oder to skip the nighttime assaults.\n\nExploring during the day is equaly agonising because of your characters speed and stamina you barely have enough time to explore one location before heading back to your shack. Sprinting all the time is also unadvisable for the woods are densely populated by bear traps and poisonus fungi ( which you need ot harvest to level up) and if you want to venture deeper into the woods you are required to have a light source of a kind. Issue is some of the most uggliest baddies and lot interesting quest set pieces are located in the deeper woods. This leaves you spirinting though the woods blind triping over traps or takign and slow and takign a beating from a pack of hungry mosnters.\n\nAll in all after 11 hours the end is nowhere near in sight and I barely have any progress on my first quest. Before commiting yourself finnacialyl to this game the needsto be a lot of bug fixing and rebalancing done. I also urge the devs to do away with the random world generation since it add nothing to the game but frustration.\n\nVerdict: wait for it to get better. Hopefully this will grow into a nice gem","July 29, 2014","false","22.0"," 114 of 250 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","114","250","0","16"

The character designs are so bizarre and disturbing; they fit perfectly with what this game is trying to accomplish. The mysterious and fragmented storyline will make you immersed in the Darkwood world. Exploration is extremely exciting because you never know what you will find and the constant looming threat of The Thirst and the creatures of the night will always make you feel rushed\n\nWhere this game fails is the combat. Weapons are not easy to find and tend to break too quickly. You will more than likely be forced to craft your own weapons which will consistently deplete your resources, but you need these same resources to build barricades to protect yourself at night because fighting during night is near impossible. When you do manage to craft a weapon, good luck trying to use it. Your attacks have to be extremely accurate in order to hit anything. Here is how most combat situations will go for you: You aim your attack. The enemy jumps at you, attacks you, and jumps back in half a second. You swing your weapon and miss. The enemy jumps back in, attacks you, jumps back out before you can even aim your next attack. Before you know it, you are dead and could not even land a single hit with your useless weapon.\n\nThis game seems to have so much potential, and I am excited to see where this game will go in the future, but the combat feels so broken, it isn't worth playing at the moment. I'm tired of being killed by the first enemy I encounter every time because the broken combat system doesn't give me any chance to protect myself.","August 1, 2014","false","7.6"," 54 of 132 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","54","132","2","3"

Sorry kids, but you didn't. Everything in this review is completely accurate, so your downvotes just show your immaturity.\n\nA game with great art style, but tarnished by the lack of thought put behind it. Everything in this game aesthetically is amazing.\n\nHowever I will not recommend this game, for it is far too unfinished and completely unthoughtful with the design choice.\n\n-The UI is just bad. Get rid of it.\n-The game is far too unforgiving, and you have to complete extremely tedious tasks to survive. Oh, by the way, when nightfall hits, you must have drank from a certain well prior to nightfall, and be inside. Before nightfall.\n-Days only last about 5 or so minutes, so good luck getting anything done within that amount of time.\n-The story is completely scattered and difficult to follow. Most of the time it just doesn't make sense.\n\nI had high hopes when I bought the game. It looked great in the trailer, but I'll tell you, this game is nothing like what the trailer shows. I think that's where they pull people in. I understand you would want your game to be challenging, but there's honestly just fake difficulty put into the game. When I say that, I mean the monsters are just straight up overpowered. They're faster than you, they're stronger, and they don't give up. If you don't have a chance, there's a major error in your game. Almost all of the locations in the game are copy/pasted, which makes for an extremely difficult time navigating where you have, and haven't been. The map is.. atrocious, to say the least, and completely inaccurate as to the locations of certain places. Pro tip: Don't listen to where the characters in game tell you to go to find a certain location, they literally have no idea where the place they told you to go is. I've been told that some person I was supposed to meet is East. I head East as far as the map would let me. Nothing there. Okay, I'll just back track a bit and try to broaden my sweep. Still nothing. After giving up I start to wander. I found the place all the way southwest on the map. I'm not kidding. There's so much more crap to this but I don't really feel like typing about it anymore, even giving it this much of a review is giving it too much credit.\n\nBottom line: The game is crap, design is crap, very cool art style, devs are crap (Meaning they almost never update the game, and when they do, they are miniscule updates that almost always wipe your progress even when they say it won't).\n\nDon't buy this game. It's nowhere near worth what they're asking for. I've seen tighter free-to-play games than this.","July 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 13 of 42 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","13","42","0","0"

And Darkwood looked very creepy and promising. It's much like a combination of Fallout 1, The Last of Us, and Silent Hill.\n\nSadly, the scariness of it wears off after playing it for a few days, and then it just becomes annoying and frustrating. Everything you do in the "day" of the game is spent preparing to survive the "night" (which you spend cowering in a boarded-up shack, wondering if something will come and murder you.\n\nThe combat and the enemies can be described in two words" "screw you". From ghosts that smash the lights at night to barfing naked gray men who throw rocks and you and beat you with twigs, the enemies will always kill you in no more than 3 hits.\n\nOh, and you can die by stepping on poison mushrooms, but level up by cooking and eating them, because logic.\n\nWhen you die, you have to traipse around the woods to recover your lost stuff, which burns up your daylight hours and sets back the progress of the game. And the player character is a sissy and gets tired after running. Well, my fingers hurt from holding down the sprint button.\n\nThat said, I can't claim to hate this game. There's plenty of potential for a great game in this. It's just that its difficulty isn't the challenging type. When enemies can arbitrarily kick you in the balls, it's just no fun.","July 9, 2015","false","16.2"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","7","31","0","5"

A "try hard" to sound cryptic and dark. At first I thought it wasn't bad - until the game actually starts. Right off the bat - game puts you into a hostile environment with zero light, rain, tough-decision making and zero tutorial within 5 minutes of the actual game (not including prologue). During the day time you must avoid stepping on some poisonous mushroom, while evading wild animals, while not getting lost in a forest. Because daylight only last 5-10 minutes, once night fall hits, you must then 1) Specifically go back to your hideout 2) Use the special well with special water so your body doesn't decompose at night. 3) Get back to the hideout with all the same problems as day time...except you can't see ANYTHING.

I dont like mindless battles with countless enemies all the time like 90 percent of games nowadays, this game is among the few that makes you feel as if you achieved something from killing any 1 enemy in the game. Finding items will determine your fate for the night and hopefully you will find some of the neccessary recipes needed for surviving and effeciently defending your shelter. Im still using a nail board for my defense which is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the durability of weapons is also a little aggravating because it seems like every 2 engagements with enemies you will need to produce a new weapon, and resources are limited so thats also kinda bs. But overall i love the style and horror this game comes with, its a game that i want to get better at because its not generic or simple, its original and challenging. I hope this game will be successful because i would love to see more content from the developers or maybe thats just the greedy me not enjoying all the content theyve provided thus far.

In just 45 mins of playing Darkwood, I want to break something.\nMy issues with the game are as follows; hard as hell to see anything. Even with my gamma at max its just too dark to see anything not scary just dark.\nI guess the music and sound effects are supposed to be really scary but I'm hard of hearing and legally deaf, so yeah, not going to work too well on me. (But hey I'm used to the gaming community ignoring those with hearing imparments, we are deaf not blind, you jerks!)\nThe combat is crap, total and complete crap. Weapons...what weapons...oh those things that break after you use them two times. I think maybe the idea is to run from everything but lets face it, how many of us played Resident Evil and ran from everything?\nI don't know about the story, not sure if there is one, just basically get out of the woods. For all I know they may have an award winning plot going on, but when your players want to hit escape before they have even played an hour, well it doesn't matter what your storyline is.\nSome people are going to love this game, some people are Masochists. I'm not. Dying in a game is part of the game, but it seems to be the main part of this game. I hated that game Dead Souls for the same reason.\nIts a good concept, I don't regret buying the game even if I dislike it because I support indie teams and the concepts they are trying to put out there. However, with that said, no I don't enjoy Darkwood. I don't enjoy getting slaughtered over and over again. I don't enjoy having to squint and bring my head ever closer to the screen just to try and make something out.

Skills seem to be quite useless, and you will lose them pretty fast anyway (you lose all character progression on death).\n\nOnly positive thing about the game so far is the atmosphere.

It is DIFFICULT,so don't go into it thinking it'll ease you into anything. It won't. You don't get a lot of supplies, you have limited time to wander from your safehouse to find new locations and your map is elementary at best. You'll often be completely lost wandering around the woods, and that's part of what makes the game so scary, especially when the sun is going down and you can't remember where your safehouse is.\n\nThe other night, I sat in the dark with my one light on as my generator was running, and heard dogs outside the house. Suddenly, the dogs started yelping. something was KILLING them. My lights went out, i turned on my torch, and this shambling dude comes up to me with a stick, moaning. I got a couple of good hits on him and he ran, while shadows suddenly surrounded me in my lack of light....and then bam. Morning.\n\nSeriously one of the most tense games I've played.

Exploring the world and doing your best to survive offers players an unforgetable experience and atmosphere that really does get you hooked.\nEven with it being an early access title there is a lot of content to enjoy and the support by the developers at Acid Wizard really has been fantastic and is very encouraging for what is to come in the future.\nThis, along with the great support and care from its developers have made Darkwood a game I have not regretted purchasing for one minute!","December 15, 2014","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome.\n\nI've played a few hours when Alpha 2.0 was out. This game has really surprised me, in a good sense. It looks really promising in its current state.\nIt's really hard, you are never spoonfed and learn by mistakes (most of them will kill you). Your highest priority is survival: gathering resources, crafting items and weapons to save you from the horrors of the night in the woods. Trust me, there's nothing like hiding in a corner of your house, in the dark, hearing something  killing all the weaker creatures outside then bashing into your barricaded doors, moaning and growling.\nThe characters are quite memorable. Even with few dialogue lines they have, I felt that no one in the woods should be trusted. They're all hiding something. The protagonist is just as strange and sick, having to quench his deadly thirst from the well every night.\nThe graphics are lovely. Nothing too fancy, but almost every location looks like it was carefully crafted. I got that feel of presence while being in the woods. Oh, and the world is randomly generated, so every new playthrough means a new scheme of your survival.","December 31, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every time you hear a bump in your hideout that will be like your reaction and look around like crazy cause of...\n\nFirst Person visibility: Yes first person visibility on a bird view game. It's like playing it first person but much different. Makes it more eerie.\n\nThen the combat system... you need to get used to that as you need to ready your weapon at first.

The game sucks you in and there's no easy way of getting out. The smallest things can scare you in this game. There is no pre-made map. There is a map however but you don't know where you are on it. You must use your surroundings to figure out where you are, and if you get lost, then you're going to have an excrutiating game getting back to your safehouse.\nNights are going to be next to impossible to survive especially when you first start out.

It is DIFFICULT,so don't go into it thinking it'll ease you into anything. It won't. You don't get a lot of supplies, you have limited time to wander from your safehouse to find new locations and your map is elementary at best. You'll often be completely lost wandering around the woods, and that's part of what makes the game so scary, especially when the sun is going down and you can't remember where your safehouse is.\n\nThe other night, I sat in the dark with my one light on as my generator was running, and heard dogs outside the house. Suddenly, the dogs started yelping. something was KILLING them. My lights went out, i turned on my torch, and this shambling dude comes up to me with a stick, moaning. I got a couple of good hits on him and he ran, while shadows suddenly surrounded me in my lack of light....and then bam. Morning.\n\nSeriously one of the most tense games I've played.

The best mechanic is the day/night cycle. you can't just hide during the night, as you need to go outside to drink the water, and many deadly enemies attacking your home will make you cower in a corner and cry in the dark and pray for the light of day. the ultimate game to get if you want true horror","August 16, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh and not that Im complaining but Im on day 15 mainly because somewhere the game glitched and stopped spawning monsters at night around day 9.

I backed this title on Indigogo originally, and early on was drawn to the idea. Every other game I have backed was a disappointment but not this one! Even for being in alpha state, the game already succeeds at drawing you into the creepy and somtimes terrying world of Darkwood. My review follows, but for those that do not wish to read TL;DR: A monster started chasing me, so I sprinted towards my house. I lost him, but ran into a mushroom and died. 10/10\n\nGameplay\nYou wake up in your safehouse after the prologue. A man with a dog face waits for you, and gives you some basics. He gives you some clues about the mysterious Dogtag you have on you, and points you towards the "Chicken Lady" to the west. From here you're on your own. Your main objective is to follow the clues, but along the way you may follow a trail or a strange noise and before you know it you're exploring the world. Littered along the woods are items and crafting supplies, letting you make some basic survival supplies. When it starts to get dark, the thirst comes forcing you to return to the safehouse where a well keeps you alive for another day. But the day doesn't end here, now you can cook the items you found infected with whatever is eating up the woods. This results in essence, which act as experience points. When you've collected enough essence, you get to select from a list of skills. They range from nice to incredibly useful, but somtimes a player must also take a downside to balance out the power. When you die, you return to your home with your equipped items slighty damaged, all your essence items stolen and back at level 1, so you should think twice before storming into a fight. Health is pretty basic, but there is also stamina which is used by using items or running.\n\nControls\nThe controls are interesting. Most of the game is played with the mouse and WASD. Items that have more than one action accessible to the player have a context menu that is brought up. You can sprint with shift and open the inventory/crafting menu with tab. There is also a map (m) and a journal (j). For me the controls felt fairly smooth and natural.","July 26, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definetly would suggest to anyone looking for a very promising game. I will say this though, I haven't really found anything too scary about it this game yet, but I'm pretty hard to scare. I have seen a few things that some people may call a "scare" if they play it (IE. jump scares, loud and aprupt nosies, etc.) still a good game all around. 4/5","July 26, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really dark, creepy atmosphere and challenging gameplay. For me the first game, that captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. I'm really hyped about the NPCs and story bits. Very weird and special. It also brings in a good piece of RPG gameplay, that sets this game apart from a lot of other sandbox type games.

I had just sprinted all the way back to my some-what fortified base, took a drink from a well, and made my way inside. I began shutting all the doors I could, and got into a room I had began to call my safe-haven. The two windows in that room were boarded up, but there was one thing I had left untouched... the door. The previous nights had shown me, or I had thought had shown me, that I could just push a dresser infront of it and it would all go peachy. So I left it that way. But little did I know, it wouldn't go as planned on this night. About halfway through the night, as I'm backed into a corner scared half to death of all the noises coming from outside, I begin to hear, "rrrrrrrnnnnnnnn!" It sounded like the dresser I had infront of the un-barricaded door was being pushed. So, on instinct, I whipped out my flashlight, and shown it at the door, and in mid struggle, there it was, this creepy black creature, pushing the dresser out of the way. I was terrified, all I could do was hide, so I turned off my light, took out my only weapon, (a board with a few nails in it) and backed myself into a corner. I couldn't see anything, I sat there, scared half to death, with my board ready, for the rest of the night. Then, when the sun began to rise, I heard the dresser slide across the floor once again, as the creature left. ~ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIFYING!~","July 26, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, I can fall for jumpscares sometimes, but this game... this game isn't about jumpscares. In this game, all of it's scaring-ability is directly presented to you with a build up, which is most evident when night comes. This is one of those rare games where nighttime is actually terrifying like they claim (looking at you Minecraft and Don't Starve). During the night, you have to hunker down in your little log cabin and essentially pray for the morning light. Problem is that when the sun falls, demons come from the darkness and you're able to hear them as they attempt to penetrate your shoddily-crafted barricades. In one situation, I had barricaded a window and blocked off the two doors with a stool and a dresser, thinking that was sufficient. However, as I passed time in the pitch blackness of my room (generator had gone out), listening to the hellish shrieks, moans and snarls of the hunters lurking about outside, I encountered a new sound. A door opening and the sound of an object being shoved. The hairs on my arms stood up straight, my pulse quickened, chest tightened, and, in the darkness of the room, something else was with me. Going against everything my common sense was telling me, I lit a flare to get a look. When I spotted that disfigured demon casually shambling into my sanctuary my heart skipped a beat. Luckily, he hadn't seen me and I was able to quickly dispatch of him. This is how the scares in DARKWOOD are presented. You know they're coming, and the buildup to them is just as painful as the climax. Other than that, DARKWOOD presents a very intriguing plot and contains some of the coolest and most stylized NPCs around (I stared at the wolf merchant and the violin boy for a good five minutes). Overall, DARKWOOD shows great promise in its early access stage, and from this point, there's no where to go but up. Buy it if you don't mind the bugs that comes with early access or put it on your wishlist for later, because this game is 100% fantastic.","July 27, 2014","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't see ANYTHING until your line of sight, much like the beam of a flashlight (NEVER EVER MISTAKE IT FOR THE BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT, it is NOT a flashlight), alights on whatever is there.

Hard as hell though, the only weapon you'll have most of the time playing being the infamous plank with nails, while having to face monsters that can two hit kill you. Only complaints I have with the game: weapons are too hard to find along with sources of illumination.\n\nBUT hell man this is an AWESOME game, totally worth the money for me right now. Ive had plenty of scary moments, one of which I will share with you now...\n\nNight of the 2nd day. Doing pretty good. Got myself a alcohol bandage, a savage's twig, plenty of nails and boards, and some gasoline for the generator of the safehouse. I had just finished barricading the last window of the house when I see the well activate, telling me that night has offically begun. I quickly run outside via the side door and take a drink, then go back inside and barricade the door with my last remaining nails. I stand back to admire my haniwork, but my bright mood is cut short by the blabbering of a savage approaching the house. I snap out of my "safe" feeling and run back to the kitchen oven and sit in the corner to await the arrival of daylight.\nI sit there, my twig in hand, regretting that I did not have enough time to refuel the generator in my haste to barricade the safehouse. I hear a feral dog in the distance, getting closer. Angry growls are heard, and soon I hear the savage outside my house getting attacked by the dog. A few seconds later, I hear only the dog making any noises, and I can conclude who won the struggle. I feel relieved that the barricades are keeping them out of the house, and feel as if I might just survive the night. Then I hear something else approaching the house. But this wasnt a dog or a savage, it was a new monster. It had ghostly moans and wails that make chills run down my spine. I hear the whelp of the dog, and then, silence. I sit there completely still as I concentrate all my mind on the sound of this new threat. It's moans re-emerge, and it is right outside the kitchen window. "Please go away" I plead in my mind "Please go away". Then, I remember the only place in the house that I couldnt barricade, a hole in the side of the house that I blocked with a wardrobe.\n\nI hear the squeaking of the wardrobe's legs against the floor as it is moved.\n\nI light a few matches and drop them on the floor as the thing bashes through the kitchen door. It stares at me with glowing white eyes and lunges towards me. I frantically swing my stick in front of me, only to see that the blows are near harmless to the creature. I desperately try to escape the room as the creature bashes away at my health. I make it to the doorway as I hear a bone crunching sound, and my character falls. I am dead, and soon the creature stands over me, its pure white eyes the only thing amist the darkness of the night...","July 28, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The oppressive atmosphere really helps to immerse players into the game, while the overall difficulty really cements the fact that here in the forest the player is not the most dangerous thing lurking in the darkness. The gameplay is fairly simple at the moment; from a top-down view the player walks around the game world, their line of site represented by a visual cone, when the character is not facing something like, say, a searchable pile of rubble or a wandering enemy or NPC, they disappear from the game map, though you can still hear them. This is used to quite terrifying effect if your power goes out and a monster breaks into your home, as your field of view shrinks tremendously, or when you need to craft a weapon or use something from your inventory, as your field of vision disappears while your character has to rummage around inside his pack. Melee combat is fairly simple but rewarding, and good timing is key to surviving any unavoidable confrontation. I've seen gameplay of firearms, but have yet to personally acquire one myself.\n\nThe story, at this point, isn't all that clear to me. The bare bones of it is that the player character is stranded within a forest of the Soviet Block, apparently after some form of horrific mind and body altering plague outbreak, however, this is certainly not just another generic "and then zombies" story. The creatures and characters you will meet have been transformed or changed in very strange and terrifying ways. The current goal of the player seems to be to find their way out of the forest, a task that will take them quite some time as they must survive multiple nights, hidden in their homes as they are set upon by monstrosities from God knows where.\n\nThe game, being in early Alpha, does have its issues though.\n\nAs stated before, the game is quite difficult. Extremely so, to be honest. Chances are very high that, like myself, players will not find any remotely decent melee weapons for the first few nights at best, and will be forced to either run around their home all evening to flee from any intruding monsters or waste precious limited nails and wood boards used to barricade doors and windows or repair doors or windows to make what is essentially the crappiest weapon you can have; board with nails. This is accentuated by the fact that the map is randomly generated, with locations being spread out across different areas each time. Only once have I ever found an Axe within the first two nights, and that was pure luck.\n\nCurrently there is no difficulty option, and so players will constantly come face to face with extremely powerful and fast monsters. You can outrun most of them, but many can easily keep pace with the player, who will eventually run out of stamina when sprinting. When the player dies, they lose the remainder of the current day they were on, unless playing in Permadeath, as well as any collected items such as Mushrooms, while also taking large damage to any item with a durability meter, such as weapons, gas cans, or flashlights and lanterns. The game essentially punishes players for dying multiple times over, as the only way to repair melee weapons, for instance, is to find Repair Kits, which so far have been few and far between at best, which more or less forces one to make the decision of whether it's even worth it to bring a weapon or durability item with them outside of Permadeath because should they die it loses something near half of its durability, and every single bit is precious in this game where virtually everything you cannot speak to is trying to eat your face.\n\nHopefully in a future update, the durability of items will either be raised or the health of enemy monsters will be lowered, or some form of difficulty option will be implemented. I truly enjoy this game, but having all of my items breaking because I'm trying to explore to find objects to PREVENT myself from having my items breaking gets quite tiresome. Finding an Axe and Repair Kit only to have your house randomly besieged by a bird-headed beast and something that resembles a Schism from Silent Hill: Homecoming on the second night, dying, and then having to use that one precious Repair Kit just to ensure I can fix up my axe and try to not die the next night is not what I'd call fun, but tedious.\n\nThe game could definitely benefit from some more crafting options, such as  more traps. So far the only traps I'm aware of are Bear traps, which the player finds strewn about in the forest or in crates and such, or smashing some bottles to make broken glass. I'm surprised there's no option for, say, using some nails and a board to create a nail strip to put on window sills or something to that effect. Perhaps some wooden stakes the player could place outside of doors or windows to damage enemies that walk through them.  These do not need to do ludicrous amounts of damage, I just thought it would be a nice touch, seeing as how it's odd your character only seems to have the intelligence of nailing boards to door frames and windows, and not building much of anything else with them. They could even make the costs for such craftable things rather high, such as requiring 15 nails for one nail strip, or 10 boards for a single set of wooden stakes. Seeing as how these resources are fairly limited anyway, I don't see much issue in alloowing more options for people to use them on.\n\nIn the game, you can actually smash down doors and windows if, say, they are barricaded or locked. This offers another method of getting into locations should you lack a key or lockpick. However windows, and even when unbarricaded, doors have a ludicrous amount of durability. I'm not sure what those Soviets made their bedroom doors out of, perhaps reinforced concrete? Most weaponry, besides an Axe, breaks before a door or barricaded window is even at a third of its overall durability. These are, for all intents and purposes, old wooden doors with some old wooden boards nailed behind them. Why then does it take roughly a third of an axe's durability to chop one down, even when it's simply locked?\n\nThere's no way to attack without a melee weapon. The player cannot swing a punch or anything of the sort. While this does make the game more challenging, I also find it incredibly strange when facing another human enemy or wild dog that we cannot at least throw some exceptionally weak punches to fend them off. In most cases this would be suicide anyway, as once again, the enemies can take a fairly ridiculous amount of punishment while also dealing well over the damage the player deals in many cases, but it would still be nice to even have the option of being able to pathetically defend ourselves. I'm fairly certain if a naked man cornered me inside my home and began hurling rocks at me, I would at least try and defend myself, not continually run around the room.\n\nPerks at this point in time are somewhat pointless, unless you can survive for exceptionally long periods of time you will simply die and lose the perks you just wasted some of the limited number of mushrooms you've gathered on. I've simply taken to storing the mushrooms in hopes of selling them later. Once again, a difficulty where the player could actually keep the perks to see the actual fruits of their labors would be nice.\n\nEvery night at the start of the night cycle, the player must drink from the well outside their home, or else die from...whatever sort of plague or disease is currently ravaging their body. This is an interesting feature, however it requires the player to remain soleley at their beginning house where the well is located. There are a number of other "friendly" NPCs around the map whom are most likely suffering from the same ill-effects as the player character, and yet you are the only one with a well outside of your home. It'd be cool to be able to set up shop at other homes with wells.","August 31, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really thouroughly enjoyed it, although as a survival horror where punishment is so severe, its slow going. Lack of story in these parts can end up making it a chore just to play. As well as complete save wipes with every early access update and game mechenics changing to the point where I have to relearn how to play every time, I am going to wait until the game is fully released and polished before I put many valueble hours into playing it from start to finish. Aside from that I quite like the survival aspects, the environmental interaction and the fact that you have to experiment with things. Be prepared for trial and error and a massive learning curve, although this is where all the fun is. When you do progress or things go right, it feels really good as a change from the brutal world.

It may just be me but they probably need to put up a disclamer at the begining of the game to say that its hard coz jebus is this game hard. from that taste of story i have gotten so far, the plot itself seems very vague but focused at the same time, it would be great to see another game from Acid Wizard set in the same universe as Darkwood.\n\nmy few itches that havent been scratched yet are the map mechanics, if there was a way to get your exact position on the map to show up that would totally open up the game, being in an area with no aparent landmarks with the sun going down and the "locals" crawling out of their hidey holes is both terrifing and frustrating. also, (quick note) the whole drinking from the well at the begining of the night is anoying. the threat of being hunted my monsters and the like is hard enough, and having that extra pressure of drinking from the well push's me as the player, closer to the keyboard smashing phase of frustration. It replaces the fear of the monsters with the fear of the insta-death-dehydration. if there was a drink bottle that you could use once a night, allowing you to hold up in other buildings overnight would make the whole "lost and trapped in the scary woods" more punctual.\n\nThis game deservse more attention, being able to scare players from a 'topdown' perspective is a hard thing to do and Acid Wizard has done this well. However although there isnt much ingame punishment for dying, you should be afraid of it, due to it making the game loose pace and in some cases, die alltogether.\n\nOverall, the creepy and interesting plot, and clever rpg-survival mechanics have kept me returning to this gem, every once in a while.\n\n","April 4, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each sound or artsy detail comes together to create a surreal horror experience.  Although the game itself is not completely terrifying in the way that a game such as Outlast might be, it's difficult to deny this game won't cause your heart to beat slightly faster.  The game's intensity also adds a lot to the atmosphere and gameplay.  I constantly find myself running to blockade doors in the midst of terror and panic.  Another great aspect of this game is the fact that they are updating it.  For example, initially I had problems differentiating day and night; however, a somewhat recent update has brightened day and seemingly darkened the night.

I backed this title on Indigogo originally, and early on was drawn to the idea. Every other game I have backed was a disappointment but not this one! Even for being in alpha state, the game already succeeds at drawing you into the creepy and somtimes terrying world of Darkwood. My review follows, but for those that do not wish to read TL;DR: A monster started chasing me, so I sprinted towards my house. I lost him, but ran into a mushroom and died. 10/10\n\nGameplay\nYou wake up in your safehouse after the prologue. A man with a dog face waits for you, and gives you some basics. He gives you some clues about the mysterious Dogtag you have on you, and points you towards the "Chicken Lady" to the west. From here you're on your own. Your main objective is to follow the clues, but along the way you may follow a trail or a strange noise and before you know it you're exploring the world. Littered along the woods are items and crafting supplies, letting you make some basic survival supplies. When it starts to get dark, the thirst comes forcing you to return to the safehouse where a well keeps you alive for another day. But the day doesn't end here, now you can cook the items you found infected with whatever is eating up the woods. This results in essence, which act as experience points. When you've collected enough essence, you get to select from a list of skills. They range from nice to incredibly useful, but somtimes a player must also take a downside to balance out the power. When you die, you return to your home with your equipped items slighty damaged, all your essence items stolen and back at level 1, so you should think twice before storming into a fight. Health is pretty basic, but there is also stamina which is used by using items or running.\n\nControls\nThe controls are interesting. Most of the game is played with the mouse and WASD. Items that have more than one action accessible to the player have a context menu that is brought up. You can sprint with shift and open the inventory/crafting menu with tab. There is also a map (m) and a journal (j). For me the controls felt fairly smooth and natural.","July 26, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had just sprinted all the way back to my some-what fortified base, took a drink from a well, and made my way inside. I began shutting all the doors I could, and got into a room I had began to call my safe-haven. The two windows in that room were boarded up, but there was one thing I had left untouched... the door. The previous nights had shown me, or I had thought had shown me, that I could just push a dresser infront of it and it would all go peachy. So I left it that way. But little did I know, it wouldn't go as planned on this night. About halfway through the night, as I'm backed into a corner scared half to death of all the noises coming from outside, I begin to hear, "rrrrrrrnnnnnnnn!" It sounded like the dresser I had infront of the un-barricaded door was being pushed. So, on instinct, I whipped out my flashlight, and shown it at the door, and in mid struggle, there it was, this creepy black creature, pushing the dresser out of the way. I was terrified, all I could do was hide, so I turned off my light, took out my only weapon, (a board with a few nails in it) and backed myself into a corner. I couldn't see anything, I sat there, scared half to death, with my board ready, for the rest of the night. Then, when the sun began to rise, I heard the dresser slide across the floor once again, as the creature left. ~ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIFYING!~","July 26, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While some have complained about the game not giving you any sort of direction or instruction, I find that to be the farthest thing from the truth. The game tells you exactly where to go. Loot is abundant, objectives are clear, and enemies are not too many but not too few (until night). The game is definitely worth a play, and as it sees updates, it looks like it can only get better. The game does present some major issues so far, however.\n\nYou cannot escape dogs. They are too fast. Either you fight them or you die, or avoid them if you have the skill. Fighting them can prove difficult early on as it may be easy to make nail boards, but those nails and boards are also important for barricading your home's windows, which keeps you safer longer and reduces line of sight, keeping you hidden easier. It would make a lot more sense if we were at least able to use our fists. If any of us were to be attacked by a dog, I feel like we'd fight back. Most of the enemies are extremely tough as well. Natives have obscene reach that is very hard to counter. Best to just find a gun, which can take some time. You're best taking on enemies (if you really have to fight) one at a time, as the majority of the enemies are more than twice as fast as you, have superior reach, and an infinite amount of stamina, while you can only sprint and swing for so long before they're chewing your heels off.  Most natives can, however, be outrun. Stamina conservation is key.\n\nSpeaking of fighting back, it cannot be done at night, plain and simple. You can barricade everything in your house, everything, and sit quietly with the lights off, not making a sound. Eventually, a big baddy is gonna knock down your doors/barricades, let a pack of wolves in, and eat you for a midnight snack, as if it knew you were there the whole time. Alternatively, you can use what precious fuel you find to fuel your generator, to keep your lights on. While this offers amazing lighting that rivals even daytime light, it only makes it easier to watch yourself get eaten by the mob of enemies. While I understand the game is meant to make you feel unsafe, alone, and scared, it's very frustrating when fighting back is so hard.\n\nAside from these issues, I can't think of anything else that's wrong with this game. Maybe the economy needs some balancing, or perhaps combat needs to be tweaked, reworked a little even, but otherwise the game at its best moments is fun and genuinely challenging. The atmosphere is terrifying, which is difficult to achieve with a top down game.\n\nPlay it, help further development.","July 31, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The oppressive atmosphere really helps to immerse players into the game, while the overall difficulty really cements the fact that here in the forest the player is not the most dangerous thing lurking in the darkness. The gameplay is fairly simple at the moment; from a top-down view the player walks around the game world, their line of site represented by a visual cone, when the character is not facing something like, say, a searchable pile of rubble or a wandering enemy or NPC, they disappear from the game map, though you can still hear them. This is used to quite terrifying effect if your power goes out and a monster breaks into your home, as your field of view shrinks tremendously, or when you need to craft a weapon or use something from your inventory, as your field of vision disappears while your character has to rummage around inside his pack. Melee combat is fairly simple but rewarding, and good timing is key to surviving any unavoidable confrontation. I've seen gameplay of firearms, but have yet to personally acquire one myself.\n\nThe story, at this point, isn't all that clear to me. The bare bones of it is that the player character is stranded within a forest of the Soviet Block, apparently after some form of horrific mind and body altering plague outbreak, however, this is certainly not just another generic "and then zombies" story. The creatures and characters you will meet have been transformed or changed in very strange and terrifying ways. The current goal of the player seems to be to find their way out of the forest, a task that will take them quite some time as they must survive multiple nights, hidden in their homes as they are set upon by monstrosities from God knows where.\n\nThe game, being in early Alpha, does have its issues though.\n\nAs stated before, the game is quite difficult. Extremely so, to be honest. Chances are very high that, like myself, players will not find any remotely decent melee weapons for the first few nights at best, and will be forced to either run around their home all evening to flee from any intruding monsters or waste precious limited nails and wood boards used to barricade doors and windows or repair doors or windows to make what is essentially the crappiest weapon you can have; board with nails. This is accentuated by the fact that the map is randomly generated, with locations being spread out across different areas each time. Only once have I ever found an Axe within the first two nights, and that was pure luck.\n\nCurrently there is no difficulty option, and so players will constantly come face to face with extremely powerful and fast monsters. You can outrun most of them, but many can easily keep pace with the player, who will eventually run out of stamina when sprinting. When the player dies, they lose the remainder of the current day they were on, unless playing in Permadeath, as well as any collected items such as Mushrooms, while also taking large damage to any item with a durability meter, such as weapons, gas cans, or flashlights and lanterns. The game essentially punishes players for dying multiple times over, as the only way to repair melee weapons, for instance, is to find Repair Kits, which so far have been few and far between at best, which more or less forces one to make the decision of whether it's even worth it to bring a weapon or durability item with them outside of Permadeath because should they die it loses something near half of its durability, and every single bit is precious in this game where virtually everything you cannot speak to is trying to eat your face.\n\nHopefully in a future update, the durability of items will either be raised or the health of enemy monsters will be lowered, or some form of difficulty option will be implemented. I truly enjoy this game, but having all of my items breaking because I'm trying to explore to find objects to PREVENT myself from having my items breaking gets quite tiresome. Finding an Axe and Repair Kit only to have your house randomly besieged by a bird-headed beast and something that resembles a Schism from Silent Hill: Homecoming on the second night, dying, and then having to use that one precious Repair Kit just to ensure I can fix up my axe and try to not die the next night is not what I'd call fun, but tedious.\n\nThe game could definitely benefit from some more crafting options, such as  more traps. So far the only traps I'm aware of are Bear traps, which the player finds strewn about in the forest or in crates and such, or smashing some bottles to make broken glass. I'm surprised there's no option for, say, using some nails and a board to create a nail strip to put on window sills or something to that effect. Perhaps some wooden stakes the player could place outside of doors or windows to damage enemies that walk through them.  These do not need to do ludicrous amounts of damage, I just thought it would be a nice touch, seeing as how it's odd your character only seems to have the intelligence of nailing boards to door frames and windows, and not building much of anything else with them. They could even make the costs for such craftable things rather high, such as requiring 15 nails for one nail strip, or 10 boards for a single set of wooden stakes. Seeing as how these resources are fairly limited anyway, I don't see much issue in alloowing more options for people to use them on.\n\nIn the game, you can actually smash down doors and windows if, say, they are barricaded or locked. This offers another method of getting into locations should you lack a key or lockpick. However windows, and even when unbarricaded, doors have a ludicrous amount of durability. I'm not sure what those Soviets made their bedroom doors out of, perhaps reinforced concrete? Most weaponry, besides an Axe, breaks before a door or barricaded window is even at a third of its overall durability. These are, for all intents and purposes, old wooden doors with some old wooden boards nailed behind them. Why then does it take roughly a third of an axe's durability to chop one down, even when it's simply locked?\n\nThere's no way to attack without a melee weapon. The player cannot swing a punch or anything of the sort. While this does make the game more challenging, I also find it incredibly strange when facing another human enemy or wild dog that we cannot at least throw some exceptionally weak punches to fend them off. In most cases this would be suicide anyway, as once again, the enemies can take a fairly ridiculous amount of punishment while also dealing well over the damage the player deals in many cases, but it would still be nice to even have the option of being able to pathetically defend ourselves. I'm fairly certain if a naked man cornered me inside my home and began hurling rocks at me, I would at least try and defend myself, not continually run around the room.\n\nPerks at this point in time are somewhat pointless, unless you can survive for exceptionally long periods of time you will simply die and lose the perks you just wasted some of the limited number of mushrooms you've gathered on. I've simply taken to storing the mushrooms in hopes of selling them later. Once again, a difficulty where the player could actually keep the perks to see the actual fruits of their labors would be nice.\n\nEvery night at the start of the night cycle, the player must drink from the well outside their home, or else die from...whatever sort of plague or disease is currently ravaging their body. This is an interesting feature, however it requires the player to remain soleley at their beginning house where the well is located. There are a number of other "friendly" NPCs around the map whom are most likely suffering from the same ill-effects as the player character, and yet you are the only one with a well outside of your home. It'd be cool to be able to set up shop at other homes with wells.","August 31, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may just be me but they probably need to put up a disclamer at the begining of the game to say that its hard coz jebus is this game hard. from that taste of story i have gotten so far, the plot itself seems very vague but focused at the same time, it would be great to see another game from Acid Wizard set in the same universe as Darkwood.\n\nmy few itches that havent been scratched yet are the map mechanics, if there was a way to get your exact position on the map to show up that would totally open up the game, being in an area with no aparent landmarks with the sun going down and the "locals" crawling out of their hidey holes is both terrifing and frustrating. also, (quick note) the whole drinking from the well at the begining of the night is anoying. the threat of being hunted my monsters and the like is hard enough, and having that extra pressure of drinking from the well push's me as the player, closer to the keyboard smashing phase of frustration. It replaces the fear of the monsters with the fear of the insta-death-dehydration. if there was a drink bottle that you could use once a night, allowing you to hold up in other buildings overnight would make the whole "lost and trapped in the scary woods" more punctual.\n\nThis game deservse more attention, being able to scare players from a 'topdown' perspective is a hard thing to do and Acid Wizard has done this well. However although there isnt much ingame punishment for dying, you should be afraid of it, due to it making the game loose pace and in some cases, die alltogether.\n\nOverall, the creepy and interesting plot, and clever rpg-survival mechanics have kept me returning to this gem, every once in a while.\n\n","April 4, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a rather steep learning curve for first timers... But for those who brave it and learn from it, I assure you that you will thuroughly enjoy this game. Suffice it to say, your character may die in this game... perhaps a lot in your first play through. Though, like dark souls, every 'death' is a learning experience, and this game rewards persistance.\n\nMatched with an environment as creepy as its well-told story, the Devs have truly outdone themselves with the creation of compelling (and very disturbing) characters shown in a world full of danger. You will quickly need to learn how to survive and, for the sake of maintaining the resorces you find, find tricks to keeping your character alive.\n\nThe fact that this game is still in Alpha is, for me, among the most exciting factors of the experience. In and of itself, the game has run without flaw from me, save a few minor easy-to-avoid/get past glitches that I have seen in many slelf-proclaimed 'finished' games. Just so, the thought of MORE being added to this game in every aspect pleases me greatly. This is a game well worth both attention and support... And heck, why not have a GREAT time playing what they have thus far while doing both of these things?","February 10, 2015","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Standing there, all I could do was shift my vison around the room in a vein attempt to spot the source of the noises which I could not identify. Luckily nothing broke in and I continued on, repeating another uneventfull but nervous night in a corner listening to the creaks of wood floors, the sound of a struggle ending with a dog's whimper, and a deep gurgling sound that seemed to be moving around my dilapidated sanctuary.\n\nOn my third night in game I had found a few bear traps and placed them around my hide out in the hopes of killing anything that would be foolish enough to ambush me. Lo and behold, something started to beat down my door and I sat there clutching my half broken board hoping it would be enough to protect me from whatever was coming to get me. Just as the last sliver of life was torn away from my feeble defenses one of my cats burst thru my door and jumped onto my shoulder. I cried out and knocked the cat to the floor who then bolted out of the room.\n\nI sat there staring at the screen, still breathing heavily, while my groggy eyed wife slowly pushed open the door to my study to ask what had happened. I turned off my monitor, reasured her nothing was wrong, and followed her to bed. I then stared at the ceiling with my eyes darting around our darkened room at every unfamiliar noise. She awoke 6 hours later with me sitting in a chair in the corner of the room watching the door and windows.\n\n10/10 - I will continue to lose many nights of sleep over this game.

Not pleasant at all...\n\nAfter being *rescued* by a mysterious *Doctor* during a supposed viral based epidemic (or so we're led to believe, at least in your own mind), you are thrust into a decrepid world where 'surviving' is key. Doing so requires crafting, making the choice between fight or flee, setting up a stronghold/barricade that will need to be prepared in order to fend off the creepy creatures that lurk in the night, and build your character enough that they may eventually brave deeper into the horrible world. Materials will be needed, weapons are mandatory, so there will be no bunkering down for days and hoping things go away - You will have to go out into that awful world - And there is no compass to direct you.\n\nDark Wood is a desperate experience, from sprinting from a quest location towards your home, trying to get to safety before night rolls over the forest, to scavanging during the day only to be met by angry wildlife or vicious humanoids who are far from human.\n\nNPC's will open up quests or information when you bring them specific items, yet none of them can be considered 'normal' by any stretch. You can also opt to kill them in cold-blood and ransack their homes, if you are that way inclined. One way or the other, survival is paramount, while exploring and partaking in quests is up to you.\n\nThe experience as a whole is not so much terrifying as it is permanently creepy, from corpses and destruction dotted all around the random map, to cowering in the corner of your fortified base while monsters roam outside (or even inside) your 'safehouse' while you cry and pray for morning to rise.\n\nIf you're a fan of the 2D style and enjoy crafting/barricade based survival horror, with a dirty creepy world to explore and the simple fact that running is a VERY valid option over fighting for your life, then you'll love Dark Wood.\n\nI'll be watching the growth of this game with interest and can't wait to see what else it adds into the mix.","August 28, 2014","true","37.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound is practically everything in a game besides the basic functionalities, in Darkwood, if you hear that twig snap, that means either you, or something else has just walked over it. You hear that thing that went bump in the night? Odds are it's something that very much would like to see you deceased. This was a trait that keeps me on edge when playing and definitely caught my attention during my time playing it.\n\nThe overall Graphics is simplistic in design, yet complex and very well thought-out. Instead of making the game a simple First-Person or even a normal third-person game. The Acid Wizards took it up a notch by using a top-down view of your character. Trees are very detailed in perspective and as you hover your mouse over them, they will disappear as your character gains vision to that specific area, leaving other areas not in your field of view cone covered by a dense brush of trees and other foliage, this makes the game very unique as it can leave you unaware of what might be hiding underneath that treeline you have come across and very may well be your final mistake.\n\nKeeping an eye on this game as since the initial 1.0 Alpha version it has come a very long way from then and the developers have introduced many more features to it, let alone improving overall performance and enjoyability. However it should be noted heavily that as the game states, it is very unforgiving and one wrong move can easily spell your doom.","August 6, 2015","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was being killed going outside the house and at night by savages breaking through my "fortified" windows. I was becoming severely frustrated. However, I found out hiding in a corner behind my wardrobe protected me, if anything got inside. That's when the game took a turn from frustrating to addicting. I started traveling only in cardinal directions, in that way I never got lost again. A few days surviving, turned into weeks of surviving. After not dying for nearly 40 days, I was full level, was in hideout 2, had an arsenal of weapons, supplies, and enough gasoline to light up my place forever. Around day 55 I decided it was finally time to venture to the Old Woods. It had taken a lot of grinding and sleepless nights, but I felt ready to finally embark on the quests I had received months ago now. My nights in the meadow and the forest had spoiled me once I finally arrived in the Old Woods. I had weapons and a♥♥♥♥♥♥lore, but I was thoroughly unprepared. Nightmarish creatures chased me the minute I arrived. I don't know how to describe them, but I know I'll never forget the terror they instilled. They were blood red with enormous black teeth. They were much faster than me, but I had a gun. It took some effort, but i managed to kill them both. I had low health at this point and it was about 6:30pm. I was a tad lost, but knew I had to try to make it home. I ate a mushroom and rushed home at top speed. By the time I made it to the threshold between the Forest and Old Woods it was about 8:30pm. It was very dark and I was beginning to grow concerned. The noises in the Forest at night are enough to worry any man... I raced to the chicken ladies' house and made it there about 9pm. I had a half an hour to make it to the well before the thirst set in. About halfway between my house and her's, a monstrous version of the nightmarish creatures I had encountered in the Old Woods began to persue me at great speed. It had a dark, foggy-like miasma all about it and it was much faster and stronger than it's counterparts. I tried to get away, but it was too fast for me. I could see the lights of my house on in the background. I was so close... I fired a few shots at the creature as I backed up toward the light. The creature proved to fast for me and dodged my shots. I could see the front door now of my generator shed, but the creature was relentless. The creature attacked, I dodged, and in the lull, rushed for the shed. I busted through the door and the creature took a bite as I made it through the threshold. I was low on health and the creature was much too fast for me to attempt to bind the wounds or take one of those magic heal-all pills. I rushed through the shed to the second room, the creature tried to take it's last bite, but it missed. I rushed around the corner trying to make it to my wardrobe. I thought that, maybe if I could get behind it, maybe I could hide out until morning. I got behind the wardrobe and almost got it in front of the creature, but the creature proved much too powerful. He wouldn't be impeded by a mere wooden wardrobe like his weaker counterparts, or the measly savages. In an instant, the wardrobe was thrown across the room. There was nothing between the creature and I now. I had no bullets left for my pistol and only one shell left in my single-shot shotgun. I took my shot, Then everything went dark. I woke up next to my oven the next day without a scratch, but I no longer could "see" as well as I could before. I needed more of the precious "essence". I decided instead of venturing to the Old Woods and risking death again, I would venture around the "much safer" Forest. Within the hour, I ran into two savages and a huge dog. In my scuffle with them, I killed one of the savages and severely wounded the dog. I attempted to run away from them, in the hopes of healing myself and returning, and ran right into a bear trap. It snapped.... and sealed my doom.\nSo, the moral of the story, is this is one of the greatest games I have played in a very long time. There's a lot to see and do, interesteding story premise, quests, and its incredibly addicting. I can't wait for this game to be completely finished, but even in this early Alpha state, I haven't even begun to explore the Old Woods and complete many of the quests. I didn't expect much out of this game, what with it being early Alpha release, and me knowing nothing about the game. I took a chance and bought it, and I can say that it was entirely worth it and I look forward to the future of this game. Good job devs, I hope to see even more cool features implemented into the game and can't wait for the official release.\nMy one criticism would be the absence of a save function :/\nOtherwise easily 11/10 (Extremely addicting) :D\n\nUpdate: Haven't played this game in almost a year I think, (it was still Alpha 0.0) and I gotta say, I'm loving a lot of the updates. Glad you guys went back to spawning in a hideout when you died. I feel you've made a lot of improvements in terms of crafting. Love the new monsters and night events, LOVE The Three! I somewhat miss the well, but not that much :) All in all, I'm glad to see how far this game has come. Still very fun and addictive, and I feel that you've made it easier for new players to be able to learn the game.

I was being killed going outside the house and at night by savages breaking through my "fortified" windows. I was becoming severely frustrated. However, I found out hiding in a corner behind my wardrobe protected me, if anything got inside. That's when the game took a turn from frustrating to addicting. I started traveling only in cardinal directions, in that way I never got lost again. A few days surviving, turned into weeks of surviving. After not dying for nearly 40 days, I was full level, was in hideout 2, had an arsenal of weapons, supplies, and enough gasoline to light up my place forever. Around day 55 I decided it was finally time to venture to the Old Woods. It had taken a lot of grinding and sleepless nights, but I felt ready to finally embark on the quests I had received months ago now. My nights in the meadow and the forest had spoiled me once I finally arrived in the Old Woods. I had weapons and a♥♥♥♥♥♥lore, but I was thoroughly unprepared. Nightmarish creatures chased me the minute I arrived. I don't know how to describe them, but I know I'll never forget the terror they instilled. They were blood red with enormous black teeth. They were much faster than me, but I had a gun. It took some effort, but i managed to kill them both. I had low health at this point and it was about 6:30pm. I was a tad lost, but knew I had to try to make it home. I ate a mushroom and rushed home at top speed. By the time I made it to the threshold between the Forest and Old Woods it was about 8:30pm. It was very dark and I was beginning to grow concerned. The noises in the Forest at night are enough to worry any man... I raced to the chicken ladies' house and made it there about 9pm. I had a half an hour to make it to the well before the thirst set in. About halfway between my house and her's, a monstrous version of the nightmarish creatures I had encountered in the Old Woods began to persue me at great speed. It had a dark, foggy-like miasma all about it and it was much faster and stronger than it's counterparts. I tried to get away, but it was too fast for me. I could see the lights of my house on in the background. I was so close... I fired a few shots at the creature as I backed up toward the light. The creature proved to fast for me and dodged my shots. I could see the front door now of my generator shed, but the creature was relentless. The creature attacked, I dodged, and in the lull, rushed for the shed. I busted through the door and the creature took a bite as I made it through the threshold. I was low on health and the creature was much too fast for me to attempt to bind the wounds or take one of those magic heal-all pills. I rushed through the shed to the second room, the creature tried to take it's last bite, but it missed. I rushed around the corner trying to make it to my wardrobe. I thought that, maybe if I could get behind it, maybe I could hide out until morning. I got behind the wardrobe and almost got it in front of the creature, but the creature proved much too powerful. He wouldn't be impeded by a mere wooden wardrobe like his weaker counterparts, or the measly savages. In an instant, the wardrobe was thrown across the room. There was nothing between the creature and I now. I had no bullets left for my pistol and only one shell left in my single-shot shotgun. I took my shot, Then everything went dark. I woke up next to my oven the next day without a scratch, but I no longer could "see" as well as I could before. I needed more of the precious "essence". I decided instead of venturing to the Old Woods and risking death again, I would venture around the "much safer" Forest. Within the hour, I ran into two savages and a huge dog. In my scuffle with them, I killed one of the savages and severely wounded the dog. I attempted to run away from them, in the hopes of healing myself and returning, and ran right into a bear trap. It snapped.... and sealed my doom.\nSo, the moral of the story, is this is one of the greatest games I have played in a very long time. There's a lot to see and do, interesteding story premise, quests, and its incredibly addicting. I can't wait for this game to be completely finished, but even in this early Alpha state, I haven't even begun to explore the Old Woods and complete many of the quests. I didn't expect much out of this game, what with it being early Alpha release, and me knowing nothing about the game. I took a chance and bought it, and I can say that it was entirely worth it and I look forward to the future of this game. Good job devs, I hope to see even more cool features implemented into the game and can't wait for the official release.\nMy one criticism would be the absence of a save function :/\nOtherwise easily 11/10 (Extremely addicting) :D\n\nUpdate: Haven't played this game in almost a year I think, (it was still Alpha 0.0) and I gotta say, I'm loving a lot of the updates. Glad you guys went back to spawning in a hideout when you died. I feel you've made a lot of improvements in terms of crafting. Love the new monsters and night events, LOVE The Three! I somewhat miss the well, but not that much :) All in all, I'm glad to see how far this game has come. Still very fun and addictive, and I feel that you've made it easier for new players to be able to learn the game.

But im sure most of these issues will be balanced in the future. I hope","July 20, 2015","true","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I saw the content and I was perplexed, I played the game and now I want more.\nThis game is difficult if you don't learn the ropes quickly, prepare to die multiple times. The darkness is always present, and you will learn to fear what is in the dark, rather than the fact you cant see. These developers made a  bombshell and they know it, yet they have wrapped themselves in such a subtle, thought-out story that it may be hard to progress to new chapters. I sincerely hope they deliver.\n\nTip:\nPlanks are your friend, the more you have, the better, and make sure you don't neglect their friends the nails. Barricades mean life or death.\n\nFYI: This is a game that doesn't get boring even though you have both a pistol and a shotgun, after all those only take down the small fry...\n\n-------UPDATE--------\n\nIts in alpha 7 now and they really are fine tuning this  game. They want the story and elements to be perfect. I really hope they don't abandon an "Alpha" game and stop the early access and run away with our money. They are preparing chapter 2 which is a good sign at least, but how many chapters will there be? To be continued......","July 21, 2015","true","46.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
