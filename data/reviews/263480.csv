I will try to update my review as more updates come out. The game is now out of Early Access!\n\nRating at the moment: 8.5/10\nFinal Rush is a Sci-fi FPS game, which at the moment, only has Co-op and singleplayer. The game mode at the moment, Rush, has you and up to 3 teammates battling 10 waves of robots. It's like Killing Floor and COD: Zombies. As the rounds progress, you are met with an increasing amount of difficulty and diversity of robots. At the moment, there are 9 weapons to choose from, 8 upgrades, and 5 different levels. The weapons options and upgrades are good. Types of robots and  types of weapons and upgrades\nEDIT: The guides are out-of-date, but it's the only guides there are and they have most of it covered.\n\n- Settings?: Here's screenshots of them:\nAudio [imgur.com]\nVideo  [imgur.com]\nResolution goes from 320 x 200 to your screen's resolution. Anisotropic Filtering goes from 2X to 16X. Anti Aliasing goes from FXAA0 to FXAA3\nControls [imgur.com]\nYou can change them.\nGamePlay [imgur.com]\nFor purchasing game before price drop.\n\n- Visuals?: Visually, this game looks amazing. The animations look a little weird, but other than that it's great.\n\n- Sound?: The sound is alright, but it sounds a little wierd with this new update.\n\n- Bugs?: There are thankfully not much bugs. I've only seen around 4.\n\n- Singleplayer?: You are able to play by yourself, but so far the only thing to do is play Rush. The game is very difficult playing by yourself and there aren't much people that play this game.\n\n- Multiplayer?: It's you and up to 3 people battling robots. There are a few dedicated servers, but barely anybody that plays this game.[steamcharts.com] That being said, they did an amazing job with multiplayer. It's really fun to play with other people and earn some friends. You can get cornered a lot though, so make sure you have a mic to help yourself and others out. You can make your own dedicated servers.\n\n- Customization?: They have now added a customization tab in the main menu. When you level up, you earn more armor options, skills, and gun upgrades. You can buy these using the points you earn from beating games and leveling up. There are about 4 options for each armor piece, including head, bodym shoulders, legs, and boots. You can upgrade your guns to increase mag size, damage, etc. You can buy skills to make you run faster, reload faster, etc. There are around 25 skills.\n\n- Content?: There are now 5 levels, around 9 weapons, around 8 upgrades during each match, 1 gamemode, multiple achievements, tradings cards, leveling up, and customization for your player and weapons. This game could use more content and workshop support, but it has enough to earn a quite a few fun hours. What they need is more gamemodes and levels. In MY opinion, they only need more levels, weapons, and workshop support.\n\n- Replayable?: Somewhat repeatable, you should be able to get quite a few good hours into it. The addition of achievements, trading cards, and more have made this game more fun replayable (if that's a word). The addition of customization of characters, guns, skills, and even leveling up have definitely made the game more fun and intresting.\n\n- Developers?: I'm very happy to say that the developers have delivered this update, and it is looking wonderful. There have been more updates and they continue to deliver what they promised they would. With more graphic options and improved visuals. I like the Path of Development so far, and I do wish them luck. They are active in the forums and they do respond to peoples problems. Sometimes, their response can even be humerous.\n\n- What is Needed?: Workshop support\nMore content (guns, upgrades, levels, etc.)\nMore players (which they can't really change :/)\nThe ability to crouch\nAn improved scoreboard\nVoting system\nIncrease in amount of players allowed in each game (4 right now)\n# of robots determined by players\n- Verdict?: The game is actually quite fun. There is a lack of content and multiplayer could be improved, but they will do that in the future. I recommend getting this game now. If none of your friends play, convince them too or just ask people in discussions to play or ask me. People will be eager to play and I hope it will work out for you.","July 6, 2014","true","41.3"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","0"

I like the visuals and the robot comments they make when shot, and the ways their bodies slump around in robot garbage heaps when taking them down. Yes, there is not a whole lot of variety in the enemies and some weapon balancing is in order, but there is a foundation here for a really fun coop experience. So far i just have a few personal gripes that arnt very big fixes but would make things much smoother atm.\n\n-first and most importantly, get real multiplayer going between steam friends ASAP. I have 2 friends myself that ive managed to sell this too, but they won't buy until they have multiplayer other than LAN\n-allow custom key bindings (i know it looks like you can, but everytime i set keys differently, they just reset to normal upon leaving menu)\n-A "jump" would be nice. Let's face it, when you play fps games nowadays, the ones who "ground" you with no jump feel as if there is something lacking mobilitywise the whole time.\n\nAnyways, i do really enjoy this game and can see the potential like i said.\nKeep up the good work!\n-","January 18, 2014","true","14.0"," 66 of 91 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","66","91","0","2"

Just pick a gun and you're off. No story or cutscenes etc. Robots just keep coming harder and faster and bigger, while you improve your weaponry and features.\n\nControl and gameplay are excellent, though still lacking in movement options like all fps games these days (can't move much while shooting; can't sprint and strafe).\n\nWeapon options are quite good. You start with a choice of shotty, assault rifle, battle rifle, and the weaponry builds from there.\n\nThe middle tier weapon options could include a true auto smg, but it'll get there I'm sure. The shotguns seem OP.\n\nAnyway, jump in; grab a gun; shoot until you die!","January 26, 2014","true","14.8"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","36","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnbdelta/recommended/263480/","tnbdelta","Delta | Technicolour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tnbdelta/","119 products in account","-Release review\n\n--Scroll to bottom for an up-to-date review.\n\n--OLD REVIEW\n[YES I KNOW ITS AN ALPHA]\n\n100% Honest review.\n\nI would not reccomend this game in its current state. I bought it on a whim and quit after surviving 3 waves, There isn't a server browser but there is a LAN option. Gameplay is repetitive and boring, Just wave after wave of killing boring enemies with a limited use of weapons. There isn't any character customization, story nor different game modes. Maybe after 6+ Months of updates it would be worth purchasing but in its current state; HELL NO!\n\nIn all honesty this game isn't worth buying even with -33% or even -75% off.\n\nI managed to last 1 hour, After 15 minutes I was bored, There isn't anything new or exciting at all older games such as Killing Floors (Even thought it is a slightly different genre, the concept it very similar) is much better. There is no character progression you just survive each round save up and buy a new weapon. That is pretty much the entire game in a nutshell.\n\nI feel pretty much robbed at this point. I'd expect a lot better than this even for an early access game.. a total mistake buying this even whilst on sale feels like a cheap cash grab even after being under development for 2 years. I own a lot of early access games both with and without steam and this is in my top 5 rubbish list, I've already unistalled it and will give it ago 8 months down the line.\n\nAlso if you're using the shotgun you have to keep spamming R to reload, and it only reloads one shell at a time which is kinda annoying when you're trying to keep an eye out for the enemies. You can't even jump in this game, The environment is pretty standard and doesn't stand-out anywhere noticably. The devs say its their first game out of the studio and it shows, A good attempt but lacks content and there isn't a reason to even play it after 3 waves.\n\nEven when loading up the game for the first time it states there is a game update so I click on the update button and it loads up a web page stating that there isn't an update? O.o\n\nEdit: Reponse to developer (Also posted in comments)\n\nHello developer,\nI'm happy to receive a response directly from a developer, during the last couple of years  with game studios both big and small struggling I can to some degree understand your viewpoint.\n\nI'm also glad to see that the game will continue to be developed as I was worried from what I had seen (v1.00) and the dates surrounding the release and development.\n\nMultiplayer nowadays is certainly a must when it comes to first person shooters and being a game launched on steam I personally believe it is very important to have some kind of server browser regardless of what format and I am also hopeful now that the server option is being worked on.\n\nI may have come across a little bit harsh in my review but for a small studio graphically I believe the game is quite solid. Environment features such as exploding barrels, laser trip mines & different types of grenades (Example. EMP & Damage over time grenades) aside from the regular fragmentation grenades. The ability to jump would also significantly improve player-environment interaction (Example. Climbing onto boxes when cornered etc)\n\nI will be checking back time to time on this game and even though my review was negative I believe that this could be a decent to great game.\n\nI'd love to have a chat sometime and discuss some small ideas that I personally think would benefit the overall experience of the game.\n\nLastly I'd like to thank you for the offer of a 15 dollar steam game of my choice and it is this type of developer to customer communication that just goes to show that even small studios care what their customers think and not just about sales figures.\n\n-----------Update----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've downloaded and played it again to see what all these updates are!\n\nThere has definitively been some progress, The GUI revamp is nice!\nThe enemy AI is more intelligent.\nIt interested me enough to actually beat wave 10. (The game)\nI couldn't test out the Multiplayer because no servers would show up in the server browser?\n\nStill lacking in content but it is definitively improving.\n\nIs it worth the price tag? Nearly!\n\n--------Update-2------------------------\n\nSo the multiplayer is now working there are two servers up with a maximum for 4 players (A little disappointing but meh, its okay)\n\nBoth servers were empty, after playing to wave 6 and dying it was +1 person +1 person coming in.\n\nIt was okay - But I have two BIG gripes with the multiplayer.\n\n1. -Respawn lives are shared by ALL.\n\nMeaning that if some scrub joins your team and wastes all of your lifes during wave 1 and 2 you're pretty much screwed.\n\n2. The STUN bots are OP.\n\nI like the concept and the stuns.. but the stun time does need to get NERFED.\n\nEven when you're not swarmed you'll be screwed over.\n\nnearly all maps fill the same, all close-quarter corridor styled maps..The different maps are nice, but they feel all the same.\n\n3. The RANKS.\n\nSeriously? I've played 4-5 games and it seems like ranking up it going to take 3-4 months just for the second rank... Do they really expect people to grind day in day out for these ranks?\n\n4. Limited weapon types.\n\nThey are all pretty much stuck into 3 catergories.\n\nSniper, Assault rifle and Shotgun.\n\nPretty standard, pretty dull.\n\nHow about adding additional catergories? Such as STUN weapons, STUN grenades more AoE weaponary or heck deployables?!\n\n5. Multiplayer teams.\n\nthere is not type of 'voting' in multiplayer which WILL have a negative impact on the player experience.\n\nWhat happens if somebody is AFK on your team? How do you vote-kick them?\n\nWhat happens if somebody on your team is just griefing and dying on purpose?\n\n6. Robots - More creative entrances..\n\nHow about them dropping down from Vents? Coming up some conveyer belts like a production line churning them out.\n\nWhat about some kind of WEILD tools so you can temporarily hold positions?\n\nHow about custom player-made emblems for communities and just regular teams?","January 17, 2014","false","4.3"," 71 of 114 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","71","114","0","18"

Never have I yelled "Don't tase me bro" with such sincerity and volume. As of 12/1/2014 what you pay is what you get, no microtransactions or DLC.\n\nNo proper tutorial to point out the games features. Especially the UI.For example: Health is of course located at the top along with a "shield" however health is segmented, and as you take damage your health regens only a segment. In order to fully regen your health you need to either sprint to the health station or purchase an upgrade at the store via the somewhat hidden upgrade tab. I found the upgrade tab after maybe 3 failed games.\n\nLevels are rather ho-hum. Little bits of moving machinery here or there to give some 'life" but theres no awe. Which helps in a a way, no real distractions while fighting. Levels feel legit like factories/storage units in which there would be plenty of robots. However they feel like legit factories and storage units, rather dull but serviceable.\n\nCurrently there are 8 enemy types each having their own range of somewhat charming taunts,Of which only one you will learn fear from. The taser-bot. You will feel the dread of Sarah Connor meeting the terminator in the 2nd movie as you are approached by its blue tinted fury.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, they lack any real intimidation or "character". Which yea I get "robots, what character?" but it does leave ya wanting when games like Leaft 4 Dead and all of its Boomers, spitters, Tanks and whatnot exist.\n\nYou can have a total of 3 weapons by the end of a "Rush", your side arm, your main, and an "alternative weapon". Weapons feel about as good as they can when shooting against wire and metal, though a rather lacking selection of guns may put you off. 3 upgradeable weapons (standard shotgun, rifle, and sniper-esqu rifle) and 1 upgradeable side arm are what you choose between entering a match. As you play each match you accumulate points to spend at the shop which allows you purchase a standard/all around upgraded version of the starting selectable weapons (main), two preference weapons (alt), and two "experimental weapons" (alt). The experimental weapons provide a sort of "reward play" as they become accessable after so many rounds of accumulated points, you may destroy hordes of robots with dangerous lobs of lightning or incinerate them with essentially a laser cannon.\n\nYour 4 upgradeable weapons are manageable in the combat profile screen, there you can view and customize your weapons and character though only somewhat. Armor is purely for looks, mix and match as you unlock, some weapons have alternative firing modes however scopes give "recoil reduction bonuses" which should be a pure cosmetic choice not a somewhat forceful upgrade. Aside from firing modes, the upgrade paths of weapons are linear. Your character also has a skill tree, after obtaining the trainee perks your able to choose 3 of 6 (plus 1 required) perks from each branch of Assault, Ranger and Support. While respec-ing is easy enough, its a shame they don't let you have multiple pre-sets of perks. The perks in question generally give damage or accuracy buffs or give a grenade or ammo clip ever 2 minutes. Nothing too amazing but the choices are decent choices as opposed to a blantantly better perk to choose from that its been paired with.\n\nPicked up while it was 25% off looking for a cozy little FPS to play. The game needed some option tweeking before I could find a comfortable spot. Despite all the wish fors and occasional bugs, its a neat little time sink. Definately needs a shooting range mode or something to let players get somewhat comfy with weapons and settings.","December 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

After each wave you are able to upgrade/buy new weapons, skills or customise your armor. Sounds pretty neat, right?\n\nWell, to be honest, the game is quite fun for a while. The thing is, a multiplayer game like this simply needs a lot more to keep being fun and interesting.\n\nThe main problem of Final Rush, is the lack of players/servers. At the time of writing, there was no active server and for that, no active players. I did set up my server but during that time no other player joined me. You are able to fight the robots by yourself but that surely is not an easy task.\n\nThe gameplay felt a bit off to me. Destroying robots does not feel satisfying, gun control is a bit weird, even walking doesn't feel right. I did not get far enough into the game to know if the robots act differently after a few waves but the first waves of robots just come walking towards you and start beating you, so the A.I. is pretty much non-existent.\n\nSince the game uses the UT3 engine the graphics are OK. The maps are nicely done but might bore quickly.\n\nOverall, Final Rush is not a bad game and you could have some fun if you buy the game together with some friends. The game is quite steep and there are better games that offer the same kind of gameplay. One game that comes to mind is "Interstellar Marines", which also has a mode in which you destroy robots, just not in waves.\n\n\n","April 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

It had great graphics, and interesting concept, and from what I understood, it had multiplayer capibilites. I bought this game in hopes that it would be every bit as good as it seemed. However, I was wrong. The game's maps were confusing. Tight corners with little to no manuverablity made the game next to impossible for me to play. Perhaps for someone wo enjoys a challenge this was a good thing, but to me, it was smply no fun. What was worse than the gameplay was the fact that the game did not feature Steam multiplayer, and my friends and I who bought this game for the sole purpose of playing it together realized that we just wasted our money.","July 28, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Lets start with video settings, basically there is none, by which i mean advanced settings, only things you can change are resolution, AA and AF.\n\nIn game and action.\n\nJust as soon you create server or join to server, game gives you option to chose your class (Assault, Recon or Support - yeah that's it). Game has 5 maps which all of them are indoors. All weapons have dreadful recoils especially assault rifle, christ, with that you can't kill anyone, while you are trying to surivive 10 robots at the time is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because shooting won't slow them down at all, sometimes they just decide to rush at you until you are surrounded and going to die after 2 seconds. (sure, i see fun and enjoyment here). Unlike KF here you can buy ammo and even heal up during waves as long as you have credits / money for it. After beating each wave you can go shopping but time to do that is rather short for new players.\nPlaying solo is extremly hard and trying to play online is just impossible, God knows where servers are hosted due to ping issues.\nYes, i know game has RPG system but it takes lot of time to actually get at least one level not to meantion soloing is extremely hard even on easy difficulty, i just managed to survive 4 waves.\n\nOverall.

However there is no community and no online games currently running. Unless your going to buy 4 for your buddies this game is not worth buying. You can't get anywhere in single player alone. The basic enemies are simply not ballanced for it. You need a freind to even get past wave 7. The guns just simply suck. I had to constantly be reloading while running away because you can't out-walk any enemies and you can't shoot them fast enough to stand your ground even on wave 1. You have to aim inorder to hit anything however while your doing that there will always be an enemy behind you just waiting for you to walk into it.

All you do is shoot robots like you would in a Call of Duty Zombies match and spend in-game money on weapons and weapon upgrades.

Honestly thinking about buying this for a friend. The only bug I found other than the update now bug is that on some rounds a robot will spawn but not come out from behind the door they spawn behind. I will say that the game is very much new but not bad for being thrown together on a limited budget. I would like to see the Robots ai for navigation improved alot and maybe jump command at one point or another. Maybe add some flying enemys like little drones just to annoy the player more and to give diffrent things to shoot at. This to feels like a combination of a Halo look mixed with Portal and gameplay of CoD zombies. Me and my friend will enjoy this game alot if you guys add more weapons and some better AI navigation. Also consider adding a melee weapon to the game would be a nice addition to the game cause the punching and hitting things with the butt of the weapon is a tad over powered. Love the game will play for a long time.","January 25, 2014","true","5.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Right now there's not much content, but I really enjoyed the setting of this game, in later updates I would want to be able to aim down the sights, otherwise why do we have red dot on the weapon. Also, I belive if there'll be more cool movements for the player, like some parkour jump and firing while you fly and add some slo-mo for singleplayer, and for co-op as well. For sci-fi, action filled dupstep would be perfect I think. I pretty much know that more weapons are coming, so it'll be better to make weapon sounds more depper and more epic. And if you planning to work on enemy, make them not just walk towards player like a zombie, but maybe some droids,who can run jump from 1-st floor to 2-nd. And of course, graphics are high detail and that blue filter really is in place. More epicness for this already awesome game, and it'll be one of the "Co-Op Must-Buy" games.

The goal is to survive through timed waves that spawn robots and getting points to spend in a shop that appears between two waves. There you can buy weapons and upgrades only.To buy ammo or health, go find the two automated distributors that are elsewhere on the map so you have to choose what to go for, because despite the futuristic environment, you can't carry stuff to heal you on the way...\nThe story is set in a highly advanced technological future, and robots got corrupted. That's all we know, seems a bit lacking of context here.\nMaps are small, only 4 of them, and so many choke points you can't use for yourself because you'll get swarmed with robots in no time. No welder to seal doors and taking a stand, absolutely no strategy here. Only way to survive is to continuously run around the (small) map and gather a horde behind you until the clock goes zero, then shoot them all. But beware of the map itself : you can jump, but can't jump above a tiny obstacle to flee the horde, which will bash you to death.\nThere is only 3 weapons to begin with, and an infinite ammo pistol (and bashing that merely damage bots or push them away...). Aim is tedious because of a very high recoil that screw your aim after each shot. Weapons don't feel powerfull as it can't one-shot a basic bot in the head. Oh, there is grenades too, but they'll bounce a weird way and blast radius is so ridiculous (maybe 1-2 meters), unless they badly bounce back at your face and kill you. It's safer to throw rocks and it might do more harm to those bots.\nTried the online game too, no server below 130 ping, all empty...\nIt seems there is an xp counter, but no profile page yet to see if there is perks to unlock, so there's no point to grind highly difficult waves of uninteresting robots for peanuts.\n\nSo it's an early access game, but it is still very unpolished in the current state. Even at 10€, get Killing Floor instead, or wait for KF2.","September 27, 2014","false","3.4"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","6"

The graphics look great, but as someone who started out playing shooters on the PC, I am dissapointed in the lack of proper movement. There are far too many things in the enviornment to get caught on and the players movement is slow and restricted. Even on normal difficulty, I kept getting caught in corners and assualted by waves of robots, which I cannot seem to kill without extreme difficulty.\n\nEdit: Alright, so I decided to rewrite my review upon request from Strike Games. This game is not my cup of tea, but that may be because I was raised on fast-paced shooters like Unreal Tornament. This game feels a bit too campy for me, and the fact that you are using bullets against robot seems ineffective. I feel that, in the future, we would have better weapons for dealing with such things, like plasma guns. The lack of pickups and instead having to pay for ammo and health is just not a mecanic I am fond of. I feel the game takes too long to pick up and by the time I have even a chance at getting a decent gun, I am being overrun.\n\nI also feel that this game could benefit from having some sort of campain mode. It is cool that they included the story for the player to read, but playing though it would be much cooler. Maybe add missions and/or a tutorial so it is not just you getting thrown in. It is a bit confusing to get the hang of, honestly.","July 18, 2014","false","1.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The fact that such a fundamental flaw still exists is a bit of a disgrace, especially because the game seems pretty good.","May 13, 2014","false","4.1"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","2"

As much as i live survival type games, this just doesnt feel like one. There is only the one type of enemy except sometimes they are a little quicker and have more health. All the weapons pretty much feel the same with really out of control recoil even on the handgun. Movement feels off... as if your gliding around like a hockey puck. Anytime i tried changing my settings the resoultion went down to one thats so blurry couldnt do anything.\n\nIt would be a cool flash game about 5 years ago but not much more to it then the 1000 shoot at thing mobile games you can get for free on your phone. Maybe in the future it'll feel like an actual game but for now its just a game where you stand there and shoot at this annoying thing at walks at you.","October 1, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Also listed as Single Player but there's no single player campaign at all, practically false advertising.  It's basically just a multi-player game you can play in offline mode.  Everything is designed with form over function.  It's pretty but there's no substance.  Without a single player campaign it's just shooting a bunch of moving tin cans.  Stay away.  Not even close to worth the money.","December 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

Looks like I'm in for a time.  Still, Tower of Guns used UDK and that was fun, so maybe it'll be okay.\n\nMenu runs at 10 FPS.  Well, the hope was nice while it lasted.\n\nLet's see.  One game mode.  Five maps filled with stock sci-fi scenery.  Upgrades are pretty boring.  I guess making interesting ones that don't break the game's balance would take more testing than an indie studio can muster.  No female avatar, of course.  I mean, a futuristic military force allowing women into its ranks?  Don't be stupid.\n\nLet's try the game itself.  Nobody else is playing on this fine Saturday afternoon, so I'll just have to face the robotic hordes solo.  On the bright side, the framerate has improved.  I'm now running at a buttery smooth 15 FPS.  In fact, if I switch to windowed mode I can go as high as 20!\n\nAnyway, it's just a simple horde mode.  Enemies are pretty bullet spongey and all the guns are terrible, so as the only person playing I didn't make it very far.  Now I'm idling for cards and writing this review.\n\nOkay, maybe I'm being unfair.  Final Rush is still in Early Access, so some glitches, missing features and balance issues are to be expected.  Let's check the store page and see what the developer plans to add in the future.\n\nWait, what?  It's not in Early Access?  This is a finished product?\n\nHuh...","February 7, 2015","false","4.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

I can't play it for more than a few minutes, because the sound effect that plays when you get multipliers (such as for getting headshots) is so much louder than the rest of the game that it gives me a headache. I tried to communicate this problem to the developer before writing a review, and he quickly released a patch to 'fix' it, but it's still awful. How awful? I recorded some of the gameplay audio to check it out, the BAMNFFF sound effect is a full TEN DECIBELS louder than anything else in the game (if you aren't knowledgable about audio editing, 10 decibels is a huge difference in volume).\n\nOther than that, the only enemy type that appears for the first couple waves is a generic looking robot with animations that look like they were done by a child. They have a huge amount of health compared to first-wave enemies in typical wave-based shooters, which I guess makes the game unique, but I just find them silly and annoying. Getting cornered and killed by a mob of these absurdly animated robots just feels ridiculous.\n\nThe three starting weapons all feel very lackluster; if you like memorable gunplay, this probably isn't the game for you, although it's possible some of the purchasable weapons have a better feel.\n\nThe graphics are nice for an indie game, nothing mindblowing, but far better than, say, Killing Floor. If only anything else in the game could hold a candle to games like Killing Floor.\n\nI probably have less than an hour logged but that was more than enough time to tell this is by far the worst wave shooter I've ever played. Take my opinion how you will, but I will say based on my experience that this game is a joke, the developer doesn't seem to have good taste or know what he's doing (and doesn't understand why professional gaming news sources won't give him the time of day), and you can get far better co-op gameplay for a lower price elsewhere. Not to mention everyone on the forum reports the game is dead and there's no one to multiplayer with.","August 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"
