I've always been a bit reserved when it comes to the original Talismans playstyle remedied a couple of my concerns with the original. Even though it heavily borrows from Talisman it feels as it tries to do its own thing with it and those efforts are, at least in my opinion, successful.\n\nThat said, the game feels rather bare-bones sadly, even though the store page says that you can play all 18 Space Marine legions in their struggle to stop/help Horus from dethroning ol' emps this isn't exactly true. Out of the 18 Legions only 9 are actually given any sort of flavour at all. The Ultramarines, The Raven Guard, The Salamanders, The Sons of Horus (although with both loyalist and traitor versions), The Imperial Fists, The World Eaters, The Death Guard, The Night Lords and the Word Bearers, the rest are DLC or coming as DLC.\n\nNormally this wouldn't be this much of an issue for me, but coming as this is a social game that I'd prefer to play with friends, and playing board games on a PC hot-seat isn't as popular as it used to be, this means that the game instantly becomes much less attractive as people don't only have to get the core game but also the DLC that they want to play their favourite characters etc.\n\nSpeaking of favourite characters! This game adheres rather strictly to the book series it seems and many of the primarchs are replaced with champion stand-ins, neither Rogal Dorn or Lorgar Aurelian are playable at this time which is a bit of a dissapointment but not a major concern. The Luna wolves/Sons of Horus are naturally represented by Garviel Loken and Ezekyle Abaddon since Horus is one of the the bosses of the game.\n\nThere are a few more complaints that I have, for example you're unable to switch sides, heretics can't redeem themselves and loyal space marines can't go traitor, characters can very easily get ridiculous amounts of resolve so they become impossible to kill (there doesn't seem to be any realistic upper cap), the UI is a bit convoluted so reading about different effects and bonuses is something that, at least I, usually just skip and let the game determine the outcome.\n\nIn closing I'd like to say that the game is probably pretty enjoyable as a fan of the setting and even though I'll probably play it some more, the incredibly greedy business model with a majority of the cast cut out to sell the 4€ DLC for 2 characters each makes the game earn a negative review.","February 22","false","5.3"," 177 of 210 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","177","210","9","2"

You may also fight against enemy Warlords, if you get in the same sector (place) as them.\n\nYou must get a Talisman through a quest you get in one specific Sector, and get strong enough to fight your way to The Vengeful Spirit, the place where the final battle will take place.\n\nYou will have to defeat Horus, if you're Loyalist - or The Emperor, if you're a Traitor.\n\nOne of my favorite features of this game, it's the possibility to play hotseat with any number of players you want, AND with the AI. The Online Multiplayer is also a good thing.\n\nDon't mind the dlc. Yeah, it's day one DLC, which is never a good thing, but I really think it's unnecessary to have it.\nIt just adds 2 Warlords for each faction, and some dataslates (cards). The base game already have plenty of both.\n\nSo, if you like Talisman, tabletop games, or even if you just like Warhammer 40k, get this game and have some good fun!","February 22","true","2.1"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","52","76","3","3"

People who like Warhammer are really going to like this. People who like board games and Warhammer are going to ♥♥♥♥ing love this. Allow me to take the time to explain this to you with my awful grammar and dry sense of humor.\n\nTL:DR/Gameplay Version - Scroll to Bottom\n\nTalisman is a board game by Games Workshop that was originally transferred to a digital version a few years ago by the same guys who made this game. Talisman is a game where you defeat monsters, gather equipment, gain followers and eventually try to become the strongest hero in the land. Now take that concept, replace equipment with Space Marine companies and vehicles, monsters with chaos and Titan Legions and the replace the final battle with the massive encounter between Horus and The Emperor himself. It's also worth noting that there are two factions in the game for those unfamiliar with Warhammer 40,000 lore; the Loyalists and the Traitors. The loyalists fight to protect the Emperor of Mankind and the Traitors fight for Horus against the Emperor. I'm sure it's obvious which side you should choose. (The Emperor Protects).\n\nNow here comes the part where I give you a rather poor tutorial of how the game works. You start out with by choosing a character, if you want to be a Loyalist Commander (good) or a Traitor Commander (bad). Each Primarch/Praetor/Captain has special abilities and varying stats to choose from so it's beneficial to take your time and read each one's specials. For you loyalists, Roboute Guilliman is a good place to start... and Traitors can start with Mortarion or Angron. Every commander has 6 basic stats aside from their special ability. These are Resolve (health), Fate (rerolls), Resources (used for buying junk or paying "tolls"), Melee Combat, Ranged Combat and Strategy (used for various combat rolls, only used when stated). You can increase your Combat skills (Melee/Ranged) by fighting enemies of the same type and leveling up based on it's combat skill. For example, to increase your melee, you have to use melee fighting. You need 7 exp to level up so if you fight a Combat skill of 6, you'll need to fight one more opponent of at least 1 to lvl up. If your opponent has 7 or more, you pretty much level up on kill. It should be noted that equipment, fleets, companies and legions (followers) will also increase your melee and ranged combat skills. It'll tell you which. Your stats can also be increased/decreased by various events that occur when you move spaces.\nThese events are generally "dataslates" (encounters). Encounters can be equipment, fleets, bad guys etc etc. Most of the time you'll run into bad guys and you'll have to kill them (combat works like Munchkin, units on the same tile that are allowed with you can support you in combat).\n\nThere are 3 zones (regions) in the game and as mentioned previously, your goal is to reach the inner region and save/kill the Emperor. The outer region is the largest and is the safest for newbs. The mid region is smaller and a bit more threatening, expect to be fighting the other players a lot in this zone. The Inner Region is the final region and has the hardest encounters by far... do not even try to go here unless your combat skill is at least 10 in either category. Also, bring a Talisman... if you don't bring a Talisman you won't be able to fight either Horus or the Emperor in the Final Battle. You'll just have to turn back around and go complete a quest to get one (did I not mention that? You have to complete an errant quest on your corresponding factions planet in the mid region (Davin for Traitors, Titan for Loyalists)). I could go on but I think I've explained enough for someone to get started.\n\nWhat does this game do right? Well a lot actually. Aesthetically, it's freaking awesome! This is some of the best 40k artwork I've ever seen and realy brings the game alive. There isn't much in the way of animations or graphics which is a shame but the game's presentation is absoultely stellar with a painstakingly ridiculous amount of detail placed into each unit card, each event card and all the game's assets. The game itself is also a lot of fun, although it does take about 2-3 hours just to complete one game at the fastest setting and I don't think the tutorial does an adequate job explaining the game. It might be because it was just too wordy (I'm just being nitpicky). This is also one of the most lore heavy 40k games I've ever seen, with short descriptions on every single in game item/unit/commander that helps explain the lore to those who are unintiated.\n\nIs there anything that is blatantly bad? Not from the time I've played so far. The dice-rolls can be frustrating sometimes but that's any game involving an RNG (I feel like I roll waaaaay too many ones). Aside from that, this game is a great purchase for any board game enthusiast or Warhammer fan.\n\nVerdict:\nApproved by the God-Emperor of Mankind.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnunJBYFgJ8","February 23","true","4.7"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","31","48","8","0"

I like how some bonuses are per sector and not added to your character all the time.  You can still level your warlord up to be a force to be reckoned with but it feels more balanced with the sector bonuses. The look of the game is classic WH40k, if you are a fan you will not be dissappointed. The board feels alive, always animated, zooming in for more details on the planets etc, really does look nice. I hope they maintain this quality for the mobile release.  And of course, it is based on arguably the best event in 40k history and is represented well in that it is Loyalist vs Traitor legions, you don't stand alone. You will work in a team and are able to help each other, for example you can swap data cards if you land on the same tile. The feeling I get from reading a good Heresy book is captured well.  You will WANT to play this with as many people as possible, it does feel like you are part of the conflict.","February 22","true","17.8"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","23","34","2","0"

Gameplay is very similar to Talisman digital. The setting is different (obviously), with the board being replaced by the star systems surrounding Holy Terra in the time leading up to the penultimate battle of the Horus Heresy. The graphics are truly stunning, with planets and stellar constructs replacing the geography of the original board.\n\nYour player characters are Warlords of either the Loyalist or Heretical chapters of the Space Marines and the forces of Chaos. The extensive library of artwork from Games Workshop has been put to excellent use here representing the characters. Equipment and followers are now 'dataslates' fulfilling their expected functions within the Talisman engine.\n\nCombat graphics are attractive with sparks and energy discharges crossing the screen between combatants. Combat mechanics remain functionally the same.\n\nI've been playing Talisman since its initial release as a board game in the 1980s. I've been purchasing Fantasy Flight Games' revised fourth edition and more recently 'Relic' which, like this game, is set in the 'grim darkness of the far future, where there is only war', while utilising the Talisman gameplay engine. The Horus Heresy takes place 10 Millenia prior to the current setting of Warhammer 40,000, hence the change in nomenclature. Nomad games have taken the new setting and graphic style from Relic and translated it deftly into the digital realm.\n\nFor the extremely reasonable price, this is definitely worth the purchase. My only criticism is releasing two hero and villain DLC packs on the day of release. These add two new Warlords in each pack. The game soundtrack, which is usually included for free in a core game purchase, is pay-for DLC as well. At this stage I feel there is plenty of variety in the core game so I will be holding off purchasing the packs. While I enjoy soundtracks, I feel the price tag is a little too steep to warrant a purchase.\n","February 22","true","4.0"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

Encounters are different too - like when encountering warriors of your faction they will either try to join you, help you out with some resources or even fight together with you in that sector. Meaning that alignment nets more consequences than just sector penalties like in a fantasy Talisman.\n\nIt's also very stylish.\n\nOverall it's one of a very few modern WH40K PC games worth playing and is a fun addition to your game's library even if you already own the original Talisman. There are some downsides however - there's less content and DLCs seem to offer less too.

I confess that I am impatient with most tutorials and largely ignored them.\n\nThey have certainly captured the feel of the Horus Heresy with most of the lead characters/Primarchs having abilities that make sense. Graphically the game looks really good and I especially like the background details when zooming into different sectors. For a board game come video game the graphics are really good when you consider most images used in the game are still rather than animated.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game especially to Heresy fans even though I do have a few gripes that let the game down.\nFirstly the soundtrack which is optional as a DLC is too overpriced and underwhelming. I can't say I actually notice the music very much, only really noticing the in game sound effects.\n\nSecondly the achievements for completing character goals to 100% requires far too much repetition and far too much luck. For example you can complete most character goals in a few games with the same character but some goals require you to play the game over and over in order to get enough points to complete. I would rather have spent this time completing other characters and enjoying the game with some feeling of freshness rather than playing the same character endlessley to get an achievement.\n\nThird, it can take quite a while to get players to join online games which is a real shame as I only see this game having longevity by playing against human opponents.\n\nI do recommend this game but would caution against buying the DLC until you try the game. If you can get a few mates to play with you then the DLC is definitley worth it.","March 14","true","100.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

More fights built into squares that give you experience and more squares that give permanent stats. Less cards that jam up the game and make things take forever. 2v2 is good if you enjoy coop. Trading equipment adds a new dimension to the game which is fun if you have a human ally. They released a new character for free in the past couple weeks which was a good addition.\n\nCons: 2v2 is the only mode to play. Content seems bare bones compared to Talisman digital. Only a single ending which consists of winning a fight five rounds in a row. Relatively small starting number of  unique characters and already charging for extras. Very difficult to get a game online, hopefully the release on iOs and some marketing will help that.\n\nOverall I enjoy Talisman THH and would recommend to loyal Warhammer 40k and board game fans. It is not without its flaws and I suggest having a friend to play it with.","May 1","true","56.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I love the original Talisman which was a wonderful digital re-creation of the board game.  This is a nice rework of that but still feels like Talisman.  My only concern is the board is so busy it's a bit overwelming to keep track of everything.  And also if you've played the original a lot, you'll have to keep track of the new names of the old stats/powers.\n\nA worthy effort and I look forward to what else they are planning.  I do think the DLC is a bit expensive and there's no Season Pass this time so I'll probably wait for a sale to pick those up.\n\nWill this replace Talisman for me?

This game is definitely fun if you have a friend you'd like a co-op talisman experience. Also, good or bad, Horus is a much shorter game; I finished in about 90 minutes whereas DE games can last a few hours.\n\nLeveling up your combat skills are a lot easier in Horus because you don't always fight the monster adventure card equivalents yet you can still get stronger. These cards are either loyalist or traitor, and if you are the same faction as the card you have a chance to just take it (a dice roll) and get an immediate combat bonus, instead of the usual way of fighting a few monsters to gain enough trophies (XP in Hours) to level up.\n\nGame ends by either fighting Horus or the Emperor, akin to fighting the Ice Queen or the Eagle King, except In Horus one does not continuously attack the end boss (so it takes a few turns of combat). I'm not a fan of these endings and I'd like to see alternative ones.\n\n","February 24","true","5.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

But you can pay for more characters as they're released!\n\nThe wording on several of the spaces is incomplete or inaccurate.  For example, the Realm of Chaos (Rubicon Straits) says Access 2 Dataslates OR Roll 1 Die to cross the warp.  But landing there immediately defaults to 'draw two cards.'  The other thing is if you want to move through that space into the inner region.\n\nThe Random Number Seed appears to be set from the get-go, and the tendency for one character to just tear through a heap of weak cards early on gives him a nigh-insurmountable lead.  Certain characters are flat-out better than others, which is a familiar carry-over from the original Talisman.

At £4.19, a big drop in price and seems more suited to the mobile platform anyway.\n\nA big difference in screen size but hey a big difference in price aswell.   Finally I would recommend the game on PC if it was reduced in price.  So unfortunately its a thumbs down from me, I'm going to get nurgle rot now.","April 10","false","0.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","11","24","3","0"

That said, I bought Horus Heresy not expecting too much but have been floored at just how little it really is.\n\nMake no mistake, Horus Heresy is nothing more than a re-skinned Talisman. The engine is blatently identical. While the animated backgrounds and board graphics are definitely a step up, I can't help but feel like I'm playing a Talisman *mod* rather than another game entirely. If anything, playing Horus Heresy simply makes me want to go back and play more Talisman.\n\nAnother thing bothering me is the potential for expansions. Whereas Talisman has plenty of Board-n-Box expansions to digitally recreate, Horus Heresy is an in-house creation from Nomad, so there is no canon to really go off of when adding content. This is only made worse when you realize...\n\n... The content they create is going to milked even worse to players, since there are no physical expanions to recreate as in the original Talisman. Without something physically to copy, there is no real place to begin and end. No "finish line" for the DLC product. It's all up to them, and the example is already set with the two garbage DLCs they have released already on Day 1. It's a few extra cards and classes that could have been easily included in the base game.\n\nNot doing so is a gesture of bad faith.\n\nI will never, ever forgive a company for releasing Day #1 DLC. It only shows they they were willing to hold back content that could have been (and arguably, should have been) packaged in base game. They are deliberately short-selling the main product to nickle and dime you about it, on the same shelf. If they had waited at least a few months or so that would be one thing, but *same day* DLC is inexcusable. I don't understand how a company can do this and not feel completely covered in shame.","February 23","false","0.2"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","19","41","0","0"

I knew straight away that this was not looking good.\n\nBut I thought dont worry lets play the game, lucky I have a friend who also likes Talisman so we both got stuck in with a 4 player game. I couldnt wait to have an assortment of characters to choose from after  reading many horus heresy books. Such a rich tapestry of lore awaited me.\n\nIt seemed the lore was getting massacred worse than the loyalists at Istvaan III. Not being able to choose most of the Primarchs or characters for both sides showed that they plan to milk this for all they can.  They should have had dozens of characters for each of the legions not just a few characters in total. For a game as bare as this that could have made it alot more fun. Do I want to be Fulgrium or a random World Eater Warlord which strangely enough generated for the loyalist.......so disappointing.\n\nAfter a couple of hrs I knew that Tzeentch had tricked me into purchasing a shoddy game. It was nothing more than a  mod of the original Talisman that was just a grind to play. So many game play faults like not being able to scroll around the map while other players are having their turn make me wonder if anyone actually play tested this.\n\nComputer characters just floated around the outer regions and didnt even challenge for the inner regions and to win the game. I couldnt believe how bad that was as it shouldnt be hard to get that right at least. Maybe they borrowed a few programmers from Total War to program the AI or something.\n\nBy the time we got to the end sequence fighting either Horus or the Emperor we had just about had enough, we were hoping to end the first game with a bang but all we got was just each of us trading turns to annihilate  a resolve point of the emperor. A flat finish to a flat game. It only got flatter with the terrible end credits.\n\nTo charge $22 USD for a game like this and release DLC is a disgrace and nothing less. Forget the bloodthirster demon this is another GW moneythirster demon that spawns across steam and tried to take my money and sanity. The only redeeming feature was that I got a refund.\n\nWhen I watched my friend roll a 1 four times in a row the thought occurred me it had just summed up the game for me.....\n","February 25","false","3.5"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","11","26","2","0"

Vulkan is a prime example of this problem, he in the lore is the second if not the strongest primarch in physical strength yet somehow is very poor combat wise, the only reason anyone would use him is for the special abilities he has.\n\nthen there is the problem that the game completely messes up the story line giving the impresion that isstvan III, isstvan V, war on calth and the battle for prospero were all happening at the same time during the seige of terra, this makes imersion near impossible. Though i would say the game overall is good i would not personaly recomend it.","February 25","false","1.6"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","7","19","0","0"

Here's a list of the things that bothered me:\n- The map is forgettable. There are no locations other than the centre that have any sort of memorable look to them, as the board is simply a grid with a space background.\n- Icons are ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere, and the text is tiny for information on cards and abilities. It's just cluttered.\n- I know it's supposed to be a the grim-dark future, but everything on the map is so dull it hurts.\n- Only 4 players max. Always 2v2, and as far as I can see there's no way to alter the rules of gameplay (although I could be wrong about this)\n- Encounters are boring. It's almost always a case of either fight stuff, attempt to recruit stuff or get resources (equivalent of coins).\n- Everyone can see your strategems (spells). Why is this a thing?\n\nOn a side note, Loken is Broken. Nobody should be allowed free combat-retakes with no concequences as a base ability.\n\nEdit: Completely forgot to mention the end of every game. It sucks. It really, REALLY is bad, and there's only one option: beat up Space-Jesus or Horus 5 times.\nI really hope the developers expand thoroughly on this game, because it really is quite bare-bones at the moment.\n\nEdit 2: Also, forgot to mention that the system of leveling is easily abused. I spent most of my first game running back and forth into enemies built into places (not encounters), killing them over and over to rank up my melee combat level. It would be the equivalent of fighting bandits in the forest over and over again and getting points towards my strength each time I killed one in Talisman, even though they aren't actually encounters.","February 23","false","4.3"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","11","28","0","0"

I simply do not possess the vocabulary to describe how utterly tedious this was even while playing with a good friend. Also, I have played Talisman (board game) so I was aware going into this that there are good game mechanics and not so great ones.\n\nHere are a few things I didn't like:\n\n- Horrendous UI. It is both aesthetically ♥♥♥♥♥ and also functionally broke. In-game descriptions of game mechanics are vague with some guesswork required. You are also locked into watching each player's turn and can't explore the board or your own items while you wait. No helpful labels, if you're looking for a particular planet you better know them by memory or you're clicking each one to find a name. Colour palette is very ordinary. Yes 40K is meant to be dark and gloomy but this is just so boring compared to other 40K franchise interfaces.\n- The AI. Couldn't find a quest on the questingest day of the year if they had an electrified quest finding machine. Also, I know Talisman can get a little 'grindy' but comeon AI, your stats are ridiculous, head towards the middle now or maybe start that quest? AI, do you really have to play ever possible strategem you have during the end game when turns are already tedious enough? Really?\n- The ending. I cannot even begin to explain how utterly mundane it was. An image shows, some random in-game 'achievements' count up the stats in a vain effort to encourage you to do more playthroughs on different characters (even the day one DLC ones, see below) and then you're dumped at the main menu. There's no explanation of the monumental feat you've just achieved, no lore to read through. Nothing. Hey I'd feel good if I didn't just want the game to be finished at that point.\n- Day one DLC. Why let your ♥♥♥♥ game get in the way of charging more money for characters? Maybe the funds raised could be pumped back into the game to make it... better? Nah.\n- The fact I cannot get a refund because my one complete playthrough took me over 2 hours. Yep. Pretty sure that's an intended feature.\n\nAlso Apologies to my mate Rick Havoc who I shared this experience with. We were making the best of a bad game but towards the end we both just wanted out.\n\ntl;dr: Bad interface, bad colour palette, bad AI, bad ending, day one DLC. Do not buy.\n\nFin.","February 25","false","4.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","0"
