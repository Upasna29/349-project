"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/recommended/388320/","Isarii","Isarii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/","98 products in account","I've always been wary of games that try to tackle historical events, because they rarely seem to get their subject matter right. There's something disrespectful about historical games like the early Call of Duty titles, which placed players into real wars that real people fought and died in, exploiting those experiences by transforming them into mindless entertainment for the masses. Tackling this kind of heavy subject matter requires a degree of nuance that bleak loadscreen quotations or pressing F to pay respects don't even begin to provide.\n\n1979 Revolution: Black Friday doesn't share those problems. Created by Rockstar Games veteran and Iranian national Navid Khonsari, whose family escaped the turmoil the title aims to portray, the game tells the story of the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which lead to the deposition of the Shah of Iran and the end of the Pahlavi dynasty. The influence of this period in Iranian history cannot be understated, yet knowledge of this point in history remains woefully elusive to the American public consciousness.\n\nIt's fitting, then, that the game starts out with so much exposition. This isn't a Call of Duty title looking to capitalize on history as a mere backdrop to action-heavy gameplay. The Telltale-esque title places players into a series of unfolding events as an Iranian photojournalist recently returned home from Germany. Early in the story, players will take a walk through a protest-crowded street, snapping pictures and listening to their companion expound on the issues facing Iran leading up to the 1979 revolution. Westernization, income inequality, government censorship - the developers are clearly aware of their audience's unfamiliarity with the setting and do a fantastic job of the setting the stage for the players.\n\nIt all comes naturally; your character, after all, has been out of the country for awhile, so it stands to reason that he might need to be caught up on current events. After snapping a photo, players are presented with a quick blurb of information and given the option to learn more, leading them to small snippets of Iran's history in the game's journal.\n\nFortunately, unlike many titles tackling heavy subject matter, 1979 Revolution is at least somewhat able to stand on its own as an entertaining game. It's informative without being preachy, and engages players with choice and consequence and quick-time event systems Telltale Games or Life is Strange veterans will find immediately familiar.\n\n1979 Revolution is best described as a political thriller, and it isn't long until your jaunt down exposition lane is interrupted by the proverbial ♥♥♥♥ hitting the fan. It's a character driven story, showing Iranian nationals with a variety of different political and religious views reacting as their country is turned upside down. The voice acting is crucially well executed, thanks to a cadre of veteran film actors. Almost everyone involved with the project has a prior work that I've seen or am at least familiar with; I recognized the voice of Mozhan Marnò from The Blacklist, House of Cards, and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night immediately.\n\nThe game is an indie title though, and you can tell that the funds for its actors may have been diverted from other areas of its limited budget. The art assets in particular leave a bit to be desired; it will quickly become apparent that character models and animations are being reused for the game's extras. In a game like this though, pursuing flawless writing and voice acting for its characters ultimately should trump almost everything else.\n\n1979 Revolution does end a bit abruptly. It's not as bad as say, The Banner Saga, but I was expecting the narrative to go on for an additional chapter, or maybe for it to show a bit more of the revolution's aftermath. It's not a bad ending per se, but it does sort of build and build and then just end in the middle of its own climax.\n\nOverall, the game succeeds in bringing a historically accurate, better understanding of the titular revolution to those who play it. It's not a deep look and it doesn't get too bogged down in historical details, instead focusing broadly on the people of Iran as they lived through this formative moment in their nation's history. 1979 Revolution is worth checking out on that basis alone if you're interested in experiencing a sample of pre-revolution Iran and how it evolved to become the nation we have today.\n\nIf you're not interested in that, I'd find the the title harder to recommend. This is a game of ideas, and it follows that the title is inextricably linked to the message it wants its players to receive. Standing on its own, its narrative isn't as satisfying as a Telltale Game and its gameplay doesn't touch Life is Strange, but if you're generally interested in experiencing a bit of history, that can make the title shine.\n\n1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a short game at just over two hours of total playtime, and is available on Steam for a full price of $12. I'll leave the value judgment up to you.","April 6","true","3.4"," 75 of 91 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","75","91","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Renachan/recommended/388320/","Renachan","Clockwork Apple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Renachan/","77 products in account","Like most other Iranians, I get very excited about anything that has to do with us and our history, so when I heard about this game's existence I bought it right away. Now that I finished my first time playing it, as much as I hate to ruin the 69 reviews I thought I could share my thoughts:\n\nI can't recall any other game that really focused on a historical event like this and not only told the story but also let the player become a part of it. You can make some choices that really help your character or the ones around him, or be their doom. That's already something that quite a few big game titles don't manage.\nBut the story telling is flawed. Some characters have no personality or are so rarely there that there is really no reason to care for them, and there aren't many characters to begin with. I ended up only caring for two characters, and the second mostly just because his role just hit home for me.\nAnd just when things are really heating up, the game ends. And it's not even a big ending that really feels like one, it's more like listening to music and during the chorus your speakers just suddenly die. A lot of questions should have been answered, but aren't even mentioned again, and you simply don't get much deeper into what was happening which is a pity.\n\nThe gameplay was not that interesting for me aside from choosing what to say and occasionally how to act. What you can do most of all is looking for things and collecting them, which then give you a little insight on both what was happening during the revolution and also Iranian culture as it was back then and still is now, which is neat for those who don't know much about Iran but still perhaps too little for those who really know nothing.\nMore important information can be collected by taking photos, and you do that in a very basic "click at the right moment" minigame. Depending on how well the photo turns out, the more information you get.\nThere's also everybody's favourite thing in gaming history: Quick time events! *sarcasm*\nAlso, on two occasions I had to patch up people who were hurt and I have to say that that were just silly. Especially having to put bandages around the wounds, it looked really bad and out of place compared to the style in the rest of the game.\n\nThe game looks alright. It's rather obvious to tell which character models were worked on longer and which ones were rushed, and in just one scene, standing on one spot, I could count up to almost 10 copy-pasted NPCs. But I really did like the style they went with and enjoyed looking at the character I play. The environments were also done nicely, it really reminded me of walking down a street in Tehran.\n\nI have the luck of rarely ever getting glitches and such in games, but there was this one point where I walked into a half circle of people in the hope that I could collect something in the middle, but then Babak closed the circle and I couldn't get out because he just wouldn't move. I had to restart the whole sequence and stay away from groups from then on which probably made me miss out on some things.\n\nSo, tl;dr: while this game is very flawed, it does go down an interesting path and I did enjoy my time playing it. It doesn't cost much, so I do recommend it as both a small "collect stuff and achievements" game if you enjoy those and an alternative to a short and probably biased documentary.","April 24","true","3.5"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","58","66","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hexagonsun/recommended/388320/","hexagonsun","jungle.james","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hexagonsun/","1006 products in account","From my perspective, I viewed this rendition of history as heavily pro-Tudeh (the Communist Party of Iran) and though it touches on the application of fiqh to Communists from the religious characters within in the game, "1979 Revolution: Black Friday" communicates its narrative as the Arab Spring in another lacquer. And that's a shame really. There is no equivalency to be drawn between the current Sunni revolutionary movements and the Iranian Revolution proper.\n\nThe developers did their homework for sure, but I couldn't get my character to become a Shia fundamentalist or lead him to become a basiji so what's the point of player driven actions or agency? Though Reza (the protagonist) is clearly Westernized, it didn't permit me the option of having a developing narrative drive a connection towards increasing his faith.\n\nAs an honest assessment, this game's presentation falls into this terrible milquetoast middle ground that simultaneously would ♥♥♥♥ off Shah loyalist expats and a contemporary Shia as the Tudeh are portrayed as harmless, albeit naive, saints. They're only critiqued as hypocritical, or worst of all, taken for the fools that they were. Aside from those notes, the game is a "rah rah go student revolutionary movements" within a general context and retelling that Pahlavi was a pretty bad leader (I agree only in part to this sentiment) and that the SAVAK weren't a friendly bunch.\n\nThe game does highlight what Iranian life was like from 1953 on as it modernized and, though there are some shoutouts to Mohammad Mosaddegh's overthrow courtesy of MI6 and the CIA through Operation Ajax, this only serves to reaffirm the developer's bias to the effect of -- "Wow, isn't it such a shame that Iran became an Islamic Republic."\n\nTo illustrate better, I'll draw my thoughts from another angle: imagine if the insufferable coming of age movie "Garden State" (2004) were combined with a youth political drama. Yeah, I can feel your excitement building already.\n\nAnother, different, and probably more substantive critique I could provide for those unaware of the political, social, or historical components within the game is that it could've been more expansive with a branching plot. You, Reza, the player, are permanently stuck as a dumb collaborator with naive revolutionaries. In this way, "1979 Revolution" truly sticks to history as it occurred.\n\nWelp, those are my thoughts about this adventure game from a self-anointed, self-styled, and perhaps in this case, immodest scholar of the Middle East.","April 10","false","4.6"," 297 of 444 people (67%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","67","297","444","37","38"

True, I’ve played games like Beeswing, that were profound on a personal level, but this game is profound on global, historical and personal levels. For this reason, and others, it has already drawn hostility purely for political and social reasons, so I feel justified in attempting to redirect attention toward back toward this important and interesting game while attempting to maintain context. (This is a very early review on a game that is impressive from the very start, and that I expect to elaborate on soon.)\n\n1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a game about the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, to be replaced by religious fundamentalists. That event is very important to those of us that are Americans (regrettably, the only context I have) because this nation was fully responsible for placing the Shah’s oppressive regime in place, with all the repression and CIA-trained torture of dissenting voices involved. The history of the region, the nation and the time are an extremely critical part of the game, but more so are the people of Iran, both those guilty (to many) of instilling yet another oppressive government, and those innocent of anything beyond wanting happiness and a better life for their families. People just like those all over the world.\n\nOne of those innocent characters in 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a young, male photojournalist named Reza Shirazi, who finds himself caught between his Shah-supporting family and his Ayatollah-supporting friends as he attempts to record the street revolt for posterity. And that’s basically the beginning of the game: Reza in a prison cell being tortured by an historical figure for information and connections, as the game proceeds in flashback form.\n\nMuch of 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is caught up in the minutia of the actual proceedings. The events, the people, the places are all (apparently) real, based on personal accounts and news reporting. The story may occasionally seem to bog down in the detailed use of Reza’s camera to record shots matching actual photos of the time, but goes far toward setting a precise, real mood for the player. Each photo taken presents the option to learn the reality behind that person or event, but may be (?) easily avoided on any subsequent playthroughs. When this game is presented as being “based on choices”, it’s an understatement, since choices have repercussions from small to large, and can come fast and furious. Outside the story itself are 39 Steam achievements based on those choices, included many multi-stage achievements. All indications based on the large number of choices are that this game warrants multiple playthroughs.\n\nI was an young adult preparing to graduate college at the time of the 1979 Revolution, and I have distinct memories of the kidnapping and release of the American embassy hostages, as well as the resulting Iran-Contra scandal. Few things have shaken faith in government as universally in my lifetime as knowing that a soon-to-be president traded weapons for trusting American lives (as if baseball cards) with the nation considered by many to be our worst enemy (at that time calling us "the great satan".) And possibly worst of all was that our president (Reagan) left the nation, the hostages, and their families tortured in the ignorance of the illegal deal he had previously (and secretly) made to free them for little reason more than to embarrass the outgoing president, Jimmy Carter. All that is important context to this game being played in the 21st century, but not essential to enjoyment. Perhaps a quick read-through of the following would be helpful before starting 1979 Revolution: Black Friday to have a more complete understanding of the complicated relationship between the people and nations of Iran and the USA from that time until today:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution\n\n1979 Revolution: Black Friday isn’t for everyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/388320/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","I got this game because it seemed like a grittier, more realistic take on a Telltale-like adventure game. It's certainly more realistic, but that's simply because of the subject matter: it's historical, not using some comic book or sci-fi movie as its foundation. Indeed, the setting and the events of the time are the most interesting parts of the game. Sadly, that's not enough to make a game good.\n\nJust like an indie movie, the pacing struggles throughout. By far the best moments are when it picks up and you finally feel a sense of urgency. Unfortunately the same can not be said for a sense of agency. I got the impression that my choices would have very little effect on anything, and sure enough, they didn't.\n\nThe story focuses on a few different characters, but the length is so short and we know so little about them that it's hard to care aabout what happens. The culture and circumstances are also far enough away that they're difficult to relate to. And again, not having a lot of time to adjust makes it hard to immerse oneself in the world.\n\nEvery character felt like they were preaching about something - some viewpoint or moral or position. This added to a lack of emotion makes it a bit hard to stay invested and interested, as it sounds like you're just being lectured to for most of the game.\n\nThere are some neat collectibles; the photo mechanic to acquire them was fun and added to making the environments seem real. But the quick time events were annoying and not particularly well-exected. Some only flashed on the screen for a second or were hard to read while others used obscure icons with no text or explanation. Lastly, some of the collectibles were mutually exclusive with each other (for no good reason I could find) which meant having to restart a chapter to acquire them all. This was particularly frustrating because you can't skip dialogue or cutscenes and there's no sprint. In a word: slow.\n\nThe icing on the cake is an atrocious cliffhanger ending. Nothing is resolved, despite this supposedly being a full, standalone game.\n\nThis is a story worth telling, but a game might not have been the best medium for it. If you're heavily interested in the place and time then I'd probably still recommend it, but for everyone else I'd wait for an indie movie version. With a different ending it'd be worth the ticket price.","May 15","false","4.2"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","51","80","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robinpolding/recommended/388320/","robinpolding","BobCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robinpolding/","98 products in account","TL;DR: I recommend this game for fans of TellTale/Life is Strange or those interested in learning about history.\n\nI picked up this game after reading about it on RPS and being a fan of TellTale Games and Life is Strange, as well as enjoying 'The Cat and the Coup', a short game about the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1953. I also like games where you learn things - I always faithfully read the historical notes in Assassin's Creed games and am pleased to see that this game crams in around 100 historical notes.\n\nThe game places you as Reza, a young photographer who becomes caught up with revolutionaries during the 1979 Iranian revolution. Similar to a TellTale game, you choose dialogue options based on a time limit and perform key-presses and QTEs for a couple of action sequences. The game also has a photography mechanic, linking the pictures you take to real photos from the time. There are 19 'chapters', which are better called 'scenes' due to their length.\n\nThe story is short, but gripping. It throws you straight into a situation and story you know nothing about (unless you're familiar with the 1979 revolution in Iran). This has its pros and cons. It means that you begin by making decisions without really knowing Reza, or why he might want to choose certain options. As you go on, you learn more about the political situation and Reza's life. Rather than creating a character from scratch, you often find things out in later chapters that make you wonder whether you made the right decision. This along with its length and the chance of finding all the historical notes certainly gives it more replay value than a TellTale adventure. However, it may have been nice to learn a bit more about Reza and Iran before being thrown into the story. The historical notes add depth to an otherwise limite story - there simply isn't enough time to build up a strong emotional connection to the characters. I'd say that the story is less character driven than politically driven. You find out more about the revolution, the factions and Iranian culture/history during the game and this informs your choices more than the relationships of the characters.\n\nThe game recommends headphones - I used them, but they aren't necessary. The audio is fantastic and helps put you right in the setting. Voice acting is also of a top, profesional standard and occasionally blends farsi phrases into the speech, so keep subtitles on because these are fully English.\n\nHowever, the gameplay left some things to be desired. The time to choose dialogue option is too short. It makes conversations more realistically paced, but barely gives you the chance to read all the options before you choose. I also experienced some major, frequent framerate drops, and I'm running on a mid-to-high range gaming laptop.\n\nOverall, I'd say this was a very good attempt at making a game that tells the sort of story rarely touched upon in video gaming. Games are often afraid to deal maturely with politics, either having an indistinguishable red/blue faction or a clearly evil enemy organisation. Real world politics is even less commonly used in games. 1979 Revolution deals with this well, teaching us that there is not necessarily a right or wrong side. Instead, politics is messy with many different groups pursuing goals for many different reasons. It has its flaws, so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but fans of adventure games or those interested in story-led games should definitely check it out; it's the same price as a movie ticket and the same length for a single playthrough.","April 5","true","2.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

In this case it's Iran around the time of the Islamic Revolution when anti-establishment sentiment was soaring against the Shah totalitarian regime. It's fascinating to learn about that through the game while having a cohesive and compelling story so it doesn't feel like just a narrated walk through a museum exhibit. All the historical and cultural tidbits you learn and uncover makes for an enlightening experience like the political climate of the time such as about SAVAT or the Mujahideen, Iran's version of backgammon, the food, and why there was such an anti-American fervour.\n\nThe game plays like a historical Telltale game where you have player control and moral decisions to make but it's not quite an adventure game and more a cinematic experience. It's well-written drama with moving music and great voice acting. There are large crowd setpieces which are quite impressive for how much detail is packed in for a crowdfunded game (that missed its initial Kickstarter goal of $395K). There are sometimes QTEs which just reminded me of Indigo Prophecy and they can be silly but the most effective one is when you're moving between a hail of bullets and can die pretty easily, so patience and attention to audio cues is key. There's a framed narrative so you're reminiscing about this time of the 1979 Revolution while being interrogated and tortured. You play as Reza, who's a photographer struggling to remain neutral as it becomes increasingly harder to do at the cusp of a revolution. You've been away from the country so it's also a homecoming story. All the photograph taking reminded me of Beyond Good And Evil, so that was great. Often when you take a photo, you can read more info about the real event which reminded me of Never Alone's tapes.\n\nThere's a cast of characters that are all interesting (especially Bibi the woman leader of the protests, Babak the close friend, Ali the hothead, and Hossein your brother who's Shah security). Moral decisions relating to them can be trying with your own politics like whether violence such as throwing rocks during a protest is justifiable under such oppression. There's a particular one in the last quarter of the game that will feel like you're given nothing to make such a potentially devastating accusation or who to save which plays into the endings. There are 19 chapters, some of them can zip by in a few minutes while the ones where you're controlling Reza and navigating environments while interacting with hotspots can be longer, so overall it's a 2 hour experience. The story is eventful enough that it doesn't feel short but despite both endings, the abrupt ending(s) is a major cliffhanger. Abrupt not in an artistic sense where there's meaning to it but just as if there will be a continuation to do with other characters.\n\nDespite the intense drama around the revolution, it was the smaller specific moments that stuck with me more. At one point that's not related to the plot, you can decide to pray or not. I've never seen muslim prayer in a videogame ever and have to say it was very faithful with even a step-by-step photo guide. From that prayer, you get a line of dialogue about Prophet Muhammad PBUH that can be used later on. My favourite sequence was spending time in your home with your family, viewing live-action photos, arguing with family members about this political situation, rummaging through items, and coming across this giant stack of home video tapes. The photos and home videos are all live-action which made me wonder if this was autobiographical in a way, and that kind of intimacy was exciting. I wanted to spend more time with these characters and this world, which is why I felt unsatisfied with the ending as I just wanted more. That is probably a good thing.","April 7","true","2.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

I found the quicktime events to not be over-used or out of place which is actually a fairly feat and a method that can easily be abused.

Here in the US, we don’t get much of anything about Iran, or the middle east for that matter, that isn’t Isis, “Bad” nuclear deal related, or how “PC” we have to be towards everyone. But we don’t ever really get a glimpse of what it might actually just to be a real human being in these places. 1979 Revolution: Black Friday does this.\n\nSo I’ll break down this review in different segments.\n\nVisual: 1979 Revolution: Black Friday has a graphic novel style feel to it. Made with the Unity engine, which is a very accessible development tool for indie gaming. While not the most visually stunning game ever created, the game's distinct art style is very nice to look at. Plus the concept art is incredible. The environments look great, with great lighting especially in the interrogation scenes. The main characters look great. On a downside, some of the background character models are not quite up to par with the main characters, but it’s not a turnoff. Overall, I would say the visuals look great and work for the style of the game.\n\nAudio: The voice acting in the game, are as good as any AAA title. With an extremely talented cast of Iranian actors the really bring it on the performance front. Navid Negahban (from Showtime's Homeland) in particular steals the show in the scenes that he is in. All the sounds from the environments are great as well, and really bring you to Tehran.\n\nGameplay: Very much Telltale-esk, the mix of choices, QTE, and Photography, Exploration all blend well together. The strength coming from having the real life pictures next to the one’s you took. I found myself meticulously trying to recreate all the photographs to the originals. Photos also provide a means to learn about the actual events, culture, and  people that influenced the Revolution. By the way, there is a tremendous amount of content in this game in regards to learning about the revolution, history, and culture of Iran. This is where the games stands apart from pretty much anything.\n\nStory: It took me almost 4 hours to get through the entire game. I definitely took my time and tried to get every picture, and exploration point. I felt that the impact of my decisions also weighed heavily in big and small ways. For example when I picked the mole, to see the picture of the person I picked dead in a hole in the next interrogation scene really had an effect on me.\n\nAmidst this crazy political season in the US, and all the events happening worldwide It’s incredibly refreshing to get a game that is as relevant in today's world as this one. Whether you're a democrat or republican, a communist or nationalist, this game presents the importance of everyday people taking a stand for what they believe in, and what happens with the consequences of those decisions.","April 6","true","9.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

That wasn't a problem in this game: the characterization is so good that I could recognize each of the characters almost from the moment I was introduced to them. That attention to detail and quality storytelling continues throughout the entire game.\n\nWhile there are issues - character models are re-used a bit too much, controls are janky, decisions aren't nearly as important as they seem to be - the game really does an amazing job of putting you into the setting, to a degree I've not seen before in any of the other narrative-based games I've played. I've read a lot about Iran's history, especially about the 1979 revolution, but the things the game showed about the revolution, culture and society of that era - both in-game and the real-life videos and photos integrated into the game - do so much to help you see how things really were at the time.

But Argo only really touches on, one piece of the timeline of the revolution; the Iranian hostage crisis and the six Americans that escaped out of Iran. Black Friday seeks to tell the whole story of the Revolution, as a point-and-click adventure game.\n\nYou play as Reza Shirazi, a journalist, photographing the events of his home city, in Tehran, Iran. But there are multiple people in his life calling for him to join their side. Babak, his cousin, is involved with the protests of the revolution, but only wants to get their message across through nonviolence. Ali, his other cousin, is much more heavily involved with the revolution, and is willing to do anything to help the revolution, even if it means resorting to violence. While Reza's brother Hossein is a member of the SAVAK, Iran's police force, and persuades Reza to avoid going to the protests, out of fear that it will get their family in trouble. It's up to Reza to make a choice to merely take the role of a photographer, or revolutionary.\n\nThe gameplay should feel familiar to anyone who've played any Telltale's recent games, as it's clearly taking influence from their style. Can move around freely, in the parts of the game that aren't interactive cutscenes, and have a cursor you can use to examine anything in the environment. Many times you will be given up to four dialogue options at the bottom of the screen, which can affect how the game progresses. One gameplay mechanic that isn't taken from Telltale is the ability to take photos. As I said, you play as a photographer, and will be prompted to take photos of important events related to the Revolution. When in photo-mode you will see the photo-op as if looking through a camera, and must time the shot right in order to get a clear picture. Many of the pictures you take are inspired by real-life historical photographs, and the game will show you a comparisson page between the photo you took, and the real photo, along with historical facts relating to the photos.\n\nThis is actually a concept I'd wanted to see done in a game at some point. I love the idea of being a photographer, documenting history, and sometimes having to make a choice of exposing a moment of injustice, or intervening and stopping the injustice yourself.\n\nThe game does a good job at depicting the state of Iran in 1978-1980. You can feel the frustration and outrage the people of Iran feel. Everyone's attire looks appropriate for the period, and you get to see a lot of Iranian culture. It never ceases to give you interesting, and at times intense photo opportunities. Including one where you have to make a choice of whether to capture a photo of a policeman beating a protester, or running in and stopping the brutality.\n\nThe game also did a good job in humanizing the characters, even the ones that you might not like. For example, they make Hossein a very understandable character. He might be hard on Reza and angry at the revolution, but the game depicts him more as a man trying to continue to support his family and not lose his job, than just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who abuses his power.\n\nAlso, like the game Never Alone, this is an excellent educational game. It clearly did its research on the historical events it presents to the player. I could ligitimately see this game being recommeneded to students by history professors in the future.\n\nOne complaint I do have is that this was a lot shorter than I'd thought it would be. I managed to complete it in about 90 minutes. And the game ends on a big cliff-hanger, which makes me hope that there's going to be more, like with Telltale's games. But as of writing this I haven't heard when or if any more episodes will be released, so I'm cautiously optimistic. I really hope we'll hear more about future episodes, as this game has me hooked.\n\nIf you're a fan of Telltale's games or you're a history junkie I would definitely recommened this game. The only thing I might advise is wait and see if a second episode will be released if you want a more longer experience.","April 11","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Players are quickly given the opportunity to take on a more insurrectionist role, and are encouraged by another character, Ali, to set aside the camera for a rock to throw at the police.\n\nThis choice, the balance between non-violent protest and full blown uprising, lies at the core of 1979 The Revolution in a way I’m still struggling with.  Is a peaceful option relevant if it won’t survive?  Is a violent movement better than the alternative? If you sacrifice your ideals to succeed, have you really succeeded?  I don’t know- and The Revolution won’t tell me.  Instead, it only makes you consider the struggle of people who have made that choice, are making that choice, and will make that choice in the future.  In forcing me to think heavily on this and in telling the story of Ali, Babak, and Reza, 1979 The Revolution: Black Friday succeeded.  Its failings lie in the most interactive trappings- it’s most game-like elements.\n\nFirst and foremost- for a game that has you progressing down decision trees constantly and includes a Telltale-esque “Babak will remember that,” your selections don’t seem to have much of a meaningful impact outside of the immediate scene.  This may in fact be a good thing, as the tone of your answers can vary wildly from what you had imagined;  iNK Stories would have benefitted from something akin to Mass Effect’s Paragon/Renegade delineation.  In that same vein, silence is not always an option, instead, if a timer runs out Reza will reply with a pre-determined line which sometimes felt contrary to how he had behaved based on previous choices.  Finally, several of the quick-time events and interactions felt tacked on and broke up my interest in the story. Speaking as someone who doesn’t play many of them, I think The Revolution 1979 may have been better served as a visual novel, offering players a more focused narrative and dropping many of the interactive sections.\n\nThese issues are not the reason I will not be playing through the game for a second or third time.  I’m not interested in redoing my choices and seeing the alternatives because I am content with the story iNK Stories and N-Fusion led me through.  It wasn’t happy, and I think it could have been improved upon, but from an early confrontation with Ali, to a discussion of faith and power with other revolutionaries, and to a quiet moment of reassurance from Reza’s father, the story that was told is mine. I won’t play through the game again, but that doesn’t mean it’s done with me.  Despite its technical stumbles, 1979 The Revolution: Black Friday serves as a lens to not only learn about one of the defining moments of the last century, but to also consider the question, “What are my ideals worth?”  It’s a question I am going to spend a long time thinking about.\n","May 16","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Story seemed like hours were cut from it. At one your point your a peace loving guy who wants to take pictures then the next scene its been a year and you apparently learned some revoutionary stuff in Germany and want to overthrow the Shah. Decent voice acting at some parts but for the most part unispired and bland. The story was a bunch of semi connected events of people with very little of your choices making a difference and an ending that had me asking my self if my game just crashed because of how sudden it was.\n\nYour choices in this game are very minimal and there are some quicktime events while performing first aid that the game acts like are difficult but are almost impossible to fail. The action quick time events are press W, W, D, S, now click as fast as you can pretty much.\n\nAlso notice how this game talks about how your pictures will change the revolution? Well it really doesn't matter and I think you actually CHOOSE pictures like twice and one of them you have to pick the right one so not really a big deal. You take pictures to get the historical photo from the actual Iranian Revolution and a short blurb about its context. This is actually really cool but shouldn't be the core mechanic behind the game.\n\n5.5-6/10\n\nOverall this game is like if Telltale games wanted to make a historical game but wanted to make it worse than their other games. It isn't a terrible game and if you like the location or want to learn more about it then you might actually enjoy it. I did have some emotional moments during the prison scenes but other than that I wasn't connecting too much with the characters. We usually only talk about Iran in a negative light so it is nice to see a game set in Iran with you being a normal Iranian. There are good scenes and it is worth maybe 5 bucks but not 12. Buy it on sale or watch a playthrough if you really want.","April 5","true","1.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The majority of this game is using W, S, A, D keys to move around, it’s allot more of an adventure game than anything else.\n\nThe whole story revolves around the toppling of the Shah and the Islamic institution of Ayatollah Khomeini who is a stark Muslim leader. In modern days you will hear Iranian people comparing pre 1979 when people look normal (by western standards) and free because of their ability to express art, music, voting, media and clothing. Past 1979 is when this Muslim dictator began to enforce Sharia law and made women veil up, they were refused to vote, voting was totally rigged, music and art were suppressed, people’s liberties were crushed and the police was used as a form of gang to squash any opposition views by kidnapping them and killing them. Many people consider the Islamic state today to be oppressive and many Iranians want to fight for the true freedom of their country that the Shah tried to instill. Sadly many Iranians today still refuse to acknowledge that Islam is the main culprit to their demise and that it was their own doing which caused them to collapse.\n\nThe game itself is a bias representation of a view point during this 1979 revolution. You are put in the spot of a young photographer who has trivial choices by which he can play out the story arc. The game itself isn’t bad, but there are a few things that took away from my experience. For one I found the combat sequences unappealing and very outdated. Granted this is a low end adventure game primarily designed to deliver a story element, but I found repetitive character models everywhere and I felt like the low detail of the engine didn’t really capture the struggle or aesthetic of Iranian life. I also didn’t like the educational pictures that you would get upon taking a snap shot yourself, they tie in with my first point in that the games aesthetic is more esoteric than representational.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, if you’re the type of person who wants to indulge into what most Iranians see as a representation of their struggle and their political turning point, then it’s not a bad play.\n\nIf you're the type of person that wants factual and political truth, with situations and events that resemble what really happened, then this game is probably not for you.\n\nKeep in mind these type of games are heavily bias and for people like myself who like to make up their own mind, it doesn’t overly appeal.","April 11","false","2.6"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","26","48","2","0"

If you're expecting Telltale quality, you're dead wrong.\n\nThe story is great. I'm doing the second round of playing with different choices right now, so I cannot guarantee if there are multiple endings yet, but the game makes me feel like a lunatic when I go off the rails when I choose something the developer doesn't seem to like.\n\nSay the first playthrough I'd go for a reasonably peaceful choice, but I'm going for all out violent options the second time around. What ended up happening is that I'd get ridiculous lines of dialogue the characters would say. It seems that the character the player plays (Reza) can be a reasonable guy a second, then a maniac another.

I have been looking forward to playing this game since INK stories had a booth at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and overall I would say the wait was worth it.\n\nPros:\nIt plays a little like the PS3 game “Heavy Rain” in which your actions affect the outcome of the game and the story line. So you have to make quick decisions on what to say, what to do, or if you should fight.\n\nIt is a great learning tool to learn about the Iranian revolution and some current events in Iran today. They take you to real places and use the story arc to get you in the loop of what actually went on in this country. One of my favorite features is the notebook feature. Where you can read about the revolution as you experience it.  Cons:\nThere are no save points rather there are checkpoints throughout the game. So if you have to leave the game and come back later. You are forced to replay a  little of the game to catch back up to the part you were at.\n\nI can’t help feeling that this game would have been better on a console like a\nPS4 or Xbox. The controls like moving the character around and taking pictures is a little clunky.\n\nThe graphics could have been better. I would say at best the graphics are 10 years behind, meaning this is something I would have expected in a game from 2006.\nOverall though, his game is so unique that I would say the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend this game.","April 8","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty solid. If you liked Life Is Strange, Anything from Telltale, then this is a solid pick up. I got on sale for $10. Took me 2 hours to complete and left me wanting more. Though some may say $10 is steep for a 2 hour experience, it's not different than me spending $15 to go see a movie. Games like these should be released more often. An interactive movie style experience that pulls you in and get you emotionally invested. Though I found controlling Reza a tad annoying at times, getting pictures and learning about the history, regardless of accuracy, was enteraining. The voice acting was believable and had a more solid VO cast that Life Is Strange and that game was great. I hope to see a 2nd episode in the future, I don't mind paying $10 if they were to released 4-5 more at $5 each.

Normally I don't feel really invested in characters in a game, especially shorter games. But this game turns out to be an exception. It's an excellent game on a very serious subject, and it takes you along the way and slowly pulls you into blurred lines of the good side and the bad side.

You can die if you make the "incorrect" choice too many times, but the game does not make you start back from the beginning, but instead a checkpoint. I thought that was really nice. Without giving too much away, you can take different routes. Personally, I only too one route. I can't bare to take the other one! Not only is the design and the art of the game nice, there are optional little lessons explaining certain elements of the games you may choose to read up on. I came out of this game knowing a bit more about the Iranian Revolution from this, and it was really interesting. This game is unorthodox.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/recommended/388320/","alison","alison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/","147 products in account","1979 Revolution is harrowing, but very good. When i first saw it appear on Greenlight i voted it up immediately - Telltale-style interactive movies are not normally my cup of tea, but the idea of a game placing you as a photojournalist into a significant moment in history is genius. It does not disappoint. You don't even play anyone of consequence - you're just a kid with a camera - but that means you are really playing everyone of consequence. Walking amongst the youth, the radicals, the oppressed, the protestors... It's a unique opportunity to be able to document everyday people's lives, their struggle in a complicated time.\n\nThe sound design is exceptional, and the acting is perfect - it really feels like you are being caught up in a movement you can't control, something bigger than you - something exciting, frightening, confusing. My main complaint is that the camera is clumsy and keeps you trapped in small, barely-interactive areas, but that's fairly standard for this genre. This ain't no Life is Strange. But the setting is extremely refreshing - historical settings outside of the West are rare in gaming, and this is a particularly interesting one. The story builds well, the atmosphere is electric, and i had to blink away a few tears at the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bfkelleher/recommended/388320/","bfkelleher","Crummy Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bfkelleher/","420 products in account","It's pretty dang short and it has a whole ton of unresolved plot threads. I'd like to see where they go, but we'll have to see if a sequel is made.\n\nSince the game shows a point of view so often not seen in the West, I feel like it's definitely a good idea to try it for its pretty low price point.\n\nHere is why you should get this game:\n\n1. This is the only game I know of about this period of time that doesn't have a political agenda aside from telling this story from a layman's perspective. Reza starts as a sort of outsider having traveled abroad recently, so through his understanding we are able to see how the revolution looked to an everyman (at least in the first flashback sequence).\n\n2. I like how all the pictures taken by the player throughout the game to progress the story are then linked up to the real life pictures that they're based on. It'd be nice if the focus didn't swing wildly back and forth, though.\n\n3. In the scenes where the player is asked to explore the area there is a LOT of detail. I think my favorite scene in the game was going through Reza's house reading all of his parents' letters and watching their films.\n\n4. The price point is a pretty fair one especially when it's on sale like it is now.\n\n5. It lifts pretty heavily from the Telltale style of gameplay (QTE's, exploration sections, timed choices) so if you enjoy that style of storytelling this one fits the bill.\n\nMy major hang ups are:\n\n1. The game assumes we know too much. It starts towards the end of things with Reza already a revolutionary working against the Islamic Republic government but his motivations for doing so and his disagreements with the new regime aren't explicitly laid out. All we know is that he doesn't like it.\n\n2. The game leaves a lot of threads just hanging open. One of the major figures in the revolution the player joins seems to want a free Iran, "free from the Soviets, the West, even God," but what exactly that would look like is never really made clear. In addition none of the different parties involved in the revolution have their motivations made clear. The clerics want a cleric backed Iran, the Communists want a Marxist republic, the Mujahadeen want something unclear, but nobody says exactly what their version of Iran would be like. At one point the player has an opportunity to meet all these characters to try and understand them but it seems like it's mostly small talk. Then you never see any of them ever again.\n\n3. The game gives you a bad choice. This is a bit of a spoiler, but the framed narrative for this game is Reza (the player character) is being interrogated by a member of the new government. During this interrogation, a family member joins in for leverage against Reza. Then later on the game gives you a Telltale style "save this person or the other in a limited time" decision for that family member and another one. If you are paying attention you already know that one family member survives this (because he's with you during interrogation) so why on earth would you save him? He makes it!\n\n4. Reza's cousin, Ali, is inexplicably violent. Through the story we learn that he's worked against the government before and he's a wanted man, but he still shows up at every event specifically to encourage violence. He works counter to the goals of the party of which he takes part and everyone seems to still be OK with him being there instead of kicking him out. Not sure why, but it didn't make that much sense to me.\n\n5. Some of the voice acting, especially Reza's during more dramatic moments of the game, is really hammy and kinda hard to believe. Most of it is pretty believable, but Reza is sometimes just hilariously underreacting or hilariously overreacting.\n\n6. Reza seems to catch on to this whole "revolution" thing really quickly. Like at the beginning of the first flash back he's all "Oh geez I don't know guys," but then towards the end of that flashback scene he's pretty much completely convinced that the monarchy should be abolished. Also, what was with the first scene with the communists? Why would Reza, who's literally just heard of Khomeini, start a fight on his behalf?\n\nOverall these hang ups are not major enough to detract from an interesting 2 hours experience for $15. Definitely worth it, but it has its faults.","April 5","true","2.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

A genuine (and successful) attempt to combine history and phillosophy with gaming in an engaging manner that functions both as a traditional game and an educational experience. It really brings the experience of the Iranian revolution to life, asking the player challenging questions and making them feel they're part of a real time of change and wonder which ideas they find most compelling. It elicits empathy for Iranian people and reminds us there was a time before the strict Islamic country it is now. That's important given the reputation Iranian people and the country has now.\n\nThe quicktime sections function well enough but not quite up to the standard of the likes of Telltale. The main problem for me is that the reading material and educational elements weren't quite as well integrated as one might hope. Certain sections were heavy on the additional optional reading material. I wanted to read it but the need to go into menus which stopped the music or click multiple buttons to click in and out of the various screens made me sometimes want to just not bother. But actually, I did bother! So it can't have been that bad. I'd like to see another episode seeing how the revolution played out, or takes on other historical times rich in ideas for examples the French Revolution, the lead up to and the invasion of Iraq from the perspective of an Iraqi would be fantastic.","April 30","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really, really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. I am giving it a reccomendation, only because I think the developer deserves it for putting so much of himself into this project. However:\n\nAs games go, it's not a very good one. Thre player is tasked with QUICKLY deciding lines of dialouge, most of the time having little context; little clue to what any of the choices even mean. The player is just expected to....pick one, just for the sake of picking one. Also, the game is more like a movie; one which plays out in front of you, and during which you can occationally either pass a QTE, or die.\n\nAs story telling goes, it's not very good either. There are two sides to every revolution, and this game CLEARLY tells only one. I would like to have learned about the Iranian revolution from both sides. In this case however, one side is sadistic and evil, and the other side is benevolant. That's rarely how revolutions go, and I've not doubt that this one didnt go this way either.","June 4","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
