I wanted to like this one, God knows I love HOG games, but just, no.\n\nIn Ferrum’s Secrets you play the role of some girl who goes look for her grandpa (an inventor) who was apparently abducted by an unknown person for unknown reasons. Okay, to be fair the reasons are kinda sorta disclosed in broken English at some point, I had kind of stopped paying attention by then.\nThe story itself could be a decent typical HOG one, and the game could be an average one as it had a good general idea, but the execution was just awful.\n\nFrom the start the game was annoying: The windowed mode provides no resolution options, leaving you with a window the same size as your screen, making the mode pointless. There is only one option for sound/music - muted or not. If you mute it, you miss out the in game sounds which aren’t too bad, but if you don’t mute it you’re driven insane by the ill-fitting music on the menu. There’s no voice acting, thankfully. The menu itself is unpleasant to look at.\n\nThe graphics are so-so. They’re done with Unity and are 3D, people look pretty decent, but everything else looks pretty bland and blends in. The 3D adds the annoyance of making the game slow and laggy.\nThe UI/GUI is awful looking, huge, clunky, and obscures clicking areas in some cases. The clicking areas of items is rather specific too, and sometimes you found yourself trying to click an item placed at the end of the screen only to end up in another location because they kind of overlapped.\nThe tutorial is short, in the way, and not overly helpful.\n\nYou’re thrown into the game with no explanation of what you’re doing there, no intro, no background, no nothing. And while I love the cats, I had started to wonder just how many friggin’ cats did this grandpa had before the girl decided to make me note at last that it was just the same cat (hers) following her around.\n\nMost of the story is told through notes or through written dialogue that just goes by too slow in some occasions, and way too fast in others. This would have been easily solvable by allowing the user to click to get past the dialogues.\nIt also needs some major editing because the English in it is terribly broken.\n\nAlso, it can’t seem to make up its mind if it’s about inventors, magic, or both, as we’re all in a steampunk-like kind of setting at the start and then suddenly there’s this druid/witch like person. Ok?\n\nThe Hidden Object scenes are boring, either too easy to solve or have words that are a bit weird that made me search for the object for way too long because it wasn’t quite the right word.\n\nThe minigames have no explanations; granted, most don’t need them as they’re fairly simple, but then there’s a couple where you’re not really sure what you’re supposed to do. At all. And get no help, because… The Hint system is inconsistent. You never know when it will or won’t work. Sometimes it gets stuck in a loop or forces you to an unnecessary step (ie. carrying a light) when there’s no need to, in order to have you progress.\n\nOh, and finally, the spinning hidden object area was horrible. I was lucky it didn’t last long enough to make me dizzy, but it had some small items to try and click on which moved way too fast as the things spun, which only made the torture longer as I couldn’t click the exact pixel I needed.\n\nOn the upside, it’s kind of cute that you can interact with a couple objects (bump them aside or tip them over), and you can choose the game difficulty, but it hardly makes up for the hassles.","October 7, 2015","false","5.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","3"

The writing is terrible, the sounds are cheap, the 3D modeling is very cheap, the puzzles are awful, movement is clunky, but there's a kitten in almost every scene.\n\nHow awful are these puzzles? Let me give you an example: your task is to pick up all golden animals that are stored in some wooden cabinet, but you can't just take them, you can only take those in the list, and as you take them new animals get listed that you may then take, until --surprise-- you have taken them all. Note also that words don't stay in place on the list, but they move around. Another task is to assemble a light bulb (a science wtf in itself without a way to fill it with an inert gas). There's a handy wall poster with the parts labeled 1 through 4, but that won't help you any because you need to start with a cable that is not on the poster or it won't work. Of course once you take the bulb the useless cable is left behind. A third example? You need to get to a switch panel with a simple light-flipping puzzle in it, but it is padlocked; you found a key, but it fell to the floor, and rather than pick it up yourself (with a stick or something), the kitten has to do it, so now you need to throw some cat food item next to the key, and then a spider appears and scares the kitten, so you have to open a toolbox with spider poison to somehow make the spider vanish so the kitten can fetch the key for you. Trust me, it does not get better, and I haven't even mentioned the spinning hidden objects puzzle yet, which is an idea that nobody else has done before for a good reason.\n\nWhoever played this and said they enjoyed it is lying. Or they like kittens a lot. I don't.","November 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","24","27","6","1"

Bad English dialogue.  Hint button sometimes gets stuck on a past puzzle you've already done.\n\nGraphics are nice but content needs some work.  Would be nice to have arrows or some indicators of where we can go.  I click on the screen intending to click on an object pictured there but suddenly the scene changes and I'm in another room.\n\nBug: Somehow I got into a locked room I didn't know was there by clicking the wall.  But I didnt' know it at the time so I got the items there.  Later the hint button kept telling me to go to that room (once I found it legitimately) but there was nothing to do there.\n\nIn the place with the guard the hint button kept telling me to look at some shelves but once I zoomed in the hint button told me to exit out of the zoom.  It was caught in a loop.  So I was on my own from then on and had to figure things out by myself.\n\nI couldn't figure out how to enter the safe combination, so I skipped that puzzle.  Thank you for at least including skips!\n\nThe English dialogue needs some work.  It doesn't make sense sometimes.  Also make it so that the player has control over when it continues.  I missed a lot of dialogue because it goes by so quickly.\n\nAs of now I can't recommend it.

It is not a good hidden object game by any means, but somehow can entice the player to stay on board until the story’s end.\n\nLong version:Ferrum’s Secrets: where is grandpa is the kind of indie title that, by all accounts, should be considered terrible. Yet there is something in its crude stumbling of a design that makes it interesting; intriguing, even.\n\nIt is difficult to tell where that mysterious charm lies. Visually, it is nothing special: a typical Unity engine game, where even the hidden object parts are 3D scenes of hard-to-recognise low-polygon blocks. (On the other hand, the environments are full of attention to little details.)\nThe rest feels like some half-finished adventure game with a strange difficulty curve. It is mostly straightforward, like any decent HOG, except for chapter 3. There, get ready for endless backtracking and a maze where it is more difficult to find the entrance than the exit.\n\nThe story is, well, a mess. Awkward dialogues, hard-to-follow plot about some kidnapped grandfather who is one of the key people in some steampunk conspiracy orchestrated by an evil factory owner, and an entire chapter that I swear was pasted from some other, unfinished game. It is not hopelessly terrible, but I wouldn’t blame anyone who gives up trying to follow this plot.","January 8","true","11.6"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

Welcome to the hidden objective version of it.\n\nI bought this game because it was one sale and I was curious how a 3D HO game would look like. Unfortunately it turned out it was not worth it. It's just a really, really bad game.\n\nThe options are basically non existant. There are windowed mode on/off (which doesn't work anyway) and audio on/off.\n\nThere's no intro or any introduction whatsoever, so you don't really know what's going on, what universe are you in etc. Shortly after the beginning you learn that you are some girl who's looking for her missing grandfather.\n\nThe first chapter is rather pleasant and consistent, however the rest of the game looks like an unfinished school project (this would certainly be a fail at my university).\n\nThe story is very poor, inconsistent, full of plotholes and generally makes no sense. We jump between modern times to medieval ages (I guess, we're in some hut with an alchemist casting spells), back to modern times and at the end we even encounter some "robots".\n\nThere are some basic sound effects, but there's only few of them and you hear them only occasionally. The music is quite pleasant, perfect for this kind of games. There's only one theme but it's not annoying.\n\nThe game is made of Unity assets and you can see how the developers got lazier and lazier the longer they were working on it. The "robots" in the last chapter are just soldiers painted black, stuck in a shooting animations without a weapon. The novelty of the 3D HO game wore off really quickly and became just annoying. I've never seen a "loading" screen in a HO game before.\n\nHidden object scenes are not randomized so there's no replayability value (who would want to play it twice anyway). Puzzles are very easy and offer absolutely no challenge. Some of them (e.g. the safe) are very counterintuitive and if you leave a puzzle and come back to it, there's a high change of it getting bugged (it starts from the beginning, but the graphics are just as you left it).\n\nThe GUI is horrible. Especially maps seem like they were made in MS Paint.\n\nAt the end of chapter one there's a very bizzare spinning hidden object scene which made me feel rather sick. Lucikly there was only one, because it wasn't pleasant at all.\n\nI can't recommend this game, even if it's in a bundle for $1.","November 8, 2015","false","19.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Most annoying was the rapid speed of stories that were told, e.g. when meeting Doris or Arthur. I'm quite fluent in English, but as a non-native spreaker, I just could not cope with it. And the speeches can not be repeated or read afterwards. Please let player click mouse before proceeding! Another thing: playing this kind of games invites you to click on interesting spots in the screen. This is very often punished with timeconsuming screen that states that you are just clicking around. And that's exactly what I want to do!! Moreover, when at the airmachine, pressing HINT brings you to the yellow-and-orange wheel somewhere at front and invites you to do something there - but nothing happens and real hints are not given. Finally: I can imagine why it was choosen for, but I disagree the choice that you don't have HINT capability while looking for hidden objects. . .\nTogether: moderately positive, but don't think that I will play it second time soon (which I normally do with these games)","August 16, 2015","true","5.4"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

Rather than use hand drawn sprites, this game instead uses crude models for objects.  Not only does this obscure the identities of many items in hidden object scenes, it also combines with the bad lighting effects to create frequent pixel hunts in the rest of the game.\n\nThis is made even worse by the narrow areas in which to click and use several objects.  One of the crowning moments of fail was when I used lubricant on a rusty gauntlet.  It didn't work, so I tried the hint button, and I was right all along!  Except, oh wait, I was supposed to put the mouth of the bottle on the gauntlet, not the middle.  Silly me!\n\nDialogue from NPCs only stays up for a couple of seconds at a time, much of it can't be repeated, and very few objectives get logged in your notebook.  Combined with the attrocious English translation, this led to several cases where I didn't know what I was even supposed to be doing.  Top that with the aforementioned pixel hunts, and I don't think I would have made it through without the hint button.\n\nThe hidden object scenes do that thing where only part of the list appears at a time and you can't click items that aren't listed.  It's not even justified like in Artifex Mundi's crafting puzzles.  It's just a pointless annoyance.\n\nThe only case in which I would recommend Ferrum's Secrets: where is grandpa? is to an aspiring game developer who wishes to see a prime example of how not to make a hidden object game.

The story is badly told: no intro whatsoever and all the bits of story are hidden in the journal (which isn't even pointed at by the tutorial!) or in hidden notes scattered in the game. That's definetly not a good way to tell a story -.-\n\nPlus the very rare story texts stay on screen for a too short time, they should wait for an input instead. Throughout the game a lot of centered texts pop up could have been added to explain the player progression, instead of a small 1 line text displayed on top of the screen for 2 seconds exactly. The 3D enviromenment makes everything like a maze so a few holding hands texts would help. Funnily enough, clicking around aimlessly makes a big window of text appear and nags you for looong seconds. And you'll see it often since you cannot see your way or because you're trying to find what you're supposed to do to advance.\n\nThe mini games are awful: obscure, with no explanation. The 3D view made the first one annoying and confusing, the second one had buttons and lamps that were too tiny. Luckily they can be skipped. Mini games should be totally scrapped and redone.\n\nThe HOG screen are too dark and uninspired and the lack of sound while picking objects make it very odd. The objects to pick are ugly, texture-less and sometimes tiny. The first HOG screen was nice, but the rest quickly went downhill.\n\nMost of the screens are too dark (really!!) and it's hard to see the useful items in there. Tools are all amost black, and the hidden collectibles are almost white. the whole house being almost pitch black is funny since the missing grandpa was an electrician, he obviously wasn't very skilled haha... So maybe an angry customer got his revenge! ^^\n\nNavigating in the rooms is not obvious at all, you'll often miss other room entrances unless you\npointed your mouse on the correct exact pixel. Navigations arrows would help.\n\n\nI cannot help but think that the number one sale argument of the game - it being in 3D - quickly\nbecomes its cons as it makes The navigation too confusing. Add to that the screens being too dark, the lack of sound and the lack of dialogues and story. The game would benefit from a bit of patching and updating - it feels unfinished as it is. The base is really good, but it definetly doesn't feel finished.\n\nIt was a bit hard to decide whether to upvote or downvote. I don't want to punish the game with a No as it doesn't deserve it, but I wish there was a Meh vote instead. As for me I didn't even finish the game, couldn't stand the never ending dark room after dark room after dark room with not a slight idea of what I'm doing or going. I gave up in "Living Room II". It's just not fun. I love HOGs games but this one is more a tech demo. The game already have a lot of No votes so I'll upvote it instead, in the hope of it being updated one day and because I want to encourage the dev.","September 30, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It reminds me of one of the old games like Doom or Quake, where decorations were not always attached to walls and objects/players often seemed to clip through walls. The puzzles; partly down to the poor translation are not always obviously explained and in some cases the odd angles make them rather awkward.\nI've been stuck on a hidden object (oh the irony) puzzle for an infuriating period of time trying to collect the last object, which i can see and have repeatedly clicked, but its in a drawer and it would seem the click-hotspots have not been defined well as wherever i click the item it just shuts the drawer again.

Many times, it's not obvious what you can and can't click on, and the fact that objects you can interact with are so close to scene change borders. There were quite a few times where I tried to grab something, but found myself going to the next area by accident.\n\nI also felt like not all of the puzzles were very intuitive. There were a decent amount of times where I just used the hint button because I lost my patience with trying to understand what to do.\n\nThe game does a decent job at trying to keep the gameplay fresh. There are times where you walk around interacting with objects and placing them around as you'd expect. Other times, the game will have you play a mini object-finding section, where you have a list of random items to find in a scene. These were all pretty easy and didn't add much to the game in my opinion, but it was a nice change from the regular gameplay.\n\nYou'll also occasionally have small puzzles to solve that have their own made up rules for that section. Figuring the right order of switches, or turning off the correct pipes. Again, it's a welcome change of pace, but they weren't incredibly fun.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game, but it doesn't offer anything special enough to make it worth getting through some of the frustrations the game comes with. If you're a great enthusiast when it comes to this genre, perhaps you can still find a bit of fun in this one for a cheap enough price.","December 24, 2015","false","7.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That name is not going to catch on, I'm guessing. The milestone, though, is something else - this is the first all-3D HOG I've even encountered. It may be the only all-3D HOG there is, although I'll have to do some research into that. I'm used to the occasional 3D backdrop, and I've seen plenty of 3D animated cutscenes, but Ferrum Secrets is the first time I've seen someone build an entire world out of polygons and then dump a bunch of items in one place and expect me to sift through them. Based on this audacity alone Ferrum deserved a look, and I was certainly surprised by what I found.\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nAlmost not at all. This is the first thing I noticed about Ferrum Secrets - objects seem less random and arbitrary in 3D. I'm sure this is partially a factor of the novelty, but the internal consistency of having the various clickable items all made of the same basic lines and textures as its surroundings massively simplified the struggle of getting artwork to match that so bedevils 2D HOGs. This could easily sound like damning with faint praise - 'everything looks terrible, so the objects fit right in!' - but that's not my take on it at all. While the environments may be primitive, harkening back to the days of Myst or D, the locations they depict - a trashed house, a run-down factory - are the kinds of places one would expect to have scattered piles of refuse, so setting HOSs there seems natural.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nNot entirely - the hidden object screens are largely of 12:1 construction, other than one diversion to find plants for a potion. The game's developers at least recognize that this is an issue, so they cover up the problem with a figleaf explanation, having their heroine announce that she should 'clean up' the various areas if she's ever going to find the item she needs. The screens aren't then constructed so that a variety of items actually have to be removed in order to find the important one, but at least some effort is being put in.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nThe game is all over the map here. While I applaud the interesting choice of engine and art style, it's impossible to overlook how shoddy and random much of the construction is. The HOSs are well-designed, and there are some fairly clever puzzles - especially one that takes advantage of the 3D camera to let players move around a series of pipes that they need to turn on and off. The story around them is just odd, almost as if it was cobbled together around the assets that they developers had on hand, rather than starting with the plot and constructing from there.\n\nThe story concerns an evil fog that has fallen over a city, and the disappearing scientists who are somehow involved in its creation. Nothing wrong with that, other than the fact that there's no fog to be seen in the vast majority of the game. The most puzzling thing, however, is a strange interlude in which a witch helps the player brew a potion to cure an arbitrary illness they gained in the previous chapter. If it seems like the witch in question looks like she's ready to his something with a magic staff, that's because she's obviously a pre-made model that the developers simply dropped into the game, irrespective of how it fit into the setting. It's incredibly jarring to be playing a game about stopping a steampunk zeppelin from using chemical weapons on a metropolis and then suddenly have a sidequest send me into a magical dungeon to find reagent. The whole sequence obviously exists only to pad out the game's extremely short running time, so I was understanding - but it still derails attempts at narrative pretty badly.\n\nDespite its extremely short running time and fairly basic puzzles/HOSs (I neglected to mention, but 3D hidden objects are much easier to find than 2D ones), I was fascinated by Ferrum Secrets. Yes, that's entirely due to the fresh concept, but if nothing else, this game should encourage other developers to take risks with the genre. This isn't a great game, but as a proof of concept that HOGs can work in far more broad environments than had previously been believed, it might just be an important one.","March 21","true","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
