A lesser know one is they're also pals with strange sack doll people, who don't take so kindly to having their pet kidnapped by demanding aliens. But what are friends for besides rescuing each other from extra terrestrial life, while dooming the planet in the process, and thus Gomo sets off on a mission to steal a powerful crystal and save his canine buddy from the slimy captive. Unfortunately he isn't able to save his game as well.\n\nDaedalic's Gomo is a much smaller game than the developer is used to, and this emphasis on accessible, simplified mechanics envelops the whole of the 1-2 hour experience. I'm fairly forgiving of short games, but in this case the lack of content and interactivity is rather shocking. Significant portions of the game amount to little more than cutscenes, with "gameplay" effectively revolving around clicking the right of the screen to keep things moving. When you do come across a puzzle, it's so basic and quick to solve that it almost feels insulting and a waste of time, forcing you to momentarily slow down and wait for animations to unfold before progressing to the next equally tedious moment.\n\nGomo isn't a hopelessly bad game, in fact numerous parts are rather charming and enjoyable to watch, but it's design is painfully shallow and ultimately, entirely forgettable. The significant lack of interactivity leaves it in an awkward position feeling more like an extended animated short than an actual game, but the few entertaining moments are not at all enough to carry the experience by itself, which ends before you even realize it's started or has any chance of becoming more than a dismissible novelty.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 3, 2014","false","1.4"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","3"

I thought it was going to be a 20 minute kind of game, but I managed just over 80 minutes on this. Which I don’t think is too bad.\n\nIn terms of story, point and click games don’t usually lack. I’m not saying this game lacks story, it’s just a lot simpler than most point and click games I have played.\nThe general story to this game is that your dog has been kidnapped by aliens and you have to get him back by finding and trading a crystal with the aliens.\nIt’s nothing too special of a story but it was simple and it worked.\n\nThis is one of those games that leave out dialog all together and just use simple sound effects and noises. The sound quality itself isn’t that great and I’m not too much of a fan of that whole approach although some games can make it work. This game is somewhere down the middle for me.\nIn terms of using spoken sound effects and noises for people talking, I can usually stand that. But using the same kind of mouth noises and sound effects for more general things like walking or to emphasis gestures kind of annoys me. I’m not sure why, maybe just the sheer childlikeness of it?\nLuckily for me, this game is charming in other ways. So much so that it didn’t really bother me.\n\nThe art style is nice. It’s cute, and it definitely adds to the charm of the game. Throughout the game there are background noises/animations that did make me smile to myself a few times.\n\nIn terms of puzzles this game is very basic. The puzzles are pretty easy but the game itself is still fun despite that.\n\nAll things mentioned so far, I think it’s important to mention now that maybe this game is better aimed at younger audiences. Although I did enjoy it, it’s very simple in many ways so if you are looking for a challenge and a time sinker, this isn’t likely it.\n\nAll in all I liked it. It was a fun way to kill a bit of time. If you are a fan of the point and click genre and are looking for something else, maybe give this a go.\n\n\nTL;DR : Fun, light-hearted, little point and click game maybe aimed at younger audiences. It’s charming, cute and a fun way to kill an hour or two.\n","August 30, 2015","true","1.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Aliens have stolen the dog of the protagonist, who looks like a middle-aged sackboy. A bunch of totally random shenanigans follow. Nothing really makes sense or coalesces into a rational narrative, but neither is anything really that funny, quirky or zany. It's just weird for the sake of being weird.\n\nGomo feels like an animation showcase: Most of the time you're waiting for a lengthy non-interactive walking/climbing sequence to complete so that you can start looking for the next hotspot.

I have not played a proper point-and-click game in a while, but this was quite a treat.\n\nGomo is a small game, and I mean that story-wise and resolution-wise. The game does not run at widescreen, which was fairly annoying. I would have liked to see the game running at 1080p. Gomo is like a lot of other point-and-click games. It consists of a variety of primitive puzzles, some being stupidly easy, with some others taking a bit more time. These puzzle elements made the game a bit more enjoyable in a gameplay sense and I enjoyed them.\n\nThere's not much else to the game, it is a point-and-click adventure after all. There's a little exploration to it and the game contains no violence. You don't even need to be literate to play the game, it's very simplistic. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it'll just be more appealing to those looking for a nice, short game.\n\nThe game conveys a nice story without the use of language. It's quite neat actually. The story is incredibly generic, but the way it is conveyed makes it much more powerful. Gomo is searching for his best friend, who was taken from him. He'll end up going far beyond what players would expect in order to get his best friend back. The game's art style was lovely, as was the music. The music was very atmospheric and immersive, when combined with the backgrounds and art displayed throughout Gomo's adventure.\n\nOverall, Gomo is a short, but nice adventure that appeals to point-and-click fans with little time on their hands. It combines a charming story with great music and art into one small, enjoyable package. I recommend Gomo for any point-and-click fans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkV-I3YNLNM","December 9, 2013","true","1.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

Even the amorphous character kind of resembles the nice robot in Machinarium. The soundtrack seems to be copied from Rock of Ages.\n\nThe problem with Gomo is that although it had every elements to be a nice game, but the developers failed to make it more interactive, to make it fun. Most of the time the player is (un)patiently waiting for the character to move or finish doing something. The first 20 minutes of the game requires interaction from the played for less than 30 seconds. Watching grass grow is more interactive than playing Gomo.\n\nThis is one of those games that I am gald I didn't have to pay full price for, and I must confess that after all the card drops the game was immediatly uninstalled.\n\nI don't recommend this game unless it is free.

It only has about six easy puzzles to figure out and a boring storyline. You learn nothing about Gomo except for the fact that he lost his dog. You don't know what he is exactly, why everything is underground, why these aliens took his dog in the first place, why you randomly travel back into time to nuke a town (the only humurous and non-irritating part of the game to me), why above ground is like a farm type of area...the unanswered questions really are endless. He moves very slowly with every movement which is irritating and the sound effects are absolutely horrible. All of the sound effects literally sounded like the creators made them with their mouths. For example, when Gomo falls, it sounds like a literal whistle noise someone is making. I would suggest not this gameto anyone. It was a complete waste of time and money. Oh and one more thing, the ending credits are very strange.

It's a little over an hour long, and you guide Gomo through various casual puzzle levels, mostly operating some machinery, as he (she? it?) sets out to get the stolen pet back. There's not really any dialogue, and your inventory only has 3 slots (which go unused most of the time), so you can see it's not much of a point&click adventure in the traditional sense, but it operates as if it was one, and the art certainly conveys the feeling that we're moving in a weird and alien world. Windowed, it is 800x600; fullscreen, slightly larger (1030x800 ?) with black borders added.\n\nFor its length, the regular price seems a bit steep, but the game has been bundled a few times and goes on deep sales regularly, so it is quite possible to buy this game for a price that is more reasonable.

He is then charged with the dutiful task of retrieving a sought after relic for the perpetrators of the dognapping as an equivalent exchange for his companion.\n\nVisually, the game has intriguing, monochromatic, hand-drawn environments along with rooms and characters oversimplified in design. While venturing and trekking through each level, little events play out to entertain the player while having no necessary connection to the actual plot.\n\nControls are entirely devoted to the mouse, making the protagonist move, observe and gather up key items which is then stored in one of three inventory slots. The animation of the character tends to feel deliberate and, at many moments, appears to take too much time to execute; however, the quirky mannerism of the protagonist makes up for it as you can’t help but smile at his awkward demeanor.\n\nThroughout the exploration of the game, players will encounter puzzles which aren’t created with much complexity. The challenges seem too simple and it was felt at times like they could solve themselves. There’s no means of direct dialogue but just the sound of the creepy, overly husky grunts from the main character and high, incoherent murmurs from the antagonist.\n\nGOMO is definitely a relaxing game because of its slow pace which is a nice change after a long stressful day. Only downfall is that it’s far too easy but still an enjoyment. :)","January 21","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a great artistic challenge for the designers, since everything has to be told by actions and facial expressions; plus it opens up possibilities to include a plethora of details that would probably go unnoticed otherwise. In Gomo’s case these are small (or sometimes large) visual gags that are littered all over in every scene.\n\nThe gameplay follows a room by room design, where you have to interact with scene elements and sometimes collect and use items to get to the other end of the screen. There are also a few more conventional puzzles here and there, but even with those Gomo is little more than an interactive cartoon. For adults at least. For small children it may act as a good educational software to teach common problem solving.\n\nLike most similar games, Gomo is short, 60 to 90 minutes long. But even at full price it costs about as much as a movie ticket, providing at least as much fun as a film would.","December 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Puzzles are simplistic, and instead of being puzzling they are actually just frustrating. Much of the content is redundant, such as having a door and a button right next to that door to open that door. All this does is make the game more frustrating. The little cutscenes and animations are meant to be cute but instead they are annoying, they detract from the flow of the game, making the game a stuttering experience. One might argue that they are meant to be an eye candy, but it will take a whole lot more than just a few annoying instances of so-called "eye candy" to make this game look good. Overall, the metacritic score (currently 50) is a very accurate description of this game. Nothing to love but nothing to really hate.

The story doesn't exactly wow you either and the game is overall very short (I completed it in 81 minutes).

I love point and click adventures, I'm a fan of anything with aliens as a major plot device, and I really liked the art style.  Unfortunately, I can only halfheartedly recommend this game after experiencing it.\n\nThe major problem I have with the game is the pacing.  For such a short game, you spend a great deal of time waiting.  There are unskippable cutscenes that are too long for the information they convey, and your character's action animations are incredibly slow.  The animation itself is cute and well-drawn, but it shouldn’t take longer to pick up an object and put it in your inventory than it does to walk to where you need to use that object and solve the puzzle.\n\nAdditionally, the game initially gives you a sense of urgency with a countdown timer, making it appear like you have to rush, and then the game immediately and frustratingly takes away your control - the very next screen, your character starts playing around with random stuff in the scenery, wasting time.  Five minutes later, though, it doesn't even matter anymore because they seemingly throw the entire timer plot point out the window.\n\nSpeaking of plot, nothing really made sense in this game.  Sure, you are questing after your kidnapped dog, who you can only free by recovering some sort of glowing crystal that the aliens want, but everything beyond that falls into the "because we felt like it" category (especially that WC scene).  Randomness is not necessarily a bad thing - there are some cute sight gags, and some of the crazy content is downright fun - just don't expect a coherent narrative.\n\nThe item-based puzzles in this game are actually pretty straightforward, though.  Pick up a thing, walk a few inches, use thing.  Not too complicated.  The only aspect that might throw you off is the interface.  Each screen is programmed to act like an aggregate of smaller areas instead of a whole, so you will need to click on an excessive amount of movement arrows to access all of the individual sections.  Additionally, aside from light switches, the swirly "interactable item here" icon will usually only appear if you are within arm’s reach of the object.  Gameplay would have been greatly improved with the ability to smoothly walk across the screen, and with all of the interactables showing an indication on hover.\n\nThe game contains a handful of mini-game puzzles that range from mildly interesting to exceedingly frustrating.  I actually had to look one up because I could tell that the colours were significant, but the puzzle as a whole was not intuitive.\n\nAnother frustrating puzzle was the bonus content.  There are three unlockable bonus features to uncover over the course of the game.  Once you find the trigger in-game, the new content is permanently available from the main menu.  One of the keys is pretty obvious, but I found the other two to be easily overlooked.  I actually played through the game three separate times before I found them all; however, I didn't feel the payoff was worth it because they are basically three versions of the same thing.\n\nI played through with "easy mode" turned off, since most people said the game was not challenging enough.  I found out the only actual difference between the difficulty settings is that puzzle solution targets are not highlighted in hard mode.  This factoid is never explained within the game.\n\nOverall, I liked the game's art aesthetic and atmosphere.  Some of the humor was funny, there were a lot of amusing background details, and the main character was endearing.  I also liked many of the locations, and the puzzles were pretty decent for a short casual game.  I still can't give this game high marks, though, because of the annoying mini-games, the clunky interface, the repetitious bonus content, and the consistently inconsistent pacing.  I rate this game a 5.5/10.","February 6, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A perfect game for young kids (3-8 years old) or folks new to gaming.  The point-and-click makes it easy to figure out what to do, and the toughest part about the puzzles is figuring out what aspects of the landscape are actually usable. The story line is basic; don't look for any deep meaning here. When played in one sitting, the mechanics and puzzles can feel a little boring, so I'd recommend this for your hangover days. It's a really nice Sunday morning game, and the credits are quite soothing.

Do not expect too much at all.\n\nI recommend this game if you're a kid from the nineties that still enjoys those cartoons from your youth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/recommended/265330/","novalinnhe","novalinnhe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/","425 products in account","TL;DR: Gomo is a short but sweet little adventure game, offering adorable graphics coupled with a silly story and very low puzzle difficulty. Best suited to younger gamers.\n\nFull Review: Gomo is a sweet little point-and-click adventure in which you control Gomo, a cuddly lil' dude who gets his pet dog stolen by a mean old alien overlord! The only chance of return for our poached pooch is a mysterious red crystal (naturally imbued with mystical powers of course), which our alien overlord is actually very happy to swapsies with us. So off we embark, on a quest to find this crystal thingy by any bizarre means necessary.\n\nNow while "by any bizarre means necessary" includes zipping down garbage chutes, out-smarting security robots and firing atomic warheads across alternate dimensions, Gomo's gameplay is actually highly linear, and the solution for how you're supposed to do all these crazy things is usually pretty straightforward. You also have just three inventory slots for objects (which are rarely used), and each "scene" will only offer one or two puzzles to solve - most of which you'll understand as soon as you see them. So I get the impression that Gomo is probably aimed at younger players, and reckon the last reviewer's description of it as an "interactive animation" has it spot on.\n\nI am personally a big fan of point-and-clicks, so I was happy enough playing through to the end and really enjoyed Gomo's silly humour. However, after a while I started to get frustrated with the character's movement. You often have to click multiple times simply to get Gomo to cross the scene, as he needs to be in precisely the right place for you to perform certain interactions. Because of this you're often left confused as to where your character should be standing simply to progress to the next area, even though you know exactly what to do. However I doubt children would be put off by this.\n\nAll in all? If you see this game on sale and have a younger gamer or two to entertain, maybe pick it up for a rainy day. Otherwise I personally feel there are far better "low difficulty" point-and-click titles on Steam on the moment, such as Detective Grimoire, Broken Age, Samorost and so many others.","April 11","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are charming, the environments are well made, and the music is stellar, often surprising me with its exceptional quality. However, the game suffers from two fatal flaws: its length, and its difficulty. The puzzles of the game are quite simple, clearly being geared towards a younger audience. The average gamer, however, can complete them very easily. This is a major contributing factor to how short the game is; it can be beaten in about an hour with relative ease. There are games that supply much more entertainment for eight dollars, so don't consider this one unless you have small children and/or the game is on sale.","December 18, 2013","false","1.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

During my first playthrough I only achieved the last one. And from that the only thing I can say you should definitely not await the bonus games to be any less hillarious than the main game.\n\nSomehow this game achieves to take itself and the genre absolutely not serious in a way few games do so one could call it almost art.

First of all, it's a short point and click-adventure with minmal interface and almost no real story development. You're playing Gomo, a Domo-kun-like creature with a zipper bag in its backbone, whose dog gets taken by a mad alien. It demands a trade off, only giving your beloved pet back if you bring him some sort of crystal. That's it and there is not much else to it. You walk from screen to screen, almost always hindered by some problem in your environment that you have to solve. If you played Samorost or similar flash-based games, you know the drill. Click here, click there, see what happens. If nothing happens, try the same thing again, only add this time that one single item you picked up in this screen.\n\nAs long as you buy this game to a minimal price (5$ or even lower), you won't feel cheated, but if you want a complete game that keeps you busy for the weekend, then Gomo is a waste of your money here =/","December 12, 2013","true","1.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I didn't like Machinarium because of its emptiness design - which however perfectly suited the robots world - but Gomo managed to make me come back to logic puzzles games.

The debut game from Slovakian developers ‘Fishcow Studios’, Gomo is a great steading to start on, and shows the talent that could come from ‘Fishcow Studios’ in the future.\n\nAnd what’s it like?\n\nThe fun and challenging game follows the sack-boy styled character Gomo on his search for his beloved dog, Dingo, who has been cruelly kidnapped by an alien. By completing puzzles and fixing all manner of machines, you must navigate Gomo to a crystal, the ransom for his sack-dog.\n\nThe game itself is interesting, and caters to all levels of puzzle-solvers, with an “easy” mode for those who could easily end up throwing their PC across the room otherwise. There is a good mixture of object-based puzzles, as well as simple point and click elements. Some of the puzzles take longer than would be hoped to even figure out what is needed to be done, and there are even some that you have to just fiddle with until they work – despite this, Gomo is largely a creative and exciting game.\n\nTravelling through many different locations, the background is always amusing. From satirical army posters in the testing bunkers, to a stick man reaching the top of a mountain, then sliding back down. In-keeping with the quirky-traveller style of Gomo’s character, his body has a back zip to solve the omnipresent problem for all game characters: what happens when you pick up more things than you can hold? The whole style of the game has a very hand-drawn and honest indie feel to it, but the story and gameplay are as refined as you would find in any major puzzle game.\n\nTo some audiences, the non-verbal style of that game may be increasingly annoying, as being stuck on the same puzzle for five minutes makes the music a little grating. But, the satisfaction of finally understanding a puzzle makes it worth the struggle.\n\nWhat’s the final verdict?\n\nDespite being a quick play-through, Gomo challenges and amuses, with an endearing design, traditionally repetitive music, as well as some humorous “WTF” moments to be had in alternate dimensions. ‘Fishcow Studios’ have created a game for all levels of puzzle-solving gamers on the quest for a sack’s best friend.\n\nWords by Louise Egan\n4/5","December 13, 2013","true","1.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

With the exception of two headscratchingly-vague puzzles, the rest are tediously easy. Gameplay is either finding the thing to click on and pick up or find a use for the thing you just picked up. In only two instances are you going have to look beyond your immediate surroundings in either case. Items are nearly always used in the same room and only once in the following room.\n\nThe entirety of the "story" is getting your dog back, though none of the rooms give you the least indication of why you're there or how they interconnect. The trip is inscrutibly disjointed and I never felt any sense of connection to what's going on. All the events are random and without purpose.\n\nUnless you have a fascination with "find the thing to click on" games, give this one a miss and go buy Machinarium.","January 28, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The strongest point is definitely the sound design, but the artwork and animation require a worthy mention. The story is fairly basic, but cute nonetheless, while the setting and the atmosphere are nicely constructed. There are enough puzzles to keep you busy every  once in a while, but the difficulty is very low for all of them. The game's strongest point is definitely not working your intellect.\n\nUnfortunately the game is very short as it will probably take an adventure enthusiast about 90-120 minutes of uninterrupted play time to completem counting the time to admire the drawings and also catch a few easter eggs and cameos in the background. The difficulty is very low for an adventure game and even though it will not provide high levels of intellectual stimulatios, it does make up for the visual and audio elements and the overall atmosphere created.\n\nThe game starts by default in easy mode which can be turned off in the settings, but this only removes the hints for certain item actions so it's not going to add much to the difficulty. I found the lack of separate volume controls for the music and the fx quite annoying as the music tends to be very loud compared to the folly and effects. Running this game on my native 1440*900 with full screen enabled rendered the active window of the game surrounded by black borders meaning the game has a fixed resolution and will not scale at all. This might prove irritating for anything above 720p and I can't even imagine how it might look on 24" or 27" screens.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a fast, easy and fun point-and-click with basic puzzles, great sound, good artwork and a nice atmosphere check Gomo out, but make sure to get it on sale, as the 7.99 EUR they charge for it over in Europe is pretty high compared to what it has to offer.\n\nI'll give it a 6.5/10","December 25, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/casualtf2/recommended/265330/","casualtf2","Casual","http://steamcommunity.com/id/casualtf2/","61 products in account","An inexplicably stunning showcase of developer free will and recursive division method puzzle coding that bellows an unmistakeable, courageous cry into the fierce altercation of defining what constitutes a "game".\n\nGomo, with an undeviating knack for atroit storytelling, remains the most stunning audio-visual I have encountered since availing myself to Steam. Interlaying plot and mechnical substance are the bread and butter of this concrete dissemination into the indie platform, an infrastructure which has gone from strength to strength since its establishment.\n\nBefore any other function, Fishcow Studio's "Gomo" remains in force a splendid narrative. An intimate character study, the effervescent relationship of political attitudes between a hound and its proprietor, and an irreplaceably joyful reunion that flourishes as the last flicker of hopefulness to overcome the oppression and destitutions of an extraterrestrial invasion all faithfully describe the title, each as naturalistically error-free as the genetics of the standard isometric-hexoctahedral diamond. Ergo, Gomo's only shortcoming seems to reflect upon its unforgivingly dense attitude. Can Michelangelo's "The Battle of the Centaurs" be sincerely appreciated and understood in a matter of meer  hours as an effortlessly-elementary, offduty joe-boy? Is Nadir Alfonso's "Spoki" best appreciated on the scanty centimeters of one's consumer display? The answer is implied in its impossibility—but these are affairs of thought deemed innesential to the practicality of my review. Ergo, the influential aspects of Gomo's achievements frequently lie in its nearly imperceivable array of substance and meaning.\n\nWhile primarily a mounmentally grand application of effective component-driven recounter of chronicles, short and imperative, again and again, Gomo holds upstandingly well as a puzzle piece, both from the trenchant creaks of the drawing board and in practice. Decadent, yet unforgivingly minimal and hollow, new-age strategies towards Pascal and Assembly-based game programming create an interwoven pattern of familiar convictions and challenging endeavors that ultimately cast a stronger framework for the heart-warming, carefree broth that is Gomo.\n\nPrincipally, Gomo has expunged my prevailing interests and expectations, relaying the roads of my heart and brain with an indispensable appreciation for first-rate programming, graphical optimization, and fundamentally genius storytelling through the puzzle genre. All in all, I am left to promulgate the simple fact, that behind all of its never-ending intricacies and undulating passion for a cunning yet discrete product, Gomo is, quintessentially, a game.","May 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Well, I was hugely disappointed. Here is why:\n\nAbsence of the story:\nThere is none. The supposed story is that you have to save your dog. However, after the first minute of the game until the last minute of the game, nothing makes sense. Even after finishing the game and reading some walkthroughs to see if I missed something, I still do not understand why things were happening. The entire game can be viewed basically as a collection of random puzzles stitched together by a loose thread.\n\nLaughably simplistic puzzles:\nDid I say puzzles? Sorry for misleading you, but there are no puzzles in this game. Everything is straightforward. Unless you are 5 year old or braindead, it should not take you more than an hour to finish the entire game. I finished this game in 118 minutes, and I am quite bad at puzzle games.\n\nPoint and click:\nThere is only one puzzle in this game. It is figuring out what is clickable and what is not. Earlier, I said it should take around 1 hour to finish the game. Well, half of that time you will spend trying to figure out what part of the scene you can interact with. This is the only puzzle in the game, and very annoying one.\n\nAs a conclusion, avoid this game even if someone offers it to you for free.\nInstead, try Machinarium or Botanicula.","April 12, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortuantely, the resembleance with those two games faded away pretty quickly. First off, the puzzles in Gomo are so much easier that they're barely fun at all. This "bore" is ampified by the fact that the puzzle mechanics are the same in more than 50% of the puzzles. Furthermore, all puzzles in Gomo are entirely episodic. That means: one screen = one puzzle (with very little exception). That just doesn't fly nowadays anymore. Especially considering that for a price of currently 8 € you get much more elaborate games that will provide you with more hours of fun (Gomo took me less than two hours to complete!).\n\nPutting all this together, I gotta say that Gomo was not worth the price. I'd be willing to pay around 2 or 3 € for a game of that size and difficulty. I do give credit however for the graphics which I liked and the funniest feet I ever saw in a video game ;)","December 13, 2013","false","1.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Don't buy it. The puzzles are so basic that I would guess they were designed by a slow-witted second grader. It takes less than one minute to figure most of them out. This game could possibly be worthwhile if you had a couple spare hours and it were on sale.

In Gomo you plays as Gomo an evil Alien kidnaps Gomo's  dog and wants a crystal in exchange for the dog so Gomo sets out on a journey to save his dog from the alien. So how is this game ? Its honestly quite underatted and the bad reviews judge this game on its lenght so im gonna point out everything that i liked and disliked in this game. The game looks great and has a cute art style which i simply love. The puzzles are simple and are quite easy to figure out. The game also has a charming charecters designs that are a joy to look at and the game in itself is a blast to play through. The game also has some issues. The game is incredibly short clocking in at an hour. Some minor glitches but thats pretty much it. Overall Gomo is a great point and click adventure game that i suggest you check out if youre a fan of adventure games. I give Gomo a 7.5/10","July 17, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If the tediously long animations were sped up slightly, I suspect that this game would take less than half an hour to complete.

I bought it for less than a dollar, which was a fair price as it turns out. It's a fun little game--but there's not much to it.\n\nThe game's aesthetic is its biggest strength. I've seen someone say that Gomo gives off a "Winnie the Pooh" vibe, mostly on account of the gentle, determined, kinda derpy protagonist. But I think the game's world has more of the feel of a Tim Burton movie--the characters, events, and atmosphere all walk the thin line between cute and endearing and dark and creepy. The visuals all look really good, and I appreciate that the main character's animations are all custom-drawn for each screen. Just don't be surprised at how eerie the game can be, what with the color palette of mostly browns and grays, the minimalistic music and sound effects, the slow pacing, and the near-total absence of comprehensible dialogue.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Gomo definitely functions as a more casual puzzle game than most point-and-click adventures. Your character only has three inventory slots, meaning that most of the game's puzzles are pretty straightforward and require only a few short steps to work out. The game doesn't allow much backtracking, which is nice in a sense since you won't get stuck wandering around wondering where to go next. But the game's linearity also means that you won't ever face any truly complex puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves generally represent a healthy degree of challenge. Pay attention to every detail onscreen and you can usually find your way forward after a few minutes of hard thought. Unfortunately, the puzzles don't really get any harder as you play through the game, and they can be a little uneven. You'll find yourself saying "That was obvious" or "What the heck am I supposed to do?" a little too often in this game. And sometimes you'll say both things about the same puzzle.\n\nUltimately, though, the game feels kind of empty. There's barely any story to this game--aliens kidnap your character's dog and offer to exchange him for a crystal--and absolutely no coherent through-line explaining where you are or where you're going next or why you're there. Each new screen and new set of puzzles seems totally arbitrary. You jumped through the last hoops, so here are some new zany hoops to jump through. And while your character goes through some wacky and amusing steps in his journey--battling an ancient robot, launching a sheep in a hot air balloon, and breaking into a squirrel's house--there's no narrative thread or even logical connection to give them any larger meaning.\n\nSo there it is. Gomo is painfully short, which wouldn't be a problem if it had anything resembling replay value or content. But since there's really nothing at all behind the game's nice visuals and modest puzzles, I'd give this game a pass unless I could get it for pennies.","December 13, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only $5 at full price anyway, but it's really short (took me less than an hour and a half from start to finish) and there's not a lot to it. The main impression I got was that they wanted to make a cartoon but for some reason they were forced to make video game instead. It's fairly whimsical and things don't really happen for any particular reason, but the puzzles are easy enough that that's not frustrating. There are a couple of sliding tile puzzles that don't really fit the style of the other puzzles in the game, but they're not randomised or anything so you can just use a walkthrough (which I did).\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Journey of a Roach, only not as good. The protagonist does speak, but rarely, and the dialogue is not important. Mostly you just press buttons and see what happens and then move on to the next screen. I was briefly stuck in a couple of places just because I couldn't work out what I was supposed to achieve, but most of the time there's not even really a puzzle, you just find the thing to click on. Sometimes you'll have to use an item from your inventory, but they're almost all one-use and given to you right where you'll need them. It's not a challenging game, there's not much story and very little characterisation, but the animation is nice and it doesn't take long to get through.","March 4","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the game again just to unlock the bonus minigames but it was just a waste of time as all three are slight variations of a "whack-a-mole" game.\n\nOverall the game is okay, but in my opinion it's the type of game you'd rather give to a 10 year old to keep them busy for a couple of hours.","March 1","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most puzzles spanned only a screen or two and didn’t require very many interactions to solve once you knew what the goal was. The story was also pretty ridiculous, but at points ridiculously adorable and the game had a good sense of humor (at one point little red riding hood is fighting the wolf with a light saber in the background). My main complaint was that the game was so short. It took me an hour to complete the story and although there are hidden mini-games to find and unlock that are accessible from the main menu, they didn’t increase the time I got out of the game all that much.
