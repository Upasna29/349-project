Many of the characters don't even have animations.\n- No voice acting.\n- The writing seems very lazy. Many times when I observed a hotspot in a scene I got the default "Nothing interesting here."\n- Very Glitchy. The game froze up on me twice and one of those times I had forgot to save in a while.  There was also a problem where my character would just walk off the screen and this happened a lot.\n- Short length and the ending seemed very rushed.\n- Too much sexual innuendo that just isn't very funny\n\nPerhaps it's breaking ground here with it's gay themes but that aside it's really not that good of a game. It feels like a very cheap novelty.","July 22, 2014","false","4.7"," 259 of 311 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","259","311","4","12"

Being a fan of John Waters, I was attracted to what I thought would be "campy". In my humble oppinion, this doesnt even have much "camp".\n\nThis game is like buying a novelty from a sex shop. You're never going to actually use it. It's a joke.\n\nThe game itself lacks any actual gameplay. I grew up playing Space Quest games, and other point and click's. This has no puzzles. If any of it was intended to be puzzling, then it was really easy. The comedy is decent, i'm a huge fan of the innuendo lift, but it really stops there for me.\n\nAfter playing the game for 1.5 hours, I hit a gamebreaking bug. Cannot restore save file. So, I sent my troubleshoots to the dev. I was shocked to actually get a respone.....but here I am almost 2 weeks later and I still do not have a fix for this horribly overpriced novelty of a game.\n\nI am all for supporting gay games, but this is just a disgrace.

It's kinda-sorta passable for a funny reddit comment thread, where people joke about point and click adventure tropes. Does it make up for game's other deficiences, can it carry a game by itself? Hell no.\n\nSo far game made me think exactly zero times, most of the time i just watch protagonist awkardly walk at badly drawn backdrops. Interface is clunky, hotspots are badly set up and the whole experience is rather... tedious.\n\nI guess we're still living in the world where "gay game" is such a novelty, people eat up products like this and even have something good to say about it just because it happens to be gay. I guess some people still want it to be "a niche".

However, the pricepoint is way too high for such a short game.  You can play through the game in an hour maybe drag it out to 2 or 3.  There's just not enough here to carry the pricetage it's asking.  With so many games to choose from these days, just because it's gay-themed (and hey that's something, I'll give it that) doesn't excuse the lack of content that any other game would be criticized for.  Voice-acting would have been a nice addition as would several more planets to explore along the way.

The price is pretty ridiculous, even on sale, so know what you're getting into. It's not horrible or broken, but it's simple, buggy, and poorly animated. The protagonist has a habit of walking off the game screen and having to be reset. The puzzles in the game are straightforward and with the hint system you'll never be stuck. The humor isn't quit as bad as other people say, I'll say I chuckled a couple times throughout the two hours it took me to beat it.\n\nReally this is worth maybe a dollar or two, and even then, I bet you can find a flash adventure game that rivals it for free.","January 1, 2015","false","2.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","0"

The process of getting from one task to another and the 'storyline' were mildly interesting. There is no way to interupt his walking when you click on an exit which made it difficult when you realise you missed something but must now wait for him to finally get to the next section then repeat the process. However the only good thing I can say Is I got through the game. I think if it had clearer hints and less walking time with the model pause before he turns where you need to go it might be more interesting to me. Instead I was bored halfway into the first section. I think at one point in the game he was walking on water.","December 30, 2014","false","2.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

I bought this game as a laugh to play with my girlfriend, but instead, it turned out to be an engaging story for the short time it lasted. I've noticed that every review for most of the games on this site often contains a lot of personal bias, so I figure I should be fair to this game and to everyone else and show my viewpoint from two different perspectives.\n\nAs a straight guy examining the game's gender tropes, this game was fun. Characters break the third wall and talk directly to the gamer, a tool that showcases a lot of the games true humor. The most often trope in video games is "hero saves damsel in distress", but here, the main goal is a reunion between the main character and a past love interest, who is by no means a damsel. Several other homosexual characters and comments made by them shine a light on how few other video games defy stereotypes and show that relationships can come in any shape or form. I REALLY enjoy a game defiant enough to turn common tropes around. Creativity is really the only thing that keeps game development a fluid marketplace.\n\nAs a gamer, this game was a short, funny adventure. The nature of the point and click game genre often requires a lot of going back and forth between different areas of exploration, and there are some moments where a detail that you didn't catch may end up making you explore an area you have already been to several more times. The game has a high contrast mode for vision impaired players, a nice touch if you're having too much trouble searching for the right things to grab. However, despite this, the game itself is fairly short; you should be able to finish the whole thing in under a few hours. The art style is not exceptionally thrilling, but the dialogue is hilarious and finding all of the hidden jokes and sexual innuendo was exactly what I expected.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this to others, but only if the price for the game falls below $8 or if you have some money burning a hole in your pocket. The ending scene makes the whole game absolutely worth it.","November 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","29","52","0","2"

The lowest price seems to had been $5.99. I'd say that is even pushing it. Hopefully you have a nice friend to get the game for you instead lol. Luckily, my friend did just that.\nThe story was sweet. The game felt a little too short. The game could be completed in four hours.\nThere's not really a reason to replay besides an extra feature of being in underwear the entire adventure. The graphics would be a bit inconsistent when using that feature as it will sometimes show him wearing a shirt in the textbox.\nAs far as bugs go, the game can sometimes be unresponsive, but it only lasts for a short while. There was one graphical glitch I had however it was fixed when restarting the game.\nFor a Point & Click game, there's not much to really click.\nThe humor in the game made me chuckle.\nThe innuendos in this game is pretty vast.\nThe art is passable. There's some inconsistentencies, such as the white pixels when you're riding the ship lift. However, I will say some of them are nice eyecandy.\nThere's not that much animations in the game. However, I haven't really played many Point and Click games. I don't believe many Point and Cick games have animations.\nThere's no voices in the game. The music is alright, not something I would download. It is very loud. I would turn your cpu volume down before playing.\nThere's not really any secrets in this game as far as I know.\nThere's also a lot of needless walking. I can click on a thing across the screen and the character will walk there only to say one line.\nIs this a game you need? No. Is it worth checking out just for the gay theme? Maybe? The gay theme might be the only thing going for it. There's not many gay themed games, so it exceeds there.","February 22","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Similarly, some dialogue could use work: some opening conversations were relevant earlier in the game, but are bizarre when they're repeated. Surely it wouldn't have been too difficult to throw in a generic greeting?\n\nThose are fairly minor squibbles - or should be. The walking, though: slow, frequently illogical, and at times frustrating enough to make me question whether it was even worth continuing. As the lead character thinks later in the game: "This is going to be a long game." He forgot to add "needlessly".\n\nThere was some jarring change in artwork at one point late in the game, for what amounted to an extremely lame joke (or at least, that's the only reason I can think of); and I'm still not sure what happened in the grand final scene, other than by imputation: it's almost as if there's a part of the scene missing.\n\nOn the plus side, the eyecandy is great - Joe Phillips is always reliable! - the humour generally good, and the storyline interesting enough to keep me playing - with enough "I didn't see that coming"s to keep me on my toes. Some of the puzzle solving, while usually logical, can take a bit of nutting out (although some others are  telegraphed a bit too much).\n\nOn balance, thumbs-up wins - but it was a close-run thing. And the sad part is, the things that brought this game down were easy fixes. If the game testers had done their job properly, or the developer followed up on their advice, this could have been a MUCH better game.\n\nAll that said, though, I look forward to the already-overdue next project from this developer: it's nice to have a gay-themed game that is not embarrasingly over-the-top (Joe Phillip's artwork aside, but I happily forgive him that). Sure, some of the dialogue is corny - I'm looking at you, lift - but overall the game is not nearly as corny or stereotyping as some reviewers would have you believe.\n\nHaving unlocked the alternative play version, will I play the game through again?\n\nYes - but not for a while.","January 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

Many people may not like that fact, but that is what the game is about. The game is a comedy above all else, it does not try to take its self too serious, I mean just look at the title of the game. Is it worth a few laughs, yes, and while I did laugh at the gay undertone of the game, I never found the game insulting or rude to the LGBT community. The writing does par off later in the game, and it lose some of its fun, only to pick up a few giggles here and there towards the end.\n\nThe main issue with the game is that it lacks polish and depth, from proper screen resolutions to sound sliders, and an over all UI smoothness. Even the puzzles are very simple and that may be good for people new to this genre of game. The art style in the game is simple at best, and why I am not amazed at  how this game looks I don't feel I will be taking anything away from it with after beating it.\n\nThe game is a comedy if you go in thinking its supper dubber serious about it then you will be only upsetting yourself. Its simple and worth a few laughs but not at $15.

For what it was, it was enjoyable. The major drawbacks were a clunky user interface, lackluster animation (despite otherwise rather nice art), and by far the worst: it was just too short!

Just be aware that some of the price might be considered more of a friendly donation than being entirely justified.","October 23, 2014","true","4.7"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","11","29","0","0"

Unlike most point n' click adventures, you don't need to combine random objects to solve a puzzle. The objects are fairly logical. However, it doesn't mean the puzzles are easily solved. You do need to think, but not like a developer. The hints for puzzles often come by trial and error, and by interacting with the NPCs. Got something in your pocket? Show it to someone! You never know where it will lead.\n\nI'd have played it in one sitting but I had to go to bed. Definitely a game worth playing in one sitting.","October 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"

Games like this are opening the world of gaming to the gay community. Playing a game where the guy saves the girl all the time gets tiresome; playing in a world where guys had boyfriends and girls, girlfriends was refreshing. I can only hope that there will be more games with this concept in the future.","December 23, 2014","true","3.6"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"

The humor was very tongue in cheek and sometimes called on breaking the 4th wall. For those fearing the "gay" label, outside of the cast of muscled men and a few ladies, there isnt really much going on. The game focuses on the story and the quest, focusing most of the "gayness" into the canned humor instead of the interation between characters. That aside, it was a good game. While not really worth the steep price tag for such a short game, if you like the style of gaming and are willing to shell out the cost considering the length, don't let the homophobes scare you off.","July 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 23 of 55 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","23","55","0","0"
