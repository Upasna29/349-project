The Great Fusion is a nice looking, well made game, but while the game feature list includes "Current affairs remarks with nods to social criticism", the game is so left leaning that I got a cramp in my neck from playing it.  Don't get me wrong, I certainly agree with some of the general sentiment, and I'm as aware of income and privilege disparity as poor people tend to be, but by the end of this game, I was starting to feel like it was written by Noam Chomsky and Alex Jones.\n\nAside from what sort of message the game may or may not be trying to convey, Is it fun?  I did play through the whole game, but it never really felt all that fun.  A lot of walking back and forth, dragging things over other things, hoping one of them would work, all the while being presented with a series of stereotypical caricatures such as "the greedy landlord", "the stupid boss", "the corrupt cop", or "the blind fish seller".  Ok, well that last one wasn't all that stereotypical, but anwyay.\n\nThe Great Fusion does try to be funny, and falls rather flat there as well, since it feels like every attempt at humor is pasted over the "message" the game is trying to deliver, besides the gags just not being funny in the first place.  I liked the bit about getting the rat to wash the dishes, but the funniest part is that the entire game is about how copyright protection and enforcement pretty much destroyed civilization as we know it, and I bought the game on Steam.","February 26, 2015","false","3.1"," 102 of 133 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","102","133","23","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/341690/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","The Great Fusion is a story set in a near future, where the economical crisis has taken a turn for a worse, making all countries fusionned in one, where riches are richer and where poors are poorer. And the copyright has taken over the world. You're Max, a geek, that lost his job at the beginning of the crisis and despite working, he's depressed and in a poor district. One day, Mate, his friend, finds a CD with Pong on it. But after playing it, Mate is kidnapped.... It's your job to find him!\n\nIt's a point-&-click game, with a depressing setting... but also satirical. In reality, the whole story is a parody (and also denouncing) of the mighty copyright. A lot of 'easter eggs' can be found: Larry for Leisure suit Lary, the boss that loves cats, the thugs whose names are directly a reference to video games, etc.. There is however no puzzles apart to find all objects and use them.\n\nThe problem of the game is the lack of real objective. There is no indication of what to do. Unless you find the right character to speak with. Also, you can't control your save. If you missed an achievement, you have to begin again the game.\n\nThe translation, while very good, has some spelling mistakes. I played the game in French by the way. So, it's also multi-language.\n\nThe graphics are cartoonish, reinforcing the comedy settings. The soundtrack is also good.\n\nI got the game through a bundle and I don't regret it. However, to fully enjoy the game, you must have also a good reference of culture (cinema, arts, video games). I'm pretty sure I missed some jokes. I recommend it mainly for people loving adventure games. It may bore others.","August 19, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Similar to masterpieces like Monkey Island or Day of the tentacle, not as good as them of course, but close, the history is very good, really really good, graphics and gameplay similar to old adventures from Lucasarts (but with a history and jokes really good)\nIf you like adventure games, get this one. Now I've to continue playing hehehe...","March 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

It's also really difficult to figure out what to do sometimes especially since you quite often have to do the same thing over and over with the same results until it produces a different result. But with that said it's still worth buying. On sale. For when you're REALLY bored.","April 5","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game is pretty linear and not much freedom to devert from the story, reminds me of the old school Sam and Max Hit the Road / Leisure Suit Larry (no lusty ladies though) to a degree.\n\nFor five bucks was worth a go, the game is motivated by politics and copyright laws/big brother, so if that isnt your cup of tea, then you may want to steer clear. Otherwise worth giving it a shot.","February 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","21","43","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/godzillasflyingpizza/recommended/341690/","godzillasflyingpizza","GodzillasFlyingPizza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/godzillasflyingpizza/","59 products in account","This is a game about an incredibly average guy who is Definitely Not The Game Developer, living in a near future dystopia in which Every White Male Middle Class Software Engineer's Worst Nightmares Come True. (These consist of a staggering misunderstanding of intellectual rights, copyright law, and economic inequality, wherein the game developer seems to think that taking away the right to buy entertainment is the same as taking away the rights to free thought and freedom of speech; wherein a person who actually buys or finds for free a copy of something is somehow violating copyright; and wherein "extreme poverty" means having a paying job, an apartment, and some debt.) His only friends are Another White Game Developer and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Yes, A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Who He Definitely Met In College. He is an unrepentant sh*thead to everyone he meets, but mostly women; to men he is polite and respectful, though it's exlicitely stated that this is usaully because he's afraid of them. He is polite only to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ He Definitely Met In College. He steals from other people, but this theft is joyless, unlike in other adventure games. The jokes come off as extremely whiny and petulant and aren't really jokes per se at all, but consist of the main character, who, remember, is Definitely Not The Game Developer, insulting people who he's Definitely Never Met In Real Life. Also, you need to insult people as much as possible to progress through some puzzles, which means you, the player, are forced to harass and debase a lot of women, and act like they owe you something for your very existence.\nAlso, the soundtrack consists, as far as I can tell, over the same 30 second loop of jarring music looping again and again. There is no voice acting, which we must consider a mercy. The graphics are comics/cartoonish, and are fine. The text contains many errors which should have been removed with basic editing revisions.\nDon't play this game. You will feel be forced to be an unlikeable sh*thead with zero redeeming qualities, and it will make you feel like an unlikeable sh*thead with zero redeeming qualities. It takes the drudgery of modern existence, complete with passive aggressive sexism and workplace harassment, and fails to make you feel better about them. You don't need to pay money to feel like that.","September 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"
