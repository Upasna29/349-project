"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/421910/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n"A brand-new addition to the Collectible Card Game genre that showcases a wave-focused game play instead of the AI-focused standard"\n\nGame Overview\nThis game features a wave-focused, strategic PvE aspect that is rare in Collectible/Trading Card Games nowadays.\n\nYou have three (3) classes (Hunter, Occultist, and Scientist) to pick on which makes up the variation for deck building. Each of these classes has their own specialty and traits but you are limited to have only thirty (30) cards per deck. These variations range from "the amount of health, energy, and maximum cards in hand" at the start of each stage up to "the cards available for their use".\n\nThere are "class-specific" and also "common cards" which gives you the freedom to make a more flexible and versatile adjustment that matches your play style.\nThe cards also have other sub-categories that they belong to, so you better be aware of them to avoid confusion. The game proceeds with a quest-style campaign which gives of points after you clear the stage, which you can use to buy booster packs.\n\n\nThe Pros\nWell-Updated and Balanced - With monthly expansive and balancing updates to the game, you can feel that the developers are really committed and passionate in working towards their game to become better and better. There was a very hard stage (and by this, I mean you will have difficulty clearing the stage even if you have epic-legendary cards) at a time before "Update Foxtrot" came. It's not that making a stage easier is good since higher difficulty gives more replay value, but there has to be a certain limit to it and the update was a good adjustment for it.\n\nBeautiful Interface and Graphics - A user-friendly interface and an artistic display of collectible cards are one of the factors that contributes to the appeal of the game as a whole.\n\nHigh Replay Value - The right balance of difficulty in the game, the point reward system, and its feature to collect cards of various rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary) are the factors that contribute to this game's replay value.\n\nLow Random Factor - Though the RNG (Random Number Generator) system in card games is sometimes what makes them interesting and fun to play, I find it appealing that this game and the developers decided to have a low priority on this aspect to make it more strategically immersive. It would be more satisfying that you clear a stage using a strategy rather than just relying with luck, wouldn't it?\n\nSteam Cloud - A game with a Steam cloud feature is almost always a plus. Especially in this case, you won't have to worry on carrying over save files in case you are using a different computer to transfer over your progress.\n\nThe Cons\nDeck Variations - Currently, the game has three classes which mainly differentiates each other depending on the type of damage they produce but isn't limited to them. While it is more than sufficient in the game's current status,it might feel somewhat limited in terms of deck versatility in the long run.\n\nRepetitive Audio - Good soundtracks are always a big plus for any game, but unfortunately this isn't the focused attribute for this one. Yes, there is a good soundtrack in the game, but hearing it repetitively will make you fed-up at some point (or even make you annoyed enough to disable it).\n\nSingle Player - Not that this is a true downside of the game, but more of a recommendation in the future. A multi-player game play is always welcome when it comes to card games, however it might be hard to grasp on how this will play out since this game is focused with PvE.\nThe Verdict\nFrankly, this game is a diamond in the rough. While it has it's own flaws, the immersiveness of the game play and its beautiful interface covers for it and gives more.\n\nIf your question is whether it is worth to buy the game now even if it is still on early access, my answer is "Yes, it is worth it".\n\n\nIf you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","March 16","true","20.2"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","34","37","2","0"

When you complete a quest you get reward points and you can buy booster of cards from the Store; if you're not happy with some of the cards you got from boosters, you can sell them and craft new ones with the resulting credits.\n\nI'm having some difficulties with "Hard" quests, not only because they are meant to be difficult but also because of luck; yes, when drawing cards from the deck, luck plays a very important role, like you'll die several times when, for example, you're not getting Medikits in time to heal yourself (deck has 30 cards and you can have max 2 cards of the same type, so there are only 2 Medikits max - there are some other healing cards but they are not sufficient on their own).\nSolution for success is going to the Arsenal and build a new deck (or modify it) until you get the proper cards for the current quest you're playing. There are several different aspects to take into account while fighting, starting from the type of cards you're going to use, effects and conditions that are applied to them, type of damage they inflict and monsters you're dealing with, because each and every one of them is pretty much unique.\n\nSo, I'm having quite a lot of fun playing PANOPTES and feel like recommending it with flying colors.","June 3","true","10.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Better that way, as you will fight against Mythical Monsters, Aliens and more.\n\nPANOPTES is a TCG driven story where you have to engage in combat against enemies using a deck of cards. In this early access, you will be playing 3 types of characters: Hunters, Scientists and Occultists. Each of these types have they own abilities and basic deck of cards. The basic deck of cards (30 cards per deck) for the Hunters will have more common weapons, cards and tools. The Occultists, in comparison, will have more magic cards and the scientists will have a balance of the two.\n\nCombat-wise, it is simple to understand how it works. You have a deck of 30 cards at your disposal. You can draw or see a maximum of 5 cards at any given time. You might fight 1 wave of enemies (it could be 1 enemy in one wave) or several with a single deck of cards. Can be tricky at times. Each card will use a specific number of energy points to use against your foe. Remember that each time you draw a card from the deck, it will cost you 1 energy point and at the start of each turn you will have 5 energy points at your disposition. Cards like the Adrenaline Injection will give you an extra energy point but only for a minimum of turns. If you win the battle, you will be given a couple of new cards and reward points which you can use to purchase a booster pack at the store to help you to unlock new cards (you might not gain any new cards). Booster packs are not cheap; you will need 600 points to purchase a booster with 5 extra cards in it, and 7900 points for a booster which includes 75 cards in this current version.\n\nThe graphics component for this genre of game is very good and the audio creates very suspenseful atmosphere. I do like the information tab, you will get information about your team, missions, factions and more.\n\nThis is a solid early access as far as I am concerned and I look forward to seeing updates.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Audio gives you an atmosphere of suspense\n-	Nice content for an early access\n-	Nice graphics for its genre\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\nI really believe this game has great potential even if winning a battle relies heavily on drawing the right card at the right time.\n\n7/10 (early access score)\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/421910/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen it comes to TCGs I'm always a little cautious as getting the balance right with cards and creating a TCG that has good synergy is very difficult but I think PANOPTES actually hits the nail on the head.\n\nPANOPTES focuses on story and PVE which is a welcome break from the usual PVP that TGCs focus on. I've enjoyed a lot of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone in the past so I'm not new to this genre but I do feel PANOPTES touches on something a little different.\nStory-wise you are part of 'The Club' which seems to be an organization that hunts monsters and other supernatural beings in a world where most people try to turn a blind eye. Your aim is to rid the world of these evils and protect those who can't protect themselves.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played this style of game before the aim is to build your own deck from three classes (Scientist, Occultist and Hunter) each with their own class specific cards and play-styles, to defeat waves of enemies per mission. Each class has their own strengths: Hunter is more weapon based whereas Occultist focuses on magic and spells, and each requires different strategy. Each deck is made up of 30 cards which are drawn at random and it is with these cards you must defeat your foes each mission. Drawing and playing cards uses something called Energy which replenishes itself at the start of each turn. Enemies do not have energy and instead only attack with their monsters each turn rather than playing any new cards. Once you complete a mission you are rewarded with new cards and some in game points which can be used to buy booster packs. These seem to range from 600 to 8000 points, 600 point packs containing 5 cards and 7900 point packs containing 75 cards.\nThe fact that you can unlock new cards for your decks gives this game plenty of re-playability BUT I would love to see card trading with other players introduced. Despite the fact that the game is PVE I think it'd add a strong community within the game which I feel is very important in TCGs.\n\nCreating a deck is already very fun and a little challenging. There is a great amount of cards currently and as I said before, the classes add even more choice and let you play your way. Where PANOPTES focuses on PVE this allows you to build your decks how YOU want to play rather than having to build decks to counter commonly used overpowered decks like you do when you play PVP TCGs which is a relief. It makes the game much more engaging and way more enjoyable to play on your own terms.\n\nAnother thing I really like about PANOPTES, and which is often overlooked, is the graphics. The art style is very clean and all the cards are very detailed. Usually in pre-aplha games there is a lot of placeholder art but I feel the artists put a lot of time into creating something amazing from the start. I enjoyed just browsing the cards.\n\nThere ARE balance issues with some of the cards but this is being routinely worked on so do expect some cards to be nerfed and others to be buffed whilst the development is going on but that is just a part of the Early Access process.\n\nI think that PANOPTES is a very strong contender in the TCG arena despite the fact that it's still in Pre-Alpha Early Access. In fact I'm surprised this is even considered pre-alpha. There is plenty of content to keep you going through development and the developers seem engaged with the community and are pushing out updates once a month on average.\nI am very excited to see what becomes of PANOPTES because it already is a fantastic addition to the TCG genre.","March 4","true","15.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It's got some pretty challenging fights in it, so not for casual players.\n\nPROS:\n\nGood, consistant, artwork throughout. Cards are nicely illustrated, with the techno/magic world being well represented.\n\nDecent ambient music and incidental sounds.\n\nThree characters with three different basic playstyles. Each can be heavily tailored to deal with different threats and synergize decks for rushing, DOTs etc. Plenty of scope for customisation.\n\nA pretty impressive amount of cards already. You start with a basic set for each character, and unlock new cards by completing missions or buying boosters with in-game currency. There are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS :D\n\nGenuinely tough fights in places. They need a customised deck and a proper strategy to beat.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nThe UI is clearly a work in progress. It's fully functional but bare bones at the moment. It's also a little "dry", without much feedback when card interactions happen.\n\nLack of mouse-over text. All the rules and card effects are explained in the game, via the help button. However, if you want to find out what, for example, the "indomitable" effect does on a monster card, you'll have to go through quite a few clicks to get there.\n\nWall of text cards. Some of the boss cards have a ton of effects and conditions on them, which can be a little hard to parse. I'd like to see these eventually condensed down to mouse-over hyperlinks, which bring up what each effect does as you hover over it.\n\nLack of damage/effect predictions. Some cards do things like "Damage = 3 +number of spell cards in the card graveyard", for example. At the moment, you have to manually go into the graveyard and count the spell cards. Things like this should be automated, and hopefully will be. I'd also like to see what the potential effects of a selected card will be on enemies as I hover over them.\n\nThat's it so far. I'm on mission 37 at the time of writing, and I definitely feel like I've got my money's worth so far. Looking forward to any improvements and extra content.\n","January 9","true","14.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's classified as a horror Trading Card Game (TCG) and takes a Player vs Environment (PvE) approach as opposed to the more common Player vs Player (PvP) approach usually seen in this type of game.\n\nGraphically, the game is unexpectedly beautiful. The artwork is unique and has a dark urban fantasy vibe to it. The soundtrack actually enhances this mood and creates a suspenseful experience.\n\nThe story itself is also engaging, and that's very unique to this style of game where storyline is generally minimal. The controls are very easy to master, but keep in mind that this is a game that doesn't offer controller support. It's strictly mouse and keyboard functionality.\n\nGameplay is also fully functional and easy to learn, even if you've never played a game of this type before. The premise for this game is that you're an agent of an organization called "The Club," and your purpose is to vanquish mythological and supernatural creatures.\n\nGame objectives are met through the drawing and playing of cards, and deckbuilding is central to the game, as is typical with this genre. There's no mana, but instead "energy" comes into play, and it is spent and regained through the course of gameplay.\n\nThe game has more than 50 different missions and three character classes: Scientist, Occultist, and Hunter. Each class will have cards that are specific to the class while other cards are universal. Points are awarded for completing missions successfully, and those points are then used to obtain additional cards.\n\nThe ability to customize your deck and playthrough multiple times with different character classes means that this game has a great deal of replayability.\n\nThere are just two Steam achievements at this point and no Steam cards, but this game is in the Early Access stage, so it's entirely possible that we will see expansions to game content and extras in the near future.\n\nI didn't experience any game crashes or game-breaking bugs, and overall the game feels and functions like a fully finished product. I'm actually very amazed at the overall package and excited to see what the developers will consider to be the finished version.\n\nI recommend this game very highly to any fan of TCG and CCG games, as well as those who appreciate a darker gaming atmosphere.\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Review Experts.","March 15","true","3.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/421910/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCard games have been all of the rage what with all of the success enjoyed by Magic the Gathering and more so on PC with Blizzard’s Hearthstone. I, myself, have to admit to more than a little bit of addiction to Hearthstone. While I don’t quite have every card in the game or reached legendary status I have played countless hours in the game. Therefore, I do find it interesting when a new entry is added to the Steam catalogue. Games such as Hand of Fate and Card City Nights have seen significant playtime on my account. This time it is Suricate Games with their first foray onto the Steam platform with PANOPTES.\n\nIt’s currently in an early alpha pre-release stage but I believe that Suricate Games got it right with releasing it onto Steam now. The base game is already in a very playable state meaning that players will be able to begin to experience what the entire game is like when it’s all finalized by their estimated date of the second half of the year. The basic mechanics are similar to the genre. You get a few cards to start off with, some action points to play them and a draw pile. Unlike other games that I’ve played a player can use an action point to draw from their draw pile. The cards have different properties that are either weapons, heals or serve utility purposes. The AI, unlike other card games, come in the form of waves. In the quests that I played through the first wave came with two mobs, the middle one was a loner, a third was stronger than the first and you either finish after three or there can be even longer waves.\n\nThe story hasn’t been fleshed out yet so it’s unfair to delve much deeper there. Thus far the graphics are more than suitable and the sound was suffice. These are things that could all change as the development moves closer to final release.\n\nWhat I did play was definitely enjoyable and is a game that I cannot wait to come back to – being that I am a card game addict. So that’s who I can recommend it to. If you’ve ever wanted to provide some input into the making of a card game, want to support something that could be very, very good from its alpha stage then do get in on PANOPTES.","January 14","true","0.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I've finished it and I've never read PANOPTES anywhere in the game at all except for the opening loading screen (which looks nice btw).\n\nStory driven tcg? Sure but only if you read the block of text before and after each mission; otherwise, you can just ignore the "story" completely and hit that start mission button. The game has a pretty solid campaign with a total of 51 missions. You can choose from a pool of three characters, each with a different type of cards available to them (Hunter, Scientist and Occultist) except for the Common type which, as its name suggests, can be used by any one of them.\n\nAt some points in the game, you are forced to use a certain character for a specified mission just so it will fit with the story. For the rest of the game, you have the freedom to choose (but not really if you want an easier life since certain characters are more appropriate for certain missions due to enemies' resistances and abilities).\n\nThe only bug I found and a persistent one to say the least is that you can't view all of the possible monsters for missions with many types of monsters in it. You can use the mouse wheel to scroll down but it comes back up immediately so you can't hover over them to view their profile. Or you can drag the page down with your left mouse button and try to hover over them quickly but you will fail. Trust me, I've tried.\n\nOne last thing, watch out for mission 9.

In comparison to the Pre Alpha Demo I’ve played the Early Access has shown great progression including multiple new features. I played the pre alpha demo on my channel a while back and instantly fell in love with the concept, you don’t see to many card games that are story driven and have a horror aspect to it. What makes it stand out so much is the level of the detail in the artwork, it’s comparable to Magic The Gathering. The music truly captures you, making you realize you are in complete isolation having to complete your mission of taking on your enemies. I also noticed they added quite a bit of lore to the background of the organization and it’s members which is an interesting read. My only gripe with the game at the moment is it needs more animations in terms of when the cards are in effect. I also hope to see future instalments of when hovering over the card the symbols are explained without going to the clue mark at the top of the screen. Overall I love the game and will keep supporting it as it progresses through many changes to come, I recommend it to anyone who loves card games that contain horror elements, be apart of The Club and take down these abominations!\n\nI've also made a Let's Play of the first mission and a general introduction about the features of the game if you would like to check it out!\n\nLink to the Let's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62u0dwsEEeE","January 31","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm some 30 odd missions into the campaign, and thoroughly enjoying the difficulty level.\n\nThis is a game that requires deck-building strategy, and you don't always figure out what you need till you've taken a beating, and then it may still take a few attempts to get a workable combo.\n\nI also appreciate that the variety in the missions (and enemies) means you're using different classes and cards along the way. So when you do unlock some booster packs it's more fun than in some other CCGs where it's likely that a bunch of the cards won't see any real play.","January 31","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

People may feel a little lost first time they play, but it's easy to learn with practice.  It is still in development and it looks to be improving upon every update.  Would recommend to other players who have a preference for card games.","March 8","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The linear challenges can get repetitive but the strong game play makes it worth going through them. I am very excited to see where development goes from here as a lot of the core gameplay is already present and polished.","May 30","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
