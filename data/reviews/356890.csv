"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/356890/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","TL,DR: If you have an Android phone, play it on there for free (apparently, that version has ads). If you're curious, search the name and play it for free on-line (that version DOES NOT have ads, as far as I can tell). If after that, you want to pay $3 for it, do so to support the dev. If you're a card addict, wait for the game to go on sale.\n\nAnd, if you want to read the dev telling me things I already know about this game (because I paid money for it and played it) and how to spend my money. . .and trying to tell me why certain features are worth my money (SPOILER ALERT: it's because they are fun), then check the comments for my review. This feature comes free of charge, but is technically an ad. Which is weird, because I paid for an ad free version.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wish there was a neutral rating for games like this. It's fine. It does what it does and it's okay. It's nothing great, but it's not a bad game.\n\nOne More Line is a simple game. You're a little "D"-looking thing and you being propelled upward. There are obstacles in your way. If you smash into them, you die. If you smash into the wall, you die. If you click with the mouse, you'll be pulled into the orbit of of the obstacles. If you click again, you'll be released. The score goes up as long as you're not orbiting an obstacles and the goal is to get as high a score as possible.\n\nAnd it's fine. The name is true, you'll want to give it another go. The (I think) one music track is funky. It requires some skill, there's challenge. It's fine.\n\nHere's the thing though: it's a mobile port. Not only is it a mobile port, but it's mobile port that is free on android phone. Don't have an Android phone? You can play it on-line for free. Now, this isn't necessarily bad. Enchanted Cave 2 is also free on-line and that game is great. However, it has a lot more depth. There's more to do. One More Line, is the perfect mobile game. It's simple, it's quick, it's best when played in short bursts. There is not a lot to it.\n\nAlso, it's a lazy mobile port. It tells you to "touch" and the little tutorial screen that pops up the first time you play does not seem to want to go away by clicking with the mouse.\n\nGranted, there are features not in other versions. Apparently, the multi-player is exclusive to Steam. However, I, personally, am never going to make use of that. There's cards, there's achievements.\n\n$3 isn't a lot, but it feels a bit too much for this. This is a perfectly fine game to get on sale for $0.99 if you like achievements and cards.","August 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 91 of 124 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","91","124","2","12"

Be careful though, because one mistake and you’re gone.\n\nThe game features 2-4 player local co-op so you can race against your mates in a bunch of different gamemodes such as Chaos, Destruction, Time Attack and Survival, or if you don’t have any friends you can play by yourself and try to beat your own high score.\n\nAs you play and accumulate mileage you automatically unlock new hats and trails to customise your icon, to show off to your friends how hardcore you are.\n\nThe game is small, but for $3, I believe anyone looking for something to play with mates should have it.\n\nI rate One More Line 8/10 boomerangs.","June 1","true","3.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

First thing it asked me was if I'd like to watch a tutorial video. Yes, why, of course. But no matter how hard I was pressing "Yes", the video would not start. Then I realized the game started with no sound for apparently no good reason and when I tried to switch the audio on from the options menu, the game crashed itself to the desktop.\nOh, I wanted to quit it so hard...\nThen I got to actually play it, and I changed my mind.

The problem with that version, is that every 3 runs or so, you are bombarded with advertisements. In a game where you can make mistakes that will kill you in an instant, those 3 runs sometimes will go by so fast, you get interrupted by an ad quite often. Not a truly gamebreaking thing, but an extremely annoying thing none the less.\n\nSo why get the Steam version if mobile is free? Well, I for one prefer the feeling of pressing a key over tapping a screen. Sometimes touch screens are wonky, and will register your touch, even if you aren't actually touching the screen. This can lead to frustrating deaths in this game. By pressing a key (Which is the Q key by the way) that random element is eliminated.\nIf you are bad at games like I am, you will also appreciate being able to play uninterupted by advertisements every time you make a misake. I've had great runs, and I have spurts of really really bad runs. It's nice not having to look at yet another Walmart Special when I'm goofing up.\n\nAnd let's be honest, this game costs less than a Big-Mac burger. Well worth the $3 pricetag.","August 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Sometimes the hold on the obstacle isn't released the moment you let the button go so you cannot predict the exact direction. Similarly when you try to grab a node, sometimes it won't react instantly and in this game you need fast reflexes and very responsive control of your "line".\nb. (This is the most important problem) Sometimes the algorithm will choose the target that is coming straight at you to cling on to so it's bye-bye with a head on collision.\nAnd that's it for me.. just a few too many head on collisions and game over for this one..\n\nPS.

Personally I love the idea of traversing vacuum by gears and tangent lines. I've spent a considerable amount of time playing this if you think about it. This isn't a big title after all.\n\nIt's an interesting example of a game with zero input lag. This might seem contradictory to the enlightened consumer who's read other reviews. However, one must acknowledge that there can't be input lag when there is no input ability in the first place. For some reason the game refuses to consider input at will---from that point on it's more like 'One More Titanic'.\n\nIf you're like me, and you like the concept of One More Line, then you should definitely try this game out. Just not on Steam. This game is free on Android. Test the waters there. Okay, you might not be able to do co-op that way, but then again, what's the difference between having two fellas punch a monitor and having someone put a fist through the screen by himself? Both situations end with you having to fork out a lot of money.","December 18, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/recommended/356890/","bumblebug","Bumblebugbee3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/","250 products in account","One More Line is a hypnotic game of survive.  The concept is crazy simple; don't hit any objects or veer off the course.  The problem is you can't simply steer where you want to go.  Your only means of changing direction is to grapple hook onto the direct objects that clutter the track.  Once attached to these objects you'll start to spin around them and will continue doing so until you release.\n\nThe speed of your ship is what makes this such a challenging game.  You only have split seconds to decide if you should attach yourself to an object.  The farther away from the object the better as you'll have more time to think and examine any immediate threats.  This is a huge problem as one of the easiest ways to fail is to swing smack into a near by object while rotating.  Also, if you're too close when you hook on your ship rotates so quickly its basically impossible to tell which direction you'll be heading once you release.\n\n\nAs you continue playing though the game you'll unlock different options to customize your experience.  You can choose different outfits for your character and different tracks for the contrails of your ship.  These choices aren't very thrilling but they at least provide an excuse to continue playing.  Then if the challenge of beating your high-score isn't enough to keep you entertained there is an option for local multiplayer which can go up to four players.  A series of different game modes offer quite a bit of variety for multiplayer.  This is a very fast paced and unpredictable game the would be perfect for parties or a good laugh at a competitive get to together.\n\nThe sound design is where this game really shines.  The music is thrilling, it keeps you pumped up and ready to face the crazy trials this game will put you through.  Death is so quick and is written off almost instantly.  Simply click the retry button and you thrown straight back into the world.  Meanwhile the game cheers you on in its rhythmic robot voice singing out "retry" or "one more line".  This feels kind of reminiscent of Minecraft's "just one more block" mentality.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a super light game.  That being said One More Line is quite fun and very addicting.  Most rounds won't even last half a minute.  I almost wish the ships speed would have started out slower and got faster as you progressed upwards.  My main complaint is there is little to no time to react and stop yourself from swinging right into another object.  Also there are times when I'm certain I press the grapple button a fair distance away to find myself slamming right into the object.  Its not perfect by any means but its an inexpensive game with a amusingly simple mechanic.","February 23","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
