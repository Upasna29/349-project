I personally never saw a game like this, but the setting is still awesome.\nYou have your 4 characters;  3.5 Characters, because pure is still unfinished\nPhalanx, Judgement, Ryoku and Pure. All of them have their own move set, animations and taunts even, who are all optimizable. (Im not going to discuss who is under-and overpowered, so shush)\nYou can equip those characters with 5 different swordtypes; Longsword, Scimitar, Rapier, Katana and Jian, which are all unlocked in the start of the game and the only thing you can unlock is eye-candy, which doesnt affect gameplay at all. Meaning, no matter how long you play the game, you wont unlock anything that will affect gameplay.\nCoupled with some parkour (which is useless) and a nice fighting system (which I wont explain either) and you have a perfect game, right?\n\n...No..not really.\n\nThe Good -Nice Fighting System\n-Responsive Controls\n-Good designed free for all and Duel game modes, where FFA can be moddable, being a source game.\n-A lot of workshop integration which fits this game perfectly\n-Online leaderboards which keeps track of your progress\n\nAnd now....the dark side of this game\n\nThe Bad -Bad Tracers (Hit detection if you want it that way)\n-Hitboxes can be just awful at times\n-Lag can do a lot of weird stuff\n-4. Character Pure is unfinished\n-Characters have attacks which are just broken or weird\n-A lot of balancing problems\n-Random and unexplainable FPS drops sometimes\n-The General Duel maps have FPS problems in general\n-Ranking system is just not executed well\n-Buggy Physics and just stuff thats not supposed to happen\n- The Game Is Dead\n\nThis is where the normal review ends. Ill give this game a 5.5/10. Dont pick this up for the normal price, get it on a sale, when you really want it. Yes, I have a decent amount of playtime still racking up. But at this point I cant recommend this game.\nYou can end here or keep reading for some more details, details, yay!\nEDIT: No, I dont hate this game. The community is great (aside from a few people), the concept is awesome and the game is overall fun. I just cant recommend it at this state. YES, I like this game.\n\nDead Symphony Simply, this game is dead. Trying to get in new in this game is hard, because the most active players are the advanced and good ones. The community doesnt grow, the devs (and the balancing team) keep doing decisions and decision which are just not explainable. Most old-school players quit and/or switched to other games;\n\nFor a reason, you will notice when you go online everyday for a week: You keep meeting the same people over and over again. And the new players will just get crushed by the advanced ones (This game is multiplayer only), having no chance to get better without avoiding the good players all the time.\n\nThe game isnt even THAT bad, its just how I said. Fighting the same people over and over again just gets boring.\nBUT, the community IS good. Some people of the balancing team are nice players and some devs even play the game!\nThe game being dead, means we meet the same people over and over again (For the third time now), but that also means that were a BETTER community. We know eachother better when theres less people.\nWell, yeah, sucks that the community keeps getting smaller because more and more people are quitting.\nIf the devs dont do something, this game is poorly advertised aswell, the game is going to be dead soon. Dead for good.\n\nGod, that was a lot of random bu!!sh!t. But you wanted a review and here it is.\nThanks for reading! <3","August 18, 2014","false","195.6"," 888 of 1,091 people (81%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","81","888","1","14","45"

That said, it might not keep you terribly entertained for any great lengths of time, but it has potential as long as more content is added by either the devs or by the community.\n\nLong version:\nBasically game plays similar to a fighting game. Two people, one arena, best out of three. The twist is in the combat system its self. Swords clash and deflect off each other, creating opening for light attacks and heavy stance attacks, when timed well, can do tonnes of damage to the people who dare give you an opening. Grabs, projectiles and charged attacks are thrown into the mixture as well to give you some more interesting options to play with.\n\nTo break it down there are four characters available in the game as it is now, each with their sword fighting style and speeds.\nSword lines project the path your sword is going to travel when you attack. To avoid taking damage from these attacks, you opponent can dart out of the way, roll to avoid the sword's path (yes, provided you can time it right, you can roll under a horizontal sword swing to avoid taking damage), block to take less damage or clash swords with an attack of their own.\n\nThat's just the basics of how the fights turn out. There are two types of server available as of now; Duel and Free For All.\nThe way duel servers work is quite neat. On each duel map, there are three different arenas to fight in. If all three are in use, you can queue up to join one of them and spectate the current dual as you wait. At any time, players in an arena and its queue can vote to make the arena they are in a 2v2. Free for all servers are quite different. Instead of the map being split up into three, all people are in one big space and can attack at random or challenge each other to private duels to avoid being interrupted by randomers.\n\nAs you fight, you gain a form of currency called 'notes'. These can be used to buy new swords, skins, capes and masks for your preferred characters. I'm interested to see how the workshop is integrated though. The workshop seemed to undermine the whole currency thing, letting you download free, visible-to-all swords. All the items off the workshop have been removed though, so they're probably addressing that now. The global ranking system is a neat idea too. With every win and loss (and apparently hit landed too) contributing to your rank which is on display and for everybody to see. Is a nice little touch to either give you a boost of confidence or a boot up the ♥♥♥ depending on whether you've been playing against a dev or not.\n\nSpeaking of which, the devs are friendly and very in-touch with the community. I've run into them a couple times in game, which I can't really say for anything else I've played.\n\nAnyway, I would say this game is worth your money. It's a nice little idea, and I'm interested to see how the devs are gonna continue to add to this game.","November 25, 2013","true","11.2"," 376 of 444 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","376","444","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xiaounlimited/recommended/225600/","xiaounlimited","Eaguru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xiaounlimited/","190 products in account","I absolutely love this game. I am enamoured by it, addicted to it, and appalled by it. I'm conflicted, because it is incredibly fun and incredibly flawed. It's fast-paced 1-on-1 sword fighting action that's neither realistic nor fantastical.\n\nBefore I say anything else, I will preface with this: you are buying into Early Access. This review is written pre-1.0 release. The game is inherently unfinished and has issues. I'm certain these will be addressed sooner or later.\n\nBlade Symphony is a 3D directional fighter, taking cues from Soul Calibur, Jedi Knight Academy and GunZ. I've been told it's "like GunZ, without the guns." The (currently) four fighters have their own movesets and synergies with weapon types. It's up to the player to figure out the various stance chains (between Fast, Balanced, and Heavy), how to space them, and how to time them. Players will link these moves together, stabbing, slashing and bashing each other until one fighter loses. That's as simple as it gets.\n\nIf you're looking for a description of basic game mechanics, there are other reviews for that.\n\nWhat I'm primarily writing about is where the game simultaneously fails and succeeds: its unintentional systems. These buried systems that new players will not be introduced to, and be simultaneously destroyed by, are my favourite and least favourite part of Blade Symphony. These tricks are similar to how K-Styling came to be in GunZ—happy accidents that came about as a flaw in the mechanics. Air canceling, animation canceling and gliding are some of the tricks and mechanic abuses that have become what is the current meta of "advanced play" in Blade Symphony. While many lower ranked players will play it straight, advanced players will frequently dominate arenas against players that do not know how to leverage these unintentional mechanics. Many newcomers will not have the patience to learn how to play against or adopt these strategies and will be put off. At the same time, it adds options and extra layers to a game that would otherwise be fairly simple.\n\nThis is where I'm conflicted. I love the community teaching aspect. I feel accomplished knowing how to beat cheese strategies, how to beat spam, and how to execute these exploits. At the same time, is it a good thing that a game relies on the crutches of unintentional design to succeed? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nI'm in love with the game. You might hate it. I support this game to the fullest, but be wary of what you're getting into. Blade Symphony is one of the best $15 I've spent in a while. It might be your worst.\n\nAll I know is that my adrenaline is pumping and I am having one hell of a time.","December 9, 2013","true","97.5"," 254 of 306 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","254","306","0","2"

But first some things I wish to point out.\nAfter 900 hours I can be a little biased in favor of this game\nThis is not a game where a person with 1 hour should be reviewing, this game takes much more time to understand and any reviews from these people should be ignored, if you like it or not.\nBlade Symphony, released May 7, 2014 by Puny Human Games. This is a game that without a doubt I am addicted too, though idk if that is good or bad, probably bad. From my first day on Blade Symphony spamming with Jian Ryoku, to becoming almost top tier, my journey has been wonderful. I have met tons of people, most of them on my steam friends list and I dont regret anything. Though I feel like im a rare case, for many many players have stopped playing for multiple reasons that ill get too in second.\n\nPros:\nComplex fighting mechanics (can be good or bad, but probably a good thing).\nGood community, most of them you will talk to and get to know them a little bit.\nMembers of the community are taking an initiative to try and balance the game.\nAwesome soundtrack.\nFun player-made events like Battlechess, Machine, King of the Hill, Fencing, Kendo etc.\nSteam Workshop enabled, allowing you to choose from tons of player made swords.\n\nCons:\nBad retention rate.\nNot much content.\nTime between patches can get rather long.\nDevs aren't as involved as they once were (though they are still here).\n\nThis is one of those games that is not for everyone, and if you get this game you need to go in knowing that you will get stomped, beaten, and "lolgitgudfgtggnore"'ed by bad eggs, this is only a very small amount of players though, most of the players are actually very friendly and willing to help you. Time and practice will gain you skill, you will need to be patient. You dont know how many times ive seen new players come in and get mad because they cant win. Sorry, your not going to win against someone with houndreds of hours. As of right now their are two servers with teachers, "Sexy Food" US, and "Avalaon" EU.\n\nBut this game isnt without flaws, because of the games retention rate (sorry cant remeber the exact figure), you will notice not very many play this game. Those that do play, have lots of hours. So if you are looking for a game with many players. Quit reading and find a new game. But because this is a fighting game, the most important thing is the balancing. Tbh this game has become less balanced than in the past. But im sure devs, and experienced players will work together to balance the game in time.\n\nIf you are looking for a complex fighting game, and can handle being beaten up many times, I strongly recommend this game. As I said, this game isnt for everyone and you need patience. But after 900+ hours ive had my journey and it has been pleasant, and I wish to see more people.\n\nI mentioned about me having most of my friends list ppl from Blade Symphony. Im going to take this moment to list every single one of them so you have an understanding of just how many people I have had the pleasure of meeting and having on my friends list.\n\nLexxure, Blood Spartan, CanadaOP, Dr.untitled, Goobie, Matthiasa, Mike, Paco, RedBreadMcjagger, Redmund, Tea Time, Tork, Tyrone, Waifu, MTU, Nani, Narny, Norman, Pedro, R3D343, Raffle, Scal Forte, Septum Sonus, Skeleton, SSauce, Taz, Kmoney, Water, Xehanoth, Darknight, Vendetta, Vylli, R3D5n0w, Animas, Bready, Chipi, Codemonkey, Death, Dnoor, EatabagofDiks, Elmo The Grand Defiler of Soul, Famos, Frok-Vee, Fug4life, Hade, Imposter Snake, JESUS IN REHAB, Kevin, Kiinsy, Lostinei, Maconjr, ManofHonor, Paradox, Ricky, Rozie, Sazed, Sergeant Stoner, Milo, Stewy, The Fish, Greatest Black Karate Man, Zealum, Trolligy, ZeronKnight.\n\nAs you can see I have met many people from A-Z, and have enjoyed talking to each and every single one of them, or they wouldnt be on my friends list. Im at the point that I stay for the community, not the fighting itself. Once you start playing and you stay, you will see your friends list stack up with people you meet. And with that being said......I recommend this game.","January 6, 2015","true","322.6"," 177 of 209 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","177","209","5","17"

Remember that day when you finally got to play the swordfighting video game you had been dreaming of all your life? That was a good feeling.\n\nNow you're in your mid thirties, unmarried and childless, with a career that isn't really going anywhere. It's Friday night and, if you were back in your college days, you'd be at a party, drinking cheap beer on the floor of your best friend's furnitureless apartment, maybe feeling up that chubby but cute girl whose been sending you messages on Friendster. But you're not back in college, you're middle-aged and sitting at your computer looking to download a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game to play because THIS IS WHAT YOUR LIFE HAS LED TO: FILLING YOUR MINUTES WITH DISTRACTIONS TO PAD OUT THE HOURS BETWEEN THE TIMES YOU GET TO SLEEP.\n\nSo you download Blade Symphony, thinking that you'll get to relive the awesomeness that you felt when you first became a Jedi in Star Wars: Jedi Warrior Jedi Academy. And you know what? You do relive that awesomeness.\n\nFor fifteen or twenty minutes, anyway. Then it dawns on you why first/third person swordfighting games always devolve into these super-serious multiplayer servers with very strict rules and Bushido codes where the admins kick anybody who doesn't stick to 1v1s. That reason is because only 15 year olds enjoy playing on a server where it's a free for all and everybody just runs around whaling on everybody else, and you can only be fifteen for so long. Eventually you have to either quit the game and play something more engaging, or you have to join one of these tryhard swordfighter servers to breathe fresh life into the game.\n\nI give this game a thumbs up because for those first fifteen minutes I didn't feel like a middle-aged man playing ♥♥♥♥ing video games on a Friday night in my tiny loft apartment.","February 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 163 of 195 people (84%) found this review helpful 180 people found this review funny","84","163","195","180","16"

Even after the issue was fixed, they used the achievement to make a joke out of the entire issue, which was a very real one and bugged out hundreds of players profiles for over a year. This says a lot about the team's professionalism (or lack thereof) and their attitude towards paying customers.\n\nThen there were the times the development team used their company twitter and facebook accounts to insult players they didn't like or that made critiques of some of the mechanics, trolled players on their own forums and edited posts of players they didn't like to make fun of them using forum mod powers, this list could go on for a while but I'll just include a few quotes from their team and sum it up by saying their conduct has often been very unprofessional, immature, rude, insulting, childish and offensive.\n\nThis style of conduct along with poor market research is why their company has since had to close its office due to lack of sales revenue and why all of their staff has been laid off.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n"Hello there!

Put simply this game takes a lot of skill and quite some time to learn, but once you do it can keep you sitting still for hours. You have 5 swords and 5 characters, you pick a sword and a character and then start playing. All of those do different things and YOU as a player might benefit from different elements, so try a bit of everything to find out what's best for you, then play that for a long time and develope your own personal playstyle.\n\nGraphics are avarage, if not slightly below avarage. Some character faces are really weard. 5/10\n\nSound effects are not beautiful to listen to, but they are obvious and instantly tells you what's happening even if you aren't paying attention or seeing what's happening. 5/10\n\nMusic is just good and matches the character and map design. It brings you a feeling that is signature to this game. 7/10\n\nCombat system is very good and might be what makes fights in Blade Symphony so entertaining. Blade Symphony has this rock paper scissor system, which means some attacks beats others when they meet, also charging and things that are unique to some swords are also very fun and makes you think a bit more of what you pick. 10/10\n\nAlthough this game is not always so impressive at first sight, it keeps you entertained in the length, and you always keep learning and getting better even when your playtime hits the roof. This is my favorite game of all time due to not only the time spent but the moments I were given and friends I met, along with difficult fights and teaching newer players in game a thing or two.\n\nLASER OUT ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)!","January 18, 2015","true","851.9"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","63","76","15","11"

The game is really well built, its a solid game what can I say, sure the animations could use more work but it is very structurally sound, meaning it's perfect for a fighting game.\n\nIts pretty damn balanced, meaning people will always find different things to ♥♥♥♥♥ about rather than uniteing over something being over-powered. Yeah people will agree that vanguard and longsword is overpowered, but after that it seems like free reign.\n\nSo what's  my point? Well my point is, if you don't like a hardcore competitive nature in a game, then this is not for you. Hell at first I didn't like blade symphony untill I invested 10 hours into it, then it became like crack cocaine. It is not a game where you can cheese your way to victory over the best players, you have to actually improve at the game meaning that something that works again lesser skilled players doesn't work against the best.\n\nThe game has a pretty weird learning curve, I feel like at first it is not steep at all because your like "O boy this oak doesn't know what's comeing with my N1 heavy left and right phalanx play" but after that it is very steep once you realise that playstyle isn't a very viable way to play the game. So listen here buddy boy it gets harder, but I know you can pull through it, just like you pulled through reading this much bull-crap that doesn't matter. After you get over that and you realise that judge is the best charecter obviously and every other one is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, then you start haveing some real fun and you can dish out your e-peen among skeleton and zeo and watch them strip you bare and cold in the russian winter.\n\nSo what is my actual point, well, it's a game for people who want to be competitive in a pretty balanced game. You have to roll with the punches baby boy.\n\nThe reason I'm not reviewing the game so much as reviewing you is because this is simply one of the best games I have ever have the pleasure of playing, it is a gem covered in dirt in the middle of a secret ravine full of bipolar neckbeards. There are flaws but they are only apparent when you just start playing, as you play more and more you start to see it as this holy image of a perfect game.\n\nThe reason I see it like this is because it is just so damn solid overall, you have different ways of playing different charecters and you can try and make your way work. It is rage enduseing but in the good kind of way I guess. There are different sword types, attack paterns, since it's 3D you have different ways people manuver creating very interesting gameplay.\n\nSo to conclude this great speech of nothingness I guess it's up to you if you want to buy this game or not, hell I don't know if you will like it. You can take my word but I'm probably wrong maybe, if you tried this game and didn't like it, come back and give it a second chance please, it truly is a game that the community makes, and even with a small community it still is fun. Buy the game if you havn't right now its 9$, 200 hours is worth that money any day.\n\ntl;dr: Me and zeo are actually secret lovers in a alternate reality","December 20, 2014","true","304.6"," 77 of 100 people (77%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","77","77","100","24","4"

A lot of people compare the combat to Dark Souls and Soul Calibur but I really don't see the resemblance. It also sounds like it's inspired a fair bit by the Jedi Knight games, but i've never played those. You can live all your dreams of pointed and sharp weapons, from poking someone in the eye to cutting their shin. One of the best parts is that not all weapons are pointed and sharp, thanks to Steam Workshop integration.

Stance changing should be done away with and replaced with dedicated light/med/heavy buttons.\n\nAdvertised breadth of fighting styles is exaggerated as only a few are viable, with the majority of them involving mashing M1 with a good deal of jumping around since the dodge mechanics are unreliable.\n\nHit detection is often suspect, as you will find yourself tapping your opponent with your sword and not being granted a hit as their sword registers before coming close to you. Air juggling opponents as you attack below their feet is common. You will be left wondering how your opponent hits you or you them, which leads to another point--\n\nThe system itself has many bugs that the veteran players pass off as actual systems, then abuse. Things like preforming an air attack right as you land will send certain classes gliding across the ground, and  grab attacks that skip animation frames thus not allowing a counter.\n\nA good way to judge the competitiveness of a game is how consistent it is, and this is BS's biggest let down. You will see high ranked players loosing to new players often enough to realize that strategy doesn't mean as much as you would hope, unless the tactic happens to be spam m1 between light and medium stances while hopping around with a quick class, or charging attacks and jumping toward your opponent to fire them off as the heavy class.\n\nUnlockables are cosmetic. A good choice for a game that presents itself as competitive.\n\nArt style is whatever. A mix of Asian and future punk.\n\nGame is still in development, so community is extremely small.\n\nBeing in development, all the negatives of this review might eventually be ironed out. However, with the dev time coming up on 2+ years, I don't hold out much hope. I can see its release being met with little recognition and quickly fading back into the Lobby-With-Side-Minigame that it is now.\n\nIn short, it tries to put forth a competitive ideal but the result ends up feeling shallow and often times random or unfair. If you are a fan of competitive fighting games (or even action games like Ninja Gaiden or DMC), you will quickly get annoyed with how loose the game feels and its inconsistencies. If you want to swing weightless, occasionally incorporeal swords at other people while hopping around, this might be a game for you.","December 5, 2013","false","26.9"," 156 of 261 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","156","261","0","9"

The community is great, the gameplay is fun, and the characters are diverse.\n\nThe problems?\n\nThere is a huge lack of players in Blade. New players are always welcomed, but they wont have an easy time. If you're new and trying to get into the game, you will be destroyed over and over, for hours on end, until you eventually start to get good enough to compete with the community that's left in the game.\n\nThere are five different classes in the game to choose from:\n\nThe Judge\nThe Phalanx\nThe Ryoku\nThe Pure\nThe Vanguard\n\nEach of them have their own pros and cons, and learning how to play your selected class will take a lot of time. There are a multitude of sword types in the game and they all offer their own benefits, so learning which one is best for you is key when working on your class.\n\nThe game works off of a ranking system:\n\nOak\nIron\nSteel\nDiamond\nMaster\n\nYou get promoted through the leagues by beating opponents of your league. This isn't a great ranking system, as you could be an oak leaguer who consistently beats masters, yet gains no elo points so you dont progress; you would need to wait until an oak leaguer faces you and then defeat him to advance for instance.\n\nThe game will test your ability in every fight. You will have masters who have over a thousand hours and they will beat you over and over, but you'll take a lesson in each fight and those lessons will eventually shape how you play the game.\n\nIf you're willing to put in enough time to learn how to compete against the majority of the players who are still on Blade, then this game is very rewarding and very fun. There are a lot of players who are interested in teaching newcomers, and the community in general is very nice and are a lot of fun. However, if you don't want to lose over and over again whilst you learn the game, then this game isnt for you.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10. There are issues with the gameplay such as dodgy tracers sometimes and ping can play a large part in the combat, but the game has an amazing community and the game itself is a lot of fun if you invest enough time into it. I reccomend bringing in a friend with you if you want to buy the game to not be completely alone whilst you learn.","April 15, 2015","true","479.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","0"

Note that not all fights will give you points in ranking, 2v2 and 2v1 matches where all players have the same rank won't give any points at all, but they give notes, however I wouldn't recommened 2v2 cause is god damn tedious fighting 2 people at the same time while they spam attacks and your team mate isn't doing anything or is already dead. At the same time 2v2 is pretty good if you want to fight someone your level without losing elo/ranking\n- Alot of players are pretty cool and willing to help you out, also the ryoku clan mentors are pretty useful for many people young and old (not just for ryoku players it's just a name)\n- Somehow has become a weeb game, even vanguard starts speaking japanese all of a sudden\n- Sprays, ez anime boobs ingame\n- A lot of people are trying to bring the community together\n- Hidden code of honour (Bowing, GG GF WP, no shurikens when starting, etc.)\n- Nobody really knows how good you actually are. The elo ranking system turns the ranks into leaderboards rather than seperating players by skill, so it's pretty fun to go defeat new masters who think they are good\n- You can only buy cosmetic items in the customization menu, no items that give you an advantage\n- fug4life (the life force of blade symphony)\n\nCons\n- Vanguards who spam (idk why they aren't less spammable nowadays, it's insane)\n- It's frustrating to get on the right track especially when you don't have a mentor or someone(/thing?) similar\n- If your ping is too high then the game is f*cked up (grabbing from 10m away, you can't hit anybody, random damage done to you) if you are under 100 ping it should be fine\n- Empty community most of the time (When there is a sale of some sort there are tons for some reason, so play during sales if you want to play with tons of people)\n- Spamming gets you up the ranking system pretty fast\n- Not many servers and most are for FFA and Duel, never get to play on many others with good ping (unless you're in EU or NA)\n- Some characters make a real good fit that it's pretty easy to rank up with them (Rapier & Phalanx, Rapier & Vanguard) they also are really hard to beat sometimes, I'd see this mostly being trouble for new players\n- Players learn more through playing random matches at first than through the tutorial, never got to finish the tutorial myself. It approaches you with a very technical mindset, but for someone who just bought the game trying to have fun you're better off learning by going into FFA to duel people, trying new things out, and asking people how stuff work\n- People on the forums who complain that the game is dead but don't actually play the game\n- There isn't that much new content in each update, however I do believe that this could be for the best considering most people find tons of reasons to hate on new characters\n- If you stop playing for several days it's painful to get back to your original skill level (cries)\n\nWhile said in Cons that spamming gets you up the ranking system pretty fast, alot of people can get stuck between Diamond and Master. When you get Diamond the first time don't expect to keep it too long as there is a massive skill gap between players when you reach Diamond. If you're lucky you'll focus less on ranking up and instead actually getting better.\n\nAdditionally the game gets very technical sometimes, reading up the patch notes is a good idea if you want to improve your techniques/tactics/whatever. Sadly you can't 1 hit with a katana anymore ;^)\n\nSo, this game is pretty good gameplay wise, and there aren't that many issues if you enjoy the game like me, vanguard is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ when abused, but there are some players that respectably use her. I'd say that this is game is the best game at the moment for people who want to play a sword-fighting game that requires real skill. It really gives you a feel of improvement everytime you beat someone through hard work and training.

There are four current classes with more on the way, and a handful of different weapons and variations on their appearances, including a diverse variety of steam workshop items, which is always a plus.\n\nThe game is quite enjoyable when you can find equal tiered players on the same level as you, where you can play the game in relative ease of mind, but there is a darker side to Blade Symphony, and that is its community of "veteran" players. So unfortunately, this is a game that I cannot recommend to those interested in getting into a dueling game, unless you have incredibly thick skin.\n\nThe community in this game, is in fact, not "great" as some of the highly ranked players have posted. If you check their steam names on the official Blade Symphony website, you'll see where they measure on the ladder and whether or not you can believe a word they say. The vast majority of the veteran players in this community are rude, immature, and generally disrespectful to new users. So its like any other game then, is what you're thinking.\n\nAnd it is, sadly, this is what competitive gaming has become. Its nothing more than a festival of higher ups telling you how bad you are. This is something the devs need to regulate, because when it comes to admins on the official servers, there are none from what I've seen. Players can get away with the worst kind of behavior, and harassment of new players with great ease.\n\nNow the short version: If you want a good fighting game with a good community, stay away from Blade Symphony. The game itself is good, but the community will leave you wanting to uninstall the game from their relentless immaturity, and rudeness.","July 24, 2014","false","29.3"," 42 of 67 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","42","67","0","0"

Why the game is bad results in the characters, the duels, and the ranks/ladder. The characters are bland, and can be even claimed as "generic". All of them have the ability spam their fast combo, which is what 75% of the community does anyway.\n\nAll the characters have different play styles, which might sound good but they're all just awfully cheap. Pure is all about strafing their attacks in a sideways direction to hit. Ryouko is spin/spam to win. Phalnax is pure fast combo poking spam with a little bit of timing. Judge is timing, and heavy damage spamming with the balanced combo. Each is used in a cheap way, which makes the experience of the game unrealistic and frustrating.\n\nThe Duels are not smooth at all, considering the cheesy animations and the constant spam. To win, its basically who can spam faster. All duesl are the same, as no one uses wall jumping or parkour in general for an advantage, and you're even looked down on by the annoying community.\n\nThe ranks and ladder system is sad after this new update. I have gotten to a master rank after 24 hours of gameplay. Tells you how easy it is to get to the top, and when you get there it would probably lead to boredom. You dont gain a sense of achievement, as many other players just aren't good, and they somehow gain high ranks (possibly through spamming)\n\nTo end off, all talk about the community. Generally, most people will cry when a fight is won, or the claim "gg" which is completely fine. Its a 50 - 50 ratio between the two, which is not too bad. The worst part of the community is their maturity. I generally go on and theres plenty of mic spammers, and people who cry about it and don't realize theres a mute button, which might be the only useful thing on the interface. Another person you will find, is, "The Master". These people roleplay as a super good samurai otaku weeaboo, or they'll act rude and type during a match things like "kek did you think that would work" and then spam you to death with a pure strafing move. Overall, it's a circlejerk of scrub-tard roleplayers and spammers.\n\nTL;DR: Dont buy the game, unless on sale. Bad community, bad characters, bad game.","May 14, 2014","false","31.7"," 87 of 154 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","87","154","0","7"

At least, I hope so. If you're really, really into sword fighting games, you might like this game, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. So far, this game kept getting slower and slower. For example, you used to be able to jump high into the air and, even though it wasn't very polished yet, it did have a lot of potential. But now they made it so that you're barely able to jump over a curb anymore.\n\nOkay, I get that that's just one of my preferences and there are probably some people who actually prefer jumping to be almost completely removed, except for triggering Air attacks, but there's a better reason for not playing this game: It has NO singleplayer mode (nor multiplayer PvE of any kind), which means that it's exclusively PvP. The problem is that there's just barely anybody to actually play against. You can literally run this game, check the server list, and see a maximum of about 11 people playing. On the same server. Which might be an American server too. Which isn't a very good thing if you're in Europe yourself. This game just doesn't get advertised, enough. It sometimes does have a small amount of people playing it, like right after the game goes on sale, but eventually people keep leaving and leaving until it's just the same handful of people who still play it consistently.\n\n\nMy conclusion:\n\nIf you're really into a game that exclusively offers you PvP sword fighting (with a little bit of dress up) and you don't care about any additional content, you might enjoy playing it for a while.\n\nIf you're just "curious" or think it "might be interesting" to you, I wouldn't recommend it, even if it's solely because of the almost non-existent player base.\n\n(On a side note: I don't hate the developers of this game. I don't know that much about them, but they appear to be friendly people who really do care about their small playerbase, and even host small, official tournaments every now and then, with a unique item reward.

The only supposed way to do it turned was apparently going into settings, controls and enabling the dev console, just to play the game.\n\nIn the end, steam invites do not work, these console commands did not work, probably because of a lack of port support. Give it a miss if you and a friend want to have fun, this multiplayer only works once upon every alignment of the planets and lots of port and costomizing work. Official servers are also gone, so are achievements.","June 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","29","49","5","4"

It's not the type of (sword) fighting game that I had expected or hoped for.  The game does not force players to face each other and fight like traditional fighting games do. Instead it gives you free range of movement around the environment like a FPS game. And because it controls like a FPS and not a fighting game I have to spend more time trying to keep my opponent in my feild of view than I do actually fighting him. It makes me dizzy and frustrated. I am a fan of fighting games, and third-person perspective action games, but I think this game would only really appeal to fans of competitive FPS games.  I really wish there was a demo of this game available, or at least a more in-depth description of how it's played. I was looking forward to this game, and I really wanted to like it, but it's not a game that will appeal to fans of traditional 2D or 3D fighting games, and ultimately I feel disappointed.\n\nI'm sure this game will appeal to many people, unfortunately I am not one of them.\n\nWhat else can I say about this game....\nThe graphics and animations are fairly good, but the ability to customize and individualize your character are very limited. You can use an xbox 360 gamepad to play the game, but you'll be at a disadvantage to the keyboard/mouse players.\n\nEDIT - In conclusion:\ncall it what you want, but it's NOT a fighting game.  It's a bunch of people running around in circles hoping to slash an opponent as they go by. The actual gameplay looks very little like the videos on the store page, and it does not resemble a real fight in any way. Its not tactical sword fighting, it's a frenzied arcade hack-n-slash with frustratingly wild camera movements to go along with odd hit-detection and unintuitive controls. The four playable characters are as lame as they are limited, and the different skins available do not do much to help individualize your character. The servers are filled with identical characters running around in circles like flies hovering around a turd.","May 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","27","46","0","7"

Tutorial teaches you the basics but the game has quite a deep combat system that will undoubtedly take a lot of practice to truly master. Combat has moments of slow and fast-paced action, with the focus of the game being around 1v1 and 2v2 dueling, as well as a FFA mode which is good for beginners. Each weapon and each character has its own style of fighting and combat is very direction-based.  It requires strategy, thought and observation if you want to be great at it. The game's graphics are very nice and animation quality is top-notch. You can do a lot of very cool moves, from wall-running and jumping to combos and power attacks. There is a lot of room for community input, along with steam workshop integration. You can customise your characters and unlock various cosmetic skins for both weapons and armour.","October 19, 2014","true","19.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/225600/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","953 products in account","When I first saw Blade Symphony on the Steam Store’s featured page, it was an Early Access title. It looked interesting to me, and I thought about purchasing it. But at the time, I spent that money on DayZ instead, also an Early Access title. DayZ held much more interest to me than Blade Symphony. However, now that this game has been fully released with an Original Soundtrack, and after playing it for a while, I regret I didn't spend that money on Blade Symphony. Some, probably most, will find it unfair since this is the full release of Blade Symphony and DayZ is still in Early Access. But the truth is, you can barely compare the two games because they share very few things in common anyway.\n\nBlade Symphony is a third-person PVP melee combat game, with skill-orientated swordfighting. It takes place in a universe called Berimbau, its history stretches back “thousands of years, to a handful of warring clans that ultimately came to peace terms and unified under a single flag: The Black Rose." There’s more story, which is why I’m hoping for a possible campaign down the road. If you want to know more story look it up or buy the game with the OST.\n\nThe player has four stances during combat: Fast, Balanced, Heavy, and Air (when one jumps). Each stance has different types of attacks/sword strokes, and one can use even more using the movement keys while attacking at the same time, like slashing to the sides. There is also a Rock-Paper-Scissors system for parrying (parrying occurs when blades collide as they’re both being swung at the same time), Heavy stance is beat in parry by the Air stance, Balanced stance is beat in parry by Heavy stance, Fast stance is beat in parry by Balanced stance, and Air stance is beat in parry by Fast stance. If both stances are the same, they both cancel out. You can switch stances mid-combo and produce a unique combination of attacks as well. The character can run, strafe, dash (includes power-dash), roll, and wall-walking/wall flips (parkour). With all this combined, the game requires skill and tactical thought. It is not an easy game to play, and there are very good players out there. You need to pay attention and you need to be quick, timing is everything. The four classes at your disposal all have unique traits and moves, choose wisely: Phalanx, the one who lunges and thrusts, fencing style. He can close in quickly and has great reach. Judgement, the one who has thick metal armour and prefers big swings. He is slow, but can take hits that would normally greatly damage other classes and he hits harder than a bulldoser. Ryoku, the one who uses rhythm and breakdancing to fight in a unique way. He moves around erratically confusing his opponents, and hits fast and quickly (pretty strong hits too). And last but surely not least, Pure, the one who is heavily influenced by Chinese Wushu, an acrobatic exhibition and full-contact sport derived from traditional martial arts. She can make use of her acrobatics to move past an enemy’s defense and strike fluidly.\n\nNow let’s talk graphics. This game is extremely beautiful. The sword models were the first thing that caught my eye after launching the game, with awesome shots of swords and swordsmen up close and wide all over the home screen. I am satisfied with the texture’s resolutions on everything in the game. The character models are also very well modeled. The maps are rendered wonderfully, some being fairly big and mildly-explorable in their own right. The particle effects while fighting are bright, but subtle, and they fade away as fast as they appear which makes the fights look nicer and better overall. The developers did a good job optimizing the game as well, I can max out the graphical settings on my humble gaming laptop and it runs perfectly. Oh btw, spectating on a duel is a sight to behold.\n\nThen there is the game’s Original Soundtrack, which is, in my opinion, one of the better video game soundtracks I’ve heard. It has a traditional Japanese/Chinese mood to it, but there is hints of western influence in there, as well as more modern sounds like EDM. The OST comes with a text file that expresses the fact that the game’s story is not told through the gameplay, “Who are these sword-wielding badasses and why are they killing each other through Asian temples, European courtyards, or city-streets?” says the credits and thanks.txt file, the album implicitly tells this story, which I briefly explained in the second paragraph.\n\nThe game also offers its share of customization, with unlockable cosmetics such as masks and capes. One can also change the default colours of the character model. The game is also a part of Steam Workshop, so people can make their own swords and add to the 25+ swords that the game already has in store for you to use. I don’t think there’s a lack of variety at all, you’re able to customize a character enough to make it your own. And if one is part of a private server, the customization to the whole game is nearly endless.\n\nThe game is fun, challenging, and beautiful. It is 100% worth the purchase.","May 20, 2014","true","41.4"," 53 of 96 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","53","96","0","0"

And finally there are different sword types that match up with the combo/class of your choosing.\n\nThe game itself is unique however the only flaw to it was the community.\nIn my past experience with the game I came across some really rude, but some polite users. The rude ones would kill you on sight, while some may argue it's Free for all I cant still say it's a dueling game is it not? Besides they have an dueling option and when you see two friends together they kill you on sight because they don't want to be bugged even though you're just passing through.\n\nThe game itself can be fun at times but it's also filled with players who are going to take it very seriously and most of the time you will get destroyed unless you train a lot in training.\n\nBut as it stands currently with some over-powered combinations I cannot recommend, I will update this review as the game continues to update.\n\n(And to all of you fans of this game out there, hate on this review all you want.

(Honestly best!)\n+Legitimately skillful (supposing you dont have higher than 60 ms ping) gameplay revolving around your reaction times, planning, strategy, and ability to think on your fingers.\n+Custom servers with unique content enabled change the design of the game, lowgrav makes aircombos (with some ground stances) available midair, creating more intricate and unique ways of play, though lowgrav is dead now.\n+Character combos are honestly as depthy as it can get, and unless you're fighting a one trick pony, you will need to adapt and switch into different tactics to win the fight, I garuntee it, boss!\n\nThe sad cons, that we should all understand are NOT REALLY THE DEVELOPER'S FAULT\n\n-It sometimes feels like you might be the one and only person who plays this game.\n-If you are easily stressed/find yourself mad a lot, this game will make you angry. You will lose a lot, it is to be expected.\n-Weapon types are somewhat lacking, and should change more than just damage values, interval rates, and such. I always feel as though the katana is useless, scimitar is hyper situational, Jian is for pure, and only longsword/rapier work out in the end for stable gameplay. If you're like me and you fashion souls, you wont worry, and will just have a beautiful tool swinging at those nasty little runts!\n-Perhaps a hidden ranking system, or the ability to not show your rank on some servers. Its jarring when you're oak/iron, and all you see is masters, because you dont want to lose, its a possible reason why our community is so small.\n-Community is TINY. Even on our recent peaks, we will only see around 100 people at most on servers, whereas mostly its 20-10, its that bad. However, whoever is there is strangely always someone different.\n-Any lag whatsoever kills the fidelity of the game, on either end. No matter which side is lagging, you're going to lose, because for some reason, this game cannot handle even the minutest change in ping, you will notice that your parries are useless, your gaurd always broken, your back always being stabbed, ranged always hitting, lights parrying balanced, and worst of all, they will almost always disappear when you swing. Its bad, its so bad, but its source, and thats source's horrid issue, best you can do is hope to lead where they're going and always use light/air to keep quick.\n\nSome nitpicky issues now.\n-Characters are all asian, its the game's design style, but its just edgy and silly, boss.\n-(Weapon) feels weak unless used on (character), every type, every character.\n-Weapons should be better diversified, and the ability to possibly use a customized, point based weapon type with the only change being a skin might actually seem better than the current system. For example...\n\n---\nLets say, you just want to make a sword thats good for comboing. You have around 100 points to spam into various attributes, those attributes could be divided into some divisions like\n\nBase damage\nSide damage\nAir damage\nCombo interval\nCombo speed\nCan guard/(whatever rapier's gaurd is)/Feint/no gaurd (for increased points or easier charge)\nCharge speed/damage mods\n\nWhile veterans of the community are K with what we have, this change would bring more uniquity to the gameplay as less cut and paste styles would be present. We're looking at you, JianPure/ScimitarPhalanx.\n\nImagine if you could make a multihit wrecking sword for disorienting and winning through attrition, or a TRUE CHAOS FLAME +5 ZWEIHANDER FOR MAXIMUM BASE CANNON! Or a faster swinging but weaker hitting wep to make Ryoku actually viable and not countered by moving left slightly.\n...\nOr we could just have less cut and paste weapon types.\n\nIt might even be a rad idea, to do something like this with characters, mixing and matching combo patterns to weave your own intricate web of butt-touchingly awesome combos that will make everyone on the server mad!\n---\nOverall, its a great game, boss! But it has its flaws, and they can get a little jarring if you're not very prepared to face them. I think if more people played it, more love would be seen all around, while I would prefer to see the game change drastically, most people don't and are comfortable with what we have, but I feel that appropriate changes would see a more unique crowd enter to join in on our fun.\n\nIts a 9/10 game with a 11/10 community, funny goodhearted people, though few as they be.\n\nNow get the heck out of my inn, boss!","April 17, 2015","true","34.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm a fencer in real-life, so that coupled with the screenshots and trailer led me to have some high expectations for Blade Symphony.  The premise is strong, but it's executed very poorly, surprisingly.\n\nThe servers are usually unpopulated, and lag is persistent.  Yes, I've tried all the usual tricks to negate as much lag time as possible.  It did not change the result.  What follows is spotty hit detection and unexpected deaths.\n\nThe combat isn't simply hack'n'slash; it's more profund than that.  However, I learned the best path to vicotry involved that line of strategy....\n\nThe game is also very unforgiving to beginners.  I understand I'm a noob, but after ~100 duels, I can count on one hand how many of them I've won. I "am" going to blame the lag here, because I "know" I'm not THAT bad.  The customization doesn't come to the rescue because you have to win to attain a decent amount of points to unlock anything of value.  In my four hours of recorded playtime, I unlocked only one thing with my accumulation of the game's currency.\n\nOverall, this adds up to playing the same people, getting your tail handed to you repeatedly, usually in a very inexplicable manner, and rarely changing your outfit to fit your playstyle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiles_/recommended/225600/","Smiles_","Big Boss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiles_/","76 products in account","At one point I was into this game, edging on Tryhard. It was an amazing game. I put very much emphasis on WAS.\nDuring the winter sale a year or two back I purchased this "unique" title, I was nervous and hoping for a new game I could play for hours on end without getting bored and this caught my eye.\n\nBlade Symphony; or BS for its shorter possibly literal term, was the game that occupied much of my time.\nAs any gamer I was raring to go, but stopped as I played the Turtorial to grasp the basics. Only to be thoroughly confused at the poor quality of the walkthrough. Regardless I pushed on, ignoring the poor walkthrough eager to test my mettle against other players, which I did. Over and over I lost, and sometimes won by learning the ways of the game on the fly or browsing YouTube for the in-depth explanations of mechanics and gameplay that the game so thoroughly lacked. But I knew that I wouldn't win right off the bat, not without much, MUCH practice and failure.\n\nThis game is not for the easily disuaded. For you will be deterred by the complexity of the game, and even the most smallest of mechanics will be difficult to grasp. Unless you persevere and learn by trial and error for sometimes the longest of times as I and other have. The learning curve is immense and only those who want to succeed, will.\n\nMonths had past, and I had become regular on BS. Frequently I would marvel at new ways to play, new tips and tricks that gave me that edge in a time of need. Or playing with new-made friends, enjoying the time spent together.\nBut this is a community that is rancid with poison and toxic behaviors. People acting like immature internet teenagers, threats, put-downs, and flatout hostility is a common thing. Browse the forums, look to the past as they do not, and learn from it, as they most certainly do not.\n\nSo I left BS, only to return having heard that changes were made a few months after my departure. Only to see that the game I had enjoyed to an extent, was rendered virtually garbage in my eyes. Nothing had changed, things weren't better. The game wasn't balanced as it should, and it never was. Nor will it EVER be if appropriate steps are taken.\nListen to your fellow gamers "Balance Team", nothing will change for the better if you lock everyone out or cover your ears to reason or possible ideas...\n\nI cherish the time I spent there and I always will, but it is clouded by memories of frustration and forced ignorance towards sour behavior.\n\nOverall Summary:\n\nGameplay - Fun at first, Interesting and unfinished, repetitive reletively soon and difficult as Hell if you aren't committed.\nCommunity - Terrible. Aside from the few who aren't. You know who you are :)\nDevelopers - Learning, as all should. But never act /  learn enough with / from the knowledge given.\n\nThey say BS is a niche game, well its a fairly small niche I'll give you that.\n\nThis is not the game for casual's. This is an unfinished game that shouldn't have left Early Access; most likely farther back than that, which needs serious work if its gonna reel me back in.\nI bid you farewell Blade Symphony, it was at first a grand pleasure. But now I'm not so sure... Debate if you will it so, but my views stand, regardless of its harshness.","October 3, 2014","false","339.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It advertises different weapons, which is great, but really it boils down to button mashing. Only certain weapons can block, while others have a "feint" (such as the katana). Feinting seems like a good premise... But it's has no leverage in a fight. The only thing it will do from my experience is cancel your attack, and let your opponent hit you.\n\nBesides the 1v1 duels, the game doesn't have much else going for it. With a gameplay design with light/med/heavy attacks, reminescent of Jedi Academy, I'd rather play that game from ages ago than this one.

It revolved around movement, spacing and combos. The developers apparently didn't want the game to go in that direction. With each patch they've ruined the gameplay more and more. The movement options are now terrible, moves that should combo, do not, and the balancing of the game is awful. Defensive options are too strong and which makes offense too much of a chore.

It was fun to play a fighting game that, unlike mortal kombat (in example), did not require me to learn 80 buttons to do 1 move. So I will start with the positives. (long review I know, sorry, if anyone feels these are false please feel free to state your opinion. But this is how The game seems to me and many people I have heard in game) PS summary at the end  (not very detailed but just my opinion on genral aspects I feel are flawed and my suggestion on whether or not to purchase the game)\n\n-Characters to fit the individual. Characters have their own fighting styles which players can choose from to what they feel is right for them.\n-Sword types that have their own unique properties which can be used to enhance a characters abilities depending on their match.\n-Steam worshop for custom sword skins, because it's nice to have a good-looking sword along with a custom helmet.\n-Easy to learn combat system- It is nice that opposed to pressing 2 buttons on each side of your keyboard, you just switch between 3 stances and attack while moving in one direction standard wasd and left mouse click. Easy and effective.\n\nNow the negatives.\n-FPS: not a problem for a while, but Many people start to have extreme fps drop and lag after playing for a certain amount of time. In my case i start to lag every 10 minutes, in which case I need to close it and restart steam to fix. Then it will be perfect again, not time consuming but bothersome.\n-Character moves... Remember how I said characters are unique and fitted for different individuals, well that's a nice concept. If they were not so annoyingly over powered. The character Phalanx can attack at extreme distances that cannot be escaped and are hard to manuveur against, the character judgement can kill in 1-3 hits, Ryo (op as well but hes my character so my word is biased), Pure... not often complained about.\n-Prior to certain updates some characters had extreme strenghts when people started complaining an update was made that bumped up every character... except Ryo  (downgraded since he was the most complained about)\n-Horrible parry system as of now. If an enemy attacks and is finished, but still has his sword touching the floor and you jump attack him/her you will be stunned because of the tracers left behind.\n-Community: okay for the most part many people of high rank always like to talk down to those below them. I Earlier the players were much more helpful and wanted newbies to get better. Not really the case anymore...\n-ALT-TABS I love this feature taking initeative. This game for me and many other people who have said it in game, always alt tabs for no reason and it always takes like 10 seconds to come back (in which case your most likely dead because the community is full of people who like to attack you while typing, or alt tabbed[maybe an accident but i doubt one who runs away then attacks when you stop moving is mistaken...])\n-one glitch in city map where you get stuck if on certain side of the rooftop.\n-Community friendly chat. People are nice to talk to but the conversations are 50% of the time just about how 1 character is too op (then in another server youll hear the exact opposite.) other 50% communit can be quite friendly.\n\nSummary:\nBlade Symphony is a game with great potential and can be a fun game. Ranking system should be, perhaps, more complex as it is to plain to be accurate. The characters are lacking balance and makes the game more about picking a character for each fight as opposed to allowing the individual to progress with the character they like the most. fps issue and certain bugs must be dealt with. Overall broken combat system makes this game less and less realistic as a fighting game (in that I mean this game is currently all about jumping and running around) to include the aweful parrying system and poor tracer effects. Perhaps a game I would suggest to buy on sale as I do hope that the devs will fix these issues in which case I feel this game could be very good. But I would not purchase it at full price. Other reviews may say otherwise but before wasting your money I hope you will take in consideration and actually think about the fact that onky 30-70 people actually play this game still.. (no understatement.)

The entire game / content can be absorbed in about 15 minutes, as there are only a few playable characters and moves are simply combinations of other moves. If you have a group of hard-core fighting game friends you may still be bored out of your mind after a few play sessions, as there is simply not enough things to do to keep playing the game. To compare, Soul Calibur has 20+ characters each with dozens of unique moves.\n\nTo make matters worse the game is entirely multiplayer. There is absolutely no single player content or anything to do by yourself. The "practice" mode is not even helpful. Compare to Soul Calibur, you have multiple modes ot try things out and learn against AI opponents. This game gives you one randomly spawned AI character.\n\nBeing only multiplayer means you will be subject to ping issues, trolls, server disconnect/lag, and in general you will find yourself spending a lot of time watching other people fight, finding maps, or swtiching between levels. A common session is start playing, join a server, then wait for a while to play.

That being said, it is extremely complex varying between 5 different characters with 3 (or 4) stances/movesets, 5 unique weapons, and a specific playstyle for each individual. No matter how you come about this game, your form of strategy will ultimately be true to you by the end of the match. Bringing with it, a "rock, paper, scissors!" attitude to a 3-D sword game involving finesse and aim, Blade Symphony can quickly turn into a game of wits rather than strats.\n\nWhile being competetive is quite viable, the intense steep learning curve set by "vets" and new players whom find arguably cheap strategies can make this "multiplayer only" game seemingly unfair. If your looking for a special community, don't get your hopes up too high. While there is a significant number of players who are amiable and didactic, the majority (in my eyes) are complacent and pugnacious individuals who will always find excuses rather than a solution in fighting you. Take this community with a grain of salt. The "devs" had walked out quite some time ago due to controversial aspects of the game (as so its said); however they are seemingly making a return. Despite all this, if you invest 10+ hours into this game, you will more than likely develop a sort of crack addiction that can make Lindsey Lohan's meth induced third chin flinch. As you've seen from other reviewers, they range from 2.1 hrs. saying "dat waz coo" to 360420 hrs. in dog years going "IF THIS WAS WORTH 500 DOLLARS ON UPLAY, I WOULD TRADE IN ONE AND A HALF NIPPLES, MY COLLEGE BOOKS, A PINT OF VIRGIN BLOOD, AND A YEARS SUPPLY OF KRISPY KREME ♥♥♥♥ MUFFINS TO PLAY THIS AGAIN.\n\nA truly unique game made the Source engine by some guys who love gaming and gaming communities. If you boil down hard enough, this can swiftly take its place in your favourites list for its competitive aspects, as well as casual. Although, a "casual" will most likely be overwhelmed by the learning curve; intricacy of strategies, tactics, and finesse; and uninviting, seasoned players. Whether its on sale or not, I'd say its a must have for a more hardy and experienced gamer for this (like Dark Souls hard, etc). This game will make you rage. You will win some, and lose some more. You will lose matches against players who sound like elmo with a dependency on heroine and an obscene amount of gaddamn tylenol where you would rather twist your left nut by gluing it to the bottom of a weed-wacker than lose to them again. I'm going to begin my second round of the game with Nyquil, so if I think sleep is the name of another player in the game who I have to beat before my stomach caves in and eats itself, I'll end up sleeping anyway.\n\nGet the Folgers and Monster combo drink ready.

Devs promised me exciting fights, exhausting duels, a lot of skill-based gameplay and... I got it.\n\nFor those who didn't really fall for lightsaber dueling or don't think Star Wars Universe has anything to do with Blade Symphony I'm gonna try and convince you to this game without any further comparisions to my favorite franchise.\n\nThe whole idea of this game is to create a competitive environment for players to duel with various melee weapons (but really mostly swords and such). The goal was to make it pleasurable, fast, dynamic while keeping it more advanced/difficult than just your average arcade game in TPP where you hack and slash your way to victory.\n\nIt's a game of strategy, analysis and customizing your gameplay to fit your style. I wanna talk about the latter first: It's really well done, you get to choose from 4 characters, and each one of them has got a completely different moveset and playstyle. I mean it, you don't get two same moves for any of the heroes. I've noticed 1-2 similiar moves but then again they follow up into something else, have different range, different purpose, are from a different "string" (I'll talk about it later). If that's not enough for you, you get to choose a sword type - there are 5 at the moment. Each one of them has got different properties and different "defensive" ability. You also get to choose what the sword looks like but that's a detail.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay: It's brilliant. How do you mix dynamic fights with tactics? You put 4 categories of attacks, each one of them countering 1 of them, at the same time being weak against another. Attacks also have exact "trails" - some leave you open, some attack from the left, some attack from the right, some make you spin and attack everything around you, but there are still openings your opponent can use. So can you. Combat is still fast-paced and you feel the adrenaline rush. Add "strings" to that. Attacks come in patterns but you can break the pattern, reset it and completely confuse your opponent. It's truly a game of skill, predictions and observation. Choose the right style, combo the way to surprise your opponent, fake an attack, reset your pattern, parry, use the openings in the opponent's pattern - seems simple, but is ingenious.\n\nThere are a few gamemodes but really you should know you can take part in FFA, duels (1v1, 2v1, 2v2) and Hero mode. Hero mode chooses one of the players to be the "hero" - he gets empowered attacks but all the enemies are trying to kill him at the same time.\n\nAs for the audio: it's neither bad nor good. I didn't really puy much attention to it and for the most part I just had my own music running in the background. Have to say I've played a bit with the in-game music and it wasn't irritating at any part. Only thing I could wish for is some better hit-sounds.\n\nGraphics are just ok, living up to standards but still pretty simple. That's ok, you wanna stay focused on the fights and there's no irritating visual stymulus coming from the game itself. Some of the fighting areas seem a little bit empty and poorly designed but it's not much of a deal at all. Lastly I'll just say that camera work is intuitive and you can actually adjust it in any way imaginable (e.g. angle, yaw, shaking, moving, rotation, height, distance).\n\nI can really recommend this game. If you like dynamic sword fights with a bit of tactics you will enjoy this game. It's simple, but holy ♥♥♥♥, in its simplicity it's beautiful.","November 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I love how it brings mind games from RTS, 4X and Chess down to a simpllistic pure intense reaction based form but I hate at the same time outside of Smash Bros most fighting Games require you to learn A LOT of pointless combos that feels more like a History Memorization than fun. Blade Sympony is simple to control but very hard to master. The combos are more in how you use your movesets since  at any time you can use a heavy, blanced, fast and Air not to mentions the air cancel of first three. This is fighing game that gets the complex parts right but at the same time is much more easy to understand the funimentals of combat and excute them over say Tekken or traditional 2D fighters. I have learned a lot and still learn a lot but I enjoy this game because it requires you to more of learn what you should do to bait the other guy in and that combacks are common if not very possable always in Blade Sympony.\n\nGrab your favorite Sword from the Workshop and slash on.","October 29, 2014","true","97.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Ultra realistic (as a game could be) A few stances and almost accidental combos that did exist but where a nightmare to memorise and know when to pull off. The idea was realism in sword fighting. A few tense jabs of tension and then a flurry and someone would be dead or bleeding to death. Ocassionally someone would take a light wound and make a come back, but it was rare. You could run about the scenery for a while, but at some point you just had to assume a stance and swing your sword and hope you guessed your opponents intentions.\n\nOn the other hand we have 'Blade Symphony' which is basically hop, spin and jab.And a lot of jumping and spinning around, I mean a lot of jumping. The advertisements shows a thing of elegance and beauty that doesn't translate into the gameplay.\n\nIt's kind of a Manga versus reality situation: and Blade Symphony is totally Manga, If wall hopping and spinning left and right , and VERY importantly: you're willing to put up with no real match making system based on rank - you'll have a hard time finding fellow noobs - then go for it.","June 23, 2014","false","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's less about knowing what your opponent will try and more about exploiting the game itself to gain an advantage.\n\nThe third person over-the-should view obfusicates much of your ability to gauge the actual range of your own attacks, as well as those of your opponent. Hit detection is often quite spotty. Which results in awkward advances followed by swinging wildly while backing up. Hit and run tactics are the way this game is played for the most part.\n\nBlade Symphony lacks the consistency of fighting games too. Frame rates aren't consistent, so good luck trying to gracefully and skillfully link sword attacks into one another.\nWhat you'll really end up doing is clicking and wildly swinging your camera around to manipulate your attack's path and speed.\n\nIt doesn't have the careful balance of fighting games, either.\nThe project's leader, Flux, set out to initially balance the attacks each character possesses using a very simple method.\nHe played against the "knight" character, who for the purpose of this process used only his slowest, strongest attack. Clicking over and over, using only this attack, Flux then played each character and gave them tools to counter or get around this attack.\n\nThen he was done balancing. The characters were done being iterated on, for the most part.\n\nThe dev team tweaks the numbers, at this point - sword swing speeds, damage values etc, but the ongoing balance meetings really only involve Flux asking the "top players" (read: most popular/vocal at the top of the leaderboard) what should be done. And of course, you can imagine the clamoring for the weakening of characters that they have trouble with, and the buffing of their mains. To be fair, it's not really the player's fault - it's natural and unavoidable to be biased in your own favor, no matter how impartial you think you are. The blame lies with the devs for outsourcing it's finer balance decisions to the most highly competetive players.\n\nSeveral characters have attacks that are so fast, they actually exceed the game's ability to display and often detect. Which can have wildly inconsistent results.\n\nThis game plays more like a third person action game, or an extremely bare-bones character action game.\nThat's multiplayer only. Very little realism to be had, with characters defying physics with certain attacks, outlandish Errol Flynn techniques, and in some cases outright flying.\n\nIf you can look past some very bizzare balancing philosophies (ie none at all) and don't expect to play more than one character (ie the one everyone at the top of the leaderboard plays) then you might enjoy this as a unique competetive experience. But all I can see is a whole lot of potential wasted by poor decisionmaking and direction.","October 16, 2014","false","70.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

What?\n\nI don't know what to say... very stiff controls.  Very awkward to play.  I want to like this for being a new attempt at making an interesting swordfighting game, but I just can't find it enjoyable.  Even in the fast stance, my character freezes up completely during swings.\n\nI would recommend that anyone who's interested in this, pick up a copy of Unreal Tournament 2004, install the ChaosUT2 mod for free, and try out the melee dueling.  This game seems like a remake of those mechanics as a standalone game, down to the 3 stances, the controls for sweep attacks, etc.  Problem is, the Chaos mod's version is just more *fun*.  You can move fluidly while attacking and it just feels more like a good action game.  The one thing I liked gameplay-wise in Blade Symphony is the way heavier attacks can break through a parry.  In the Chaos mod, it's a little silly when daggers parry a hammer blow.\n\nGood effort, but I hope the developers give this "your legs freeze during any attack" mechanic a hard look.  Just changing it to a speed penalty could go a long way towards making this game playable.  I do miss the melee duels of ChaosUT2 and will be open to a good challenger.","May 11","false","11.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

However after comfortably winning my first five duels against human opponents (including a player ranked 750th worldwide) by mashing the left mouse button while sidestepping I'm not convinced the game has anywhere near a high enough skill ceiling for competitive play. Typically you have three 3-4 strike attack moves that you can mix and match, along with jumping, grabbing and chucking a ranged weapon. Sure you can charge a strike or ‘parry’ when players swing at the same time but there’s still not much to it. Personally I need far more depth for a fighting game to retain my interest.\nAlso:\n-The arenas are small yet still look extremely basic\n-Surprisingly poor animation quality for a 3D fighting game\n-Not much to do, few customisation options and characters. Only 2 modes - FFA or 1v1\n+Although it is pretty original\n+And has at least one futuristic cyber butt\nIt's also reasonably cheap, but still not as cheap as you can pick up some older (and superior) - albeit more conventional fighters.

Blade Symphony takes this concept and narrows it down to just swords, and by doing this, they have a created a skill-based duel  game that is fun to watch and play.\n\n\nStory wise, Blade Symphony isn't much to look at. Here's the gist of it: You're a blind swordsman trying to become the best in the world. Seriously, that's it. However that's not where Blade Symphony shines. It's graphics are very well done, especially at the particles when swords collide. All of the models, both sword and duelist, are very well done with textures fitting the weapons, like giving the katana "Serrated Serenade" a serrated edge. When wandering around the maps in free for all mode, it's a joy to be able to climb up onto a roof and take in the scenery. While playing I didn't notice any texture pop ins or jagged edges.\n\nWhile Blade Symphony may be lacking a story, it more than makes up for it with its deep customization  and sword play. Upon entering, you're guided through a series of tutorials teaching you about basic things like sword types, all the way up to advanced side cancelling, with Puny Human planning on releasing more as time passes. You'll pick from one of four classes, with Judgement being your defensive tank, Ryoku being the nimble fiighter, Phalanx your long reach sniper, and Pure with her fancy spins and sword flurries. Along with your sword type, either katana, longsword, rapier, scimitar, or jian, and sets of fast, balanced, and heavy stances, you have an unlimited amount of strategies waiting to be learned. You'll see common ones like Judgement with a longsword to deal massive damage, or Phalanx with a rapier to deal bursts of damage, you can visualize more unique ones. A slow and bulky Judgement wielding the jian, which speeds up your move recovery, can help him compensate for his slow heavy attacks. Fighting tooth and nail with another play is electryfing, and the main reason why this game is so much fun to watch. When not slashing other players into bite-sized chunks, you'll be either waiting for the way too long load screens to disappear, or using your currency to purchase new swords and masks. While they certainly change how your character looks, they don't do anything to impede the balance of the game, since everything is cosmetic. This makes the game purely reliant on skill. The only way to get good at the game is to practice, practice, practice.\n\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\nStuff I liked:\n+Simple yet deep swordplay\n+Vast customization\n+Skill based gameplay\n+Electryfing duels\n\nStuff I didn't like:\n-Horrendous loading times\n\n9.5/10 Outstanding\n\nWith how easy it is to get into Blade Symphony and how deep the strategies go, it's easy to lose several hours into one play session. If you want a multiplayer duel with a large amount of depth and customization that takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master, stop reading this review and add Blade Symphony to your cart.","December 2, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sword play is fun and intense. However, at least in my opinion, I don't feel as if the fighting has as much depth as the game claims to have. Every character has at least one move that can be exploited to a degree. Character balance is decent, but nearly everyone uses Ryoku and it gets slightly irritating. The workshop support is great with all kinds of swords and hats to choose from. There's not many people to play online with though, but when you find a good server, it's worth it. There's a lack of multiple game modes. The ones that are present however are done pretty well and are fun. I personally like Free for all because you can run around the entirity of a map. You can attack others in a big moshpit or do a private 1v1. There's wallrunning and things like that which are pretty cool, but they get boring pretty quick, at least for me.

If you like competitive games similar to this then you have no excuse but to buy it; especially at such a reasonable price. From what I've played the community has been nice and very helpful, in fact someone volunteired to teach me some of the more advanced mechanics of the game. I've not gotten to an extremely high level within the game, but I can with reasonable confidence say that the game is skill based and has quite the skill ceiling.\n\nA warning however is that before you understand the game it could be frusterating for some people since you may not know what you did wrong. Actually I have one tip for people that are just getting into the game, keep in mind that there are three difference staces and an arial state for when you're jumping. Someone can break your stance with an attack from a superior stance, thus breaking through your attack and cancelling it. Fast stance beats arial, medium beats fast, heavy beats medium, and arial beats heavy. Though just because you're using a superior stance than the enemy doesn't mean that they might not hit you first or attack faster, so get used to timing your attacks just right.\n\nOne more thing about the game is that everyone seems to develop their own unique style of sword play, and by no means are any of them better or worse than others apart from the skill of the swordsman. Not only can you develop your own style of play, but you can compliment it by selecting what character/sword combination you want to use. If you want to be big and hard hitting character and slow but satisfying attacks you can pick Judgement with the Longsword as a devestating conbination. Or if you'd rather deal your damage with speed, then try Pure with the Scimitar. Either way the game will be super fun with lots of variety. (One last tip, I'd reccomend when you first start to pick Phalanx with the Longsword and once you get used to him try other characters with the Longsword. Once you feel ready and are starting to develop your style then try experimenting with differnent conbinations. This is how I was advised to learn and it worked out very well for me.)\n\nPast that though, the game is a blast; especially with friends.

It's 3D fighting game with 4 main attack styes: fast, balanced, heavy, and air, each of which can counter the one before it when the swords clash. These moves can be strung together to create a virtually infinite number of attack styles! Confusing, I know. This game frustrated me to no end when I bought it, and it still frustrates me today, but I've learned that when you push through the frustration and get used to the controls, you'll find  an amazing, in depth fighting game.\n\nPROS:\nPhenomenal, in depth fighting system\nBeautiful graphics\nFantastic music\n(mostly) Great community!\n(slightly) Attentive dev team!\nCONS:\nTracers can be unpredictable when lag is strong (So pick non-laggy servers!)\nTutorial is kind of crap\nFrustrating to get used to\nEXTREMELY  frustrating to get used to\nGAHHHH\nSummary: Blade Symphony is a great game if you're into ninjas, fighting, beautiful graphics, amazing battle music, super fast combat, intense gameplay, and lastly, a whole bunch of shurikens flying everywhere. 9/10","January 11, 2015","true","388.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Going back to Jedi Knight.\n\nI was hoping that the swords and models were just cosmetics and that everything was solely based on a single combat system like Jedi knight had, i don't know where they got their inspiration from, besides the Open area, duel thing, this is nothing like Jedi Knight.

I mean, it's sword battle which is very popular in movie scene and comic art, some people even have a deep philosophical connection with it, so the game is really nailed with the idea.\n\nBut at the moment I enter the game and play it for the first time, I'm getting quite speechless with the gameplay mechanic. It's really not the thing I expected with "Symphony" big tag in the game title. All characters can fast freely move across the stage, in a way that it's more fit into a typical hack and slash, even FPS (!), not the fighting genre. I feel like it will suit better if the char is equipped with LMG than a sword with a movement like that.\n\nThe stance mechanism is a good idea, it seems a little bit unintuitive at first with additional button to press to change stance, beside pressing directional button to change sword attack style (which I don't feel quite effective) but I think with a little bit practice anybody can master it. The content is a little bit limited at the time, but since the game is relatively new, it's still acceptable. Steam workshop is able to deliver some mods and you can hope the dev will comes with other contents in the future.\n\nOf course, a little bit here and there can be fixed with an update, but game play mechanism? Not really. If you really like the frenzy style of hack and slash game, even FPS (!), I think you may like BS because it suits that two genres style similarly. But if you really like traditional 2D and 3D fighting, and hope for a deep "Symphony" of sword duel, you should watch the gameplay trailer first to make sure if the game really worth your time and money.","July 24, 2014","false","8.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

Currently not much can be said about the game rather than it being unfinished.

There are a few servers with people in but the game says that I can't connect them because they are in a different version (Europe and USA tho), and the ones that are for my version have anyone inside. I don't know why the creators decided to separate both regions knowing that the online is dead...\nThe second one is that the game has any 'solo' mode. I know that is an 1vs1 online-oriented game, but other games similar have a little story for practising or whatever. Blade Symphony doesn't have any mode like this so you are obliged (as the game has a dead online) to battle against a IA that does not suppose much challenge.\n\nI was expecting a sale on this game because it seemed pretty interesting to me, so when I saw it on a flash I bought it.

However, I do think I have a decent-enough understanding of the game to recommend it.\n\nI began playing Blade Symphony when it was on sale for $3.  For the price, I thought "what the heck, it's cheap."  I fell in love with the game!  However, there are a few issues.  I'll list the pros and cons as I currently see them.\n\nPros:\n-The combat system in wonderful.  It reminds one of the old Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast combat system, except much more complex and fluid.\n-Good community (sort of).  There are a lot of really great people that play Blade Symphony and love to help new people learn the ropes.  Also, there are community-driven tournaments that provide some extra excitement to the game.  I'll hit on the "sort of" in the cons.\n-Steam Workshop integration.  The fact that anyone can make weapons/masks/maybe eventually capes for this game is extremely satisfying and provides a level of personlization that many other games do not have.  I, for one, enjoy beating people with a Candy-Cane Wielding Batman every once in a while.  The Steam Workshop integration makes that possible.\n-Open Developers.  The developers of Blade Symphony are very open with the community regarding what they are working on with the game.  They have been hosting developer hangouts every Saturday night to provide updates, and I personally enjoy them.\n\nCons:\n-Some balancing still needs to be done to a few attacks, but it's minor.\n-Large learning curve.  It took me quite a long time and many, many losses to get somewhat decent at this game.  This is not necessarily a bad thing but I just want people to recognize that this game requires some time to learn and they should not just play for a couple of hours, get frustrated and never play again.\n-Some dedicated players are jerks.  Now, this will be the case with ANY competitive game.  So please- if you run into someone that is a jerk, do not think that person is representative of the whole community.\n-The pricetag of $15 dollars seems excessive to me.  I would think it should be more like $10.\n\nAll things considered, I would recommend this game.  $15 dollars may be a bit much, but it is a very enjoyable and fun competitive swordfighting game, the likes of which I have not seen before now.\n","April 13, 2014","true","213.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

It is more deliberate, slower, but also deadlier. A character with a moveset and sword dedicated to slow but damaging counter hits can kill you with a single blow if you screw up your offense. The round's outcome is not decided even if one player has 100% hp and the other has 1%.\n\nThe way the game controls is pretty unique, it's centered around a combo system with stances and utilizes kb+m so there's definitely a learning curve and it'll take a while before the feeling of jank wears off. But after enough training, you will understand the uses for all of the few dozen different swings your character can perform. Perhaps one move has a fake-out portion at the beginning that baits an attack only to counter it, perhaps it hits instantaneously at your side and catches the flanking opponent off-guard, maybe it makes you hop forward and thus extends your effective range, etc.\n\nBecause the game has a parry system that lets slower attacks deflect faster ones, the game is rather punishing against button mashing when you have even slightest skill difference between players. Mashing faster attacks is the same as almost begging your opponent to devour your HP bar with one decent counter, while slower attacks can leave you horribly vulnerable and are often not as good when your enemy is right within grabbing distance\n\nIf you got the patience to study a character's full moveset, it's definitely a game worth learning. It's the only fighting game I could call myself even remotely adept at thanks to the very different pacing","February 5, 2015","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is more deliberate, slower, but also deadlier. A character with a moveset and sword dedicated to slow but damaging counter hits can kill you with a single blow if you screw up your offense. The round's outcome is not decided even if one player has 100% hp and the other has 1%.\n\nThe way the game controls is pretty unique, it's centered around a combo system with stances and utilizes kb+m so there's definitely a learning curve and it'll take a while before the feeling of jank wears off. But after enough training, you will understand the uses for all of the few dozen different swings your character can perform. Perhaps one move has a fake-out portion at the beginning that baits an attack only to counter it, perhaps it hits instantaneously at your side and catches the flanking opponent off-guard, maybe it makes you hop forward and thus extends your effective range, etc.\n\nBecause the game has a parry system that lets slower attacks deflect faster ones, the game is rather punishing against button mashing when you have even slightest skill difference between players. Mashing faster attacks is the same as almost begging your opponent to devour your HP bar with one decent counter, while slower attacks can leave you horribly vulnerable and are often not as good when your enemy is right within grabbing distance\n\nIf you got the patience to study a character's full moveset, it's definitely a game worth learning. It's the only fighting game I could call myself even remotely adept at thanks to the very different pacing","February 5, 2015","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Even if most swordfighting techniques have more than just 3 stances.)\n...the somewhat tactical swordplay in this game.\n...the style of the characters and the modability of their appearance.(even if the mods out there are mostly retextures and nothing to breathtaking till now.)\n...that the different swordtypes you have to unlock are purely cosmetic and you have the full arsenal at your disposal from the begining.\n...you can see a hologram of how your sword will cut through the air in your current pose and the current direction of your swing. (Never seen that in another game before I think.)\n\nI don't like...\n...the arcady health bar, I would prefer a more deadly combat, maybe something with disabling limbs if hit.\n...the look of most fighting places, they look somewhat cheap and packed together without much love for detail and looks.\n...that there are way to less different gamemodes for this otherwise great game. There are only point capture, free for all and some duells availiable.\n...the low player count.\n...that some of the animations look awkward and unhuman.\n\nFor people who love swordplay/figthing this is well worth about 5 €. and if you buy it with friends I'm sure you can have a lot of fun cutting eachother to pieces.

I understand the basics, but still can not reliably win in a duel for the life of me. This is and of itself isn't a bad thing. In fact, part of me is excited for how much more I have to learn. Unfortunately, another part of me is upset by the fact that there's no easy or convenient way to do so.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand. It very much tosses you into the deep end and lets you sink or swim of your own accord. If you've ever played 'Toribash', you'll probably understand what I'm talking about; you've got an incredibly complex fighting system that you can start with a friend to be on-par with (though only because neither of you are any good yet), or you can play against bots or foes online that understands the ins and outs of the system and as such, at least for a reasonable while, tend to beat you without contest.\n\nThe game makes a point of saying that it will include further tutorials at a later point, which would certainly be welcome because as it stands one has to figure out most of the mechanics by themselves after seeing somebody else do it. YouTube for now remains the best place for in-depth tutorials to be best of my knowledge.\nIn any case, this is definitely a game that will take a long time to master. If you're genuinely willing to spend many, many hours playing and perfecting this game, then good for you, I recommend it. I fear for many, though, it could end up sitting in their library as ‘that one game I really should really get better at some time’.\n\nCharacter customisation is decent – you can chose one of four characters and one of a lot of swords, both affecting gameplay stats, and you can also make a few aesthetic changes. Unfortunately the character and sword you fancy most for the looks mightn't necessarily be the best for actual competition, but I find changing up your style to match a new, cool sword you unlock is refreshing.\nThe modding community is certainly not lacking - there are plenty of custom items and maps to download, if that's your bag.\n\nI tentatively recommend this.

Blade Symphony reminds me a little of a soul calibur game. I'm really not even sure how you'd classify it. It manages to be super fast paced and exciting without sacrificing strategic gameplay. Stance dancing and combos flow together really smoothly, parrying requires good timing and foresight, and overall the combat feels great.\n\nI've been told the community is pretty dead, and I suspect maybe the summer sale deals have caused things to pick up a bit. In my case, I found a server with at least 16 other people to play with within 5 minutes of starting up the game.\n\nI kind of expected lag to make this kind of fast paced combat a complete ♥♥♥♥ show, but surprisingly few of my (very numerous) deaths have been lag related.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game, but if my experience is anything to go by, it'll take some time to learn the ropes so try not to get too frustrated.","June 23, 2015","true","61.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, the game is slow and most of the animations lock you down, making for very boring to watch fights since mobility can only be achieved by jumping and rolling short distances. Can't really recommend it because there is practically no freedom to develop your own playstyle, you either copy what works or eventually lose out to it.","May 8, 2014","false","88.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

It has its fair share of issues, but those are all outweighed by the excellent combat mechanics. There are four fighters all with very unique fighting styles, and strengths and weaknesses. There are also five different types of swords each fitting to different fighters in unique and interesting way. There are, however, some issues, for one, offline play There is an AI to practice against but it is incredibly bad, you have to set up what the AI will do, you can for example set it to attack or defend, it cannot do both, making it effectively useless. Also the player community is fairly small, which is sad, I have played ten hours so far and I have already run into some people I recognize repeatedly, but overall I love Blade Symphony's combat mechanics, and that's what sells it for me.","October 26, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This game is all about swordfighting. It is presented in a few rather similar formats. What must be understood is that it is not just another fighting game.\nThere is a somewhat hidden element of social interaction and importance of good manners. People have different opinions on the importance of manners, and some seem to deliberately be rude to get you off balance. Beating these people is immensely rewarding.\nThe best and worst part of this game is the heavy reliance on the community. The community does carry the game in every way it is lacking, but only when a decent number of servers are populated.\nI'll leave ya with this: Bow before (and after) every fight, don't attack people who are typing and don't use shurikens. I will find you and I will play foul if you do.

Having the ability to roam is a nice touch and the challenging system works well. It feels like you're part of a community . . . Provided you log in when people are online.\n\nI speak for the Australian region when I say that unless you log in at a specific time of day, you're never going to have anyone to play with. Even then,. you probably only get a window of one or two hours. The gameplay is great fun, but the lack of players makes it really hard to get into, especially when most of the playerbase are veterans.\nI want to love this game but it makes it difficult for me to do so, especially with there being no Australian ranked servers, so unless I play on >300ms, I can't unlock any new weapons.\n\nI'm going to recommend this game because it needs recommendations. The game is great. The community is friendly. But the sheer limited playerbase is what kills it, and a negative review won't help this game be what it should at all.","October 3, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have written a few reviews on this game.  Deleted them multiple times in the past.  Some were positive and others were negitive.  Why am I saying this?  Because I have a love hate relationship with this game.  It's good at what it does and when you find a playstyle you love it really comes alive.  (For me, this playstyle was shuffle shuffle shuffle and try to be sonic with a longsword)\n\nThe positive:\n+Good combat\n+Loyal community\n+Variety of playstyles and options\n\nThe negitive:\n-The game's population is made up of loyal players, but newbies are uncommon.  I highly recommend you DO NOT pick this game up if you want to fight against people of your own skill level all the time.  It is a small community and most of the people who make it up have been playing for a long time (like me, I've played since EA)\n-Sort of toxic community.  You will find a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game.  A lot.  Not everyone is like this, but... yeah.  It's not as bad as Dota 2 or LoL, but it is still up there.  (You might find old reviews saying that the community is great, these are mostly from the SoW days.  The community changed and not for the better)\n-Spamming... Well, the combat is good, just don't think that it doesn't allow spamming.  Spamming in this game can only be countered if you ACTUALLY TRY TO COUNTER THE SPAM.  Don't just think you can beat it with your normal style, you can't, you have to adapt to it.  Fighting masters, diamonds, and most steels is usually the best way to avoid spam, but low level play is made up of spam, almost to the point of exclusivity.\n\nThere are a lot more reviews out there that can talk more indept about the pros and cons of this game and its combat.  People who have played as long as me or longer.  However, I figured I would put this up because... well, just because.  BS has been an important game for me.  It is one of the few games I feel as if I can actually say I am good at (Not the best, yes, but I am somewhat good) and it does deserve at least a look by fighting or hack and slash fans.","July 30, 2015","true","708.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Basically, instead of having light/medium/heavy attacks, you instead have to switch between 3 different stances which alter your entire moveset. 1 is "light/fast", 2 is "medium/medium" and 3 is "heavy/slow". Each of these stances is designed to be strong and weak against the other two stances in a classic rock/paper/scissors weapon triangle. While that's all well and good, I still feel that having to roll over the mouse wheel to select from 3 stances in the heat of combat in order to get the move you want feels clunky and convoluted. I would have much preferred just having light/medium/heavy buttons. I mean seriously, imagine if in Street Fighter you had to roll over a damn mouse wheel or reach over to the number keys on your keyboard and than do a movement sensitive input every time you wanted to throw a damn sweep as Ryu.\n\nThere are a few other nitpicks with the combat, though I assume these will be tweaked out and refined with time. At the moment blocking seems to be pretty useless, and since blocking sucks, throws also suck. The game is basically all about hitting buttons right now.\n\nAnyway, as for content, the game has a small roster of characters at the moment (about 5 or so), but each of them has a huge variety of weapons to choose from which alter their movesets and abilities pretty heavily. The game also has 2 on 2 matches along with 1 on 1 matches and various lobby settings, so it's pretty decent for online play. Though the netcode is bad.\n\nI like most of the music also. The aesthetic is pretty cool too, though Pure has way too much junk in the trunk and her random cyborg ninja fanservice feels really out of place IMO.\n\nSeems like a solid game, and one I might return to from time to time, but I really don't like the convoluted design of the stance system. Personally I think Max Anarchy/Anarchy Reigns on Ps3/Xbox360 does pretty much the same thing much better, so I'd honestly recommend picking that up instead if you have either console.","January 13, 2014","true","12.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The graphics of this game are on par if not better than any AAA title game this year. This game strives in realism, the combat and graphics alike. It is like being in a real life sword fight, as a medieval sword fighting enthusiast and reenactor I believe I have the expertise to say that this is a very realistic game. If you don't have the money to own a sword collection like myself this game is a great substitute, the swords on the workshop are all so realistic and people must of taken months if not years to design them.\n\nThis game is just incredible so many different game modes to play and so many realistic sword fighting moves/techniques to use, I love playing this in the winter as my fellow reenactors don't like going out in the winter.

The game doesn't really "help" u to get in the game. Tutorial gives u the basics and the Training sessions with bots are boring and easy. But as soon as u enter a server u will love it. U'll search for competetors and duel one after another. You will improve by every mistake and it won't get boring that fast, because everyone got his own fighting style... some go more agressive some stay more defensively ; sure u will say right now " then there are noobs who take forfeits in sitting in one corner" , and i can easily say that this is not true. Why u may ask? The game gives u everything u need to take or make forfeits. U can win every (EVERY) fight.

If you were a fan of lightsaber duels in those games, you'll feel right at home here.  For the uninitiated, this is a rather unorthodox and very unforgiving fighting game, with a steep learning curve.  You will struggle over the nuances of the controls.  You will lose a lot of duels.\n\nHowever, once you can get past the initial bumpiness, you'll find that there's a lot of depth.  What seemed random at first actually requires quite a bit of technique and timing.  The veteran players can be very friendly, and will be more than happy to provide advice.  Some servers will even hold impromptu classes for players who ask.\n\nAs for the Early Access Beta, the game is adequately playable.  There is one character that is still a work in progress, but the other characters have fully realized movesets.  There aren't a lot of game modes, but when the focus is on 1v1, this isn't a big issue at this time.\n\nPost-release edit:  The gameplay itself is much more refined after several fixes and balance changes.  Pure's moveset has filled out nicely.  This is still a lean, mean fighting game; perhaps not the most feature filled (for now), but it certainly isn't lacking in depth.  Jedi Knight/Academy fans will be chuffed.","January 12, 2014","true","521.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

A game with simple tags like "fighter". In my honest opinion, this game has gone beyond that, it is a new genre, the "duel" genre, in it's own rights.\n\nBlade symphony is a thirdperson swordplay/fighter with incredible depth. Tracers in the air indicates what route your next attack is going to take, which changes depending on movment and what stance you have (light balanced heavy) and if you charge the attacks. You string these toghether to create "combos".\n\nThe community is very helpful and active, but as of now it is a bit small. Some things definitly need tweeking, ranking system, balancing and so on, but it is early accses, but honestly it looks like a finsihed game, and they disprove it is by constantly patching it. But right now, it's ofcourse playeble with a few gamemodes here and there but mostly focuses on 1v1. There are also tournaments arranged. It's also very easy to get in toucth with developers, and they are very responsive!\n\nThis is the kind of game were you wont even hit the best players.\n\nA gamewere people can TRULY get good!\n\n\n\n","March 9, 2014","true","89.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The people playing this game are amongst the most helpful and fun to play with people I've ever played with in a multiplayer game.\n\nServers like School of War are often full of people who are willing to help those who are new to the game or who need it. It can be a lot of fun when people organize events and people are just very diciplined when it comes to following the rules and not to mention often really polite. Almost every duel I've fought begun and sometimes ended with a bow, even though that isn't necessary.\n\nThe game itself is definitely brilliant as well. At the time of writing the game is still in beta and the developers are constantly adding things to and refining the game. From the beautiful visuals and music to the incredible depth of the fighting systems, how duels play out and the customization.\n\nOverall it's a very enjoyable experience playing this game and becoming better at it through practice or through help from fellow players.\nIt's a work in progress, but definitely something to look forward to.\n---------------------------\n5 months later, all of the above still pretty much holds true imo. The game has progressed quite a lot though, some would argue for the worse, but I personally like where it is going.\n\nAnd on a little side note, for anyone who's interested, the developers of this game actually have a meeting every saturday at around 4 pm. PST or 12 pm. GMT, which they stream on youtube. Just search for 'punyhumangames' and perhaps subscribe if you want to get notified whenever they do one. I find it can be quite insightful and they will also answer any questions you post in the comments.","June 27, 2013","true","272.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

Save your money and wait till its on sale for $7 - $3\n\nAs you can tell by my playtime, I’ve played a lot of this game. Hundreds and hundreds of hours and thousands of duel matches. At the time of writing this my current ranked game number stands at 2594 Wins, and 1298 losses for a total of 3892 matches which is 11,676 individual ranked fights.\n\nEleven thousands individual fights, and for some reason I find myself warning you dear reader that this is not a $15 game. I purchased Blade Symphony back in December 2013 for around $7 dollars; my brother purchased the game for $3, and I can tell you right now based on the current game I overpaid.\n\nSo let’s start with the good: If I’m writing a negative review, then what is keeping me playing.\n\nThe Good\n\nWorkshop Integration:\n\nThe current game allows me to create (using various modeling and texturing programs) my own weapons and items. I am one of the more active and prolific workshop creators in this game. This is one of the main reasons I have continued to play this game, as I love to create custom items for people to use. Without this workshop Integration I would have quit the game a long, long time ago.\n\nDeep Combat System:\n\nThis game has the framework for a fantastic combat system, giving you a true feeling of skill when you defeat an opponent. There is a lot of depth here.\n\nAnd… that’s it for the good.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis game has a severe lack of content in the form of game modes as well as characters. I personally have played only one of the four characters in nearly all of my 11,000 matches. The character I chose was unfinished as of December 2013, and is now being released unfinished in May 2014 (the game’s current release date). You heard me: This game is releasing an UNFINISHED character and charging you $15 for it.\n\nThere are currently only four characters in this game (or 3.5 considering the unfinished/unbalanced character I play. There is also only one way to play the game: 1v1 duel. This is the only game mode you will be able to play at launch and unless you have a competitive streak like me; you will eventually grow bored of this, as 99.98% of the current community has. This game currently has over 30,000 people who OWN the game, yet at peak times US East you will barely find 30 people playing.\n\nThe asking price for this game is $15, I urge you not to buy until it is at least HALF this price, or even a quarter of this price; because the vast majority of you will not be able to play this nearly as long as I have and you will likely quit within the first 5 to 10 hours once you’ve seen all this game has to offer. I want to reiterate; it was my Workshop projects that have kept me here so long, not just my competitive dueling.","April 13, 2014","false","956.9"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","24","47","2","9"

This game isn't for you. No need to read the rest of the review.\n\nNow, if you're still here, you might be interested.\nLet's be honest, this game is HARD AS HELL when you're a beginner. The tutorial doesn't really help, there's no solo/bot play at the moment and the  only mode available is 1v1 Versus. There is no matchmaking, you are free to join the server you want. This is how, on my very first game, I fought against the 113th world's best player. No need to say I got REKT.\nDespite the density (not easy to understand at first glance and not very intuitive controls) of the game and its little balance problems (just check the forums, but it's nothing that can affect you as a beginner) Blade Symphony remains pleasing.\nI'm not the best versus player in the world, on the contrary actually... yet I won my first match after a dozen of fights which is not so bad and quite rewarding.\nNice addition : There's Worshop Content available for this game.\n\nFinally, I'd say this game needs time to add what it lacks of and fix some issues.

Sure, sometimes spamming is the way to go and can be frustrating to deal with, but the game offers helpful strategies to bypass this. Then after a person learns to mix and match their fighting moves, they then learn which one they like the best.\n\nWith an interesting plot, good balancing that's simple, and nice play time to boot if there are players to play with, then this game is a must have for a fighter enthusiest.\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","186.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But a review is a review, so I'll delve into it more.\n\nBlade Symphony is a traditional fighting game except the main attraction of it is, as in the name, blades/swords.  Every match is a 2-out-of-3 match.  Your main weapon in this is a sword.  You can do the classic moves of any fighting game, such as grabbing, block-breacking, doing combos, etc.  Also, you do have a projectile, a smaller blade you could say.  But here is a main strength of the game: you cannot spam.  Instead, to throw you projectile, you have to charge the throw.  This is a good feature, especially for fighting game nuts like me since anybody who has played a fighting game online knows there are "annoying" experiances.  Not with Blade Symphony.\n\nAnyways, you have three techniques to your disposal: heavy, balanced, and fast.  Balanced is as it emplies, balanced.  This means you get a good mixture of some speed and some power.  It's a fundamental skill for not just the beginning of your experiance, but with every match you get into and your future experiance.  Heavy is soley based on raw power, meaning you can completely deplete your opponents health in only a few hits.  The downside is that you are extremely slow and any medicore-timed hit can have the opposition racking up combos and defeating you quickly.  You'll have to know your opponents moves and have good timing to use this technique to your advantage.  And last but not least is fast.  Fast is all about speed. Get a quick combo then move out of range, then strike again.  You'll have to play smart, because the disadvantage is that you have low damage.  Naturally, fast can, in most correctly used situations, dominate somebody who is using heavy.  Make sure that if you're using heavy and your enemy is using fast, switch to fast or balanced.  There are also four different characters to use, though they all depend on the user and how they use them.  You can also download swords of the workshop, non of them being overpowered.\n\nThe key of every match is patcience and timing.  Wait for your opponent to get within range, then strike according to the situation and their placement on the field.  Blade Symphony is honestly a great sword fighting game that feels like you're actually in the heat of battle.  Use timing, the three techniques, and the character you are using's moveset and strike.  Picking up this game was a real treat, and hopefully it is for you.  Definetly recommended to anybody who has a few bucks on them.","December 21, 2013","true","5.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The videos make it look like a combination of Soul Calibur and Toribash but the experience of actually playing the game is currently pretty crummy. That said, the big free-for-all matches look like they still have a lot of potential (I'd really love to be enjoying the game as much as I enjoy watching the last few minutes of the trailer), and the game seems fairly WIP, so I'm happy to give it a few dollars and more time to improve.\n\nHonestly, speaking as someone who plays console ports with a mouse and keyboard when he knows he really shouldn't simply because I can't be bothered to hook in a controller, one of this game's biggest problems could be that it's obviously designed around a mouse and keyboard. I'm not sure they can overcome that basic issue, but we'll see. More single-player content wouldn't hurt either -- the current tutorial is pretty light and doesn't compare favourably to playing the game online.","October 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

Chivarly is a bad comparison, yes it's based on swings and counters but the third person and mobility feels a lot different. I can compare it more to PvP darksouls when it comes to just how the game plays. The controls are a lot different though.  At the moment for an early access game it's surpisingly balanced, based mostly on your personal skill and experience with a character/sword combo. Of course there are a few things that seem a bit out of place. What's neat Is all the unlocks are simply cosmetic, and if you can't afford a new sword yet there are plenty in the steam workshop that not only allow you to see the swod differently, but everyone else in the game sees the same model as you do.","December 22, 2013","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","A fast way to describe this game is like Jedi Academy meets Bushido Blade.\n\nIf that isn't enough then the best way I can describe playing this game is with a story of my first win in a Duel.\nThere are two kinds of servers you can play on, Free For All servers where you can practice and talk to other players or Dual servers where you go one on one in ranked matches.\n\nWhilst you are cued to fight you watch however is currently playing. The game operates on a "Winner stays on" system so a good player can stay on for dozens of matches. That was what was happening this time I was playing. The player who was controlling the ring was using a rapier, a sword that can break through a players guard easily and get a lot of low damage hits in. He had completely wiped the floor with me the first time we fought and so I got to watch him fight three other players before I got another try.\n\nI spent that time watching his tactics, the Rapier is great head on but does almost no damage if you try to swipe with it, so he was forcing the other player to come at him from the front. Either by throwing knives at them when they hung back or by diving in himself. In a sword clash or parry the Rapier will almost always come out on top so he was able to take people down with ease. Over the three fights I watch I figured out a strategy to take him down.\n\nI was using the Tone Death, the first Longsword you get in the game which is good for wide sweeping attacks. When the match started we bowed and then I started to circle him, trying to get in a position where I could get around and past his guard. He didn't seem to be expecting it when I finally came at him and, instead of meeting him head on, rolled past his guard and brought my sword round in a wide horizontal swipe that took of a good sized chunk of his health.\n\nThe rest of the first round continued like that, with me chipping away at his health until he finally fell. The second round started differently, he came right in on the attack, striking at me and putting me on the backfoot. I rolled away as fast as I could to get away from his attack. I managed to land a few hits hear and there but he was hurting me more than I was hurting him. I was going to lose if that kept up\n\nCharging up for a fast strike which would take of a huge chunk of my health if it landed, he came around for a final strike. You can shuffle back instead of rolling, it doesn't carry you as far but also doesn't leave you vulnerable to attack. So I started shuffling like a 50's singer and managed to dodge all three of his attacks along with the follow up. In the moment after his attack I brought my blade down it a heavy vertical strike and took of the rest of his health.\n\nHis body slumped to the floor and I sheathed my blade as I let out a breath I hadn't even known I was holding. I don't think I have ever felt happier at winning a game in my life.","July 13, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After finishing the tutorial and joining an online server I learned not only did i still have plenty to learn but how great the community is.\n\nThe game Is beautiful not only in its asthetics but also with the animations that all seem to flow really well together and in the heat of a duel it often looks like the 2 combatants are locked in dance rather than Combat.  The 4 different characters all have a Unique yet believable Fighting style which does suit certain sword types better than others but doesn't limit you.  (The first time you see a knight/samurai use a Rapier like it was a longsword you might laugh a bit.)  There is a character and sword combination for everyone.\n\nThere are no Upgrades or unlockables that change how you play or make you better the only thing that makes you more successful at the game is practice.  If you make a mistake you will know and most likely lose a large percentage of your health.\n\nThe community is friendly and if you are having trouble you could join pretty much any one of the servers and ask for help and get it.  Though there still are those few players who are venom (Those who are just rude and sore winners/losers) but for the majority Your duels will always end with "Good fight!" "well played"  "GG" "That was a close fight!"  Its rare these days to see a community who are so willing to help each other the only other game I can think of with such a good community would be the PAYDAY community.\n\nSo yes After all this ranting I would Recommend this game to anyone whether or not your a sword fighting enthusiast or just want to enjoy a solid game (did i mention its built on the source engine?)","June 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

You get several types and character types. Each character has different moves and strengths/weaknesses. While each sword will modify attack speed and damage, with pros and cons.\n\nSo there is a lot of room to experiment with. I especially LOVE the depth of each type of gameplay.

Chivarly is a bad comparison, yes it's based on swings and counters but the third person and mobility feels a lot different. I can compare it more to PvP darksouls when it comes to just how the game plays. The controls are a lot different though.  At the moment for an early access game it's surpisingly balanced, based mostly on your personal skill and experience with a character/sword combo. Of course there are a few things that seem a bit out of place. What's neat Is all the unlocks are simply cosmetic, and if you can't afford a new sword yet there are plenty in the steam workshop that not only allow you to see the swod differently, but everyone else in the game sees the same model as you do.","December 22, 2013","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","A fast way to describe this game is like Jedi Academy meets Bushido Blade.\n\nIf that isn't enough then the best way I can describe playing this game is with a story of my first win in a Duel.\nThere are two kinds of servers you can play on, Free For All servers where you can practice and talk to other players or Dual servers where you go one on one in ranked matches.\n\nWhilst you are cued to fight you watch however is currently playing. The game operates on a "Winner stays on" system so a good player can stay on for dozens of matches. That was what was happening this time I was playing. The player who was controlling the ring was using a rapier, a sword that can break through a players guard easily and get a lot of low damage hits in. He had completely wiped the floor with me the first time we fought and so I got to watch him fight three other players before I got another try.\n\nI spent that time watching his tactics, the Rapier is great head on but does almost no damage if you try to swipe with it, so he was forcing the other player to come at him from the front. Either by throwing knives at them when they hung back or by diving in himself. In a sword clash or parry the Rapier will almost always come out on top so he was able to take people down with ease. Over the three fights I watch I figured out a strategy to take him down.\n\nI was using the Tone Death, the first Longsword you get in the game which is good for wide sweeping attacks. When the match started we bowed and then I started to circle him, trying to get in a position where I could get around and past his guard. He didn't seem to be expecting it when I finally came at him and, instead of meeting him head on, rolled past his guard and brought my sword round in a wide horizontal swipe that took of a good sized chunk of his health.\n\nThe rest of the first round continued like that, with me chipping away at his health until he finally fell. The second round started differently, he came right in on the attack, striking at me and putting me on the backfoot. I rolled away as fast as I could to get away from his attack. I managed to land a few hits hear and there but he was hurting me more than I was hurting him. I was going to lose if that kept up\n\nCharging up for a fast strike which would take of a huge chunk of my health if it landed, he came around for a final strike. You can shuffle back instead of rolling, it doesn't carry you as far but also doesn't leave you vulnerable to attack. So I started shuffling like a 50's singer and managed to dodge all three of his attacks along with the follow up. In the moment after his attack I brought my blade down it a heavy vertical strike and took of the rest of his health.\n\nHis body slumped to the floor and I sheathed my blade as I let out a breath I hadn't even known I was holding. I don't think I have ever felt happier at winning a game in my life.","July 13, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has easily eaten up a good chunk of my time just making me want to perfect my style of play with the character of my choice. The game offers amazing scenery to fight in wether it be on the streets of a suburb or a temple to a snowy village, the design is just breath taking. A lot of people like to say Blade Symphony has "Over Powered" characters, but this is not true they are easy to defeat if you take your time. You are given a wide assortment of weaponry ranging from Katanas, Rapiers and your Longsword. Every character is also given a ranged item to throw, none of them are any more powerful than the next, the only difference is the models. I myself have enjoyed this game and I believe that you would too if you are a fan of action based gameplay.\n\nI would recommend this game if:\n1. You like challenging swordplay.\n2.

I've played this game far too much over the past few weeks, and I've gotta share my thoughts.\n\nBlade Symphony is alright on its own. You can jump in and enjoy yourself, dueling against others and all, but the real fun is when you get a couple of friends to play it with you. I happen to have three other friends who also picked up the game, and boy is it fun. The true way to play the game is in a dueling fashion. You go up against another player in a one-on-one duel, which are very fun to do. There are three stances to take: fast, medium, and heavy. The heavier the attack, the more damage. I start off my fights with a heavy attack, quickly switching to fast attacks afterwards, then back to heavy after I've backed up a bit.\n\nThe sword fighting is excellently crafted, huge props to the work that went into it. We had a lot of fun stabbing each other for a good hour or two. After that, we took the game in a very different direction. The game has two modes: FFA and duel. You already know what duel is, but FFA is a bit different. FFA will take any of the duel maps and make it a large, open-world map for you and some buddies to mess around in. In this mode. you're able to parkour around the level, wall-running and such.\n\nDue to the various parkour features, we ended up playing hide-and-seek for several hours. It sounds ridiculous, sure, but it was so good. Specifically, there was one map we spent a ton of time on. This map resembled a mall, and it was HUGE, much larger than any of the other maps. The parkour features allowed us to find some pretty interesting spots to camp out at, one of my favorites being the very top of the mall, higher than the top floor. The best spot, discovered by a friend of mine, happened to be above the elevator in this map. It was a small, black room that a few of us hid in whilst playing.\n\nBlade Symphony is a fantastic game. It's still in development too, so there's much more to come, even in its already glorious state. I look forward to future additions to the game and highly recommend it.","March 4, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But a review is a review, so I'll delve into it more.\n\nBlade Symphony is a traditional fighting game except the main attraction of it is, as in the name, blades/swords.  Every match is a 2-out-of-3 match.  Your main weapon in this is a sword.  You can do the classic moves of any fighting game, such as grabbing, block-breacking, doing combos, etc.  Also, you do have a projectile, a smaller blade you could say.  But here is a main strength of the game: you cannot spam.  Instead, to throw you projectile, you have to charge the throw.  This is a good feature, especially for fighting game nuts like me since anybody who has played a fighting game online knows there are "annoying" experiances.  Not with Blade Symphony.\n\nAnyways, you have three techniques to your disposal: heavy, balanced, and fast.  Balanced is as it emplies, balanced.  This means you get a good mixture of some speed and some power.  It's a fundamental skill for not just the beginning of your experiance, but with every match you get into and your future experiance.  Heavy is soley based on raw power, meaning you can completely deplete your opponents health in only a few hits.  The downside is that you are extremely slow and any medicore-timed hit can have the opposition racking up combos and defeating you quickly.  You'll have to know your opponents moves and have good timing to use this technique to your advantage.  And last but not least is fast.  Fast is all about speed. Get a quick combo then move out of range, then strike again.  You'll have to play smart, because the disadvantage is that you have low damage.  Naturally, fast can, in most correctly used situations, dominate somebody who is using heavy.  Make sure that if you're using heavy and your enemy is using fast, switch to fast or balanced.  There are also four different characters to use, though they all depend on the user and how they use them.  You can also download swords of the workshop, non of them being overpowered.\n\nThe key of every match is patcience and timing.  Wait for your opponent to get within range, then strike according to the situation and their placement on the field.  Blade Symphony is honestly a great sword fighting game that feels like you're actually in the heat of battle.  Use timing, the three techniques, and the character you are using's moveset and strike.  Picking up this game was a real treat, and hopefully it is for you.  Definetly recommended to anybody who has a few bucks on them.","December 21, 2013","true","5.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

After finishing the tutorial and joining an online server I learned not only did i still have plenty to learn but how great the community is.\n\nThe game Is beautiful not only in its asthetics but also with the animations that all seem to flow really well together and in the heat of a duel it often looks like the 2 combatants are locked in dance rather than Combat.  The 4 different characters all have a Unique yet believable Fighting style which does suit certain sword types better than others but doesn't limit you.  (The first time you see a knight/samurai use a Rapier like it was a longsword you might laugh a bit.)  There is a character and sword combination for everyone.\n\nThere are no Upgrades or unlockables that change how you play or make you better the only thing that makes you more successful at the game is practice.  If you make a mistake you will know and most likely lose a large percentage of your health.\n\nThe community is friendly and if you are having trouble you could join pretty much any one of the servers and ask for help and get it.  Though there still are those few players who are venom (Those who are just rude and sore winners/losers) but for the majority Your duels will always end with "Good fight!" "well played"  "GG" "That was a close fight!"  Its rare these days to see a community who are so willing to help each other the only other game I can think of with such a good community would be the PAYDAY community.\n\nSo yes After all this ranting I would Recommend this game to anyone whether or not your a sword fighting enthusiast or just want to enjoy a solid game (did i mention its built on the source engine?)","June 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

This game has easily eaten up a good chunk of my time just making me want to perfect my style of play with the character of my choice. The game offers amazing scenery to fight in wether it be on the streets of a suburb or a temple to a snowy village, the design is just breath taking. A lot of people like to say Blade Symphony has "Over Powered" characters, but this is not true they are easy to defeat if you take your time. You are given a wide assortment of weaponry ranging from Katanas, Rapiers and your Longsword. Every character is also given a ranged item to throw, none of them are any more powerful than the next, the only difference is the models. I myself have enjoyed this game and I believe that you would too if you are a fan of action based gameplay.\n\nI would recommend this game if:\n1. You like challenging swordplay.\n2. You enjoy immersive and epic gameplay.\n3. You are a fan action based gameplay.\n\nI would not recommend this game if:\n1. You do not have patience, this game requires skill, and you can only do this by playing and getting better.\n2. You are not a fan of action based gameplay.","December 4, 2013","true","66.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The development team have done an excellent job so far, they have managed to create their own fighting/gameplay style which is very fun and strategic, allowing for your own tactics and methods to fight.\n\nThe different characters and weapons are all very interesting and offer variety, spoling its players.\n\nWhile this is 100% multiplayer, I can imagine having a great time relaxing in an FFA server, talking and dueling people as I please.\n\nThe music and graphics are fantastic, while each level/map is gorgeous and well designed.\n\nFor what they are trying to do, the developers succeed, very, very well! However, I am left hoping that something a little deeper can be integrated in the gameplay, to add some of the magic from jedi knight 2.

This game brings what most games failed to do.\n\nPositive: Skill Based Combat. In this game you won't see some 80 lvl Swordmaster who will obliterate you with his mind. You won't see a man (or a woman) with Legendary sword of DESTRUCTION that will kill you even when you look at it. No Such Thing. And that is the best part. Player that just started playing has just as much chance of winning the game as the one that created the game. Only your skill matters nothing more. Every item, skin, mask or anything else is just cosmetic. You like big swords like in final fantasy? Here you go, buy that longsword for ingame money but don't expect it to be better or more damaging thatn the one you have right now.\n\nNegative: This game is in early access stage, that means that there will be some problems. Like occasional lags, bugs and other annoying things. Currently there are only 4 classes and 5 weapon styles. Game doesn't have working AI for practice match (actually there is no AI for practice match). Matchmaking is non-existent. Some class balance issues. Automatic draw when time runs out etc.\n\nOverall: I would give this game solid 8/10. Only 8 because it is still in early stage and lacks some crucial things. But it's not 6/10 because it has great potential and has innovative ideas of skill based combat. It is essentially what I look in games where wallet-warriors don't exist, or at least don't matter. Where every player plays at the best of his abbility. There are no sure-way fool-proof tactics to win the duel. This game will be a MUST BUY in a few months time. Right now it is good but mark my words, it will get exponentially better","December 26, 2013","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After finishing the tutorial and joining an online server I learned not only did i still have plenty to learn but how great the community is.\n\nThe game Is beautiful not only in its asthetics but also with the animations that all seem to flow really well together and in the heat of a duel it often looks like the 2 combatants are locked in dance rather than Combat.  The 4 different characters all have a Unique yet believable Fighting style which does suit certain sword types better than others but doesn't limit you.  (The first time you see a knight/samurai use a Rapier like it was a longsword you might laugh a bit.)  There is a character and sword combination for everyone.\n\nThere are no Upgrades or unlockables that change how you play or make you better the only thing that makes you more successful at the game is practice.  If you make a mistake you will know and most likely lose a large percentage of your health.\n\nThe community is friendly and if you are having trouble you could join pretty much any one of the servers and ask for help and get it.  Though there still are those few players who are venom (Those who are just rude and sore winners/losers) but for the majority Your duels will always end with "Good fight!" "well played"  "GG" "That was a close fight!"  Its rare these days to see a community who are so willing to help each other the only other game I can think of with such a good community would be the PAYDAY community.\n\nSo yes After all this ranting I would Recommend this game to anyone whether or not your a sword fighting enthusiast or just want to enjoy a solid game (did i mention its built on the source engine?)","June 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The bulk of Blade Symphony's core fighting mechanics, duel mode stages, and  characters are well designed in general, but this makes the numerous flaws and incomplete areas that pop up all the more glaring.The tutorial itself gets things off to a poor start. While doing a decent job of explaining the basics of combat, it isn't complete. I also feel that the multiplayer aspect is also rather lackluster becuase it is focused mostly on dueling. I think this game has a chance to shine so I would still recommend it.\n","June 22, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is strong mod support for user-based content, adding a large variety to the customization potential. The music is very good at keeping you engaged in the extremely intense combat.\n\nAlthough you will be primarily using the mouse, the controls can be very tricky to master without lots of practice, and the learning curve is moderate to high - depending on whether you are used to aggressive, all-out-offense gameplay (you will find this game very difficult if that is your preferred playstyle). The tutorial is very helpful and critical to understanding the mechanics of the game - playing practice fights with the AI can help you get a grasp of how each character + weapon works. The combos are not complex since you are just moving and using the mouse, but things like timing, switching stances mid combo, parrying, and dodging are important to balance and master.\n\nThe feedback for where and how your sword will strike is provided by a faint aura showing the weapon path. Manipulate where you will strike by using the mouse and also by moving around. You can do air attacks by jumping first.\n\nThere are different types of weapons, like katanas, longswords, and scimitars. Each weapon has different characteristics - for example: the katana is a fairly advanced weapon, inflicting heavy damage during counterattacks, but weaker in overall regular attacks. The longsword is pretty balanced and has a good blocking move.\n\nYou have three different stances, fast, balanced, and heavy - you can switch at will by rolling the mouse wheel. Using these stances, there is a rock-paper-scissors element that becomes integral to survival in this game. When two swords hit at the same time, a parry happens; however, different stances will override the parry, inflicting damage and creating a window for counterattacking. You can switch stances in the middle of your combos, and this makes the game very intense when you are trying to strategize and outmaneuver your opponent.\n\nYou can also cancel attacks to feint, and the tutorial does a good job of teaching you how to do this.\n\nIn the beginning, when you are first learning to play, be prepared to die. A lot. If you play roguelike games or Demon/Dark Souls, you should be well accustomed to dying - it will be the same here. Even when you are defeating the AI consistently and with excessive ease, you will still die when you play online. Just remember, its all part of the learning process.\n\nI noticed that the connection time can get pretty lengthy, so that is something to consider - there is also no average wait timer, so you can't know for sure how long it will take to find/enter a match. There is also a lot of complaints about the card drop rate - if this is something you care about, I have found this game to have the most ridiculous drop rates. I still have 3 drops left, and others have reported only 1 drop in 8 hours. This isn't too big of a deal if you intend to play this regularly, but definitely be aware.\n\nThis game definitely takes a significant amount of skill, and I advise you to stay away if you intend to play casually or do not like games that are too difficult. Otherwise, give it a try, and you may find the challenge to be to your taste.\n\nRecommend.","July 14, 2014","true","7.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The fighting styles, the techniques, the way in which it's not just continuing clicking on the same damn button as if it was Mortal Kombat or any fighting game that requires amazing combos to beat a person yet they use the same button. ANYWAYS, this game let's you have the fun of kicking someones butt. Despite how many times you're going to lose at the beginning, you'll begin to understand that this game is not easy at it seems to be.\n\nSet aside from this, Blade Symphony is a third-person 3D swordfighting indie game which focuses primarly on multiplayer. It takes you to the basics of how swordsmen actually battle. Every attack has an opening so timing in this game is efficent or else you'll lose badly. You choose how you want to attack the person and which every attack, there's a different set of styles depending on the character you chose to play as. Advanced play has been primarily used by players who are masters in this game while the newcomers only know basic mechanics and so on. While the masters use all their flawless techniques, the newcomers would only not know how to time their attacks but also use basic fighting styles with little less combos that create openings for the masters. Many newcomers will not want to learn how to play the game therefore leading them to not only not knowing how to play it but losing in an instant to the masters or other players who had been learning this game for quite a while.\n\nOther than that, this game like I said before, I love it. It's awesome. The community in this game is not so mean but at the same, not so friendly. So you could say it's in the middle. I see no reason to get bored of this game when it's gamemode is primarily on multiplayer with Steam Workshop items you could download from. Learning how to play something will increase your benefit of actually having a chance to win at a battle rather just going on full force with one blow.Well, have a nice time in this game and wish you the best of luck!","May 31, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In reality, the game is nothing like that.  Yes, the graphics look good, but the rest of the game is pretty horrible.  They have you run through a tutorial on how the mechanics of the sword dueling goes.  They somewhat explain how the different styles work.  Then they throw you against AI to let you try them out.  Afterwards, you are left to go find a match and test your metal against other players.  Finding a match is a bear and because the matches support multiple contestants competing in a 1:1 battle, you usually find yourself sitting around spectating for a good portion.  Horrible matchmaking aside, that's not even the worst part.\n\nThe game mechanics you learn from the tutorial do not translate well against other human players.  Against AI who react and use dictated techniques the gameplay is fine.  But against users who can change styles, combo attacks, cancel actions, and can move anywhere of their own free will, it's VERY different.   Half the time you find yourself against people who are new (not their fault) and who rage over "cheap moves", which are really just the usage of the different "styles" to counter other styles (which is a game mechanic).  The other half are people who have realized that they can do things like cancel a combo at a certain time and instead choose a single move.  This means there's no consistency in the dueling.\n\nThe game sounds awesome in theory, but when they executed their ideas, they did so poorly and without proper testing (I assume, otherwise they released the game knowing of the issues and thought breaking the mechanics they set up was a good idea).  It's really not worth the money.  I picked the game up with a friend and even between the two of us, we had a hard time having fun with the game without mixing in other players.  The second you do, the game becomes even more miserable.","September 26, 2014","false","1.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

The community -- that is, people who have stuck with the game and are experienced -- were very polite and helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, I'd have to advise getting against this game because of the lack of a player-base. I had the luxury of playing during the Free Weekend which saw a big boost in player-population, but according to SteamCharts[0], the game's population always bounces back to pretty frighteningly-low levels after every sale/Freekend. And this isn't the type of game a noobie would want to get into, where only hardcore, experienced and dedicated people are playing it, ready to wipe the floor with someone who doesn't even know what they're doing yet. The accounts of other people also corroborate this problem (see the other reviews).\n\nThe forum community is also pretty toxic. So don't go there hoping to get a decent discussion about the game going.\n\nAnyhow, as far as mechanics go, the swordplay felt good and balanced, and I really enjoyed out-witting some of my foes, as well as the prospect of further polishing-up my technique/understanding and participating in mind-games - but that's likely because I was mostly playing people who weren't part of the dedicated player-base. I do question how the character/weapon balance will pan-out in mid-to-high level play. That always becomes an issue in these types of games.\n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't spend money on this unless it was a $1 or something. Play it if it ever goes on for a Free Weekend again.\n\n[0] http://steamcharts.com/app/225600","October 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

I couldn't tell if it was actually working. For a tutorial, that was absolutely shoddy. Never has a tutorial actually put me so far off from a game that I immediately stopped wanting to play it.

Attack animations are stiff and only one or so exists for each attack direction. Some attacks "hit" before their animation shows it should, giving a very cheap feeling to some stances and moves.\n\nWhile the concept is good, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend serious time on this game.","October 18, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

I can see that this would have a lot of potential but the downsides for me are that there's only one attack button (just with different stances), and they aren't kidding about only partial controller support - you cannot play this game without touching a keyboard (grab does not have a button by default), and you can't even navigate menus with the controller. I played most of the tutorial and jumped into an online game since there's no single player mode other than the tutorial. The online play experience seems to be mostly sitting around watching one really good guy slice people up until it's your turn to be destroyed and then go back to waiting. The one thing I did like about this is the level of character customisation, but it just wasn't fun to play. Overall I'd say Blade Symphony is like playing a brawler at home with a bunch of friends waiting for the loser to pass the controller to you - only without the friends. 3 out of 10, would not thrust.","October 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

After watching some videos of the game you can immediately recognise the Source engine, which made me doubt the game a little more. In the end I decided to try it. Aaand... it wasn't a bad choice!\n\nIn the begining you will propably be the "noob spamming fast attacks", but don't worry about that. Don't rush your experience, figure out some moves, watch others as they fight (FFA servers!), ask questions in the chat - the community is really helpful! Most of the players dig the atmosphere of the game - when a duel starts they nod, if a player writes something in chat (hovering icon over head) they don't take an advantage of the moment and kill you. Basically first 5 hours of the game -> 3 new steam friends :D\n\nThe game has a role play aspect to it, and I really hope the dev team will consider improving that even more. Blade Symphony is not just about the swords, but it's also about the social interraction.\n\nArcade Aspects\nYou can play this if you have like 15 minutes of free time, but only after you spend a couple of first hours in the game figuring it out. Many streamers on Twitch just jumped into the game with their friends and quitted after 10 minutes because they didn't have a clue what they were doing... Grab a coffe on a saturday morning and just play through the tutorial, figure stuff out on your own, no rush. After that you will be able to pick some fights, win/lose, have fun, and quit.\n\nTechnical Aspects\nBlade Symphony is using a highly extended Source engine. The only features I've recognised it from are the chat and the voip. Oh and the (high) framerates obviously. The graphics are very pleasing for the eye, and the motion blur fits the action perfectly.\nAbout the networking - Source can handle pings under 200ms pretty well. This aspect is very important when it comes to such an action game. Above 200ms duels become laggy and you might see your opponent attacking you from nowhere. To overcome that just don't play on Australia servers :D\n\nOverall\nReally entertaining, takes some time to figure out in the begining, great community!","May 22, 2014","true","27.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Where you either charge in or bait your opponent into a false sense of security and superiority then you hit them with the cold, hard and unforgiving edge of reality via the blade you wield in your very capable hands.\n\nYou see that this game feels like other games but it still has its own identity.\nIts not just some mindless hack and slash game. You gotta think, you gotta bait your opponent, you gotta find an opening before you strike or you could be on the receiving end of a painful and or deadly blow.\nIts a fighting game that has you thinking about the next swing you make before you make it.\nIt forces you to be defensive when fighting a quick opponent and forces you to keep up momentum against a slower opponent. It punishes you with a swift and bitter defeat if you rush in too quick or too  carelessly. It gives you a quick win if you time your strikes just right and hit that massive tier 3 charge attack.\n\nI love how Steam Workshop adds a variety of swords that you can use in combat as well as character personalization. You can actually wield an oversized pencil in combat. Think of how humiliating it would be for your opponent to lose to you. They wield badass swords, you wield a massive pencil and you dominate them. Just wow.\n\nAll in all this indie game is worth the money you put into it. If you still feel hesitant, pick it up during a sale. Beat up some swordsmen, customize your own and play. Download some new swords, practice those combos, charges and learn to parry.\n\n\nCheers","December 25, 2013","true","16.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Phalanx has ♥♥♥♥ moves that hardly do any damage, except for two of them that are spammed by any rank under the sun. Judge has some useless moves in balanced stance, but it does so much damage that it can literally one-hit. Ryoku's fast string is nearly impossible to avoid from any rank above iron. Perhaps they attempted to balance this by making his Balanced and Heavy stances into only 2 and 1 attacks, respectively, but all this did was make it incredibly easy to stick them in combos and do massive damage while dodging or knocking the opponent across the arena. Pure's moves are all weak, but they string together easily because of the massive reach of her balanced string. That is, unless the opponent is literally running away, which seems to be the current meta. Not to mention her entire strategy, which is to string together combos, is made disproportionately challenging due to the radical inconsistencies in the reach and speed of her attacks, both inter- and intra-stance. This is in high contrast with Vanguard, whose lunging and slashing through both fast and balanced strings remains fatally consistent. Oh, and did I mention that her left and right heavies are incredibly fast and her forward heavy can cross half the arena?\n\nDue to the flaws in characters, unreliable ranked servers, and a huge lag in rank updating (the ranked servers even went down while I was playing, reverting many people to Oak and taking away their notes), the ranking system is meaningless. The only tiers that show a slight bit of coherence are Iron (I just got the game) and Master (I'm decent). Even then, some Masters can barely hold a sword and some Oaks are nearly undefeated. Oh, and capes. Probably once a signifier of being a "pillar of the community" or whatever, capes hardly mean much. One guy got a cape for helping a staff member find out why his computer was running slowly at the time. Should give you a bit of scope on the situation there, and how much professionalism to expect.\n\nYes, some attempts at balancing is made, but these are sluggish at best due to the lack of speed and professionalism that the staff is known for. And while I won't recount them in detail, I constantly heard of petty incidents among staff members-- tantrums, schisms, squabbles, you name it. Times are grim, and the dev team is much more geared towards changing the game according to an IRC room rather than identifying and solving problems themselves, and possibly with the help of skilled and respected community members.\n\nAnd all that talk about the community being the best? Horribly false, unless I'm overestimating the other gaming communities. Yes, people will tell you how to use certain attacks, and yes, some people are willing to teach you a bit on how to use certain classes, and yes, people bow sometimes. However, the community is still riddled with the same amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and bigotry as any other gaming community. Anyone who reports otherwise is probably just sucking ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAll in all, this game is decaying-- Great players are leaving, "balance" is never achieved, tournaments are being cancelled. It's fun with friends, and I'd love to play it if it finally becomes enjoyable with strangers. Get it while it's on sale, but not for $14.99.\n\nSOURCES:\nPersonal experience within all ranks, including Master and Oak.\nPersonal experience within all classes, including the new Vanguard.\nPersonal experience in the best and worst servers in terms of connection speed and quality of players.\nIn-game text and voice chats with highly experienced players.\nSteam text chats with highly experienced players.\n\nNo, I didn't include EVERYTHING about the characters in here. Just what came to mind.\nIf you want to argue with me, you're welcome to, but there needs to be more than "in my matches, it's like this" or anything similar. Try to stay objective.\nPLEASE prove me wrong, though. I like having fun playing games and I don't like wasting money.","December 23, 2014","false","433.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It involves 3D Movement, you have a much higher time limit, no unfair abilities, and the whole game is "relaxing" too.\n\nAs for combat, there is no kind of absurd "button combos" (like pressing right, down, right + attack just for a special move), but instead it's all using your mouse's left click, where holding a side movement key will change the attack.\nThere are 4 kinds of battle stances: Light, Medium, Heavy and Air. Switching to these is instant (Air is automatic) and can be done between attacks to make your own mix, depending on your playstyle. "Combos" are actually just following attacks from a specific stance, maybe mixing them with another stance, but every stance has a limit (varying with the characters) where if you reach it, and if it's the longest chain limit, you will be left vulnerable for a brief moment. You can charge attacks, grab enemies, and use throwing weapons (Tomahawks, Ninja Stars and Knives).\n\nBut the amazing part of this game is: Steam Workshop support. You can literally pick any sword or mask that is approved (almost every one of them), download it, and use it in any server, and everybody else will be able to see it too.\n\nThe community for this game is really nice too, but there is some bad players (Cowards, Bad losers, spammers, quitters). They are very rare to see, though. Rare enough to not even matter.\n\nTL;DR: This game is very unique and is almost the first of it's kind, and I'd love to call it a Fencing game. I give it a 9/10 (not a full 10, because of a small lack of content). Highly reccommended.","May 22, 2014","true","9.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/az019er/recommended/225600/","az019er","az019er","http://steamcommunity.com/id/az019er/","218 products in account","As a newcomer to the Blade Symphony scene, it is best to describe the first impressions as that is what most games hook you in with. That being said, Blade Symphony is not like most games - it is a special gem that is being developed as we speak and with time it shall be worth much more than it is now; this I am sure of.\n\nBlade Symphony is a 3D sword-fighting games with an abundance of swords to use. It is a splice between arena based combat and arcade style fighting with a limited amount of characters to choose from but a large supply of weapons to pick. There are two servers included within the online component of the game (the 'chapters' for single player use are currently being expanded upon).\n\nThere is the 'Free For All' or 'FFA' server in which all players roam around the map to either make as many enemies as they want or challenge others to duels. A good addition to this is the lack of interference from other players during duels - while roaming you can see others duel and you cannot interfere with them. Not to say you can't fight without challenges - during FFA, you can potentially fight all other players on the map at once.\n\nThere is also the 'Duel' servers. These contain a series of fighting stages on a map that you scroll through and 'queue' for in an effort to fight. When a second player also signs up for the board you then duel them in a one on one battle. Who ever is hosting can change the dueling modes to support 2 v 2 battles - the possibilities are varied!\n\nOn the single player side, a nice little tutorial is in place that, for now, is the only major showcase for AI in the single-player portion. Although I have not played with bots, they also exist for certain servers.\n\nCombat is varied depending on the character chosen. In a similar fashion to Mortal Kombat, Tekken and Street Fighter, you have a choice of your character that you use (and in FFA you can switch when outside of battle). There are four characters each with their own fighting style. Pure, Phalanx, Ryoku and Judgement have different playstyles involved as well. While combat is usually high-paced among the visually lighter characters, don't be alarmed when fights take a slower pace. The ability to make your character 'walk' is as useful as the ability to 'run' on walls and manuever yourself.\n\nFind yourself fighting an impatient 'fast' stance fighter? Switch to a 'heavy' or 'balanced' stance and take it slower by walking. Of course, using the fighter's to their best ability is done by using their innate techniques. It's better to take a heavy stance with Judgement than it is with Ryoku - but the game doesn't penalize you for taking it your own way. Finding your own technique among the four characters is part of the heart and challenge to this game. Don't be thrown off by the achievement statistics for winning one round. If you have the will to learn and the luck, you'll win your first round in no time.\n\nA major part of the combat system to note is the combo system. Labeled as a 'multi-hit' the more attacks you link together in one string of movement adds to the counter; not taking damage helps. As you hit more than once the amount of damage dished out is increased, depending on the weapon. Characters don't have a set value for multi-hits but, because of the different speeds and styles, all can give out a different amount of comboed moves. Ryoku is a character that relies on the multi-hits when using weaker weapons because it increases the amount of damage he can give out. Judgement, however, relies less on this system, but, when a player uses it, it still benefits him in the same way it would Ryoku - it increases the output of his attack. With the fast paced battle taking place, it's imperative to complete multi-hits as necessary to win faster and mitigate the risk of losing.\n\nThe character design is hard to pinpoint - take sci-fi, steampunk, Eastern and Western influences and mash them together. That's a less eloquent way to describe the over-arching character costumes in appearence. It is harder to simply into a system when you get far enough to customize your character (described further down).\n\nIt's important to note that with so many factors involved, choosing from four characters is far from a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. Outcomes are reciprocated of player skill - at rare times is it up to your luck. If you learn from your mistakes quickly, this unforgiving dueling game can really shine and help.\n\nThis game is rewarding but such rewards are slow and take time and effort to attain them. You can customize and adorn your  four cool characters by adorning them with masks and skins - for a price. While there are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS in this game (a +), the system at which you gain the monetary units ('notes') can be seen as slow and tedious. No doubt, it's one of the minors in this upcoming game and it shouldn't deter you at all. The slow gain of 'notes' only impede character design and weapon unlocking. It rewards those who play the longest - or rather, the more you play, the more it pays. That said, it's a good way of differentiating the new comers from the more experienced sword masters. And while you can unlock more weapons, masks and skins you do not lose or gain an overbearing advantage over others. As long as you have control, the basic set of weapons are as deadly as the most brazen.\n\nCapes, as of now, are also unlocked by completing special and secret objectives as you play. No doubt another rewarding factor for this game.\n\nThe characters?\n\nPure is a refined and acrobatic character - think Wushu fighting. With agile swordsman ship and experienced user skill she can be deadly - if you find yourself in a 2 v 2 against two skilled Pure users, you are definitely at a disadvantage. Pure is an offensive character that is best played by switching stances rapidly and soundly. Don't let up on your opponent lest they get the drop on you. Loosening the pressure is recommended however to open up the dueler's defenses when they lack an opening.\n\nRyoku is agile, fast but unrefined - he's great for stringing combos together and less useful at hitting hard. For him you'll want to build up your combos instead of vying for a one-hit kill. The fast paced action of this game suits him as you'll find yourself overcome if you fought these guys in a 2 v 2. The Scimitar is a fan-favorite for the Ryoku user as it allows them to (cheaply) build up 'multi-hits' and dole out punishment in the boss way the character defines.\n\nUnless you are:\n\nPhalanx. This guy. This guy is one I dislike - in a good way. He's a very plyable fencer that can strike from afar but will deal the necessary damage up close. He's also useful for stringing combos up and whipping an enemy into shape. With an experience player using him, he'll no doubt be the true challenge to beat. Watch out for Phalanx. They'll get you when you least expect it.\n\nJudgement is a heavy hitting samurai. His default character, adorned in armor, has no trouble signifying how hard his experienced hand will come down upon his unlucky opponent. While he isn't as agile and swift as the other three, his recommended katana is useful for beating down the other. It's best to chalk Judgement up as one of the simpler to use. His slower speed allows for an easier string of combos if necessary by the less experienced player. He is, however, not a dominant combo chainer, his being the smaller out of all of them. Bulky and sluggish are in no way to describe him however. He is no doubt a tank and can take out a hit as well as dish them out - high damage with low speed if you look at it in technical terms.\n\nIn the end, Blade Symphony is no doubt a game for those who like swords, arcade fighting-games and arena based combat.\n\nIt is not a game for those who enjoy first person visuals, puzzle solving, platformers or role-playing games. Fast combat is not for slow players!","November 28, 2013","true","9.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Maybe in some time if they put more work into it, but right now it was not worth the $2 to play it in this early access form.","December 21, 2013","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

With full Workshop availability, customization and visuals, this allows for an extremely immersive and relatable experience.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the different types of weapons, characters, and skill sets make each matchup its own experience, and perpetuates the adventure and strategic value within the game! Figuring out different swords, characters and combos with each make for a fun game, and one that retains balance - an important concept to consider when it comes to fighting games!\n\nThe ranked system should be explained in more detail, but otherwise seems to be fair judgment. To put it simply, this game is an incredible experience, amazing detail to graphics and sword techniques in the real world, and makes for an interesting and fun, renewed experience that players are sure to love.","May 24, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's got a street-fighter vibe to it, or a 1v1 in Super Smash Bros. Except you're dueling with swords. I don't think it can really get any better than that. There are four characters with four very distinct personalities when it comes to fighting, and each can be manipulated to suit a certain fighting style, especially with weapon selection. All-in-all, it's a really fun game and the players seem like a nice enough community. The inclusion of Steam Workshop is an awesome plus too. Ever wanted to fight with the Master Sword? A lightsaber?

Let me start off by saying if it hadn't been for this free weekend I'd never have picked it up.. or rather never would have tried it, as I didn't pick it up.\n\nI absolutely loathe the asian theme, the futuristic art-style, the over-the-top animations, the character design...basically the entire presentation of this game doesn't so much speak to me as it does shout "Stay away. Far away".\n\nHowever that is a personal preference and even though I'm essentially right in this I am also aware of the fact that there are people who have the audacity to be wrong and like this sort of stuff. Not much you can do about that.\n\nBut the game isn't just looks, so let's ignore those for now.\n\nThe fighting, the heart of this game.. well it isn't bad. It is actually rather enjoyable to begin with.\nIt is however rather repetitive after a while. This is not - as some other people commenting here seem to think - due to a lack of content but rather due to a lack of input.\nI actually like the fact that weapons are uniform across characters and I could do without the different character-traits as well. Purely cosmetic characters - making the outcome of a fight only about input-skill&speed rather than character attributes feels cleaner to me.\n\nInput however is the problem.\nYou have far too little actual control to actually do something creative in your attacks, which means it all comes down to timing. Once you have ascertained that your timing is better than the opponents the fight is more or less over and will play out accordingly.\n\nI'm not going to go into balancing because I haven't played enough of it to actually notice - or care - and I've also limited myself to the Longsword, as it is the only of the weapons in this game I actually give a toss about. So while there might be balancing issues - there almost certainly are, would be the first multiplayergame not to have those - I can't comment on those.\n\nI can however comment on performance.\nSome of the maps are rather mess as far as performance is concerned and - as with all melee games - if your ping rises or isn't stable it will have significant impact on your experience.\nThe performance-drops I noticed aren't significant enough to be blamed for getting defeated in combat (outside of really close matches on a very high skill-level which didn't really affect me all that much) but they are really irritating and a drag on the amount of joy the flow of combat delivers.\n\nThis flow sadly isn't all that great either. If your opponent is fast enough you can get locked-in by combo-attacks which basically drain most of your life before you are able to defend yourself (as you can't block mid-combo, you can block it entirely or not at all in my experience). Similarly you can get yourself locked into the combo-animation and killed because you didn't hit the opponent but also were unable to respond to his attacks. Cancelling animations to perform new actions would obviously break the animation-style the game aims for, so unfortunately there is little to be done about this.\n\nThis highlights the input problem, combo-animations may look nice (to other people) but fighting with individual attacks&strikes gives you much more control over your character and combat in general.\n\nRight now the game is very heavily discounted and I can't bring myself to buying it, even though - despite the named issues - I had a couple of really enjoyable fights in this game.  Not even worth the 4€ they are asking for it right now, at least not to me.","October 18, 2014","false","3.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are elements of a traditional fighting game like frame traps, positioning, and combos, combined with the freedom and nuance of Jedi Academy.  I played a LOT of Jedi Academy back in the day and although I had a lot of fun with it, I can't honestly say that there wasn't a lot of randomness in how some fights played out.  Saber clashes weren't always consistent, and sometimes you just got lucky.  There's very little if any of that here.  The Fast/Balanced/Heavy stance system creates a very logical rock-paper-scissors type system to sword clashes.  In this game I can almost always say exactly things turned out the way they did and there's a logical way to combat different strategies.  It really does a great job of capturing the "easy to learn, hard to master" environment that most competitive games strive for.  Speaking as both a traditional fighting game fan and a fan of Jedi Academy back in the day, this is a fantastic sword fighting game that I'm going to be putting a lot more hours into.","January 13, 2014","true","71.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Judgement hits like a truck, but is very slow and easy to dodge. Phalanx hits hard and fast, but most of his attacks take hella accuracy. Pure and Ryoku are similar in the sense they both use kicks and flips in their basic attacks. Ryoku's attacks are very short range, making it easy for a decent Phalanx or Judgement to pick him off. Pure so far I've noticed has no downsides. Huge range, impossible to hit, lots of DPS. OP need nerf.

Blade Symphony has a lot to offer and the community is great, at times.

This is not your typical fighting game despite what you may think. I give this game a 9.5/10 stars on my list.

When you play games like this, you want to become skilled, you want a stats that show you how well you are doing compared to others. While this game does offer that, it offers it in a very lackluster way. To a new player it is very hard to know what server is ranked and what isn't, causing most people to have a bad w/l ratio from the begining. Past that you can ONLY get elo from people in your divison, which is ridiculos. You can lose to someone 3 divions below you, or in return beat someone 3 divions above you and get nothing. Second off your rank is based on your world chart rank. Diamond is the top 2-10%, and master is the top 1%. This means that the longer the ladder is up, the harder it is to get division promotions, what sound like a good thing is acctualy a very horrible thing, as the game does something very stupid to help new players get diamond/master.\n\nWhen you win/lose a game, you gain/lose mmr bassed on your "expected" performence against that player. Lots of variables are used, their w/l, your w/l, their elo, your elo, and worse of all... time. If you play ranked constantly you will start gaining little to no elo, making it impossible to rank up.\n\nThe ranked system is complete trash, you can go from oak-iron-diamond-master-oak all in one day, and it fels extremly unrewarding. It needs a massive improvment, along with a better matchmaking system. Overall its a solid game, but the ranked system is in DIRE need of work.","May 14, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When I saw Blade Symphony I thought it would be a similar disaster. But this was good because I was completely wrong about this game. I love games like legend of zelda and no more heroes, especially the sword mechanics, and the ones in this game... are brilliant. It's strategy on steroids. There are so many variations in how you can play that it's just... unbelievable. I heard the guy who made this game spent 8 years on it. To the creator of this game. If you see this then I want to say thank you. When someone shows dedication to making a game like this the rewards should be great. The graphics remind me of the kind of style in the infinity blade games. Before I give my final thoughts I'd like to acknowledge one more aspect. The music. It's a blast to listen to while fighting.\n\nAll of this combined made an epic setting for a video game that I haven't seen in years. This is innovative, and should not be overlooked.\n\n10/10","June 10, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In my honest opinion, it should be a bit cheaper, but its worth every cent: the swordfighting is good, the community has a honor code (kinda cool if you want to keep the  blind swordsman roleplaying thing alive) AAAAND the sometimes really soothing and chilling music.\n\nIf i had to say something bad about the game it is the fact that there is no real singleplayer experience, so you have to go on your own to perfect your technique. But hey, its not impossible, i have become a decent phalanx after a day, and i keep learning and learning from this.\n\nIts just a matter of time that they release more classes and weapons, and I hope i get to see you over here!!\n\njust a few things if you consider buying the game so you dont really lose your mind:\n\n- Bear in mind that every character has 3 different sequences of combos, and each sequence can be exchanged by selecting the stances.\n-Also, bear in mind the weapons used and their user. A phalanx doesnt do a lot of damage with say a jian, but give him a foil and he is deadly because of his fighting style. the same applies to judgement with the katana/longsword.\n-Each weapon has a blocking mechanic. Katana has a standard block, jian has a intercept ability, foil has guard (weaker block, but ability to move)\n- Bow with the B key, tease with the v key. 90% of the time i get a bow before a fight. Make sure you do that too to your oponent, it shows your respect. Also, dont throw ♥♥♥♥ at them when the battle starts, thats dishonorable.\n- Keep your camera on the oponent AT ALL TIMES. watch his flaws, study quickly his openings. thats when you should strike with fast attacks.\n\nYeah, i hope to see you there, add me if this helped you decide to buy it and well play some rounds.

What's even better is it's not even out of Beta yet.  I had to try it out for myself so I immediately purchased this title.  Let me just say, it was even better playing it.  The graphics are heavenly, the gameplay is seemless, and the idea is great.  It's like playing a free-roam Soul Caliber game that allows you to challenge players on the fly.  Very easy to get a hang of the controls. A good amount a blade swing variations.  There are even different stances you can switch between while you are fighting in order to give you 2 slower, more powerful swings or 4 faster, less effective swings.  Brilliant arenas to fight in.

You can download different swords to use and masks to wear.\nSpeaking of swords and masks, the game offer many different types of swords to match your playstyle. From Longswords to Scimitars and Katanas to Rapiers, Blade Symphony really let's the player choose.\nAswell as having the many swords to choose from, you can choose one of four different characters each with their own unique way of fighting to suit you. The customization is endless in this game!\nThe graphics are where this game falls short. The game itself looks great but there's much more potential. For a game like Blade Symphony graphics are just as important as gameplay.\n\nBlade Symphony has something I've never seen before in it's genre of game. It's hard to pinpoint what it is that makes this game so enjoyable. Maybe it's the online servers with hundreds of people to meet, duel and make friends with. Maybe it's how well it works and co-operates with it's players. Maybe it's just the whole game!\n\nIn closing, I think Blade Symphony is a fantastic and cutting edge game in it's genre that is focused towards the players enjoyment of the game. I really recommend you pick it up and try this game out, I sincerly think you'll like it.","July 17, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Oh and heres the review---->  First off its pure tactical, no button mashing here folks. Secondly the fluid movement makes fighting hell'a'lotta fun and knowing and predicting enemy movements and counteracting thier style with yours makes you feel like every hit counts. This game is purely unforgiving and any slip ups can mean certain failure so you need to concentrate on the enemys every movement and play tacticaly based on it. If he opens himself up after an attack jump in and smash him, but dont stay in too long or you will get sliced up by his come back slashes. All-in-all this game deserves a 9/10 in its current condition. Of course its still in beta and there are some minor balancing issues but all will be buffed out for final release, so in short i reapeat "OMFG GET EET NAO!"","May 19, 2013","true","104.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are elements of a traditional fighting game like frame traps, positioning, and combos, combined with the freedom and nuance of Jedi Academy.  I played a LOT of Jedi Academy back in the day and although I had a lot of fun with it, I can't honestly say that there wasn't a lot of randomness in how some fights played out.  Saber clashes weren't always consistent, and sometimes you just got lucky.  There's very little if any of that here.  The Fast/Balanced/Heavy stance system creates a very logical rock-paper-scissors type system to sword clashes.  In this game I can almost always say exactly things turned out the way they did and there's a logical way to combat different strategies.  It really does a great job of capturing the "easy to learn, hard to master" environment that most competitive games strive for.  Speaking as both a traditional fighting game fan and a fan of Jedi Academy back in the day, this is a fantastic sword fighting game that I'm going to be putting a lot more hours into.","January 13, 2014","true","71.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Every encounter is uncertain but winnable, and the multilpe fighting styles are tuned for balance in very interesting and, to my knowledge, original ways.\n\nThere are a few games (Blade Symphony, Clang by Subatai and Sui Generis by Bare Mettle come to mind) currently in development that are seriously concerned about getting melee fighting RIGHT.
