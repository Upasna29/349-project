Have you ever played the perfect game? Have you ever tasted food so good you went into a coma for 2 weeks? Have you ever felt a love worth more than life it self? This is what Pat & Mat symbolizes to me, it is the very peak of human ingenuity. I have played many games in my time but none have touched me like Pat & Mat, The story is simple yet elegant There are no cut scenes and the story is shown simply through Pat & mat's interactions and how they deal with the struggles we all face in everyday life. In doing this they show us we are not alone in the world, they show us that life is about more than the money you earn and the things you own, they show us what it means to be human.\n\nThis is more than a video game, it's a way of life...

The things we usually take for granted. Our protagonists 'Pat & Mat' live a rather simplistic existence as handymen in an unnamed Czechoslovakian city (easily mistaken, by the uninformed, for a rustic hamlet) where life plods along at a snails pace. Indeed, the setting is incredibly tranquil and as one might imagine, this placidity is reflected in both Pat & Mat's temperament. To say that the duo are relaxed in any way, would be a massive understatement, yet they are no strangers to a little bit of hard work. Even their simple life style comes with the odd challenge (ones that some players may not appreciate, due to their urban locale) yet they never falter in the face of in surmountable odds and always pull through in the end, even if their schemes are ill thought out at the best of times. Whether they player can appreciate their twisted logic will determine how much they get out of the game.\n\nIndeed, even when it comes to something as simple, as say, the construction of a mini golf course, their own unique ingenuity shines through, who else would thing to cover a course in sand after all? Let alone the construction of several courses over a sizeable body of water, whilst neglecting either any standing area for the player or mounting platforms to make reaching aformentioned courses possible.\n\nHow they managed to construct these, despite professing to be mere handymen, is beyond my knowledge (presumably they are lying to me, after all, Pat (or perhaps Mat?) claimed to have taken 17 hours to finish a single course, when really, it was possible to do so after only three, perhaps they merely did not wish to hurt my pride? I would not put it past them, the cheeky scamps) but regardless, it is presumably for that same reason that they later found themselves short of supplies to construct the remaining courses.\n\nThe knowledge of this left me a little hurt, as I had expected a little more, especially since mini golf was one of only four games on the main menu and in total only had a play time of roughly ten hours. For 39p, I could hardly complain. I will privately shake a first in the twins direction but nothing more, they are not deserving of my ire, not today.\n\nIn short, if you are wondering, is this game for me? Then ask yourself how much you enjoy taxing puzzles. If you are a self professed puzzle fanatic (like myself) and felt a little bit let down by the linearity of the new Thief game, then look no further, this is the challenge you have been waiting for, though the overarching plot is nowhere near as forboding, the characters still retain a certain amount of charm that will invariably win you over, with time, should you allow them into your heart. All I can say, is to be patient with this one; invest yourself in its charming narrative and with time, you will surely reap what ye sow.\n\n","March 3, 2014","true","0.5"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","30","43","3","0"

But overall I'd say this game won't keep you busy for long I played all modes ( although I didn't finish the golf scenario) in 3 hours. So that's that.\nThe musical score is the original from the series and matches the game perfectly.\nGraphically it's no masterpiece but a piece of solid work, with a lot of attention for detail.\nI bought this game for 0,99 $ when it was on sale for the Xmas Sale on Steam.

Out of my love for Pat & Mat I was very curious about the game but it consists for like 5% of the actual Pat & Mat feeling (The very short "Car Repair" episode) and 95% of minigames. I had good fun going through the "Car Repair" episode because that really gave the good ol' Pat & Mat feeling but it was over before I knew it... There were at least 5 empty slots for extra episodes but if those episodes will be as short as the "Car Repair" episode (and I bet they will be since they seem to be using the episode moneymilking business model) I'm not going to buy them, not enough of the actual good ol' Pat & Mat content.\n\nSo yeah, I'm very disappointed by the game. I wish there were much much more and much longer actual episodes to play to get the real Pat & Mat feeling instead of all this minigame crap.\n\nOnly buy it if you really really REALLY R E A L L Y like Pat & Mat (or 3 different types of minigames, jigsaw, memory, and minigolf).","March 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","1"

Despite this minor shortcoming though, Pat & Mat does work well with the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions and also features controller support (although I could not get the game to recognize mine).  There are a variety of puzzle modes, including standard jigsaw, but what really stands out here is the inclusion of multiplayer.  Not too many puzzle games offer this option, so for that feature alone it is worth giving Pat   & Mat a try.  The gameplay will probably not have mainstream appeal, but is ideal for children in the 7-10 age group as well as casual gamers looking for a small diversion.","April 18, 2012","true","0.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

I liked the mechanics and the way some actions reguired to use both Pat and Mat was pretty need. But all this just ads to the disapointment, feels like wasted potential. Obiviously devs knew what they were doing. The graphics were in my opinion very good and the art style was perfect for the game. Looked pretty much just like the show and it did gave me the nostalgic feels. The soundtrack as well was spot on, fitted perfectly. I mean this game was so close to being the best point & click game of the year. Just one problem, ONLY ONE PUZZLE. Im sorry for being so repetive but Im just in awe of disapointment. Atleast I learned not to trust anything game related that comes from old soviet countries, looking at you Stalker, another game that was so close to being amazing.\n\nDont buy, plunder of the century","March 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

Bought it for £0.80 at a discounted price, but I  would not pay the full price of £4.00. Is seems like there were supposed to be 5 episodes in the game, but there is only 1 available. WTF, developers? 3 different and boring minigames do not make up for missing 4 episodes!!! It's a joke! Yeah, it was fun to play the 1st one, but I finished it in 15 minutes, and now I'm left with silly minigames... Unless the rest of the episodes will be unlocked by playing the minigames? This is not explained anywhere. I surely hope that they are not going to release the remaining episodes as a "DLC" as this would be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of! So yeah, if you liked the animated series as a kid, get this game for 80 pence, otherwise stay away, it would be a total waste of money.","May 16, 2014","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Phylkan/recommended/65710/","Phylkan","https://www.eple.no/juice.html","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Phylkan/","102 products in account","This game follows two /or perhaps just one) inmate in a post-Sovjet Russian mental asylum. Patryev and Matovsky, their real names unknown, are completely, 100% clinically insane. Schizofrenic to the brain-stem; they believe that they are in fact handymen in the Czech countryside, helping what is only vague after-images of people they once knew.\n\nThat is the story, as far as I know, as anything else goes unmentioned in the game itself.\nNow, if that doesn't draw you in, there are three more things I'll take a look on: Gameplay, Audio, and Video. Oxford comma for added effect. And readability.\n\nThey claim that "...gamers will enjoy original approaches and non-typical puzzle solving." I guess that is enjoyable. If it is true. The only way the puzzle-solving is intuitive in the matter they claim, is by being completely nutjob insane. An example; in the first puzzle, that I'll samelessly inform you I didn't manage to solve, due to reasons I'll come back to later, one of the two (I don't know which, they never tell) punctures his car-tyre, while driving to gods-know-where. They then decide to follow some weird plan they found on the ground, and saw their own fence in half with some chainsaw just lying on the ground, most likely rusted to the very core, and turn a tree into a non-functional crane with the planks. I won't spoil too much, and I can't spoil either, since I haven't played much further, but apparently there is some kind of DYI minigolf-course later on, as well as dressup-minigames. Cool!\nEither way, my game bugged out, and one of the two stood still, lifting and putting down a brick floating two metres behind him, and in the end the level ended up unfinishable. By that point I was on the verge of passing out (from laughing), so I quit. The humor is there.\n\nThe audio in the game consists solely of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounds for the chainsaws and cars and murder-weapons and whatnot, as well as the worlds most anoying ever-looping jazz-pop soundtrack. That's to say, they leave about twenty seconds of nothing in between the overly cheerful tunes, possibly only to spite. It's absolutely horrible to listen to in the long run, and I'll confess that it's likely one of the major reasons for my forthcoming suicide.\n\nFinally, the visuals. I have to say, this is probably the best part of the whole game (You hear that, CoD-boys‽). That, sadly, doesn't say overly much in the game's favour. Now, I have never seen "...the popular TV series..." that is "...well known in many countries all over the world." (The Czech Republic) I have quite simply never had the chance; I have never heard of it before. Therefore, I can't tell if the game features "The very same Pat and Mat you know from your TV."\nHowever, after some quick Google'ing, I can tell you that the Czech in the game is way of, and that the visuals are as well.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to everyone who can't decide if they want to kill themselves, as well as "Casual players..." who "...will like the humor and easy-to-use controls..." (That's a lie, by the way.\n\nSeriously, though, ♥♥♥♥ this game.\nDisclosure: I played half an our of this game, which should be enough, according to other reviews.\nHowever, 80% of those thirty minutes were spent laughing at a glitch.","December 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

You start off in a menu with amazing music and amazing graphics. You get to choose which out of the 4 gamemode's you want to play. There's a puzzle gamemode which is hard af, it's almost impossible to get gold on ANY level even on the first one. The goal is to complete a puzzle as fast as possible with the least amount of tries. The puzzles all include Pat & Mat which is a really good thing in my opinion because I'm a really big fan of them.\n\nThere's also an amazing gamemode where you'd have to complete a minigolf course as fast as possible. This is also very hard but I thought it was easier than the puzzle gamemode. The background music was also really good and relaxing. You can also make your own minigolf course which I haven't done yet because I think it's quite boring to make a course myself.\n\nI haven't played the other 2 gamemodes yet which kind of shows how amazing the other 2 are. One of them is about Pat & Mat working together or something like that. The other one is called a Fashion Show. The point of this gamemode is to remember the things they were wearing or holding.\n\nI'll rate this game 10 out of 10 golfballs.

She could barely walk and she moved very slowly. She looked outside to see where she was, and to her dismay she was no longer in a Spanish-speaking country. She turned on the television and found out that all the channels were in English, except for Univision. She also saw American flags outside. Raquel was in the United States, but she wasn't living in Los Angeles; she was in a rural area.\n\nWas it all a dream? It must have been, because she didn't speak a word of Spanish. She didn't have any family in Mexico, either. As a matter of fact, she had no immediate family; they were all dead.\n\nShe looked in a mirror and noticed that there was a contrast between her real face and what she looked like in her dreams. Raquel was not a young lady, but a geriatric woman rotting away on a farm with her feline companions. She never found love in her real life; Arturo was just the man of her dreams, and she could no longer live without having him by her side. She said, "I'd rather burn on Hades' grill than live another minute without my beloved Arturo!" These were her last words before she fell into an eternal sleep due to her overdose on Lortab.","March 10, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

My entire other family hates me because they don't belive me when I tell them that I am a rich nigerian prince and that they are my cousin. My social life is a disater because every time I try to talk to someone, I sploge squid ink all over their faces.\n\nLife sucked, but everything changed when I was introduced to the shakeweight. Now my life is a whole lot better cause I can now give amazing handjobs AND I lost 50 pounds in two weeks. But my entire life also changed when I was introduced to this amazing game where two gay guys try to fix a car. Thanks Pat an mat!

The music from the show is right where you want it to be.\n- the point & click segment is excellent, but sadly quite short.\n- the jigsaw puzzle segment is nicely animated and works well, once they've introduce dall the gameplay elements\n- the minigolf segment is surprisingly good.\n- the animation quality is excellent and faithful to the source material\n- the resolution & options are a little obfuscated, but they are excellent once you change them to proper settings. was not expecting x8 AA and x16 anisotropic filtering running on 1080p 60+ fps\n- would reccommend to the young 'uns or the nostalgic.
