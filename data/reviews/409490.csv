"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/409490/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRogue Harvest is an open world survival adventure where you must explore, scavenge, craft and fight to survive in an unknown place hoping to find answers about what happened to you.\n\nIn Rogue Harvest you play the role of someone who has found themselves somewhere they don't know with no memory of who he is or how he got there. You must survive in this strange place long enough in the hopes that your memories or some answers will come back to you.\nOnce you start the game you'll find yourself in a small wooden house with only an axe, hammer and pickaxe. You'll also find a little produce growing near your house but other than that, it's just you and your tools. You have main stats that you'll need to monitor which are health and energy and without keeping these full you'll die very quickly. Energy depletes over the day and can be regained by eating raw or cooked food, and Life will drop as you're attacked and can be refilled by using medicinal herbs. Keep an eye on these because once you die it's game over and you'll have to restart entirely but since the maps are procedurally generated, each run will be a little different.\n\nYou'll soon find that the world you're in is not a peaceful one and you'll need to find some way to protect yourself against those you encounter. Your first priority will be finding yourself some resources and crafting the basics such as a crafting table, oven, bed and a sword (though, maybe not in this order). You can easily find trees for wood and large areas of stone for any ore and stone needs you might have along with many other useful items either growing in the wild or dropped from mobs but you'll need to be careful; there is no map in Rogue Harvest so you'll only have your footsteps (which are marked on the ground) to retrace. Once you have your basics you'll need to  craft yourself a weapon fairly quickly so you have a little defence and you'll also want to expand your shelter. The rest is up to you.\n\nAs you interact with the world during resource gathering and combat you'll find yourself slowly levelling up which increases your stats. You have four categories which can be increased and these are Life Points, Energy Points, Luck and Souls but you don't get to allocate your stat points yourself, they are automatically distributed across the board evenly with each level.\n\nThe developer is very active with new updates every few weeks or so and engages regularly with the community on the steam discussion boards. I had a small issue with achievements and within a day I had a friendly and very helpful reply which was a pleasant surprise. Even though the game has a clear direction the developer is open to ideas, tips and feeedback on one of the threads and once again the dev is active there and seems to take things on board.\nBut I do feel obligated to state there isn't masses and masses of content currently. Though you can craft and build things you are limited in those options. The resources don't go much further than wood, stone, ores, a few items animals and mobs can drop a few different types of vegetation. Since the game is in Early Access I am sure we'll see a little more content as development goes on though I don't know how long it plans to remain in development. I also believe the developer is adding a little more to the story (I got this from the Early Access information on the front page so I could be wrong).\n\nI have a few issues I've encountered. The graphics are something awful if you play them on a large screen. Now this is just my opinion but reading the tutorial alone was an unpleasant experience and it didn't get much better from there. There are no options to change your resolution and I am unsure on if the developer plans to add this so you can either play in windowed for a slightly better experience or you'll have to suck it up. There are also issues with seeing items on the ground. The small pieces of stone that drop after breaking a large rock blend into the stone floor and combining that with your footsteps dotted everywhere become impossible to clearly see. My second issue is the movement because right now it's clunky and doesn't seem to actually do what I want it to half of the time which has caused me some unnecessary deaths. My guy will mine the wrong rocks, not attack in the correct direction sometimes and for some reason get caught in walls and drawn towards them whilst walking.\n\nOverall I'd like to see a little more content in Rogue Harvest but the base of the game so far is very good and tons of fun. It's very reminiscent of games like Terraria and Minecraft with less focus on creative building and more on the story. For $6 it's an easy buy and I hope the developer stays active because it's certainly something I'll want to revisit when completed.","May 7","true","2.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

You wake up in a forest. Now you have to survive! Run, the ents are coming!\n\nThis is a great game and try to be cautious, surviving the first night won't be the best. I started to think the best way is just running for your life. This is a complicated survival game or complicated and funny survival game where you have to create the best shelter to avoid the enemies at night. Yeah, they are not so great at day but the skeletons.. and other things, you know. They going to destroy your shelter. Now you know!\n\n*Fluffing Clouds*\n\nSurviving here means you have to cut trees, look for herbs, apples, mining and all thins to create a great city. No, just a shelter, OK. My goal was creating a castle, but I can barely survive for a night. Ah, don't get lost in the forest. I told you! Oh, you got lost. Pity. There's no map.\n\nDid I mention cut trees? Greenpeace won't like this game. But's the only way to get some apples, crafting, shelter, etc. So sorry Greenpeace!\n\nAnd I have to kill some fauna to avoid starving. Oh, I'm starving! How can I make a fire? Ok, that would be easy I hope. Ah, you have to find the items for that. Sorry.. At night temperature goes down. In case, you could make a fire just try not to destroy your own shelter. Happened to me. There is some kind of ugly flowers called fire splitters, that could help you to create fire. They gonna though fire to you and causing a fire in the whole forest. Ok, maybe is too much but they are dangerous!\n\n*breeding the rabbits*\n\nCrafting is easy, the first thing you need is a good shelter. If you are lucky you'll find a lot of stones to create stone walls, which are harder to destroy by the evil enemies at night. Get some medicinal plants just in case, beware of the flowers! Most of them are poisonous.\n\nAnd remember: none of the shelters are safe. Those skeletons are better miners than you!\n\nThings I like!\n\n- It's a realistic way to survive, except zombies and living plans of course\n- The creepy music, especially at night\n- You have a lot of things to get and craft. Yes, this is a game for crafters\n- The tutorial is quite good\n\nThigs I'd love to be implemented\n- The chance of saving without quitting. I have to quit every time I save.\n- Respawn. Yes, I know the spirit of the game but not all gamers love getting mad every time you got killed.\n- Maybe explain more the intro of the game. The plane. Maybe a crash? Is it hard to say goodbye? I'd love to know more about that.\n\n\nI like a lot Rogue Harvest. I get killed every time and I restart again and again. I think I'll get mad soon!\n\nThanks for the chance of playing this game!\n\n\nI'm having fun with this game!","May 12","true","4.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

You're trying to hunt for food and resources, while every other creature hunts for you.\n\nGameplay:You control a nameless character that just experienced a planecrash. You wake up in a small house with a set of basic tools (pickaxe, hammer, axe) outside. From now on your only objective is to survive. You have to keep an eye on your energy and life meters, energy depletes on its own, so you have to stuff yourself with food whenever you can, cause when it reaches zero, you starve to death. Life gets depleted when you get hit by an enemy, you can get some life back by eating herbs or keeping a high energy level.\nThe land is inhabitated by a lot of unfriendly and vicious creatures, like fire flowers (no, you can't collect them, it's not SMB), walking mushrooms, and bunnies. Even worse enemies spawn at night, scary skeletons, etcetera. Make sure to kill lots of them, you can loot many important items out of them.\nYou have three basic tools: Axe for chopping wood, Hammer for destroying walls, Pickaxe for almost everything else. You can also craft weapons, like a sword, boomerang or a bow. Make sure to craft one of them, a woodaxe is not a perfect weapon for killing enemies.\nBuilding a sturdy shelter is your main defense against the creatures of the night. Make sure to add extra walls constantly: enemies can and will destroy them while trying to get to you.\n\nGraphics: While I like the 16bit-like style of the game, I can't stand how poorly enlarged the sprites and menus are. I keep touching my glasses to see if they are still on my nose, cause the graphics are so blurry. What I liked though, was that your character's footsteps and blood of fallen enemies don't disappear for a long while: you can use this to your advantage by following your footsteps back to your home, just make sure not to stray too far, there is no map and it sucks to get lost in the middle of night.\n\nSound: All sound effects are pretty normal, nothing to say about them. Music is meh, I muted it after 15 minutes because it was putting me to sleep. Some tracks vary in recording quality, especially the new game song sounds like something ported out of an early PS1 game.\n\nControls:Walking sideways sucks. I've died 3 times because of that. That's the biggest issue, the rest of the controls are alright. You have a menu where you can craft/equip items and also mute music/sfx. LMB performs action on item that you are currently holding, so using a carrot makes you eat it, using a sword makes you swing it.\n\nConclusion: An interesting game. What it lacks in sound and graphics, it makes up with its ominous atmosphere and open world. Game was putting me on edge constantly, because I could die at every given moment. Sudden flashbacks to a plane crash were unnerving me even more. Nights are REALLY dark and enemies can kill you in mere seconds. Medicine gives very little of your health back, and you have to constantly hunt for food. This game doesn't funk around. I recommend it to every one that likes a challenge and old-school games that throw you right in the world without explaining much. If you like autosaves, difficulty selection and regenerating health: stay away.","March 22","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

It is a beautiful work of art that is being readily worked on by an active developer who genuinely takes the time to look at his players\' input and works with them to solve problems should they arise.\n\nIt IS a perma-death game.  This will put some of you off so if that sort of thing does not suit you then this game is not for you    YET!\nYes I say yet because the developer has already said he\'s looking at a more lenient method of play for those who desire it.\n\nNow that\'s not to say it is perfect.  There are some bugs still as it is early developement and as a permadeath game one small screw up can easily undo hours of hard work and it is extremely unforgiving if you don\'t pay attention to the instructions or at least glance at the guide.\nGot the game full price,  got the game for my wife full price, soon to get it for more family full price.

I received this game for free, however, my review is unbiased.\n\nThere is also a video counterpart to this review, which I highly recommend you check out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0WpAsFLHtU&feature\nAnyways, onto the review. Rogue Harvest was developed and published by Genetix, and was released on November 5th 2015. It’s genres are Action, Adventure, Open World, Rogue-like, Procedural Generation, and RPG.\n\nRogue Harvest is an open-world rogue like exploration game and those types of games in my mind are absolutely amazing.\n\nWhen I first played Rogue Harvest, the very first thoughts in my mind was Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Don't Starve. Personally, I have never played Stardew Valley, but if you compare Rogue Harvest to Stardew Valley, you can see some interesting similarities in the art style. In my experience, Rogue Harvest connects very well with Don't Starve. While I have not played Don't Starve, I have played Don't Starve together, which is the exact same thing as Don't Starve just multiplayer. The biggest differences between Don't Starve Together and Rogue Harvest are, well,\nobviously the graphics,pixel art vs a hand drawn style, lack of content, and modding capability.\n\nIn Rogue Harvest, the worlds are massive and procedurally generated, and mixed with it's rogue-like element, every playthrough is different.\n\nThe soundtrack for Rogue Harvest is very, well, interesting. The sound effects are a little bit annoying, but are bareable. The music is what I find so interesting about the game. For copyright purposes, I will not be playing the music in question, but it sounds a lot like creative commons orchestral music. However, I may be wrong, and the musician is just really talented.\n\nThe graphics in Rogue Harvest are very visually pleasing, and aren't hard on the eyes, however, the sprites are enlarged in a very awkward way, and it stands out.\n\nThe controls for Rogue Harvest are for the most part very good. However, when you first start the game, the controls are very confusing, but once you have enough time playing it'll get better.\n\nThe story for Rogue Harvest is a confusing one. Your character is nameless, and is in some sort of accident. You wake up in a hut with some tools and a little farm.\n\nWhen you play Rogue Harvest, you must keep an eye on your health, energy, and surroundings. If you run out of energy, your character begins to starve to death. If you aren't paying attention to your surroundings, monsters have a tendency to sneak up on your and could easily end your playthrough.\n\nCrafting in Rogue Harvest was very easy, and compared to some other games that include crafting, Rogue Harvest had a very straight forward crafting system.\n\nThe developer is very active and updates the game almost every week.\n\nThe downsides to the game are the really short day and night cycles. The days are short, and don't give you much time to harvest and explore before nightfall. The night is short and isn't long enough to provide any real excitement. The story is very confusing and bland, like the story of The Forest watered down. Another change I'd make to the game, although not a downside, would be multiplayer implementation.\n\nRating:\nGraphics: 7.2/10\nAudio: 7/10\nGameplay: 7.6/10\nOverall: 7.3/10\n\nEnjoy my review?

Since it is in extremly early access it does not have a whole lot of features but the dev team is working hard on this game and listens to the communitie pretty much weekly updates and player suggestions. you can't find a dev team better than that. For the game the story is now 100% done (as of version 0.75) the core survival aspects are in place already so collect materials like wood and stone gather food like corn and potatoes and start building because the nights arn't that plesant since monsters are coming from every side to kill you, and when you die thats it start over. when you are set up you can upgrade go out and explore the world in search of silver and gold to craft stronger tools.\n\nAlso there are easy to craft bombs mate, if explosions aren't convining you than what is.\nAny way this is a game i played a few hours already and i will play for hours to come expecelly since there are updates almost every week.\n\n","December 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Also the sprites for looking left are flipped from the ones looking right so you change your dominant arm/hand just by looking the other way.  Nothing really original here, nor is it done well as the "Story" makes no sense.  You crash from a plane yet start in a house with tools outside of it.  I'd avoid it personally.\n\n--  Update --\nI've been enlightened that my review is out of date.\nThat is indeed the case.  It's worse than I wrote in the quick minute I took.\n"You wake in a wooded area"  You actually wake up in a small house with tools outside!\nThere's no moving animations while you use tools, apparently a arm sticking out makes you able to move around without walking!  Also that whole pixelation issue is still around, and the flipped sprite issue is still present, I'm not going to call him lazy or anything, cause I am lazier probably, ♥♥♥♥ing leaving my C# learning on hold for a couple whole months when I was nearly done.  Personal problems aside, I have a huge issue with one thing.\nAgain it's graphics.\nThe actual game sprites are in a isometric view a kind of side in between top down and first person angles.  But the floor is just an enlarged grass texture that's a straight top down angle and focusing on it gives me a headache.  Maybe I am too harsh on a small indie game project but for ♥♥♥♥ sakes get your angles of art correct IS IT TOP DOWN?  THEN ♥♥♥♥ING MAKE THE SPRITES TOP DOWN?  IS IT ISOMETRIC?  THEN MAKE THE ♥♥♥♥ING FLOOR ISOMETRIC?  Geeze  I read the rest of the reviews with things saying potential this potential that.  ♥♥♥♥ing dog ♥♥♥♥ has potential to have a new never before discovered form of bacteria, but do we search every turd ever produced by a K9?  NO WE DONT BECAUSE ITS SO ABUNDANT WE HAVE SEWERS TO GET ARID OF THE STUFF!  It's too small, it's out classed by older games and with no original ideas it might be long forgotten, I really hoped coming back to it that there'd be something obviously better but not at all.  Maybe the new seeds have actually added something for me to enjoy, but Rust did it months before with better optimization and a clear weekly schedule with things clearly outlined for the future.  And Minecraft did it years before with a healthy modding community to peek my interest if I ever want to go back to my crack addiction.\n\nTL;DR "Nothing to see here, move along"\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLY3ixO3-iA","November 24, 2015","false","1.2"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","16","32","0","32"

In Rogue Harvest you play as the survivor of a plane crash fighting to make sense of and survive in the hostile world in which he's found himself.

So much so that much like the handful of sand you quickly exhaust everything you can do and are left with moving it around the box. Fairly quickly you hit the edge and have to turn around, much like the “vast” world in this game.\nGraphics\nIt looks like it runs in 800x600 which makes everything looked pixelated and garbled. The graphics are just bad, not time or effort was really invested. There is no arm swing animation so it looks like the weapon is just appearing out of his stomach. Other than walking this is the characters only animation so time could have been invested to make it an actual swing.\nGameplay\nIf you want to know more please watch the video but the summary is.\nThe first day, I gathered materials and built a house, during the night zombies destroyed it. I then proceeded to not care about houses and wander around looking for the “objective” which I didn’t find. The first sword I built made me an OP GOD which enemies could never touch. Thus I built everything and killed everything in like 20 mins and proceeded to walk around aimlessly for the rest of the time.\nI could go on, but really I don’t need to write anymore and you don’t need to read anymore, the game still needs a lot of work and I would not recommend it.","November 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","1"

I wish if this game have another mode where you still keep the world if you die. Monsters are pretty hard to fight if you use weak tools.\n\n+ Lots of Different Varieties of Enemies.\nThe enemies are lots in here, comes with varieties of attacks. Althought they seem to be pretty basic. But at least they come up with varieties of attack.\n\n+ Gameplay\nI think I just thinking if there`s a game which is Top-Down Terraria and Minecraft, I think this game is the reason where it was born. Gameplay is a Randomly Generated world, survive, craft, and fight hordes.\n\nNegative :\n\n+ Crafting System is very limited.\nIn this crafting system, the item that can be build are less than it should be, crafting system are limited to Building, Cooking, Blacksmith.\n\n+ Graphics and Music\nGraphics are the biggest negative in this game, did some playthough and indeed there are lag every 5 seconds, the game lag 0.5sec. Also, there`s limited options in the game options. The weather effects are bad, like on the Midnight, the hud also darken, preventing you to see. Sound effects isn`t that bad but Music, I think its messed up setting in here. Sometimes playing but sometimes not, but i think that was bug.\n\n+ Storylines\nWell they fix this issues, about Airlines MH370...ok enough with that. Now this time, storyline focusing about a person who flights in the air, gone missing, its like representing the story of what i said, "MH370" airlines. You,....this is the problem I have to follow in the storylines. "I have to find her". Means your task is to find a person you loved in a randomly generated world. So you stranded into a forest and thats it, your goal is to survive and find "that" person.\n\nI think story is really forgotten in this game, so I suggest just enjoy the game.\n\nTo which player for this game and Recommend?\nIts hard to recommend this such game as some players find out this game to be forgettable game, but there`s some who will to spend time to follow up what are the game and how it works should be, this game isn`t bad, but the game isn`t good either. I recommend for those who wish to enjoy just for fun, and enjoy some challenging game. For me I guess, I just play how the game works. Since this is still at Early Stage, this game will improve more after bring more update to come.\n\nMuruRating - 6/10","December 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","5"

Here's a video of the gameplay if you prefer, which also demonstrates some of the issues I had with the game:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571666965\n\nThe UI/UX is very poor. The quick item slots are the only way to use items. They can't be used directly from the inventory. There are no hotkeys to access commonly used menus like inventory and crafting. For some reason there are only 5 quick item slots, even though they are activated by pressing a number on the keyboard. There should be at least 10.\n\nThe moment-to-moment gameplay is weak. It reminds me of Starbound in that regard, except it doesn't have the same level of depth and complexity to make up for it. The overall level of difficulty is far too low in Rogue Harvest. It doesn't feel like a struggle to live, so much as a romp through a fantasy adventure. I was expecting to die within the first 5-10 minutes. I was expecting to be slaughtered by the skeletons at night time. Instead, I was able to kill them without issue. The survival aspect is totally lacking.\n\nThe fullscreen option just stretches out the graphics to fill the screen. It doesn't preserve the aspect ratio of the sprites.\n\nRogue Harvest is in development right now, but I really think that the core gameplay needs improvement, and I don't know how likely that is to happen.","December 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It was a very mechanical bobbing, with no ease, and is it just me or does the title logo seem like it changes when it changes its position?\nThe phrase "insert coin" in the menu of the game doesn't seem very appropriate, I was somewhat confused as to what to do at that point.\nThe sound effects in the menu were kinda loud and sudden, it startles me when I click on an option.\nAfter I clicked play, I was loaded into... another menu? That was unexpected. That menu had a GUI that was inconsistent with the main menu, and perhaps even with the game itself. The mouse become an armored hand that I feel wasn't necessary, given that there doesn't appear to be a strong association between the game and armor.\nThe graphics seem inconsistent. The ground and the blocks do not share the same graphics. The ground has its own texture, and everything else are pixellated. Pixellation isn't bad, but if a game is going to do that, it should make sure that the entire game is pixellated.\nI think that the description is somewhat misleading, since from what I gathered from playing it, players can't really build a castle, since they can't stack blocks. And the inventory and crafting is placed in a strange place, with no clear way of closing the inventory once open.\nI certainly see potential within the game. It's very well-crafted, and very detailed. I do not believe there are obvious bugs or glitches, and the game is presentable. However, I feel like the game is somewhat inconsistent with itself. I give a list of things I found to be strange so that Genetix may be able to address them when updating the game.\nBecause this is Early Access, and not a final game, I do not feel the need to recommend nor the need not to recommend the game. Since Steam wants me to choose one or the other, it's not bad, and it can certainly improve, so I'll choose recommend.","December 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game is comparable to Don't Starve, Terraria, Wayward, Unreal World, Lantern Forge, TownCraft and Darkwood. My experience of it so far is that it falls behind nearly all these titles in various ways. I still however recommend it because despite all my nitpicking and comparisons, I did find playing the game enjoyable even at this incomplete stage. I also believe it's on the right track to offering a solid alternative to the above mentioned titles.***\n\nIf you enjoy playing rogue-like wilderness survival games and/or Terraria - then you will find Rogue Harvest is a worthy addition to this growing genre. Especially for it's low asking price. Plenty of content being added during this early access phase and a developer who takes user feedback seriously. Where it differs most from other games of this type is it's story-based elements. Like Terraria you can expect a lot of combat and rough nightly raids. The crafting system still seems a bit lacking compared to other games out there - but the game is not yet considered 1.0 and I have every reason to believe the developer has a lot planned before it's considered "final". And of course games of this type almost always undergo consistent updates even after that point. One really awesome thing, the game gets trippy as f**k if you eat a mushroom. You can watch me take a second look at this game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsD4RtZjt6Y\n\ntl/dr: I believe the game has room to grow before it really stands as a competitor to other similar titles. However, despite that, I found the game to be quite enjoyable as well as difficult. Ultimately I believe it's worth it's asking price and recommend it for fans of this genre. And... mushrooms.","December 29, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Minecrafty-Tarrariaish-don'tstarve but at quite a low budget.\n\nThe game is quite solid and runs relatively well but its very very lacking in graphical quality. The textures are kinda boring and low resolution. There are very limited crafting recipes currently in the game making it not very customisable when creating a base/house. Things are function over cosmetics which is understandable for a game in early access.\n\nI'd like to see some more crafting objects and an improvement on the crafting interface since if there are going to be more craftables its going to get cluttered fast. The combat system lacks dept and is similar to terrarias flail in the direction and hope your attacks are fast enough to knock them back before they hit you.\n\nIt has a while to go in development before I feel it will be great but if it goes on sale give it a chance you can probably burn a few hours in it if you are into crafting/survival games. 5/10\n\nEDIT: I understand this may seem harsh but I feel that the developer should not be coddled into believing the game is in a better state than it is. Not sure why people feel the need to say my review is unhelpful just because I didn't say the game was amazing. The developer knows that they are using /programmer sprites/ but I did not until I looked around the forums a bit. That being said I stand by this review at the time of writing and I will be coming back and reassessing this game later. I do believe it has potential and the developer is really cool. I would just like the game to be in a better position before I give more feedback. After posting this originally I have gone to the forums and given the developer more ideas on things to improve.","February 27","false","1.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"
