He also must be immature/petty because he tells you, "you suck. >:(" when you try to back out of the chat with the spammer NPC that appears to be in every town.\n\nSince the developer wants to act like this is a freemium game, I'll correct his oversight in charging me money by utilizing Steam's wonderful refund policy. Here's your review that you wanted so badly, developer:\n\nI'd compare the writing to Big Bang Theory, which I tolerated. The combat is shallow. Graphics/sound/music are what you'd expect from a 16 bit game. I didn't notice any major bugs.\n\nIf he ever takes out the NPCs (I talked to two in the first 30 minutes) fishing for positive reviews, and it's on sale for $2 or less, I'd recommend this game to people that watch Big Bang Theory specifically for the humor.

The jokes may be funny at first, but they also rapidly become boring. The map design is pretty good (world map excluded), but I found the fights to be extremely repetitive. Combat variety is also very scarce. The soundtrack is ok, but the game itself uses a ton of premade RPG Maker graphics along with the beautiful custom resources, and that gives the game a "lazy" look on some parts. Part of it is by design, since this game wants(?) to be a parody of the JRPG genre, but I can't help but suspect that it was also to reduce the amount of work a lot and... well, it honestly feels very rough on the edges, despite its good qualities.\nAfter almost 7 hours of playtime, I don't think I'll play this game again any time soon. As I said, it gets boring fast. Imo, of course.","October 11, 2015","false","6.6"," 91 of 114 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","91","114","0","0"

In reality they're a bunch of nerds trying to return to their homes while they\nenjoy a wonderful adventure in a fantasy land filled with treasures, castles, dragons, orcs,\nelves and... Santa Claus.\n\nThe first thing I thought about Doom and Destiny was "here's another rpg maker game that\nis trying to be a parody of other famous rpgs like final fantasy"... And I was right, the\ngame is just this, but done well... very well.\n\nThe humor is very captivating and the jokes will make you laugh in more than one occasion. And don't think the story doesn't take itself seriously at all, because it does, delivering a fascinating story without "plot holes" even though it's a parody.\n\nI dare to say Doom and Destiny is a perfect blend of storytelling and great humor, with a gameplay on par with titles from the final fantasy series and the possibility of exploring the world, which is something that similar games don't do anymore. And secrets, lots of secrets scattered through the map and in the numerous locations of the game.\n\nAlso the game has 3 difficulty settings so it can be played by everyone.\n\nBoth the music and the graphics are licensed contents, they weren't made by the developers but bought from third parties and put into the game. I don't consider this a real flaw, but I know some people stay away from games with rpg maker graphics because they think they're not worth it... Well, if you can get over the fact that the graphics is standard rpg maker, I assure you'll find a real gem.\n\nIf you played "the Bridge", a very good puzzle game here on Steam, you'll notice that the game opening music is the same of Doom and Destiny, but does this make The Bridge a bad game only because they share the same opening song? no, so don't be discouraged by these things someone could call "flaws" and give this game a chance. You'll not regret it.\n\n\nRECENSIONE ITA:\n\nDnd è un gioco che racconta di quattro amici evocati per sbaglio in una terra magica e scambiati per eroi. In realtà sono quattro nerdacci della peggior specie che cercano un modo per tornare a casa, ma non prima di essersi gustati una fantastica avventura in un mondo pieno di tesori, castelli, draghi, orchi, elfi e... Babbo Natale.\n\nLa prima cosa che ho pensato di Dnd è stata "ecco un altro gioco fatto con Rpg Maker che cerca di fare la parodia di altri famosi rpg come Final Fantasy"... e avevo ragione, il gioco è essenzialmente questo, ma fatto bene... davvero bene.\n\nL'humor è accattivante e le battute ti faranno ridere in più di un'occasione. E non pensiate che la storia non si prende sul serio nemmeno un po', perché lo fa, regalando una trama affascinante senza "plot holes", e questo è già tanto essendo una parodia.\n\nMi permetto di affermare che Dnd è una perfetta miscela di storia e umorismo, con un gameplay al pari di titoli della serie Final Fantasy e la possibilità di esplorare il mondo di gioco, qualcosa che non si vede più tanto spesso in questo tipo di giochi... e segreti, tantissimi segreti sparsi per la mappa e nelle numerose aree del gioco. Inoltre il gioco ha 3 livelli di difficoltà, così da poter essere giocato da tutti.\n\nSia la musica che la grafica sono contenuti acquistati da terze parti e concesse dietro licenza. Personalmente non considero questo un vero difetto, ma so che molta gente si tiene alla larga dai giochi con grafica Rpg maker perchè pensa manchino di originalità... ebbene, se riuscirete a guardare oltre le grafiche di rpg maker vi assicuro che vi ritroverete di fronte ad una vera perla del genere ricolmo di originalità ed estro creativo.\n\nSe avete giocato "The Bridge", un buon puzzle game qui su Steam, noterete che la musica di apertura è la stessa di Dnd, perché acquistata dallo stesso musicista; ma questo rende forse "The Bridge" un brutto gioco? non credo, quindi non fatevi scoraggiare da queste limitazioni del titolo e date una chance ad un grande gioco; non ve ne pentirete.\n","March 18, 2015","true","4.8"," 85 of 112 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","85","112","8","0"

I hate mindless turn combat and really, really  hate random encounters and grinding, but this game was a nice change of pace: the initiative management and the aggro system make everything more interesting, and the "speed-up" button is a blessing to quickly resolve easy random encounter when you backtrack to older part of the map.\n\nRecommended!","March 18, 2015","true","1.2"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","39","60","13","2"

But here we go.\n\nDoom & Destiny is a turn based RPG that basically jokes about/steriotypes Tabletop RPGs as well as the "nerdy/geeky" lifestyle in a sense. It is very humorous, almost everything about this game will make you laugh if you understand it.\nSo here is a short list of pros and cons to this game.\n\nPros-\n\nGraphics, this is a "if you like these kind of graphics" thing. Personally, the graphics are nice, bringing back memories of some of the classic pixelly RPGs of old.\n\nAudio/Music, the music and audio are nice. Not really sure how else I should explain this... So there you go :-)\n\nCombat, the combat is turn based, which I definitely like. Skills/Powers and there uses actually matter, the proper timing of a skill could really determine whether you end the battle in victory or in defeat. Strategy actually matters!\n\nSkills/Powers, there are a lot of them! Plus, you get to choose basically any of them you want! In the game, you basically purchase your skills and give them to the characters, each character being able to equip a certain number of skills.\n\nCharacter Development, you are basically able to shape the characters however you want. Although the characters have a class that they are given initially, the terms of what these will become is vary vague, and up to your personal interpretation. Want a Ranger? Make one. Want a Paladin? Make one. Want Kirito from SAO? Make him!\n\nAlright, that is enough pros I think except from some more minor things, so lets continue with the cons.\n\nCons-\n\nIf you don't like "RPG Maker Games" or their like, then you probably won't like this one either. But let me just say, this is not your "cheap made RPG maker game", this is a milestone for games like this and it should not even be remotely compared to some of the other RPG maker titles currently on Steam.\n\nCombat, but didn't I have combat in pros? Well, I like the combat, but it seems like others do not like it so much. Like some turn based games, the combat may feel slow at points or feel repetative. This leads to the next point...\n\nGrinding, expect to grind some if you want to level your characters. Although for the most part you can just do quests and keep the action moving, you will need to do some actual leveling in order to proceed. Personally I have nothing wrong with experience hunting, but I understand that others do not like this so much usually, so I thought I would point this out.\n\nConclusion-\n\nDoom & Destiny is definitely a game that is worth the money, if not for the gameplay (which itself is amazing), then for the comical aspect of it. It is definitely a unique game like nothing else I have seen previous. You should definitely get this if you want to play a fun, casual game with lots of humor.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","0"

I always wondered what it would be like to actually live out one of the many adventures I had played late night with my friends. Doom & Destiny approaches this in true form. Bad jokes, immaturity and plenty of junk food. Except instead of high amounts of calories, you get HP and MP. From the moment the game starts it delves into the meta and lampooning everything you loved about RPGs. Now you can expect the standard helping of RPGMaker Pixel graphics, turn based combat, hundreds of items/spells and huge overworld to explore. What makes Doom & Destiny rise above the rest, is its dialogue and characters. Why are they on this crazy adventure? Who cares. Just have fun is the mentality, and It shows. With 20 hours of core story and plenty of side quests. Doom & Destiny is wonderful homage to late night roleplaying sessions with friends, having an adventure of a lifetime!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/xAxUq5dlvlA\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","April 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

You're free to steal from homes because the king said so in an edict, npcs take their job of walking around aimlessly seriously, characters and npcs quote songs when using certain spells and, when questioned about it, some bosses might realize their plan of kidnapping the princess isn't as smart as it sounds: it's truly a ton of fun and I found myself chuclking at it quite often.\n\nBut make no mistake, behind its jokes and references the game is a solid rpg in itself with a good story, a nice power system that lets you tailor the four protagonists to your liking and a big world with lots of stuff to do.

So the Warrior can decide to go "Paladin" by taking magical damage attacks (Smite Evil, Fire Sword,...), the Ninja can decide to go "Monk" by taking fist attacks (Stunning Fist, Fist of the South Star,...) and so on. This allows for a bit of replayability if someone wants to try different builds.\n\nThe story (which is very good IMHO) isn't really hard to finish, but after the end you get the choice to keep playing for some late game challenges. This last part is a bit grindy (you need a lot of gold to buy the ultimate equipment and powers) but it's still still enjoyable. And you get to fight the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nThe authors of this game are italians, so italian players might get one joke or two more than the others (loved the Rat-Man reference :D )\n\nBuy it.","August 19, 2015","true","26.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

There's one 'dent' in the difficulty curve, but overall the game is very fair and the combat fun to play.\n\nIf you like RPGs and especially if you like both pen & paper and JPRGs this game is really worth your time.","April 26, 2015","true","74.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Doom & Destiny.\n\nIt looked like a lot of fun when I first opened it up, something along the lines of Knights of Pen and Paper. I was partially correct, in that the plot involves a D&D group (Doom and Destiny, Dungeons and Dragons, whatever, as long as they don't get sued) that ends up journeying through their own "real lives" while encountering many elements one might find in a tabletop RPG, all the while cracking fourth wall jokes and throwing in pop culture references.\n\nIf this plot was a personality, Knights of Pen and Paper would be the dry-humored friend who likes repetetive tasks but also wants their friends to be happy, while Doom & Destiny is that friend that nobody actually invites to anything but shows up anyway with news that was old six months ago and meme jokes that haven't ever actually been funny.\n\nThe combat is a pain, specifically the random encounters throughout the dungeons (not that I played past the first boss, I got bored before I even unlocked the first Door That Needs a Weird Key). You're walking along a passageway, and all of a sudden your down arrow is scrolling at breakneck speed down the combat menu. There's no animation, no alert for "hey, you're gonna fight some enemies now", just a nasty surprise when you just wanted to take four steps without having to jolt yourself out of the moment of fun you might have been having to hold the Left Ctrl key and power blast through the combat without making a single tactical decision.\n\nOverall, poorly written, poorly designed, and above all, just not enjoyable to play.","March 23, 2015","false","0.5"," 21 of 65 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","21","65","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyrobe/recommended/318130/","greyrobe","Shadax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyrobe/","183 products in account","I've been looking for an old-fashioned RPG ever since playing some old favorites from the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series recently. I tried a few JRPG's on Steam that just weren't doing it for me and came across Doom & Destiny while browsing the RPG section and decided to buy it on a whim. It was one of my best impulse buys in a while.\n\nD&D was exactly what I was looking for in an old-school exploration/grinding RPG and on top of giving me the experience I wanted, it also made me laugh along the way. Now, the humor relies heavily on the assumption that the player has a lot of experience with the RPG genre, but I assume if you're interested in this type of game, then chances are you are quite familiar with the games that it lampoons.\n\nAside from being funny, the gameplay is pretty solid. There's a certain amount of customization that goes into leveling your characters and deciding which powers you want them to equip. The combat can seem a little repetitive, but if you're not a fan of grinding, then you probably shouldn't be playing this type of RPG to begin with. Add in the fact that there's literally hundreds of weapons and items to use, and you have quite a lot of game packed into this little indie. I just finished the main quest which took about 20 hours, but for the hardcore players out there, there's at least 20 more hours of gameplay that you can do after the main story line.\n\nI can't wait to see what these guys develop next and hope that a D&D sequel will arrive someday.","April 8, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics and music are decent, quests and dungeons are simple and straightforward, story and characters aren't deep, and combat is standard (grinding required, but there isn't a penalty for playing on easiest difficulty for less/easier grinding). What carries this game and sets it apart is the humor, and you'll either love or hate this game for that. This game parodies other games and it's a pretty light-hearted experience from start to end. I enjoyed playing through this game- it's somewhat similar in concept to other parody JRPGs like Cthulhu Saves the World (which is much shorter and humor is lovecraftian rather than about gaming).","March 25, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an absolute blast to play, many of the comments will make you laugh out loud. What adds to the ambience, in an unexpected way, is the Italian-to-English translation errors, which give it that classic "NES/SNES bad translation" feel. Secrets, tons of stuff to search, and a fun Powers system help it to stand with the better RPG-Maker games. My only complaint is that damn mobile-holdover, the Back button in the Top-right corner of the screen. Everytime I notice it, it bothers me.

I find myself laughing a lot when I play this game. I like the characters, but I wish there was more character developement,  but I don't know how far I am in the game so I might reach a point where that happens. I also really appreciate the smooth game play, the amazing pixel art, and the amazingly drawn icons for NPC's.\n\nMy only issue with the game, and I'm unsure if it was an installation error or something else, but the game frequently closes and sends me an error message. The game screen also flickers a lot when I play, and it does get a bit annoying, especially if I hadn't saved.\n\nTo finish, I do highly reccomend the game, because even if it closes on me and frustrates me to no end, I still absolutely love it.","February 3","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an absolute blast to play, many of the comments will make you laugh out loud. What adds to the ambience, in an unexpected way, is the Italian-to-English translation errors, which give it that classic "NES/SNES bad translation" feel. Secrets, tons of stuff to search, and a fun Powers system help it to stand with the better RPG-Maker games. My only complaint is that damn mobile-holdover, the Back button in the Top-right corner of the screen. Everytime I notice it, it bothers me.

I've never laughed so hard while playing a game in my life.\n\nThat's really all there is to say about the game. I love the old FF games and I like nerd humor so I loved it (that's why I played it for most than 50 hours). The only thing I might wish was different is that when the game becomes completely open ended with tons of side quests, the game loses a bit of humor and story and really just focuses on getting gear and powers.","September 23, 2015","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captain1nsaneo/recommended/318130/","Captain1nsaneo","Captain1nsaneo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captain1nsaneo/","139 products in account","Solid short RPG.\n\nPositives\n-The amount of end game content is about equal to the amount of content in the main storyline.\n-Interesting level design. The green ring upgrade course was something I hadn't seen done before.\n-The party leader system and its stat changes were novel and a nice addition.\n-The power/spell/ability system restricted what tools you could use and added an interesting layer of complexity.\n-The creativity of some of the secret areas was enjoyable. The landscape textures being a subtle arrow pointing at a hidden door sticks in the mind.\n-Status effects work on bosses and MP damage can solve a fight or two. Both are refreshing changes from the norm.\n\nA negative\n-Some parts can be frustrating to figure out. I had 3, 2 of which I resorted to the net to navigate through but 1 of those was me being forgetful.\n\n\nQuestionable\n\n-The plot itself is enjoyable but a number of twists can be easily seen coming. So easliy in fact and due to the nature of the game's writing I can't decide if they were actually meant to be running jokes and not twists.\n\n-There are characters scattered about (and marked) that ask you to post reviews on steam and comments of somesort on facebook. I don't know if you're rewarded for doing so as I had no intention of writing a review until I had actually beaten the game. This made these NPCs slightly annoying whenever they popped up but since they were marked out it wasn't terrible. Their addition probably encouraged me to write a review after I was done with it but their 3 options of "Link to Steam Review", "Link to Facebook", and "I am a stupid meanie head" was not endearing. A simple request/reminder without the aggression in the dialogue to end the conversation would have been enough.\n\n\nIt should be mentioned what when the game says "Alt + Enter for full screen" it's refering to left Alt. Similar to the encouter autofight button which is left Ctrl. I mention this incase you want to build a script to help you farm pirate keys late game.
