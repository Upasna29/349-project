Thankfully the control layout isnt sloppy and you have good control over the Rocket Man!!!!!   ( burning out his fuse up here alone)\n\nIt was one of those games that kind of made you fail a few times to learn the stage, then you can hit the nail on the head. Well, I almost forgot to mention all the different types of blocks that each had different properties. The small list of these blocks is as follows, Bouncing, attraction, dissolving, and this fan that throws you across decent sized gaps.\n\nAmong all these blocks there are a few traps set up around you that you need to try and avoid well navigating the sometimes huge environment.. Thats when the game can get frustrating. If you dont complete each stage in a certain amount of time the sun comes careening towards you. That can lead to death, which is a bad thing.\n\nThe sole premise of this game is to hit all the buttons on a given stage and make it to the exit before you get burnt to a crisp. Although there are collectibles on every stage, you dont need to get them, unless you want to get a 3 star ranking..\n\nTo top it all off with a cherry, YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN MASOCHISTIC WORLDS. The game supports workshop and I hope it will be a very active community. In the wake of Mario Maker, a game like this on the PC is VERY welcomed.\n\nAll in all, I would have to say the game is worth the $2 asking price. If this is your type of puzzle game.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UenuLAKC60Q","October 30, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","5"

The level creator is not so hard to master but, because it was made with unity, you must change you control key via a little menu that appear when you launch the game.\n\nThis game remember to me an other old game that was nammed "Kula world" so if this game tell you something go buy the game since he only cost less than 2 euros :).","October 30, 2015","true","8.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

I feel as if I would not be able to complete this as I would become frustrated  and burn my pc. All in all this game seems fun yet it needs to work on smoother controls as jumping was difficult and turning was very fast.","November 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loliwulf/recommended/410440/","Loliwulf","Loliwulf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loliwulf/","201 products in account","What a clever game.\n\nIn Vertigo Void, you control a little spaceman who needs escape from the expanding sun. This is done by walking, jumping, and being flung across the outside of your ship, hitting buttons to open the hatch, then diving in and zipping away.\n\nThe challenges in this game are fresh and clever, their variety keeping things interesting, and the graphics and soundtrack are pleasant to the senses.\n\nGameplay generally consists of failing a few times when you first reach a new level to get a good grip of its layout ( the game really makes you think in 3 dimensions) then following the correct route and completing level. You can place little beacons that  persist between deaths to help out with this. They're very convenient and rather visible. The hatch you need to enter to complete the level also has a glow to it when open that helps you see it from around the sharp corners that this game is filled with. Because of this, dying at this game isn't very frustrating at all, it just makes you think more about what you need to do on your next try.\nClearly some thought and consideration was put into making this game, and it turned out really well.\n\nOh, there's a level editor too, which means potentially limitless puzzles. Isn't that exciting?\nIt's one of the best puzzle games I've seen on Steam in a while.\n\nFor $2 it's absolutely worth it. It's a token price to pay to have access to such a nice game.\n","November 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokorotano/recommended/410440/","kokorotano","Kokoro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kokorotano/","53 products in account","Vertigo Void is probably the most charming puzzle game I've come across on Steam so far. The graphics are pixelated but still have a refined feel to them, something you don't get in many Unity games right now.\n\nThe game handles the combination of puzzles and platforming very well. It puts you into a situation I'm sure at least a few of us thought of as kids: What if we were isolated in space away from our ship, on The Sun? You must remember the layout of the level and use the odd rules of gravity in the game to press all the buttons and unlock the hatch before time runs out and The Sun expands and you disintegrate.\n\nThis sounds intense, but actually the game is very calming. The music is soothing and complements the game to create a finished product: A relaxing puzzle game to play to wind down at any time of the day.\n\nFor two dollars? This game is great.\nFor one dollar? If you like puzzles then you absolutely must get this game.","November 19, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I bought the game for $0.67 and $0.99 should be the price. In my opinion the regular $1.99 is a little much for this game. If you want a cheap, fun game i would not reccomend getting Vertigo Void, but if you want to play a cheap casual game you may like it. In other words, Vertigo Void is a casual game that isn't for everyone, and it may become boring for you quickly.","April 4","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game requires you to pause and scope out your environment but then punishes you for taking too long.  then you have to start over, go to the point where you died, and continue to figure it out.  The timer just gets in the way.  I can understand a Time trial mode though, or maybe a free-view mode where the timer stops.","March 23","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
