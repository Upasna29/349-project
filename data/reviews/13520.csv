But it may not be the game for you considering how long my con list is.\n\nPros:\n\n1.) The environment is nice and it's fun to explore around.\n\n2.) There's a good amount of weaponry, ranging from a Desert Eagle to a rare and powerful automatic shotgun, the Pancor Jackhammer. If you favor stealth, pick a silenced MP5 and remain hidden.\n\n3.) There aren't that many vehicles but it's forgivable if you can drive something that fires rockets and wrecks entire campsites.\n\n4.) The A.I. enemies are impressive to fight against. Some operate like a squad and they tend to "think" (or pick stealth) more before assaulting your position.\n\n5.) In my opinion, Far Cry offers outstanding music. It builds up and increases tension which is appropriate when you're exposed to assailants.\n\n6.) Graphics are nice, considering this game is over 10 years old.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are problems that Far Cry has.\n\nCons:\n\n1.) Multiplayer is dead! There should be an update that states this in the store page.\n\nLink: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2092407\n\nDon't waste your time in registering for any site to get multiplayer. It has died long ago.\n\n\n2.) Despite what some people said, a good portion of the campaign is linear, most notably the "indoor" parts. Also, the game doesn't do a good job in providing players with a diverse amount of alternative pathways to take. It usually only gives 2 avaliable walkways to complete the same objective and I do not find that acceptable.\n\n\n3.) There's some sort of A.I. bug in which the mercenaries can shoot at you accurately behind walls when you're in their bunkers.\n\nEDIT: Stealth is also broken in this game. The human enemies can "see" you at certain points, even when they should not have. This prohibits the ability to sneak around them and often, you have to fight them head-on.\n\n4.) While I do not mind, a good amount of the Far Cry community despises the introduction of the "Trigens". In a way, I do agree with them because after you encounter them, the game becomes too different.\n\n5.) I was going to complain about the bland plot but the voice acting is far worse. The main character, Jack Carver, has a pretty bad voice actor and his lines are cliche'd.\n\n6.) Some sections of the game are notoriously hard, though not impossible to beat, even on easy. It would be understandable if you die almost immediately by rushing recklessly on the hardest difficulty but on easy is just overkill. The last level was hard but the worst part for me was fighting Crowe, the leader of the mercs, on a sinking boat while facing a helicopter. You only have a couple of minutes of destroy the aerial vehicle (as you cannot use a firearm when swimming), there's no supplies, and Crowe has good accuracy and he inflicts massive damage with his M249.\n\n7.) The worst thing Far Cry has is the "auto-save" and it lacks the ability for players to save manually whenever they want to. I heard that there is a console command as compensation but for those who don't know, they will have endless times of reloading an earlier save and you may even get stuck in a loop where you continuously perish.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn all, I did enjoy the game after adjusting myself and giving it a 2nd try. However, $9.99 is too much as multiplayer and customization is dead so please get the game when it's at a discount if you're still interested. On the bright side, Far Cry does have more balls than its successors when it comes to difficulty.","November 9, 2014","true","37.0"," 233 of 270 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","233","270","7","17"

Ammo and health conservation need to be taken into account at all times, and the AI does a good job of making enemies always feel like a real threat.\n\nDespite not taking place in an "open-world" like its successors, the original Far Cry features some incredibly vast and well designed levels (at least for the first three quarters of the game), allowing the player to approach objectives in many different ways.\n\nThe story is pretty entertaining, if a bit tongue-in-cheek. It has an 1980s' action-movie feel to it.\n\nIf you can put up with its outdated graphics, Far Cry is well worth a playthrough.","August 11, 2015","true","18.3"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","63","68","8","0"

The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim. The variation in weapons is not great, but it is good enough (should have been more weapons with silencer).","May 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 83 of 98 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","83","98","5","3"

It seems that the two main complaints people have are that the game is too hard and the story is somewhat lame.\n\nI would agree that this is a hard game, it does not baby the player.  There is no regenerating health, the enemy soldiers move quickly and have decent aim.  I am not great at FPS games, but playing this game on medium is very enjoyable to me.  The checkpoints are very well spaced.  There are just enough health and armor packs.\n\nIf you are getting stuck in one spot I would suggest trying a different approach.  Maybe even back up one checkpoint and come it things from a different angle.  This is very different from the modern corridor shooters.  The maps are enormous and you are free to go anywhere.  I can see how this could be confusing for younger gamers used to COD style gameplay.  Boats and trucks are an excellent strategy with their mounted guns.  Stealth works very also.  Early game with the M16 switching to single shot mode, going prone and headshots from a distance is another good method.  Rushing in and spraying bullets will not work as well.\n\nYou will have ample ammo for your pistol and assault rifle, but much less for speciailzed weapons like the sniper rifle and rpg.  This keeps things balanced and rewards the player for good planning.\n\nFinal comments on the difficulty.  Everyone has different levels of skill.  For me on he hardest difficulty levels I can not get very far without getting stuck.  On medium the game is fun and I die maybe a couple times per level.  Select the level appropriate for your abilities.  Once you learn where the enemies are and how many that will give you an advantage.\n\nTechnologically this game is a masterpiece.  Released 10 years and still looks great.  It is the predecessor to Crysis.  As for the story, who cares?  It is a game not a movie.  It is about the gameplay here.  Cut scenes are few and far between and non disruptive.  Nothing gets between you and pulling that trigger.  There are no QTE's or moments where the game takes control away from you.  It is a very pure experience.","February 21, 2014","true","11.3"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","62","68","0","3"

However, 10 years later, it is still a great game to play.  The graphics are really nice for such an old game, and the envorinment is great.  The foliage and varying terrain provide great cover and lookout spots.  However, I do think the game misses out on a destructible environment, but this is mostly due to its age.  I would also call it open world, but it it does have linear aspects.  By this, I mean that there can be several routs and combinations you can employ to achieve objectives, but all of them guide you to the objective (i.e. an island will have 3 to 5 paths to get to the center, and each path will suit a different play style).  When you get inside places like the labs, the mission will become linear.  Personally, I was not bothered by this because that is how I feel it should work.  In real life, buildings are not supposed to have complicated floor plans, and it mixed it up from the open outside areas.  Together, these two set different tones and forced you to alter your play style and rely on different tactics.\n\nWhat I was most impressed by in this game was was the A.I.  They actually  act like thinking people in a lot of situations.  An example of this is them "listening" for your footsteps and other noises you make.  Another example is that they will operate in groups or squads, and will often to choose tactical approaches to get to you,  They are a challenge, but to me it makes the game feel more "real" and creates a fun challenge.\n\nAnother thing I think the game gets right is the music.  It is incredible.  It comes on at appropriate times at the right volume for the perfect amount of time.  It does not take away fromt the game at all.\n\nSome of my final thoughts on the game include the voice acting, levels, and multiplayer.  Your character especially could use some improvement, but frankly, speaking is such a small part of the game that it barely matters.  You will actually probably laugh at it for most of the game, so it is not necissarily a bad thing.  The combinination of the A.I. and environent do create some incredibly tough levels.  However, they are all beatable, you just need to think outside the box sometimes.  Besides, what is a game without a challenge?  Finally, the multiplayer is dead, but lets be honest.  The game is old, its part of a popular franchise.  If you want multiplayer, get the newer games.\n\nOverall, I think this game is fantastic, and I would highly recommend this game.  I would buy the games when it is on sale, especially as part of the franchise pack, because the standard price is just too much.  The good news is that it is on sale all of the time.  I hope you this review is helpful, that you would consider getting the game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

This was largely due to the development time required for a relatively small team to create more open, non-linear environments with complex 3D architecture. As much as I enjoyed some of these linear shooters (No One Lives Forever and Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force spring to mind), I was starting to miss the days where I could walk into a room and discover three or more doors leading out of it. Also a little nervous that non-linear shooters were a thing of the past.\n\nThankfully Far Cry allayed those fears from the get go, presenting the player with nearly endless vistas, huge islands to be explored, enemy encounters that could be approached in a variety of ways. It felt like a brand new yet also warmly nostalgic gaming experience.\n\nFar Cry was the first game I chose to play on a newly-built PC system back at the start of 2005. I also had Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Quake 4, Thief: The Deadly Shadows and Deus Ex: Invisible War waiting in the wings. Far Cry came free with the video card, so I decided to "get it out of the way" first, only to end up entranced for about 12-15 hours and finding it to be one of the strongest of that particular set of unplayed games.\n\nThank you, Far Cry, for helping bring back non-linear environments to the FPS genre at a time when it desperately needed them.","July 27, 2013","true","0.4"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"

It could show the outside world and vegetation in great detail. The image quality was surprising because everyone expected the best games to come from the hand of Id Software , Valve or Unreal . Far Cry managed to surpass these industry monsters on open outdoor environments. At that time one was stupefied seeing and walking the surrounding rainforest. Handling vehicles added an interesting gameplay add on.\nThe experience of hang gliding on tropical islands was unique and later copied by several games like the wonderful 2013 Far Cry 3Game.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC with recommended CPUs from 2 to 3 Ghz, 1 GB of RAM and 128 MB graphics cards supporting DirectX 9.0b .

Fue una sorpresa por su avanzado motor gráfico y la inteligencia artificial.\n\nJack Carver, un soldado retirado, es contratado por Valerie para explorar una isla. En la isla se encuentra el Doctor Krieger involucrado en el proyecto de ingeniería genética “Far Cry” custodiado por gran cantidad de mercenarios. En la isla hay además primates sometidos a sueros genéticos que se han covertido en monstruosidades agresivas. El juego es extenso y tiene una variedad de niveles notable para la época.\n\nEl motor gráfico se denominó CryEngine y  para la época fue una revolución en mostrar el mundo exterior y la vegetación. Maneja HDR (alto rango dinámico) y nubes volumétricas. La calidad de la imagen fue sorprendente, ya que todos esperaban que los mejores juegos vengan de la mano de Id software, Valve o Unreal. El Far Cry consiguió superar a estos monstruos enos entornos exteriores abiertos. En aquél momento uno se quedaba estupefacto viendo la selva tropical circundante. Además el manejo de vehículos le agregaba una jugabilidad muy interesante.\nLa experiencia de volar en ala delta por islas tropicales fue única y copiada posteriormente por varios juegos como el Maravilloso Far Cry 3 del 2013.\n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, se recomendaban procesadores de 2 a 3 Ghz, 1 GB de memoria RAM y tarjetas gráficas de 128 MB con soporte DirectX 9.0b. Muchas tarjetas de video sufrían bastante con este juego en 2004.","November 25, 2013","true","26.0"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","48","61","0","0"

The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim.

Despite being quite old, it still manages to be a good game, although it presents several problems that impact negatively against its overall quality. The AI, for example, while good for flanking the player and working together, feels unfair since they can see the player through walls, and they spot you quite easily, so stealth isn't as fun as it should.\n\nThere's a good variety of enemies to fight, with different weapons and skills, but, as mentioned, there are problems with them. Another problem is that some can kill you quite easily before you even spot them. As for weapons, there's different types, and they all work very good.\n\nThe environments are impressive. From beaches, to old Japanese bunkers (and ships) from WWII, going through jungles, swamps, and even a volcano, this island has everything; and you can use several vehicles to move around.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's like a cheesy 90s action film. Not to say that's bad, since it really fits the tone of the game; and, let's be honest, jumping out of a jeep as it falls from a cliff towards the ocean is something that makes you feel awesome.\n\nAll in all, I recommend it, even though it made me rage a bit.","December 7, 2014","true","13.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

It has really been 10 years since this game was released! It truly is unbelievable how time flies!\n\nAnyway, this is one of those FPS games that I consider a milestone in the genre. Came out around the same time as Half Life 2 and Doom 3 did. I remember playing FPS games with corridors and relatively big rooms but never a game where you have a completely open island at your disposal and you can go wherever you want. Also, the game's engine handled these scenes very well and the frame per sec value did not drop significantly once you left a building and were in the open.\n\nThe story is quite silly, actually. You escort a journalist to an island then suddenly a rocket destroys your boat. Now, being stranded on this island, your only chance of survival is to go deep into the jungles. You'll soon find out why there are so many mercenaries with several bases here and what cruel experiments they've been conducting for a while.\n\nThe game was really beautiful at the time and beside the open-door areas it gave you the option to commandeer vehicles. This was also new at the time and this was refined later on in Crytek's Crysis.\n\nAs much as I thought the story of Far Cry was lackluster I thoroughly enjoyed this game and did several walkthroughs.","March 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strengthandhonor/recommended/13520/","strengthandhonor","VictorBravo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strengthandhonor/","86 products in account","Despite being a 10 year old game, FarCry still manages to impress with its dated graphics and gameplay mechanics. Games back then struggled to balance gameplay with open worlds as most computers at that time simply could not handle the processing power. Yet Crytek and Ubisoft decided to take that extra step and prove everyone that they could make a giant game for its time.\n\nThere is no question that the islands that you play on are huge. While the game is not true “open world” per say, it still offers amazing space to test out your strategies. The game is linear in a sense that you progress through “zones”. Each zone has its own small enemy settlements, vehicles, and random events. Some zones are very linear while others promote exploration and different use of tactics. This is where FarCry is at its best. FarCry becomes so much fun when you as the player can figure out your own strategy in how to take down the enemy. Will you fly above your enemies and try to land on their base? Drive up in a armored vehicle and blast your way through? Perhaps take the underground passage and surprise your enemy. Or simply drag your enemy out into the jungle where you pick one by one.\n\nYet there are moments where FarCry will feel like a totally different game. Halfway through you are forced to play within confined walls and shoot “Trigens” or mutated human soldiers who do ridiculous jumps and can one shot you, making gameplay extremely frustrating. To make it even worse, the game’s autosave feature saves seldom, making dying even more infuriating. Luckily, this can be fixed by a quick in console command.\n\nMake no mistake, FarCry is a very difficult game. Perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever played on hard. But it isn’t the “fun” type of difficult. It’s more of the bullcrap type where enemies have unlimited rocket launchers, grenades, and machinegun ammo while you run out quickly. Additionally, the game breaking bugs such as enemies spotting you behind walls and managing to shoot you behind tents and knowing exactly where you are makes stealth rather useless. It’s as if the game is taunting you that it could be much better had stealth actually worked.\n\nThe game’s story is nothing noteworthy as it suffers from stereotypical clichés, boring characters, and a villain who makes little to no sense. FarCry does, however, do a good job in making you feel like a predator throughout the game. At times, you can feel the effect you have on the world as your enemy gets more and more frightened by you.\n\nLast but not least, the game has some serious glitches that makes gameplay infuriating. Saving during the zone called “Swamps” and loading is not possible after the car chase as the save always becomes corrupt. The only way to complete that part is to simply not die. Which when you play on hard, is not very easy to do. Additionally, the BS enemies who can snipe you miles away while you cannot even see them within distance is another part of the game which may make you want to throw your controller or mouse at the monitor. For being a 10 year old game, Ubisoft sure has not spent time in fixing some of these serious glitches, and it’s a problem since they are selling the game with these glitches.\n\nOverall, unless you are a classic FPS lover who wants to experience the very roots of the FarCry franchise, you won’t be finding much here. FarCry is both fun and maddening, and the bugs certainly do not help. It can be fun, however, to try the open zones and play the game when it is at its best. I certainly recommend that.\n\nScore: 6/10","November 19, 2014","true","14.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The jungle scenery and island panoramic views were and still are breathtaking.  The ability to take a different approach to a single situation rather than being led on a rail to each action segment made the game very flexible for many players.  Once you enter the hallways though, the game turns more into a Doom clone where you only have one path to choose and you are faced with a new type of enemy that again evokes memories of Doom.  As a whole the story is interesting and gives you meaning to why you are fighting for your life.  I like your companion that helps you throughout the game to give you directions on where to go and what to do as well as giving background to the storyline.  The storyline consists of your boat, while on vacation, being shot down as you travel near an island.  You recover in the island and start playing cat and mouse to survive only to realize that this was no accident and the crew of your boat were purposely near that island.  But why?  What is so important about THIS island?  Play and find out, definitely a classic for all gamers to experience at least once.","December 22, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I played it in the middle difficulty (out of five) and it was, by far, the hardest FPS I've ever played. The whole game forces you to rely on split-second timing and perfect long-distance aiming to survive. This makes you much more tense than newer FPS with regenerating health ever seem to do. You're often forced to methodically clear areas slowly and precisely, which is much different than most run-n-gun games these days. Far Cry 3's hardest difficulty was significantly easier than this.\n-The stealth works very well. Your only chance at survival is to creep around in the woods. The "attention meter" is your best friend. Also your night-vision goggles are essential at spotting enemies in the distance and in the dark.\n-The AI is very advanced for the time. The bad guys will sound alarms to bring in help (which was reused in FC3), and will  take cover. However, they do occasionally do stupid things that shows how old the AI is, but it's not too bad.\n-The maps are semi-open world, with a set destination but often with multiple paths through the jungle or in vents. This design is the main thing that distinguished the game from other shooters at the time, and it's still cool today.\n-The graphics are very good for the time, particularly the map size and the foilage. Crytek are the masters of realistic video game foilage, and it shows here.\n\nCons:\n-There's no quick-save, just checkpoints. You'll often find yourself running like a madman through the jungle in hopes of passing an autosave checkpoint. A game this hard needs to allow you to save more often, although any time you want probably isn't ideal either. There is a console command that lets you quick-save, which I used towards the end of the game when I was fed up. I recommend you decide at the beginning whether you will use it and then stick with your choice.\n-There's a bug that allows enemies to see you through tents and sometimes walls. I hear, there's a fan-patch online to fix  this, along with some graphical improvements. I honestly didn't notice the wall thing at all, and there's not very many tents in the game in the first place.\n-Finally, the plot is equivalent to a pretty average B-movie story. The voice-acting is somewhat dubious, and the main character, though fairly memorable, doesn't seem to enjoy anything at all.\n-Multiplayer is dead and almost certainly isn't coming back.","December 23, 2014","true","22.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's aged, it's incontestable, examples of the clear aging include incomprehensible AI that seems to decide randomly if it will function correctly, and graphics that haven't help up entirely well most notably the CGI cutscenes. It's probably best to get the worst out of the way now, the story is utterly predictable and overall rather cliché, definitely not a story you'd get invested in. On a lighter note, gameplay has held up decently, the gunplay is implemented well with a variety of weaponry to choose from, the levels are pretty large and well laid out for the most part and facilitate various approaches to objectives.

That was over 10 years ago and I am happy to say this game was great. Altohugh back then it was VERY graphically challenging for many PCs it was well optimized and so I could play it too. I quickly realized what a gem it is in how fluid the combat is....and how merciless the fights are. You see I played on Realistic, the hardest difficulty, because my brain was dumb and I thought realistic meant more simulation-like. Nope. It means the game is HARD up until the point the mutants appear ... then it is INSANELY difficult. But yet...somehow it was still fun for me. While taking out mercenaries is doable (a headshot kills everyone) the monster mutants needed a lot more bullet persuasion to go down. Except for the difficulty this game is great in vehicular combat - helicopters, boats, cars, trucks ... and you can even ride a rogalo! Graphics are nice, even today. The story is a bit bland but not bad, just simple - save girl, fight bad guys and then defeat monsters. Playtime here does not tell you how MANY MANY hours I spent trying to beat it on Realistic. But it does say something about how good it was when now, 10+ years later when my discs no longer work, I still went and bought it. If you can overlook (or enjoy) the difficulty and linearity of some parts then I can recommend this for you, it's loads of fun!","November 16, 2014","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's no wandering around wondering what to do next.\nThe enemy AI is very good, especially considering the open nature of the game, often they will try to out-flank your position or simply get behind cover so you must then flush them out leading to some pretty tense moments. However, it's not perfect, sometimes you will see the bad guys rooted to the spot for an easy kill or they simply charge your well hidden position and it's a turkey shoot. If anything, the flaws in AI make the game easier which is preferable to the opposite situation!\nThe weapons are beautiful: a mix of real and futuristic improvements. Ammo is never really a problem (well, with the exception of the Sniper rifle bullets and the RPG loads when they would really tip the balance in your favour) and, most importantly, the damage they inflict is balanced: both enemies and player go down with about the same amount of damage. Where the game falls down is near the end when a couple of pointless nonsensical plot-twists ruin the story. The game 'ends' three times, with some ill-thought through extra levels tagged on each time.\n","January 23","true","9.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The AI is stupid and glitchy, the enemies can see you from a mile away and shoot you with pinpoint accuracy through walls, and the poor graphics and cheesy action lines will make you realize how far video games have come.

From the enemies that yell "are you alright?!" as you headshot them to your character's nonchalant reaction to the suicide missions he's sent on, this game had me in stitches, and at some points, it's extremely difficult to get through the missions (whether you try and stealth your way through or go in guns blazing). 8.5/10 will play the next 2 and maybe even buy the 4th one when it comes out.

But that was a long time ago, can Far Cry still deliver after 10 years? Yes it can.\n\nStory:\n\nYou are Jack Carver, a former US Special Forces soldier who now runs freelance boat charter services in the Pacific. You are employed by Valerie Constantine to take her to a mysterious island once occupied by the Japanese during the second world war, claiming to study its little-known ruins. Shortly after Valerie goes ashore your boat is attacked (and destroyed), and you barely manage to escape, finding yourself alone without any equipment on an island no one really knows about...\n\nFar Cry was never loved for having an extraordinary story, but the plot is solid enough and it doesn't lack twists and turns, keeping the player interested. It also mixes realism with sci-fi quite well and the transition from the realistic jungle warfare to the... well more sci-fi stuff is well paced.\n\n7/10\n\n\nVisuals:\n\nWhile Far Cry can obviously not  keep up with today's graphics, maxed out I still wouldn't call it an ugly game. Sure, it's outdated, but it can still surprise you sometimes with the beautiful tropical setting. The vegetation and water still look good and the draw distance is surprisingly long making the game pleasant to play in the open environment. Interiors however do show heavy signs of aging. Good news is that you will be able to play on ultra settings without any problems on even low end machines nowadays.\n\nOnce it might have been 10/10 today I will give it 6/10\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nI was absolutely surprised on how much I enjoyed the gameplay of Far Cry, which blends some of the old school FPS elements like hitpoints and medpacks, armor, etc. with some of the more modern game elements like the huge open world, vehicles, stealth mechanics (especially useful in the jungle), etc. providing a multitude of ways to complete a given objective with a surprisingly competent AI. Also, while it is definitely an arcadeish shooter it will require a decent amount of planing and tactics because Far Cry is actually a hard game, especially towards the end. It might sound funny but Far Cry is a refreshing experience compared to most of today's shooters.\n\n10/10\n\n\nSound:\n\nIn terms of music and sound effects Far Cry is solid again. You won't remember the soundtrack for days, and the voice acting is sometimes poor, but the ambient sounds were quite good, further improving the immersion in the jungle fights.\n\n8/10\n\n\nReplay value:\n\nWhile the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would affect the outcome, the gameplay provides countless ways to approach and deal with your objective, making the game worth several play troughs.\n\n8/10\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nFar Cry might have once stood out primarily because of its visuals, but today is worth playing because of its challenging and fun gameplay.

The game was a masterpiece in engine technology, and features some of the most interesting level design in FPS gaming.\n\nThe weapons and the feeling of power they transfer to the hands of the gamer is of such a caliber (pun intended) that still hasn't been toppled by any game since. The Desert Eagle and M4 in Far Cry are quite simply the most enjoyable weapons in gaming.\n\nThe game doesn't come without flaws though. The game suffers from the 'Crytek disease', namely, that a large part of the game is considerably worse after the introduction of superhuman enemies.\n\nIn Crysis, it was the blue alien scum, which singlehandedly reduced the game to a bullet-spamming festival of bright lights, taking away all the interesting gameplay features.\n\nIn Far Cry, it is the trigens. That being said, I'd rather battle trigens over aliens any day, but shooting loud-mouthed mercs is still way more fun.\n\nIf you are interested in playing this masterpiece, by all means, play it with the FCAM 1.99 mod.

The game was a masterpiece in engine technology, and features some of the most interesting level design in FPS gaming.\n\nThe weapons and the feeling of power they transfer to the hands of the gamer is of such a caliber (pun intended) that still hasn't been toppled by any game since. The Desert Eagle and M4 in Far Cry are quite simply the most enjoyable weapons in gaming.\n\nThe game doesn't come without flaws though. The game suffers from the 'Crytek disease', namely, that a large part of the game is considerably worse after the introduction of superhuman enemies.\n\nIn Crysis, it was the blue alien scum, which singlehandedly reduced the game to a bullet-spamming festival of bright lights, taking away all the interesting gameplay features.\n\nIn Far Cry, it is the trigens. That being said, I'd rather battle trigens over aliens any day, but shooting loud-mouthed mercs is still way more fun.\n\nIf you are interested in playing this masterpiece, by all means, play it with the FCAM 1.99 mod. It improves graphics, add more features and fixes bugs.","July 7, 2014","true","59.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Got it cheap and had many hours of fun. I would the describe the levels as sandbox-corridors. The levels overall were fairly linear, but most levels had breathing room and were wide open for experimentation with the ways you could approach combat. There are plenty of opportunities for vehicle/boat-based combat, but I found navigating the vehicles too cumbersome to really enjoy driving and shooting at the same time (especially the land vehicles).\nPlayed on Medium difficulty and it was definitively challenging. The game sometimes seems to steer you towards a stealth-based approach, but I didn't see any real mechanics to actually support stealth. Enemies could spot you really easily in thick brush or when you're far away, hear you even when you're approaching in crouch. and were ridiculously accurate when firing. Plus, you only carry a machete if you sacrifice a weapon spot. There really should've been a dedicated knife button or slot. So usually I would tag as many combatants as I could from afar with the binoculars, pick off the closest enemies or the most dangerous ones with available sniper ammo, rockets and grenades, and then charge in to mop up with the shotgun or machine guns. The game does a great job of slyly adding better weapons as the levels progress, so you never get too bored if you're paying attention and trying new guns. Used the TILDE key constantly to save the game via console. The auto-save spots were too infrequent.\nI enjoyed the enemy variety. You start off fighting vanilla mercenaries, and the game introduces different enemies and varieties throughout. Fun addition to game was that one group of enemies was constantly fighting another, and they'd only pause battle so both could attack you. Levels that included three-way combat were great.\nThe story and characters are goofy fun. The way the game's plot reveals itself slowly over the 20-ish levels was well done, and maybe I'm dense but there was a twist near the end I didn't see coming. I was pleasantly surprised. The voice acting was hit and miss, but I thought the voice actor for Doyle the scientist did a great job, which is vital since he essentially narrates the game.\nPlayed 30+ hours, experienced zero crashes or noticeable bugs. Very stable game. Graphics were great for a game this old, and I really enjoyed the overall look of the island/sea setting. Crytek's specialty is advanced graphics and its reputation is well earned here.\nGive this game a chance if you haven't already, it's great fun. It's also a lengthy game so it's a great value proposition.","February 20","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

SPOILERS !!!\n\nAwesome game, especially the stealth aspect is very fun to play. The AI. is very glitchy at times, unfortunately, but other than that, the gameplay is good.\nOne of the disadvantages the game has is the Checkpoint save system, which unnecessarily increases the difficulty by a huge amount at some points As you progress through the game you follow a (very open, yet) linear path to various objectives that are pointed out on the map. At various keypoints, for example behind a base, a yards down the road, or at a roadblock the enemy put up. These are usually few and far between, *especially* in later levels of the game. As you activate the checkpoint by walking into it, instead of completing an objective (like killing the soldiers guarding the base (roadblock), it can happen that you accidentally save while on very low health. With a normal Save/Load system you would just reload an earlier checkpoint and try again to complete the section at higher health/armor, but this waqy you have to completely scavenge the base and all the surroundings for ammo and health/armor to at least have a chance at progressing through the game, as you WILL die very quickly, depending on your difficulty.\n\nApart from the save system, another flaw of the game is the steep difficulty curve. At one point in the game you will encounter so-called Trigens, mutated apes that will jump at you and can usually kill you in just under a few hits.\nThese can make it extremely hard to survive against other human enemies, just because they reduce you to such low health.\n\nAnother frustrating enemy appears much further in the plot: Giant mutants. With rocket launchers. That detect you from like 200m away. Afggdfgfdgdgsg.\nThese are so frustrating to kill, as they usually take like a million hits to kill, draining your ammo count (one time, I had to resort to grenades, as all my guns were completely out of ammo!)\nOverall, the levels are well designed, though, and the rest of the gameplay makes up for those annoying details.\nIf I had to rate the game, I would give it an 8/10. 9/10 if the Save system was improved out of the box, that means more checkpoints and better placement of them, or a Quicksave/Quickload system, like in many other games.","October 11, 2014","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics aren't bad considering the age and the freedom you get  on how to tackle obstacles is pretty nice. The AI also tends to handle itself pretty well MOST of the time, such as trying to flank you and what not, but that doesn't mean they won't go charging through a door they just saw 4 of their buddies get gunned down in.\n\nThat being said though, this game is really freaking hard. The enemies have pin-point accuracy at almost all times and they can spot you from extremely far away, even if you're sneaking around. The stealth aspect is pretty rough sometimes, especially when enemies can see you through tents, which I understand is a bug. You die VERY QUICKLY and MULTIPLE TIMES in this game. Some situations are hair-pullingly difficult and require lots of patience to get through simply because of how strong the enemies are.

Most of the time I didn't even know why I was supposed to carry out my objectives, but I was having too much fun figuring out how to elimate a group of guards to have it bother me anyway.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth playing if you wanna see Far Cry's roots.

So I bought it on Steam and don´t regret it.\n\nShort:\n\n+Good gunplay, weapons feel strong.\n+Tactic matters in taking out enemys.\n+Good mix between linear and open world sections.\n+Thinking outside the box will reward you.\n+It´s looking pretty good for a 2004 game.\n\n+/- ITS HARD AS ♥♥♥♥!\n+/- Story is not really deep, but still cheesy enough to entertain me.\n\n-AI sometimes goes full Cyborg-mode and see you through vegetation and geometry.\n-Render distance is pretty low, AI will often attack you outside your watchable space. Using scopes is the only solution.\n-At some points, enemy placement is simply unfair.\n-I got stuck in geometries a couple of times, seems like just bad collider.\n\n\nLong:\n\nFar Cry is one of the last true "old-school" games which means it is designed to be hard. If you want an easy shooter to kill some time, this is the wrong game for sure. To say it lightly you WILL die, a lot. For starters I recommend to play your first run on "easy", even for hardcore shooter-fans. Because every difficulty setting has an invisible +1 on it, what I mean is: easy is normal, normal is hard, hard is super hard etc. You get the point.\n\nThat said the game feels very good, the gunplay is strong, the AI is somewhat intelligent and tries to actively get you with a variety of tactics. Also the graphics are okay (especially for a 2004 game) and exploring feels rewarding. Hidden armorys, shortcuts and pathways are waiting in nearly every level for attentive players to be found.\n\nOn the other hand Far Cry suffers from two major flaws: The first is the fact that the render distance is very low, so what happens is that enemys WILL attack you outside your see-able area. You have to get closer or use scoped weapons to even see them. That said the enemys are unbelievable strong, especially when they somewhat go full ARMA 2 cyborg-mode and see you through obstacles and hit you with every shot at insanely distances.\nThe second flaw are bad colliders. I got stuck several times in different levels and sections, which got me killed and that’s frustrating.\n\nWell every other aspect is not worth mentioning, the music is okay, story is not great but cheesy which makes it okay.\n\n\nSo I would say:\n\nGameplay:        5*\nGraphic:            4*\nMusic&Sound:  3*\nStory:                3*\n\nOverall 8/10 Points, I had fun and that is a good sign.","October 16, 2015","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is balls to the walls difficult for an FPS. It is not forgiving and I was basically only able to beat this game by using a save game cheat. And that is basically the only part of this game that makes it unreplayable. Too be honest I found the gunplay to be quite fun. It is lacking as the enemies are complete bullet sponges, taking in up to a full clip from your M16. Guns in this game are neat, but it does focus on assault rifles. Other than three of them there are only enough weapons to fill the status quota of different types of weapons. Lacking? Yes. But still fun as I said earlier. The story of this game is quite...stupid. Government genetic testing. Bored yet? It is definetly not the reason you will be playiing the game. And neither will its claim to be an open world game. Maybe I just played the game wrong somehow but I found the world to be quite linear, with largish levels to trudge through. I started playing this game about the same time I started playing Far Cry 3 and...I was dissapointed. Now I know what you are saying, that I shouldn't be comparing it to a newer game, but to call this game open world seems like a sin to me, and made me glad we have 3.\n\nScore: 6/10\n\nIt is worth it on sale and if you want to see how the series began. Or if youre a hardcore bada** who can take on the world. If you can kill every enemy in this game on one playthrough you are the ultimate gamer.","April 11, 2014","false","25.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

You'll spend about 12 hours exploring this amazing world. Its realistic which is like the trade mark for all Far Cry games.

The lack of a save besides autosave adds to the difficulty, and this game is truly difficult.  On realistic, I would almost advise taking blood pressure medication since it literally is die, repeat, die, repeat, die, repeat (you're like tom cruise in edge of tomorrow). There was maybe like two sections between autosaves where I did not die multiple times throughout the entire game.  AI not only has x-ray vision, but can headshot you from 200m away with a pistol through walls/tents/bunkers.

Sound effects are amazing as well, dialogue is cheesy but fits the theme of the game. Plenty of enemy variety, although some are overpowered with being able to move too fast and having impossibly precise aim. Stealth is encouraged with plenty of ways to hide and be silent when killing. Going in gung ho usually does not work due to the overwhelming number of enemies that can be in the area. Long campaign, although it does get repetitive after a while and rewards you with a sudden and anticlimatic ending. Boss fights are challenging but not profoundly epic. Vehicles are fun to use and control fairly well. It can be a pain having to trouble long distances without a vehicle, which may happen from time to time. Use the console for saving because the checkpoints are way too far apart. The franchise has come a long way but if you're interested in its roots like I was it is a fun adventure through the jungle. 8.0/10","December 5, 2013","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you fight your way back to civilization, you'll deal with forces both human and beastly.\n\nIf nothing else, Far Cry is the epitome of a predatory game - stealth, patience, and planning are pivotal to your survival. It's a game with heavy emphasis on stalking your prey, outsmarting them, and picking them off, one by one. It's an exhilarating and rewarding feeling unparalleled by many other games. For this sole reason, Far Cry deserves high marks.\n\nOn a less positive note, Far Cry can be often times frustrating. While the maps are diverse, ranging from open world to tight corridors, the latter will often place you in ridiculously tough situations. You'll likely find yourself unfairly surrounded by enemies and dying plenty. It also doesn't help that the AI is subpar.

The graphics is actually so good, that is outshines some games released a decade later. But, there is always a butt! It takes too long before the story begins, and when it does, it is not very good. The A.I. is very stupid, and clearly programmed to not see you while you are moving in the vegetation. Other than that, they have no problems spotting you trough tents, bunkers and walls. They are also able to spot you further away than you can see, so you will have to use the binoculars to see who is shooting at you. I do not get the part with the mutants, it just feels weird. Other than that the game is pretty entertaining. The levels are a mix between “open world” (semi-open world with different paths that leading to the same goal) and linear. The game mechanics are good, which makes the game enjoyable. The hitboxes are good for a game this old, and you are rewarded for steady aim. The variation in weapons is not great, but it is good enough (should have been more weapons with silencer).\n\nAll in all this is a alright game and I think it deserves a score of 6,5/10. This is a good buy, if you can get it for a discounted price, or in a bundle.\n\nWeapon of choice: Mouse and keyboard\nDifficulty: Challenging\nResolution: 1920x1080\nGraphics: All max","March 30, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has more a focus on level design and campaign than the others. It has has elements of sci-fi and corny golden-age FPS. What I'm trying to say is, don't buy this game expecting it to be ANYTHING like Far Cry 2, 3 or 4!\n\nIn its own right it is a good game. It establishes a unique form of gameplay that many of its sequels use, and other games have expanded upon. It isn't "bang-bang" and hide behind a rock sort of strategy, the fighting in this game will require you to think, plan, and execute with extreme efficiency. If you don't play by the game with strategy, you will find yourself dying countless times. Trust me, I played the game on easy, and I still haven't got past the last level!\n\nAlthough this is a great game, it hasn't aged so well. The textures aren't so great, and the character models are dated. However, the beautiful enviroments of the island have aged quite nicely.\n\nIf you come to this game looking for deep, meaningful, Bioshock-like dialogue; you're going to be disappointed. This game never takes itself seriously for a second and that includes dialogue. Jack is your typical all-american hero, Val is your typical matter-of-fact reporter, and the mercs you fight are just as corny, saying lines such as "I've got your number!" or, "I'm gonna open a can of whip-♥♥♥ on you!"\n\nI find that this is kind of like a good predator video game, great action, over-the-top voice acting and dialogue, and the best gameplay you'll get. This game is great, too bad it hasn't aged well.","January 2, 2015","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First thing i remeber was i watched my friends brother play this game back in elmentary school , when i was around 9 or 10 and so i might have played some very few minutes back then but i can`t remember. I remeber I bought this july 2009 along with cod 2 somewhere in Germany in a super market. I finished cod 2 i was probably one of few in my classes that played the orignal cod games and didnt start and jump on the bandwagon on either mw 1 or for the most part in my class mw 2. However i bought far cry 1 and got to the last part of the game and never managed to do it if i recall correctly , before i had to unistall it. So i decided to take with me my far cry cd to my small house for the holiday and try and play it again. Ofc my cd didnt work, but i had  luck that it was 75% of steam so to re buy it digital instead of using my old vista computer and burn my far cry cd to another cd , as i couldnt until i get home anyway , i decided why the hell i can now have this digitally.\n\nSo now we are around 7 years later and i finally managed to completed this. So how does it hold up compared to then.  Well i recalled alot of the locations from when i played particaly the last location and some of the locations mid way trough the game eiter way:\n\nGood:\n- Gameplay, u can stealth some parts if you want to, you can plan your approach most of the times, and most of the levels has multiple solutions or multiple routes to take.\n- Good soundtrack\n- Great level desing\n- Great gunplay.\n- Its hard even on normal\n\nDecent :\n- Voice acting\n- Story , it would be on bad if this was anything but an fps , but you dont exept a fps do have good story and the story is actully pretty decent\n\nBad\n- Enemy line of sight can sometimes be bit weird but usually works just fine.\nBeside that not much\n\nRating 9/10\nOne of my favorite fps along with cod 2, mw 1, medal of honor frontline, half life 1 and even far cry 2 ( yeah i  know i am one of the few who really liked it)   ( Deus ex if that counts to)\n\nProbably had more fun with this then far cry 3 too.\nTotal play time if you excl my steam version i guess  around 25 hrs. I was far worse on fps 7 years ago then i am now.\nI rarely play fps these days but this one is recommend.","March 27","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That nails it: it WAS a good game back in the days.\n\nBut first off, the good things: This game was simple, dumb fun most of the times. Let me tell you why.\n\nMost importantly, shooting in this game is really fun since you get a nice load of guns, binoculars and a working stealth system. Pretty well done for a game of this age. There's some vehicles you can drive which is kinda fun, too. Your enemies aren't entirely stupid either and there's a whole lot of different enemy types, adding enough variety to keep you entertained.\n\nThe story is ridiculously dumb and cliché (yeah, this is a good thing IMO). The typical random guy who turns out to be a born killing machine and badass (you), the "hot" sidekick babe (unfortunately not as hot as the developers think she is) and of course, the ultimate antagonist: The German, crazy, narcissistic and ubermensch-creating Doctor Krieger. The plot is so dumb it's actually funny, so I guess it's alright as it is. Whoever buys this game can't possibly be expecting a deep story anyway, right?\n\nNow to the bad things.\nThis game is old, and that means its mechanics are not too well balanced and can FRUSTRATING. So if you are not the patient type, just forget this game.\nI'll give you some reasons as to why it gets so frustrating sometimes. First off, it doesn't have a health regenerating mechanic like most new shooters have. That means, you often get stuck with low health in very hard situations, making those even harder. You need armor pickups and health packs and both kinds are not being distributed in a regular order. Sometimes, you literally swim in pickups, sometimes, you don't get even a single one for what feels like five minutes of trying to survive literal rocket rains.\nOh, yeah. Second: ROCKETS. This is a game mechanic extremely frustrating since you cannot dodge them in certain situations and NPC's are too dumb to realize when the rocket is going to harm THEM as well so they just stay trigger happy even in meelee range. Also, there's a lot of enemy types using rockets, so it happens a lot.\nThird: Enemies act pretty normal in close to medium range. At long range, they become ♥♥♥♥ING EAGLE EYED MLG SNIPERS. Okay, maybe not this bad, but still, enemies spot you from veeery far away and start shooting, resulting in you losing health to an enemy you cant even see with your bare eyes. Especially annoying if these enemies happen to have friggin' rockets with them.\nFourth: Game design. While this game has decent design (meaning having you knowing what to do, where to go and not being unfair) at most points, SOMETIMES IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN'T. While that is pretty common for old games, that doesn't really make it better. So be ready to face fights you will have to do at least ten times to figure out which kind of game mechanic or AI flaws you might abuse to actually win them (that's what I meant by patience).\n\nIf all that still doesn't bother you too much and you're okay with older graphics, wait for a sale and pick it up. It's a nice little shooter when you're bored and also the first Far Cry game, paving the way for the Crysis series and the newer Far Cry games. It's interesting to see how incredibly similiar the gameplay of Far Cry 1 was to its successors. Still, this is a very old game suffering from typical design flaws. Remember to be patient with it.\n\nThanks for reading and enjoy the game if you buy it. ;)\n\n\n","January 19, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game opens with a cut scene of a client, 'journalist Val Cortez', taking off on a jet ski as Jack and Val near a mysterious island.

You can tell right away that this game is going to be action packed. Once Jack finds a large, crashed boat, he swims into the hull and that's where the gameplay starts.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you are on a massive island, levels varying in size and openness.

There are sniper rifles, rocket launcher, various assault rifles, pistols, loads of weapons really.

The game is about different choices in paths, mainly when outside.

Not on Steam and with mods. FCAM mostly.\nBack when I played it, it wasnt even on Steam and I played one of the first proper 64Bit games, with patch.\n\nYou are Jack Carver and you are on a trip to a island.\nUnexptected your companion disappears and you get attacked by mercs. You have to escape onto the island.\nYou are swimming and a grenade explosion underwater throws you into a tunnel and you get unconscious.\nYou wake up in a old sewer and need to escape. You fast meet a guy called Doyle which seems to want to help you.\nHe gives you cordinates and tips how to survive and what to do. So your trip over the big island starts.\n\nThe gameplay is a classical FPS shooter. Located in a openworld tropical island most of the time. You have several wespons like a knife, pistol, machine gun or sniper to fight against the enemies. You will meet many on your way over the island and the interesting is that they are quite inteligent, especially for old 2004 enemies. There also some sort of mutant enemies next to the typical mercs but those come later into the game. You also have some sort of spy glasses to mark enemies on your map marker or just check the situation. On your way you sometimes also can use cars. Thats pretty much it. Simple but extremely well made, especially for 2004.\n\nThe engine is the CryEngine. Back in 2004 this was one of the best looking games out then and it really changed the way of FPS shooters. Well, notably together with HL2 which came out around the same time.\nAlso this was the first game of a German developer named Crytek. Which is also known for the Crysis series.\nThis game has nothing to do with the Ubisoft Far Cry games like 2,3,4.\nThe only thing they have in common is that they are FPS. Dont make this mistake please!\n\nThe graphics are extremely good for the time and even today it somewhat still looks good or decent at least.\nAll graphic options you can imagine are ingame. There are even Render options ingame with that you can let the game for example look like a cartoon game! Rarely I seen such options in games! Far Cry turns into Borderlands. Also sound settings are extremely advanced! Extremely good and well made PC game. There is also a 64Bit patch available. You need to install it extra though. I personally recommend using the mod FCAM instead. Delivers pretty much the same graphical enhancements. On the top there are even more graphical improvements. This mod really pushes the engine to its real limit. Even my HD 5870 some years ago couldnt handle it on 60FPS on maxed settings, 1080p and 4xAA. For the fact that the game was like 6 years or more old this was astonishing. FCAM also adds proper ironisghts which work really good! Also it fixes many of the annoying bugs like enemies which can shoot through objects and hit you...\nFCAM is a must have! Even for first time players! Grab the latest 1.999 version on moddb guys!\n\nPositive:\n- Old but gold!\n- Pretty good PC game, technically speaking\n- Really good FPS experience\n- Challenging difficulty, good enemy AI\n- No regenerating health!\n- Great graphics with many options\n- Mod FCAM makes the game even better and makes it "perfect"\n- Crytek! Because yes!\n\nNegative:\n- Difficulty is high\n- Multiplayer is dead as of 2014. Gamespy is down but it was never played that much in MP anyway\n\nReplayability: High\n\nRating: 9.5/10\nIn my opinion this is totally one of the best games ever made.\nRarely I played a game so often, especially after so many years.\nDefinitely a big part of gaming history, especially on PC.\nAlso mods like FCAM improve it so much!\nWhat are you waiting for?

I've never played a FarCry before , nor seen any playthroughs of it. So I went at this one blind and simply said it exceeded  my expectations.\n\nThis is not a game that you raise your gun and run through without taking your share of fire. On the contrary you take fire and suffer multiple deaths througout the game. FarCry forces you to use tactics to survive.The AI can be brutal at times utilizing actual tactics to hunt you down and kill you. It is a common ocurocurrence to get cut down by a sniper , walk into an ambush , or get caught up in crossfire. Often times the mercs will distract you with a 3 man squad while the fourth member is creeping silently to flank and destroy you.\n\nYou must use stealth , cover, and keep your *** down in the bush or you will certainly wind up dead. Throughout the game I would crawl  through the jungle to avoid contact as long as I could. Recon is a must in FarCry , if you go into an enemy camp unprepared you are dead. Even the best trained soldier dies if he is unprepared , so remember to recon and  take the best weapon synergies possible into the fight. You must learn to adapt as the batlle will shift from jungle to corridor frequently.\n\nFarCry forced me into a very slow methodical pace , and as such may not be for everyone. I really enjoyed playing FarCry and it renewed my interest in FPS games again. If you are the kind of gamer who enjoys a real challenge then I would highly recomend that you give FarCry a play. FarCry is filled with many interesting twists and as a result I never really knew when it was going to end. As I've said before "If you are not very careful you will die alot." Try not to get frustrated FarCry was intended to be difficult. If you should survive until the endgame hopefully you will have found FarCry a rewarding experience. I highly recommend FarCry to people who appreciate a challenge in an FPS.","December 17, 2015","true","49.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This definately qualifies as 'unfair' difficult. Stealth kills are a no-go as far as I know, since apparently the enemy is telepathically linked and KNOW when you stab one of their guys even if they didn't shoot nor yell or were seen, and immediately coordinate lock on your location. They also can perfectly shoot you through bushes and tent walls as if they had Xray hacks. That's just the first 30 minutes. If that's how it's going to be on "Normal" difficulty, I think I'll pass. I dunno why they even bother with the rock throwing mechanic because if you kill one guy, no matter how quiet, they know exactly where you are and you cannot hide.\n\nI understand other games are like that, but this game exists on the premise of tactical gameplay. But you can't exactly be tactical with mercinary psychics. You are better off playing this as if it were Doom or something. While that may not be bad itself, it seems strange in a tropical environment with bushes that realistically you could sneak around in.\n\nThe story is shakey even from the start. For one, after a brief acid trip, some CIA dude I guess somehow KNEW exactly where you'd be and left a phone for you to contact you with. I dunno I guess everyone in the game has a 6th sense but you...unless of coarse you beat the game already. All I can say is this game has a cronic case of game logic.\n\nI did not encounter any of these problems in Farcry: Instincts, so I assume obviously Ubisoft listened to the negative feedback with this game and fixed it for the alternate remake.","July 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Is it because Far Cry 3 literally beat down the others so nobody will try this game? or just because the game is very old. Not sure. Very fun when you have nothing to do and this will entertain you for a couple hours. Multiplayer is pretty much dead so I wouldn't even try to get onto that.\n\n\nWhen I downloaded this game, I launched it and I got a "Critcical Error"or "Critical Exception" Probably becuase I was playing on a Integrated-laptop. I easily fixed this by going to Far Cry Config and turning dynamic light to "HIGH" instead of "VERY HIGH" I guess it just took too much to handle for Intel HD Graphics.\n\n\n\nWhen I played this game on Intel HD Graphics (1000), it ran on mostly Very High settings with Shadows on Low. Ran around 50 fps average, so you shouldn't be worried about if you can run this game or not.\n\nThis game is VERY VERY challenging to play even on MEDIUM difficulty, as it then goes all the way to Realistic, which I am not even going to BOTHER run. But definitely more challenging than Far Cry 2-3, and even other games to this day.\n\n8/10 Fun, Exciting, Challenging.","December 7, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But it's also probably one of the better FPS games I've experienced because it never really felt repetitive to me, unlike other games of the same genre.\n\nYou need to adopt a methodical apporach, be wary of your surroundings, and be a crack shot in order to progress through each level. You can't just dive in and spray like scarface every single time. That's not gonna cut it in this one.\n\nI'd recommend buying on discount due to some bugs and (from what I heard) multiplayer being dead. But if you're an avid FPS player, this is a goodie to have with 20 levels,12-15 hours of gameplay, and the open world.\n\nOh,and whoever designed the last level in this game is a sadist.","February 2, 2015","true","18.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

The accuracy is poor, imagine an artifical spray and pray - the gun cursor is just a 'basic' indicator where the bullets will go, not nessarily where you are pointing.  The gun sights offer slightly better accuracy but still, not good enough considering the accuracy of the mercs and traps.\n\nEven with some much needed mods like FCam; the game is still a huge chore to play and saving after every encounter with mercs is essential- forget using stealth tactics...if you want working stealth, install Far Cry 2 and skip this.\n\nAs for the difficulty, there is honestly very little difference between easy and realistic difficultly - thats how hard this game is; realistic mode is just mostly for masochists who enjoy dying alot, or  who have played the game so much they have remembered the exact layout of the merc placements.","May 9","false","1.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mybestfriendisafox/recommended/13520/","mybestfriendisafox","Damsel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mybestfriendisafox/","77 products in account","I was wondering how long it would take for me to find a game that was really not worth my time. Farcry made me cry, a lot. So let's get into this.\n\nFar Cry is not a game where the story was generally well thought out. They throw you onto an island "paradise" where your character, jack Carver, was vacationing. From there something random happens and you have to fight through mercenaries in order to get contact with scientist named Doyle. Your character immediately trusts Doyle for no reason and then proceeds to fight through random monkey mutants and mercenaries in order to rescue a woman I still know nothing about. In short the story doesn't really make sense and is full of plot holes. Often the characters do things blindly or through the power of male female attraction. If the three characters do know each other then it's not well established. The story feels barely stitched together and thus is easily the weakest part of the game. It simply doesn't make sense, less so than many call of duty campaigns.\nFrom a sound design perspective the game is fairly unremarkable. Be ready for weak audio cues and sound effects that don't really match the actions of the characters. When a main character gets shot in a bullet proof vest he will basically Wilhelm scream, the enemies shout the same five taunts at you. All the weapons have compressed unrealistic sound effects and generally speaking the OST seems to be the same five tracks. If it isn't, then they all sound the exact same. This game did not impress in the sound department.\nThe game mechanics are frankly broken. I've seen alot about this actually and it seems this is the result of a bad patch but it still made the game barely playable. Only a few of the guns actually are usable. The AI is ridiculous, stealth (though introduced as a mechanic) is not functional. Trigins will kill you in a single hit, and the game's version of a difficulty curve is simply to throw more and more enemies at you at a time. It never gets more challenging from a skill perspective; it just throws more of the same challenge at you until the end of the game. The armor mechanic is okay at best, as it does give you more hit points and the sprint meter and crouching / going prone works fairly well to stabilize weapons and focus aim. However the game also suffers from bad vehicles. The vehicles are nearly un-drivable due to their half first person camera viewing. The third person viewpoint actually makes the car more un-drivable. In any case the vehicles require you to drive and shoot at the same time, and this just make sit incredibly hard not to crash into everything and incredibly hard to kill anything in a vehicle while moving. Far Cry also will spawn in helicopters ontop of your character providing instant death. The game is also prone to glitches such as bullets not activating collision detection, enemies shooting through walls, enemies freezing, audio and visual glitches, as well as many others.  Finally the game does attempt two boss fights. One of these is very easy and hardly of note and the second one broken. When fighting Crow on the freight ship, the game has you fight a heavily buffed helicopter with a rocket launcher. The helicopter can take 15 rockets and Crow has a mini-gun that can shred your armor and health instantly. You can see how this is broken as heck...\nPresentation however is where Far Cry earns some credit. The level designs tend to be functional and original in the late game. They show a level of creativity that takes you from tree top testing facilities to a massive volcano. Each of these levels provides ample cover and weapons (disregarding the enemy game play of course). Also the graphics actually look fairly decent. As a game from 2004, on high setting the water looks phenomenal and the game itself is pretty average. The FMV cut scenes, while pretty rough, are also fairly good for FMV of the time. In short the presentation of Far Cry was its saving grace and actually gave me something to look forward to in each level.\nSo now to summarize...\n\nPros:\n- Average FMV cut scenes\n- Strong level variety and design\n- Strong enemy variety\n- Average graphics for 2004\n- Satisfying boat level because only the boats aren't broken\n\nCons:\n- Forgettable and repetitive OST\n- Poor use of SFX\n- Prone to major glitches\n- Most of the guns are unusable\n- Poorly implemented mechanics\n- Bipolar AI.\n- Constant instant kills from enemies.\n- Broken boss fights and helicopter spawning\n- Dam.\n- Nonsensical story\n- Generally bad one liners and forgettable characters\n\nFor you completionists in the crowd this game is not for you. While easy to complete in the sense that it has no "new game plus" or bonuses beyond beating it on normal, it's still a pain due to how broken it is. Be prepared to get angry. Some levels are broken due to the enemies being hyper intelligent. Dam is an excellent example of this because the player character has no basic melee attack and the game only gives you a machine gun with ten bullets. You will die over and over again at this point hopelessly running through hundreds of tirgins attempting to reach a checkpoint. There are other moments like this that are breathtakingly bad but I don't have all the space to recount them. For completing the game you will unlock mods and statistics mode. Mods are useable as there was a modding community for the game, however I haven't a clue if there is one that fixes the issues with the 1.4 patch. Statistics mode is the exact same game with a few additions like a kill counter and an accuracy rating at the end of the level. While it's nice that Ubisoft added a completion bonus to the game, this bonus really offers no new content and really isn't worth the trouble. If you hated this game once, you’re not going to love it because of statistics. So to conclude i'd give this game a 4.2 out of 10 (as it did have its moments and honestly wasn't the worst thing I’ve ever touched) and a completionist rating of Plook at it!\n","May 20","false","11.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The graphics are amazing. For me, it's the first time that I played where you are in the tropics and can swim in the waters. Each level as you progress shows off a different part of the day. Morning, mid day, evening and night. The game play is straight forward, you also have an open range to wander but, it gets redundant at one point. Best to stay on track and enjoy the scenery either by running, driving, motorboating, and even by hang glider.\n\nKill the bad guys, kill the monsters too, they can be scary at times, some of them move fast. You can use machine guns, sniper rifes, pistols and even throw rocks to create distractions. Typical FPS game and well what's differnt too is that your game difficulty depends on how you deal with the bad guys. Sometimes you have to use stealth to get by or face a barage of angry mercs.\n\nThe game is worth playing. Check out any youtube videos on it.

There is a small variety of wepons but you can have fun with them all [my favorite one is the shotgun] as well as some sweet gadgets like the thermal goggles.  The bosses where a bit of a shame as they where simply easy to kill [excluding crowe in the helicopter].

Once you get over the slightly dated graphics, you'll notice all the enjoyable things that make the hours fly by.\nThe gameplay is excellent, and the level design is very good. Each time I felt the game might begin to feel repetitive, some new elements were introduced, and had me hooked right back in. There are cars, boats, choppers, turrets, tunnels, ruins, fortresses, mercenaries, monsters... Lots of things to get excited about, lots of variation.\n\nI'm a pretty decent FPS guy, and I always go for the "normal" setting, to treat all games equally... but I was surprised at how challenging this game is. I'm not used to dying this much.\nMost of the time, it's OK, though, because it forces the player to take a more stealthy and planned approach to combat than in most shooters.\nBut sometimes the high level of difficulty has to be blamed on ridiculously difficult bosses (and areas), and that got a little tedious at times. I bet that 80% of the total game time was spent on a handful of tough situations that had to be repeated over and over and over again.\n\nOf course, as many have pointed out, the protagonist in Far Cry is voiced by perhaps the worst voice actor I've ever heard, and that's saying a lot (I've been a gamer since the eighties).

I'll start off again with the great stunning visuals within this game (of it's time.) Best part of all, you don't need anything too high-end to play this title. The story is rather short and but clear enough to understand the premis of the game. Cutscenes happen almost instantly and you resume playing in an instant as well. Almost makes you wonder what had just happend after the short duration. Gameplay is rather repetitive. You kill, and kill some more. Unlike the other Far Cry games in the franchise, you can't really attempt stealth in this game. Enemies will spot you from afar. Leaving you in a gunfight against a great number of enemies. The game is also rather hard. Mainly because shooting one enemy will alert the rest. Again, no stealth feature was implemented. Despite all the setbacks, it is still a good game back in it's day (still is.) If you're a fan of games that consists of guns blazing. This would be a game to add to your library.

On a revisit though, this game isn't half bad.  You have to be exceptionally stealthy and tactics matter.  Go in guns blazing guaratees your death.  Even at ten years old the AI of the enemy is good enough to really hurt your ability to advance.  The setting is even interesting from a historical stanpoint.  The game is very long with some interesting level design for most of the game, and to give it some more legs you are given a serviceable story with incredibly bad acting, think 80s action movies.  With that they introduce some scifi elements that really detract from the good enemy AI, think mutants, but it didn't stop me from playing to the end.\n\nI recommend it on the basis that you go in aware it was a top of the line game from another time and definitly shows it's age.","February 7, 2015","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a small variety of wepons but you can have fun with them all [my favorite one is the shotgun] as well as some sweet gadgets like the thermal goggles.  The bosses where a bit of a shame as they where simply easy to kill [excluding crowe in the helicopter].

Far Cry is another of those examples from their repertoire. This is some great, solid stuff, despite the bugs and glitches. A game to remember. Far Cry is hard. A true challenge even at the easier difficulty settings. Performance is an issue even for today's hardware standards. The game seems to need a fresh system restart to run at its full potential. There are plenty of bugs and glitches. Some were so major that I was forced to reload a save point several times. The game engine and physics is different than most other games, and this takes a little getting used to. The main character's voice acting is pretty bad. Almost to the point of making it sound like a comedy. For whatever idiotic reason, the game alters the Windows audio settings to its liking without setting them back to their original state. This is extremely annoying. Staying in the subject of sound, do a Google search and you will see the massive amount of sound problems people experience in this game. To access the multiplayer portion of the game, one is forced to register and create an account with Ubisoft, which is absolutely ridiculous. The developers clearly reward players who specialize in stealth and skill shots rather than running and gunning. The atmosphere, mood, and setting are superb; providing a tense and exciting experience almost every second of the game. The tension you will experience is not often produced by other games at this same level. There are many parts where you will be spooked and surprised by what comes around the corner or appears suddenly. It is all done very well. Level design in this game is outstanding. The AI is good, and there is always a challenge. Far Cry is all thriller, no filler.\n\nFar Cry is great.","March 20, 2014","true","17.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mutants with the rocket launcher take FOREVER to kill, and if you get hit once you are done for, even on the easiest difficulty. The mutants only show up about half way through the game, and everything before that is just fantastic. The game is actually really fun in the beggining and it sets the far cry series up for greatness.

What made the multiplayer great on the consoles was the map editor which doesn't exist in this version nor do any custom maps appear online (which is dead, only 1-10 servers with only about 3 or 4 running with a maximum of 8 players if you're lucky) which is the only thing that really made Far Cry multiplayer worth playing.\n\nThe campaign I didn't play much of, but it's really typical.

I wouldn't recommend buying this even if it was 99 cents because it's honestly not worth the time in my opinion. The campaign is worth a playthrough I guess but you won't want to play it again.\n\nTo get to the point, if you want it for the multiplayer, DO NOT BUY IT because it's basically non-existant.

There are points of it which are still good. Its pretty much non-linear sandbox style maps. You've got your target location, but how you get there is up to you. The use of vehicles is nice (though fairly commonplace in modern games), the locations are nicely rendered and the combat system is okay. The hero is pretty forgettable, just the standard 1980's musclebound ex marine with zero personality. The plot line is somewhat cliched and doesn't really hold much interest. So an average game really, which hasn't stood the test of time too well. My score 6/10","December 10, 2012","false","38.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/13520/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","Far Cry. Oh Far Cry.\n\nThis game. This game is hard. And frustrating. Hell, it didn't even work properly on boot up. Nor did it work perfectly when it DID finally boot up. Had to turn down my settings to "High" and the shadows to "Medium" in order to get it working properly.\n\nBut: First things first. You're a retired elite soldier, running some tourism boat tour company or some ♥♥♥♥. A young woman asks you to drive her all the way to a small collection of little islands because she wants to study ancient culture or whatever. A rocket strikes your boat on the way to the islands, you get stranded and then: The girl is from the CIA! Mercenaries want to kill you! Mutants! A nuclear bomb! More mutants! A volcano which is exruciatingly hard to get through! EVEN MORE MUTANTS! Oh and you have to stop the guy who created the mutants for humanity's sake, of course. And you get the girl. And everyone is happy in the end. Except for the tons of dead guys.\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it, really. Anyway, being top-notch at its time, Far Cry isn't all that bad. It's got decent game mechanics, outrageous physics and ok graphics. Well. It came out the same year as Half-Life². Go figure. What I dislike the most is that all the levels are split in, well, levels. No open world, just an arrangement of missions for you to fight your way through. And it's got bugs and glitches, making it possible to skip some sections entirely - or not being able to get through some sections at all. Also, it's hard to try and search for a different approach to any given mission, making it boring after one playthrough. No replayerability whatsoever. There's always an optimal way to get through this game and all the other ways are just painful.\n\nSpeaking of painful: This game is hard. Even on medium difficulty you'll be running into enemies that do not hesitate to shoot a rocket straight in your face from 2 meters of distance, snipers that shoot with pinpoint accuracy from roughly 2 kilometers away so that you can't even SEE them because of the horrendous draw distance. Or just a big bunch of waaaay too strong mutants that come jumping at you and melee you to death in one or two hits.\n\nAlso: The plot. It lacks any form of engagement. Halfway through I asked myself what my original objective was, why I'm on this island and why the hell I have to blow up three radio towers. I listened to the guy giving me the mission, I did. But it seemed just so irrelevant that I forgot five minutes after. And when I finally came to the last five levels I started asking myself "When does this end?". But I wanted to get through, just so that I beat this game.\n\nIf you like AI behaviour that renders you defenseless on higher difficulties due to them shooting with pinpoint accuracy and onehitting you and if you like levels that only allow for one or two approaches at it and you don't care about any sort of plot, you might like Far Cry. Speaking for myself, I didn't like it too much and wouldn't recommend it. Unless you can get it quite cheap when Steam's got another deal. Then you can have a go at it. But otherwise... no. If you'd asked me 10 years earlier I would've said "WOW! This thing is AMAZING!". But today's standards do not allow this to happen.","November 23, 2014","false","15.3"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","22","47","0","8"

The intro cutscene seemed to make no sense and it was just a whole lot of random ♥♥♥♥ and then you are taken into a tutorial, and this is where you find out that the controls suck balls.\n\nI won't get too in depth with it but crouching is weird and sometimes it doesn't even do the animation and your screen just jerks down. Sprinting is about 2% faster than your normal speed so all it really does is make you less accurate, does a weird animation and uses up your energy which you need to jump and I think you need it to hold your breath for some reason.\n\nAfter a little bit of walking you are introduced to the stealth system... Which doesn't work. Press G to throw a rock which is for some strange reason the same button used to throw grenades but that's just a little weird. Now here is why it's broken. There is no delay between an enemy thinking they hear you and them shooting you and this is the best part of the 'stealth' system, I was trying to sneak around and I threw a rock to get some enemies to move and what do they do? Shout 'I've found him!' and they did a 180 and shoot me. So it thinks that it has stealth mechanics but doesn't so your best bet is just shooting everyone but, surprise! sometimes you just die. I don't know how, I thought I had everyone killed but I was being shot so I went and hid and then BAM, dead and remember how sprinting only makes you go 2% faster? yeah have fun running back, oh I'm sorry, taking a leisurely stroll back to where you were to try and kill everyone again.\n\nAnimations are just plain lazy, don't look at the machete because you may end up throwing up.\n\nNow, to end this review I will leave you with this. What happens when you decide that it's a terrible game that hardly works? You try to leave, what happens if you try to leave? It crashes and your cursor disappears of screen making it basically impossible to close though I did manage to get my cursor to reappear after locking my account and unlocking it again so there's that.\n\npros\n- I can't wait to uninstall it so that's a plus\n\ncons\n-stealth system is broken\n-ai is broken\n-sometimes you just die because the game decided you should die\n-movement system is broken\n-game is broken so don't buy it\n\n-1/10","January 13, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","11","25","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/13520/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","So firstly i have never played any Far Cry game ever before playing this one in 2015.  This is because i like to play games in order of release and i recently bought a package in the Steam Winter sale 2014 which included Far Cry, Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.  I cant remember how much the package was but it was super cheap.\n\nSo this being my first ever Far Cry experience i went in knowing that this was released a long time ago and that it was an older game so didnt expect too much. I haven't really played any other games that i can compare this to within the same time period either so i don't really know what graphics/gameplay mechanics were like back then.\n\nSo this game immediatly has terrible graphics in comparison to the film quality graphics of today but i assume they were probably pretty good for 2004 :P\n\nThe game is basically mission based unlike Far Cry 4 (which i haven't played but believe is Open World??) so it does feel very linear, meaning you have to go down this set path to these set objectives even though there are occasionally multiple paths to the same place.\n\nThe A.I is too sensitive or there is no option to sneak in this game since they appear to 'hear' you from what would seem well out of hearing range.  The A.I can 'hear' you through walls of buildings, they can see you and shoot you through buildings or tents.\n\nThe health in this game is very very badly balanced with the enemies/difficulty too.  Since this game has no achievements i thought to myself 'i'll play on the easiest difficulty just so i can enjoy the game and walk through it no problem' LOL! Yeah so i somehow manage to take two bullets and my entire Armor and Health are basically depleted on the easiest difficulty.\n\nThis just makes it too much of a pain to complete the missions for me and having put in what i believe to be a decent amount of effort and time trying to finish the game, i just can't bring myself to finish it because im dying too easily, the story isnt too interesting, the voice acting and all the cheesy lines are terrible and im just generally not enjoying playing it.\n\nSo from me this game on its own i wouldn't reccomend but i will be playing Far Cry 2 next and so on, so maybe as a part of the Far Cry package it wouldn't be as bad.","March 12, 2015","false","6.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","2"

Firstly, thank you to Rinon for buying me this game.\n\nNow with the pleasantries over with I can go into the meat of the review. Yes, this is an eleven year old game, but even on my rather decent gaming rig I was getting graphical artifacts, crashes and not even being able to play the game for what little I played. I purchased this game retail when it came out in '04, and my memories were true. Crytek make pretty engines, but horrible games. With enemies that can instakill you on moderate difficulty before you are within visual range of them, enemies that have models that pop in out of nowhere, and constant, frustrating artifacts the game was unplayable for me on each and every setting. Audio was a joke, as my headphones could just barely pick up voices and/or sounds even when at the maximum volume.\n\nNormally my OCD requires me to play each and every game in a series, but for now - I am skipping over to Far Cry 2. Your results with this game might vary, but in my opinion - do not get your hopes up.\n\n-Update 1/28/15-\nAnother three hours of wrangling with the game and all I ended up with was a pair of BSODs, an overheated GPU, and a full on crash that forced me into safe mode. I hate to do this but I am going to have to urge others not to purchase this game, it could damage modern hardware if my results are any proof.","January 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/13520/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","Having no nostalgia or rose tinted glasses for this game I can firmly say this game dousn't really stand well against the test of time. When it was new and innovative Im sure people looked at it like it was great. I can firmly say that this game isn't that great. Its definetly dated and in relative to game design of more recent its just inferior.\n\nIs it fun? Yeah, but more often than not I found I was having fun only to just die with no real idea who or what killed me or how. Then being forced to reload and play what might be a lengthy part of the game which ultimately undoes any fun it was the first time.  Also the fun is to few and far in between.\n\nGameplay genereally revolves around getting from A to B and killing everyone who gets in the way in between. Sometimes B is an objective or a bomb you need to blow something up which means you need to go get the bomb then back track usually. Theres vehicles peppering the game that add some variety aswell as a myriad of weapons. Some of which are quite a bit more usefull than others. Theres a combination of both semi-open world maps and corridors though the game is best when outside in a semi-open world map where the AI is best to play against\n\nThe AI has issues. They do that old thing games used to do (and bad games still do) where enemies will snap to you and shoot immediatly if you so much as poke your head out while they are alerted, while some other times they won't even be looking the right way or they will just stare at you. Or if your driving on a boat at full speed they will still be hitting you no matter how fast you are going. Its compounded by the fact tracers dont necesarrily follow where the bullets are traveling or hitting (which is especially common in older and cheaper games) so it can be hard knowing exactly if your hitting or what your getting hit by (next to no problem when your on foot shooting though when using mounted weapons it is). Another issue is that in close quarters the AI shoots so accurate and fast that with guns one guy can pretty much take most your armor and health away. Which while you did everything right, all it took was one rogue guy and a bad checkpoint and now your saved with less than 50% hp and no armor.  Luckily theres usually not much terraferma between health and armor, though sometimes it can be quite a drag to get to them. Ironically regenerating HP would actually make this game more enjoyable especially with how difficult it is and how little damage you can take anyway. An issue I have found is that RPG guys are way to often. RPG wielding enemies will shoot from ridiculous ranges at you, fortunately RPGS travel pretty slow but its still annoying especially with the blast radius. Another point about explosions, they are very inconsistant. If you shoot a rocket anywhere near a vehicle (such as using the jeep mounted RPG to blow guys out of cover) and even relatively far away you will 1 shot kill yourself. I think I played this on challenging, so I advise playing it on normal or easy, unfortuantely on easy and normal the AI are pretty stupid and can just barely hit you with my testing. Yep, its one of those games where instead of making the AI linearly more challenging its basically a cliff of difficulty.\n\nThe mutants are an interesting addition but have so little variety that theres only like 3 or 4 diffrent ones and compared to the humans they arn't fun to fight due to little or no tactics but they can kill you with incredible ease in some cases. But by the end of the game theres a over reliance on mutants with rocket launchers to make it difficult and it really stops being interesting by then. They soak up so much damage that its easier in most cases to just go past or around them and since you move so slow it can be hard to dodge away from them and their spalsh damage which again is the reason I prefer not to fight them.\n\nIt gets worse when your going up against armored guys who will soak up anything short of a headshot (So thats where Far Cry 2 got that design idea from...) And the inconsistant nature of the AI just gets worse. Some bushes that should conceal you the AI might see right through and get alerted and shoot you, while the opposite also happens. Sometimes AI decides they want to dump a magazine and hit you with a good number of rounds while at medium distance.\n\nThough for all its bad, the AI does try basic tactics such as sneaking and they do exhibit independant like thinking capabilities. Instead of the game saying you are here (which does happen) the AI will exhibit cases where NPCs will search for you and while one may find you the others wont be informed of your location in the world until they learn of it. Or atleast thats what it seems like, its not as good as Far Cry 2 and both pale in comparison to Arma and mil sim games. The mutants don't seem to do much in terms of tactics though.\n\nSaving is not very good. Unlike past games like Doom or HL1 saves are check point based and not very good. Sometimes they are to far between and with no capability to save yourself you are at the will of the save system. So a shoot out your having trouble getting past means you have to reload and get back to the fight just to try to get past it.  These days check points and auto saving is much better than this but this is far from that and really needed a manual save.\n\nVehicles pepper the world and levels and offer variance to the gameplay which is especially nice with the boat levels as they are some of the largest levels and offer the most tactical choices aswell as looking the best. I really like the reflection in water when used in games. Unfortunately land mass dousn't usually get reflected due to a glitch in the steam version regarding modern OS compatability if I remember.\n\nCompatability wise, the game is just barely there. Im honestly surprised the game actually works and dousn't crash or have many issues. Its advisable to download a fan made updated (1.41) or some other mods that make it so enemies dont see through buildings (primarily tents and shacks how the f*ck did that get through QA?) aswell as some address other glitches or add stuff to the game. If you can help it, don't buy the Steam version but instead buy the GOG version.  Sometimes when I try to close the game the game will give a black screen and keep running. As I said it just barely works.\n\nThe story is a throw away. Its like the John Carmack quote. The story here is just ultimately to give you a reason to go kill and shoot people and its pretty stupid and goofy but not entertaining on its own or anything worth mention.\n\nThe GOG version costs the same and is more open aswell comes from a truly free (freedom wise) service in terms of DRM.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game unless you are heavy into classic FPS games or unless your looking for a decent but hard FPS game. If you just want a good or great game this just isn't it, Far Cry 2 is better in some aspects especially gameplay though so I would recomend that one more so. If you really care about the Far Cry series your not missing much if anything at all. If you do want to play it don't put it above normal and maybe even easy and it might even be worth it to stop playing the game before you get to the latter levels as story wise and mechanics wise your missing nothing. Best parts are when your in an open area and fighting humans anyway. Also the final fight is intensly difficult for what feels like all the wrong reasons. Its all the worst parts of the game put together to just make it hard. So theres nothing your going to miss if you stop playing before the final mission or around the time the game turns more into a corridor shootery type game.","March 28, 2015","false","16.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","4"

Don't buy this game.\n\nAlthough it was considered ground breaking and innovative in it's time, it has not aged well and is now mediocre at best plus a BUNCH of bugs and a ridiculous amount of difficulty. I just finished the campaign and I will not be playing the game at all after that. I simply wanted to play through it so I could say I played the whole series.\n\nOne of my main gripes with this game is the way the AI can perfectly shoot you through walls. I'm all for bullets going through tents (it seems the buildings in the compounds are made of the same material as tents or whatever) and all but it should be a random chest-height spray that you can easily avoid. Not perfect pinpoint aim right at you no matter where you move or how you attempt to dodge. Couple that with the fact that you can easily die in 3-4 bullets, and you get some really, really frustrating gameplay.\n\nI know this was made in 2004 and I gave it the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But, even in 2004, I expect to be safe from outside gunfire when I enter a building. Also, another thing that frustrated me were the stairs. They are extremely broken, mostly the metal ones, and I often got stuck and had to spam prone/jump to get out of the glitched area. This could often be a problem when in a fight as you can't really walk up these stairs without glitch-hopping and jumpinh around.\n\nLastly, the games story was really bland. For almost the whole thing, but especially at the end I was questioning why I was doing what I was doing.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nI want to take this time to rant about the end of the game and how stupid/confusing it was. So for those of you who have played it, when you blow up the nuke, all of a sudden you are now captured in a helicopter with the main bad guy? It made no sense to me. I thought the game was going to end with that nuke but nope instead you get put into a typical fight for survival where you are striped of all weapons and equipment hooray! And then the end where you got to kill Doyle? Was his betrayal not the most obvious thing or what. I thought literally from the moment he first contacted me that he was going to end up being a bad guy in the end. Really predictable and boring story coupled with bad voice acting to boot, I'm just glad it's over.","December 29, 2014","false","9.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","4"

This can be fixed by modding the game or downloading a fix patch. However, this bug was fixed early on when this game first came out, and therefore there isn't an excuse for it to be present on this Steam version.\n\nThe main problem, however, is the fact that in my experience, certain load points always crash the game.

It still looks pretty good, but the game mechanics have not aged well.  There's no plot connection between the various Far Cry games, you might as well spend your time on a later and better designed Far Cry.\n\nThe plot, characters and voice acting are sub-par.  I get it's supposed to be a parody, but it's the sort of lazy parody that becomes what it's parodying.  You're a guy with a gruff voice who will kill everybody on an island because some stranger on a cell phone says so. Finding your probably kidnapped girlfriend seems secondary.\n\nCombat can be brutal, even at a modest difficulty level, and you usually want to avoid a stand up fight (this is a positive to me).  You're usually heavily outnumbered and don't have a lot of health.  However, the game's combatants fall to typical overpowered FPS tactics like sniping, head shots and vehicles.\n\nThis could have been mitigated by a good stealth system, but I found it hard to predict when and what would cause me to be spotted.  Sometimes I would be sneaking inside a building and shot through the walls.  Other times I could head shot a guard in the middle of an enemy camp and nobody seemed to notice.  Maybe they're all just super chill nilhists?  The inability to save the game other than at predetermined save points made dying after spending much time sneaking around particularly frustrating.\n\nThe breaking point for me was a map in a dark cave.  Grey soldiers against grey walls that I can't see, but they seem to see me just fine.  I'd sneak along only to hear "who's there" followed by muzzle flashes in my face.\n\nMaybe the game gets awesome later, but I'm not sticking around to find out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/recommended/13520/","fubarhouse","FubarHouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/","189 products in account","Project Far Cry, also known as Far Cry is the original title in a franchise which has been successful for a decade now. Its setting has evolved a great deal since its inception. I'm not sure if Ubisoft was aware of what they were creating back in 2004 when Far Cry was released but I believe it's safe to assume most gamers have had a fair amount of enjoyment from the series.\n\nFar Cry was set on the world's most tropical island with crystal clear waters and a bright, vibrant, lush green bushes and rainforests. The setting of this game really is something you would dream of and is quite interesting in this respect - the environment is beautiful.\n\nAs this game was released along-side to id software's Doom 3, Far Cry claimed via marketing to be so much better in every way. Unfortunately Far Cry was heavily over-rated by the media of the day and provides little to cater for new technologies and physics at its time. Doom 3 may have had serious hardware problems in its day but it has aged gracefully and the same cannot be said for Far Cry. I actually found Far Cry loves to randomly crash with critical errors, so naturally my judgement is that Far Cry was never completed - which might be the reason for my gripes with this game.\n\nI loved the weaponry - however limited, but especially the machine gun - for such a limited time of which I had. I enjoyed the method of mission delivery and how missions are carried out and the games general mechanics. The game does however feature broken physics, a disinteresting and mediocre story and really bad AI.\n\nAs for the physics, it was quite simple that I expect not to be shot inside of a building from the outside with bullets and I would expect to never kill people outside in that situation - but honestly, it seems there's a first for everything. The story and protagonist were quite bad but I won't spoil any - I actually found more interest in the companion unlocked late in the game. The bad AI, well I wouldn't say the AI themselves are bad because I saw them perform some interesting things including team leaders giving their forces hand gestures - I'll admit that surprised me. What I mean is that the enemies can take you out from miles away with a rocket and there's nothing you can do about this - but when you get a rocket launcher you don't have the same accuracy. It seems there's some serious aimbot action happening here and I disapprove.\n\nMy only other gripe is related to the realism of the tropical island setting - where the story progresses to include monsters and mutants and some seriously lame elements. Aside from this they basically have one-hit kills and take a lot of ammunition to take down so the difficulty fluctuates significantly and most people will give up on this game.\n\nTo be fair I didn't use all the games mechanics, I didn't learn where enemies are exactly, so there's definitely a way through this game with ease but not without experience. I suppose I never used these features due to the control setup, and I just shifted the controls to my liking.\n\nOverall, I believe this game is highly over-rated and those calling this a classic are only doing it for nostalgia. It's a great game on the outside, nice and fun, but once you begin progressing you'll realise that it's not an amazing game with huge technological advances such to what everybody of the time were fed by the media, but it's nothing more than incomplete and broken.\n\nI'm glad its sequel was an improvement in every way, really.","December 23, 2014","false","9.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Some of these levels are HUGE, and if you can't find any sort of vehicle, or the game doesn't give you one, well, god help you.\nThis game is HARD as Hell. In the later levels, there are so many baddies in each swarm, some extremely powerful with way too much health, several of them at the same time, that I don't think its likely to be possible without cheating. I'm not a hardcore gamer, and I don't like this level of difficulty. I was playing on Normal...not even one of the harder difficulties, but I still couldn't do it.\nI didn't really find the story all that interesting. For me, it was just kind of there, behind the swarms and swarms of enemies.\nTo me, the game just feels unbalanced, unpolished, even broken in some ways.\nThis game had a few redeeming qualities though\nSome of the levels are pretty open, which allow for multiple approaches to getting past or through the enemies.\nEach level was unique and for the most part well-executed. Some areas are huge. The indoor level layout was pretty linear but this wasn't a problem for me because I grew up playing linear games like this.\nActually, I think that's about it, off the top of my head. I didn't absolutely hate this game but I did not enjoy my experience with it. Unless you're a hardcore gamer who loves challenge, I would pass this up and try the other games in this series instead, or if you got the entire collection really cheap like I did, just don't bother with this one and start with Far Cry 2. This game is just too hard.\n\n5/10\nMeh","December 30, 2014","false","5.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

But it means that Crytek was able to churn out enough polygons and sfx to make it actually passable in the critical eyes of today's players.\nThat is high praise, technically speaking, since 90s and early 2000s FPS usually look like something that came out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Far Cry's Trigen Baboons.\nSo maybe its historical legacy will be that - the first modern 3d game that has aged visually well.\nIt's also very easy on modern gfx cards. It seems my GTX 460 breaks more sweat when rendering pixeled hipster games.\n\nSo how is Far Cry in terms of play?\nIt's really basic:\nA beautiful caribbean island, a shlocky story.\nYou're shooting bad guys with guns, take their guns and run around, quite a lot actually.\nThe most shocking features are a *omygawd* stamina bar, being able to *gasp* drop down and shoot from a prone position and *sweetjeezustheresmoar* shooting through many types of walls.\nThis is all implemented solidly.\n\nMore of FC's strengths: AI behaviour is great. Sound fx are fine.\n\nSome features were run-of-the-mill at the time, but may be received controversially today:\nNo automatic bumwiping er... health regeneration I mean. Have fun backtracking!\nNo excessive exposition.\nNo military propaganda.\nAnd...caveat millenials ... NO QUICKSAVING. The game autosaves for you, rather fairly, I'd have to say.\nThis might be a dealbreaker for many, but it actually works.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of basic FPS, you can play Far Cry without blushing.\nIt's alright. No shame in liking meat and potatoes, chart music or missionary,\n\nAll others, pass. There's just too little substance.\n\n\nVERDICT\nDr. Krieger's ethics commision approves 2,5 out of 5 specimen.\nDecent, basic, passable - for FPS fans.","November 24, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But as the game progresses, the enemies get dumber, the hallways get longer, and the game starts to wear on you.  The shooting never really evolves past hopping around the mutated enemies, or spraying hot lead in the general direction of humanoid ones.\n\nThe story itself seems disinterested with you and your actions, with the closing third of the game feeling slightly tacked on just to pad length.  It's never really quite sure if it wants to be a parody of Rambo-style B movies from the 70s, or a completely serious and dull tale of the multitalented cardboard box that serves as the protagonists's personality.  Also in this final third, the difficulty reaches a cliff the likes of which had me reaching for Dwarf Fortress for relief.  The first of two final bosses proves to be a painful experience even on Normal difficulty, but far too easy on the easiest one.  There is a section nearly directly preceding it that has you running through the jungle from the mutants, where it's basically luck if you get hit or not by them, allowing you to progress.\n\nI may have gotten this game for very cheap, and even with no expectations, I came out feeling disappointed.","June 29, 2014","false","14.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

There's no variation in the combat whatsoever and after an hour or so it becomes the most boring thing ever. Plus it's very inconsistent, you can one-hit a guard with the suppressed MP5K then a minute later you can mow down the same type of guard with the M4 and kill him after half the mag is in his chest.\n\n- The NPCs are the worst. Seriously, being able to shoot through the walls at you in multiple situations after one of them has seen you is the worst. It makes so many parts of the game almost impossible. Their repetitive, bland voices make you want to cry. After about 30 minutes of hearing "I'm gonna shoot your face off!" and "I'm gonna lay down the smackdown!" I already wanted to gag myself with a spoon.\n\n- Speaking of voice acting, every person in this game with a speaking part makes me cringe. Especially the main character, his Nukem-esque voice and cliche one-liners become super annoying after the first moments of hearing him.\n\n- Some parts of this game are so hard they may even seem impossible (even on normal difficulty). The NPCs have some undying blood-lust rage even on the easiest setting. You should be able to have fun and rush whomever on the easiest difficulty but you can't do that and it's overkill in my opinion. Some parts like the mini-boss against Crowe on the sinking ship, where you have NO supplies around you and the game doesn't allow you to shoot while submirged in water so it's super difficult to get a shot off especially while Crowe is mowing you down with his LMG.\n\n- Some things, like the ability to look at a situation and decide where to go and what kind of way to take it (Like run-and-gun vs. a stealth approach.) made me happy early on, but later on it turned into "Okay, either turn right and get shot at or turn left and get shot at. Your choice bro.".\n\n- The story is strictly linear and boring. It's pretty predictable and the complete change in the enemies in the middle of the game was terrible. Especially since the "Trigens" are one-hit kill enemies (with no armour). It seems like a cool story at first and it looks like it'll end up being a pretty nice, open game but it's just so straight forward and linear. It's honestly super disapointing.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this game. Maybe right now since it's just 6 bucks or in the bundle but only then. It's not worth the time you put into it.","November 28, 2014","false","12.6"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","2"

No valuable long term stealthy gameplay either, due to the aforementioned factors, as well as the enemy being able to hear your movement on a certain radius (this is waht makes the machete totally worthless, seeing that the hearing radius is grater than your mellee range) and no silenced weapons being available (not even the sniper rifle, which will triger NPC alertness no matter out of what range you are shooting. You as a player are OFC unable to hear the enemy snipers shots).\nNo replay value what so ever seeing that there is no RPG immersion, no decisions to make, no nothing. The same story over and over again.\nThis game is a bit like COD, only that you have insane NPC's instead of noob kids ruining the game. Hell, some NPC's are even campers!\nOn the other hand to get through some places you will have to start thinking, meaning that the progression isn't obvious or given to you by the game, even the descriptionless objectives and close to useless minimap add to this.\nFinally, to be fair, I have to admit that I didn't try multiplayer, which, if good, could at some points to the game (in case you still find anyone playing vanilla Far Cry, that is).","September 8, 2014","false","6.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025031910/recommended/13520/","76561198025031910","pederfee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025031910/","111 products in account","The short version: bland selection of weapons, laughable stealth mechanics, and inflated, artless difficulty in a pathetic bid for cred as a tactical shooter. A worthless non-plot even by video game standards, to the point where the usual juvenile BS barely even registers as campy or offensive. No, Steam, I don't recommend this game.\n\nThe long version:\n\nThe weapons are boring. You have your choice of (thus far at least, I'm not finishing this thing): assault rifle, two SMGs (one useless), rocket launcher, sniper rifle (rare), shotgun, pistol (useless), and machete (useless). Obviously not every game needs a sweeping array of whimsical fantasy weaponry, but a big part of shooters for me is bonding with my favorite guns and none of these dull gray slabs cut it.\n\nThe story is not worth a turd. The player character has bad cringey voice acting, no real qualities but a sort of flat, lazy sarcasm, and no will of his own, only taking orders from a voice on his phone. A female partner is teased early on but shows up in a cutscene tackily emulating Ursula Andress in Dr. No only to disappear again for hours.\n\nThe graphics are nice for their time. Vegetation--bushes, grass, vines, leaves--was (and often still is) one of polygonal graphics' big weaknesses; setting a shooter on a tropical island must have seemed like an impossible dream to many. And yet the jungle gets monotonous fast. You can (literally) go off the beaten path and explore around and sometimes find alternate paths through a level, but doing so never feels worth it because you can't actually sneak past enemies (more about that later). Indoor levels don't even have graphics or exploration going for them. Cement fortresses filled with catwalks and computer equipment. Sewers and tunnels with no sign of vermin and that don't seem particularly dirty or smelly. Blah.\n\nMovement is awkward. You can't go very fast, even when sprinting, which depletes a stamina bar and broadcasts your location to every enemy within a city-block radius. You'll be spending most of the game semi-stealthed in a crouch position by holding CTRL but even then enemies can easily spot you. Interacting with the environment sucks too, you have to be flat up against and aiming perpendicular to and directly at whatever it is you want to pick up or use. So doing anything actually badass, like using a keycard to jump through a door in the middle of a firefight, or killing a dude, grabbing his gun, and killing the next dude with it, is next to impossible. Oh, and the ladders! I forgot about the ladders. The suckitude of ladders in this game doesn't even deserve explanation. ♥♥♥♥ you, ladders!\n\nFar Cry is also, as others have noted, too goddam hard. Enemies a mile away can detect you and kill you to death in under a second. There's also godawful pop-in that prevents you from seeing distant enemies. Frequently you'll die suddenly from someone you can't even see or hear. Once, I discovered this was because the enemy was headshotting me FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF AN OPAQUE TENT. The stealth mechanics, with the exception of the night vision, are next to useless, and it even features that ultimate early-2000s PC FPS frivolity, the "lean" movement bound to Q and E. The best you can hope for with stealth is to position yourself for a firefight and maybe take out the first one or two guys (often of ten or more, mind you) in an area. You have radar and can use the binoculars to mark enemies on it, but doing so is a false sense of security because it usually won't see everyone, and those one or two guys it didn't catch will get the drop on you. And even successfully being stealthy isn't the best choice, because guys you sneak past will come running to find you next time they hear gunshots. You can't hear enemies coming because they make no footstep noises; if you're lucky you'll hear some stupid taunt like "I'm-a gonna gun yer face to helllllll!" or whatever but those voice clips always sound closer than they really are. This is all on the default "Medium" difficulty, by the way.","August 31, 2014","false","13.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

It was a complete waste of money, and I rarely say that about any game. The only reason I am still playing it at this point is because I have a thing about finishing all of my games. It looks good enough for a 2004 title, the voice acting is bad but forgiveable (nothing can be worse than Resident Evil), and the maps are large and sem-open, but that's where it ends. The stairs and ladders are bugged, the AI Balance function isn't actually a functional function, the enemies are OP and can one-shot you from clear across the map, the stealth mechanics don't work, you can't exit the game without it crashing on you, and probably the worst thing: there is NO manual save. Well, there is, but it's way too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to do. It involves altering some game files in developer mode. So yeah. The game auto-saves at the worst possible locations, so I found myself having to cover the same expanses of map and doing the same things over and over and over and over again until I got lucky enough to make it to the next checkpoint. Like I said, if it weren't for this thing I have about finishing my games, I'd give up on this piece of junk.","December 7, 2014","false","14.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Another mad scientist with his attempt at making super humans, but it goes wrong and then they go rogue. Great...I really need another game where this happens. OH I'm trying to escape the island!?! Why don't I just use one of the last 17 boats I got into to escape?!? NO I have to use them to go from small island to other small island. NEVER back to the mainland. I mean I got here on a sailboat I think  could make it back with a tank of gas so don't give me that excuse. And then there is Valarie...screw Valarie. I don't care! I have no idea who she is! There was no character development. I mean I love a game where you get chucked into it and you have to figure everything out, but when I'm told to go save someone whom I have no relation to? That's just bad design. It ceases to become a game and it becomes work. Maybe they should give me an incentive to go after her? Make me want to save her not just tell me to in order to justify their game and provide an excuse for, frankly, sub-par level design.\n\nPlayability:\nThis is where the game took a turn for the worse, I mean really worse. The AI was one of the most disgusting things in the world. Think Sonic '06 level of broken. I mean almost completely broken. The so called “stealth” would never work. You could be 100 yards away, prone in a bush, and you would hear “There he is!” and start getting shot at. They constantly “see” you before you even enter the room, and once I was spotted while prone INSIDE A VENTALATION SHAFT! All this combined with constantly being shot through walls or the guy INSIDE the garage but lit you up from a car's turret regardless makes the game most aggravating. Another moment was when you were told that the entrance to the boat was a hole in the side. Well guess what? They didn't mean the big obvious hole in the side. It was a small entrance near the bow of the ship. It took me about 10 minutes of jumping against a wall before I thought “Maybe the hole isn't this hole? Maybe there is another? Maybe Ubisoft pulled a fast one on me?” Even with all of these pitfalls, by no means is it a difficult game. Just repetitive and annoying. So many things were included in the game to make it longer. It felt like an ordeal, so when you beat it you wouldn't want to have to go through it again providing the illusion of difficulty. They used level design to act as a difficulty supplement, not make it actually hard. Honestly, when I see a game company do this they lose a lot of respect.\n\nLevel Design:\n“Open world” another great joke from Ubisoft. They obviously think open-world means “go here, then here, then here, then big battle, then go here.” They were extremely linear and after awhile just left a weird taste in you mouth like you get after drinking milk and then not drinking anything else for an hour. It became “Great...another building” and there was a lot of “Here I am shooting a near-identical person in a near-identical situation as the last few hundred.” It just wears you out. The addition of checkpoints just proves my point. You cant have checkpoints in a non-linear game. They just made the game even more linear. The only way you can save is if you go along the per-defined path layed out for you. Additionally, there are no side quests. I'm not saying that side quests are a mandatory feature of every game, but in an open world game, they certainly are.\n\nGraphics:\nRather good, but honestly Counter-strike source and Metal Gear Solid 3 had better graphics and they were released in the same year. One redeeming feature was the draw distance in Cry-engine is vast which required little loading time.\n\nOverall:\n“A glorified tech demo, don't bother unless you're curious about how advanced graphics could get back in 2004.” -Crisis from Steam\nIt made me laugh, and I agreed so I figured I'd re-post it.","December 16, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/13520/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","There are two types of challenging games. The first type is the one where you get killed a lot because you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and you know you ♥♥♥♥ed up. Super Meat Boy. Dark Souls. Then there's the type of game where you get killed a lot because the design is cheap and unfair. That's Far Cry.\n\nFar Cry is an absolute chore to play through. You will need to persist through piles of inexplicably bad design and an ungodly amount of unfair deaths to trial-and-error your way to the best tactic. Get Lucky or Die Quickly. It's finishable, but why would you want to? It's just not fun.\n\nSO HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.\n\nThe game uses a checkpoint system, so quicksaving through a map when things are going well is not an option. You usually have the choice of fighting or using stealth. If you use stealth, be prepared to move VERY SLOWLY while crouched or prone, which saps the joy out of staying hidden. It can take a long time to traverse the map like this, and since enemies have such keen perception, you'll probably get spotted most times anyway. Not keen in the fair sense though. Keen because they can hear your footsteps from hundreds of feet away behind a building, or one of them can see you through the dense foliage you're hiding in because your shirt is so ♥♥♥♥ING RED, and they can all shoot through solid objects with unerring accuracy because they all have x-ray vision. Getting spotted after a 5-10 minute stealth creep and reloading a checkpoint isn't fun.\n\nSo the alternative? Run and gun. This is a mixed proposition. It can feel good when it works, and the combat is nice and responsive, but you will get flanked and taken down constantly. Far Cry employs a health pack system with very few health packs, so again, 10-minute checkpoints need to be played over and over again because it just takes that one ♥♥♥♥ing guy out of the 25 you fought to get around your flank and it's die, redo. It reminded me a lot of Call of Duty 2 on Veteran mode (anybody?), but I was playing on normal.\n\nHere's how the ROCKET LAUNCHERS work. Mercs and mutants with rocket launchers fire them in such quick succession that if any one of them gets the bead on you, you are literally too slow to outrun them. If you DO stay ahead of the rocket stream, the smoke keeps you perpetually blind while the screen shakes, thus making it IMPOSSIBLE for you to fight back. Rocket launcher guys are usually a half-mile away as well, so die, reload. It's like playing Doom 2, except that you can only take one hit before death and the bad guys can shoot through walls and also, you have crazy glue on the bottom of your shoes. Not fun!\n\nDie, reload. You will die a lot. Maybe you'll get a checkpoint, but it will be in the middle of combat. Remember that rocket stream I just told you about? I got a checkpoint once while there were two rockets in the air sailing towards me. Die, reload, die, reload, die, reload, can't escape, restart entire mission. Thanks Far Cry!\n\nThe combat is functional in the corridor sections, but in wide-open spaces, it's just a matter of exploiting the AI in cheap ways and engaging from long distances to avoid any real conflict. The best strategy: go for headshots while the AI is non-reactive to your presence and they're just standing there like target dummies. Or wait for them to get caught in a ridiculous movement loop and time your shot. Not fun!\n\nYour health, even on easy mode, is laughably minimal, and the hardcore difficulty of the game is mostly caused by the AI's impossibly keen sense, unerring accuracy, and your ability to absorb about 2 1/2 bullets before dying. Not fun!\n\nI got halfway through the game and realized I had no idea what was going on or why this dude was on this island or why the voice actors talk like they're not taking their jobs or this game seriously at all.\n\nI wouldn't either, the script and story are a pile of feces.\n\nAt one point a mercenary shouts, "YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU WERE DEAD!" -- while he's unloading his machine gun at me. Try to make sense of that.\n\nSpoiler alert: there are mutants, and they look like rejected Quake 2 designs.\n\nThis entire game has no idea what its identity or focus is.\n\nYou can't even blame 2004 for this. Half-Life 2 came out a few months later and was perfect in every way, while Doom 3 even succeeds in topping this game with its focused combat and sharp atmosphere. And Doom 3 sucked.\n\nI would rather contract malaria than play this game again. I guess I'll play the sequel.\n\n\n3.5/10","February 14, 2014","false","8.6"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","11","29","0","4"

This might be the worst game I have ever played.  The graphics and draw distance are nice considering the times (tho I found the texture pop-up annoying), the gunplay is acceptable, but these were clearly the only things that any thought was put into; the obnoxious, flaky AI consists mostly of wall-hacking aimbots (in fact, a user had to create an unofficial patch to fix bots being able to see and shoot through certain surfaces, which made the game unplayable for me.  To be clear, that's a USER doing the DEVELOPER's job for FREE), and combined with an archaic checkpoint system with no manual or quick-save, you can anticipate spending hours of your life replaying the same 10mins between checkpoints overandoverandoverandover sluggishly advancing through the occasionally engaging maps.  The game seems to encourage or give the option of stealth at times, but with AI like this, I gave that up by the third level.  Some games are frusturating but highly rewarding, but I never even felt any sense of reward overcoming each obnoxious "challenge", only dreading the fact the game wasn't over yet and there was still plenty of hell ahead.  I wasn't even a little pleased until it was over, but not at all pleased with all that wasted time I will never get back.  If you're going to make a game this bad, at least have generous save systems so we don't have to put up with it for so long.  I can't think of anything with worse voicovers and dialouge that takes itself seriously (one character was clearly voiced by a close relative of Microsoft Sam).  If this is good writing, than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and The Rock more than deserve Oscars for their latest masterpieces.  There is absolutely no charm, not even in the context of the B-movie sense, which I can appreciate.  Even the soundtrack is awful and uninspired.  This comes off to me as one of these elitist "tech demo" (if I may quote the great Steamcast host spitfire ♥) games that exist soley for people to invest lots of money into their computer so they can gawk at the graphics and brag about how they can afford the hardware to run it at highest video settings.  The PC library wouldn't be complete without them; there's at least one or two every year, and each one pushes back mainstream acceptance of PC gamers a little further.  But it's almost 2014.  Graphics have moved forward from where they were a decade ago.  So the only reason this was worth playing to begin with is beyond obsolete.  All this is not to suggest good graphics are ALWAYS a bad thing, but they must supplement the experience, not BE the experience.  I was appalled at the few threads I came accross debating whether this or Half-Life 2 is better.  If you are interested in this game or even if you've already played it and like it, I can't recommend enough playing Far Cry: Instincts (unfortunately only on Xbox and Xbox 360) instead.  Despite essentially being a corridor shooter, it almost mirrors the PC version; the voice-overs - featuring Stephen Dorff as a Jack Carver that actually resembles a human - are stellar, the dialouge and story are at the very least decent if not good, the maps are much more atmospheric and in the case of the sequel Far Cry: Instincts - Evolution, I would say absolutely breathtaking at times, Paul Haslinger's soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard, and the execution overall is much better.  So play that, and not this; this will drain many hours from your life and offer nothing interesting in return.\n\nP.S. Thankyou Valve for allowing us to not recommend games.

It has good graphics for a game made in 2004, interesting combat mechanics and vehicles. It runs well on my machine too without any lag, even at 1600x900 resolution which usually lags for most games.\n\nHowever, the difficulty is insanely ridiculous, even though I am playing it at Easy difficulty after reading how people say how difficult the game is, and they aren't wrong. Enemies deal a megaton of damage, and I often have to retry the same portion more than 20 times, which is absolutely frustrating. Many reasons for this is getting surrounded by far too many enemies, getting one-shotted by rockets, or getting killed almost instantly by a machine gun once I pop my head out. The shotgun is useless junk, because it is a close-range weapon which cannot 1-shot the mutants at medium range, and I can't get to close range because they deal massive damage if I do (about 50% of my HP in one hit). The person talking to the protagonist is also speaking too softly, and a lack of subtitles doesn't help. The game is also buggy. I keep getting shot through the walls, and getting hit by rockets when I see absolutely no enemies around me. The "stealth" part of the game is to hide in tall grasses and bushes, but it is absolutely inconsistent. Sometimes even though I am hiding in them, I get spotted immediately. I also cannot fire an RPG onto a helicopter above me because the AOE is way too huge, and somehow it sends me flying 20 metres into the air upwards and fall down to death.\n\nI do agree that this is a decent game but if a game frustrates me most of the time, then it is not fun, and I cannot recommend it. I have played games like Batman: Arkham City and Arkham Origins, where sometimes I have to try 20 times or more to get it right too, but at least I knew what I was doing wrong and I had a chance. In Far Cry, as I stated earlier, I get one-shotted mostly, and getting one-shotted is stupid. Not to mention the tons of bugs.\n\nRating: 4/10","February 28, 2014","false","10.2"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

The end cutscene was super quick and unsatisfying upon completing this thing. Far Cry 2 and 3 are much better. This title has nothing to do with the others storyline wise by the way. You can completely skip this one and save yourself the frustration.

Been gaming since the Commodore 64.  I just picked this up in the Far Cry pack.  Having never played these games before just now, I feel my impression of the game is not clouded by nostalgia.  I'm unimpressed.  The opening cinematic tries to be epic and action-packed but ends up making no sense at all.  I gather some chick blew up my boat, I fell into the water - into a volcano, but not...then I get to land but there are monsters?  Then there are guys shooting at me for no reason and I end up back in the water?  I'm completely confused as to what the premise of this game is.\n\nGameplay - Yes the graphics are a little dated but that doesn't bother me.  The problem I have is the gameplay.  The dude swims like he has a blood alcohol content of .99.  I get it, it's water.  But I shouldn't go from pointing straight ahead to looking straight down/up.  The other beef I have is with the pistol.  I get that it's supposed to be relatively innaccurate.  But if I'm 5 feet away from some guy, I point at his head, fire, see the bullet trail go towards his head, yet I completely miss, that's a problem.\n\nLuckily I have some other games in the franchise to try out.  If I had purchased this on its own I'd be very disappointed.","June 25, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

Another problem I found, was that my enimes could see me through walls.

It's not that it is bad, but it's outdated for my tastes, especially after having played Far Cry 3. If you're playing for the story, don't. The protagonist's voice acting and lines are meant to be cliche and "funny," but they aren't - they come off as bad jokes. The story is poor and the cutscenes are laughable; I'm serious, just watch one and you will see what I mean. In terms of gameplay, it's alright. I don't understand why some people claim the A.I is "intelligent." I played on Hard and all I had to do was wait for them to pop out the corner and shoot them, or stay constantly alert at all times to watch out for those who stupidly stay in the same spot the entire time to insta-kill you. There is no aiming down the sights - if that's a "thing" that you need to get immersed, don't expect it. Other than that, it's an okay game.

Thinking tactically is the name of the game when sight lines, cover, and topography must be taken into account to have any chance at success.\n\nSo what’s the problem?  It’s that this is just a fraction of the experience, and the endless string of monsters in the middle of the campaign is neither challenging to fight, nor terrifying to behold.  Combine this with characters that nobody cares about, and a shallow story that had the potential to rival BioShock's if it had been done correctly, and you wind up with a product that cannot compare to more recent shooters.\n\nFor a full review, check out:\nhttp://amanandhismouse.com/far-cry.html","November 2, 2014","false","12.9"," 5 of 32 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","5","32","0","0"

Normally, I'd forgive an older game of a few bad bits, but this one in particular committed one of the greatest sins in the entertainmet industry: it put me off the rest of the series.\n\nI got this game as a 2-pack with FC2, and after 2 hours, I couldn't take the poor gameplay, nonexistent story, and inconsistent AI any longer. I put it down and never looked back. Well, I did try again a year later on an easier difficulty, and with cheat codes, but Far Cry fails to entertain. It tries to pawn off some stealth mechanics, but the AI across the whole map instantly knows exactly where you are if you so much as throw a distraction rock. This forces you to engage in combat, but far cry's gunplay is terrible and unstisfying, plagued with weapons that can't be aimed (yay random chance deciding if you can hit anyone!) and fire frozen peas intead of bullets.\n\nThis left FC2 just sitting in my library, gathering dust. I wanted nothing to do with a sequel to the awful mess that is Far Cry. Eventually, I launched FC2 out of boredom, and was floored. Far Cry 2 is one of the best FPS adventures I have ever played.

It was not at all what I expected, but in a good way. I expected a mindless shooter with maybe a few stealth scenes, instead there is a very intruiging story here, reminded me a bit of Half-Life. The mix of action vs stealth and strategy is just right, keeps you involved and entertained all the way. I literally couldn't put it down, had to see how the story unfolds. The graphics are a bit dated, but there are some mods out there that do wonders to this game. Oh and there are no silly achievements, treasures or secrets to be sidetracked by, so you can just focus on the story and the action - exactly the way it should be. There is multiplayer and surprisingly I still found quite a number of people online, but multiplayer isn't really my thing so just fooled around a bit and then left.","January 14, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good Controls...impossible scenarios. Kind of like the action movies we all loved from the 80s, in video game form. But impossibly long...everytime I thought it was going to be over or near the end it just keeps going. In some ways i'd like to consider that high value, but I guess for me I prefer my FPS games a bit shorter.\n\nOne other complaint that I am sure is included in most other reviews, is there is a terrible glitch that causes the enemy to easily target and shoot you through walls in some areas, as if the wall isn't even there. This can get very annoying at times. But thankfully it only occurs in certain places, and you can adapt your strategy to work around this problem.\n\nI suspect when it came out this game introduced a lot of new concepts to the FPS genre, and even by todays standards it isn't a terrible game. However I don't know that playing it is really necessary unless you're hardcore and want to play every FPS or every Far Cry game in the series.\n\nFinal Verdict: Not amazing by today's standards (obviously as it has been around for at least a decade). I wouldn't recommend for the casual FPS player like myself. However for those looking for older style FPS game play with higher difficulty which requires a bit of strategy and guerrilla tactics, and a lack of gimmicks that make the game easier (like slow-mo in F.E.A.R.) this game is still pretty solid.\n\n2004 Rating: 9/10 (1 point off for the cheesy scenes with Val)\n2014 Rating: 7/10","December 27, 2014","true","50.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the graphics are dated (it's 11 years old at this point) and other mechanics of the game were lacking or missing that can be found in modern shooters, I seriously loved this game. I have a weakness for old-school-style shooters and even though this was a 2004 title, it felt older in a way, in a good way. It's hard to explain but little things like the 90's-sounding music (I think the 90's never really went away until 2006 or so), the Duke Nukem-esque punchlines, the horrible voice acting, and the crude view models just made the game feel right. All of these things might be bad to people but I think it was a fun experience. The weapon variety was low but the enemies had a lot more variety as the game went on. I was surprised at how advanced and smooth the physics were for a game as old as this. Corpses were never stationary. You could always shoot them and see them slide, run through a banner and watch it swing realistically, and push things around at will. Very cool feature in a game that redefined the genre for it's time. The game is damn hard sometimes too. I played on the 3rd hardest difficulty and still found myself ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the game ready to quit. It's a serious challenge at times. Low on ammo, no armor left, low health, and still plenty of grenade-tossing enemies out there makes for a really interesting time. It's rewarding though to play through a checkpoint 30 times and FINALLY make it to the next one in one piece. There is no spoon-feeding on this game when it comes to difficulty. Enemy AI is relentlessly fast, attentive, and accurate. It works though because if this game had dumb or slow AI, the game would be too easy and not have that me-against-a-small-army-feel. You always feel outnumbered but not usually outgunned (Except for Krieger and Crow). You could be across the beach half a kilometer away laying down in bushes and a guy will notice you and raise the alarm. Damn. Better go back and try again from the checkpoint. Which leads me to my next point. The checkpoints on this game are HORRID. If there was one thing that made me think "What in the hell were the develoeprs thinking?" it was the checkpoints. AWFUL. They were so far between that dying once could mean redoing over an hour's worth of tedious sneaking and fragging. The worst was the final boss (Krieger) in which you could kill him, run around to the next elevator, pause (thinking that by now the game HAS TO have saved and put you at a new checkpoint), click back to the last checkpoint, and the game STILL didn't save your boss progress or create a new checkpoint: It would then spawn me back to the beginning of the boss fight (that I BARELY made it through on accident after 57 attempts. I guess 58 attempts never hurt?). Other than the checkpoints this game really kicked ♥♥♥. It had a good barebones feel, hilarious jokes, witty cutscenes, no nonsense but challenging gameplay, a cliche storyline (that at the time I think was probably inventive or still interesting), and a likeable protagonist. I really couldn't ask for much more. 9/10 for Far Cry.","January 19, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, checkpoint only saving which can result in replaying certain parts over, and over, and over...\n\nOnly play if you have an indomitable spirit and a fair amount of patience.

The checkpoints are sparsely laid, and getting past every enemy camp is a twenty-minute ordeal of tagging all the enemies with the binoculars, taking out the snipers, waiting for someone to wander off alone, shooting them, moving to a new hiding spot, waiting for the heat to die down, and repeating. This is all because attempting anything other than the methodical stealthy approach will get you swiftly killed, because the player character's bullet resistance is vaguely realistic, and the enemies can see you from literally a mile away.\n\nEssentially, this is the poor man's version of Crysis, in which you have to take on a vast army in the jungle alone and without a superpowered nanosuit because you don't own a NASA supercomputer.","July 16, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This feels too much like Halo: Combat Evolved - zombie-like creatures are released towards the end of the game and spread havoc among the ranks of your enemy, and you fight them with the enemy.

FarCry (the original, the classic, the brutal premier) is a somewhat dated but extremely satisfying experience. Unlike most titles, this game uses a combat engine similar to Counter Strike, in which every bullet won't be accurate if you're running or moving. In addition to ability to lean around corners, you also have a stamina bar and health doesn't regenerate. This classic example of fps  creativity was new, but is now nonexistent in MOST first-person games today. If you're looking for another positive aspect to this shooter (other than it's lush and vibrant graphics that still hold up on a polished engine) then look no further, for there is a level editor buried in the Bin folder, and it is exactly the same as the other FarCry editors. Is this game worth your time and cash? Definitely, pick it up, play it, and try to imagine this year is 2004.","June 29, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall a pretty good game, you can see how this game heavily influenced games today.  This game however pulls heavily from things people liked about Battlefield 1942 and Counter Strike in terms of gameplay, reload time, and hit detection.  A very good FPS single player game with monsters and soldiers.... that being said:  I found myself getting bored due to random difficulty between levels.  FLY through 2 levels and get stuck fighting a helecopter for a 30 mins.  The highlights - Good gun play, shooting, and the vehicles are fun.  The bad is very poor/Cheating AI and appears to be sandbox gameplay but its not.  I recomend as a discount fps but there is better out now. - oh yea...

A new graphical innovation here, a good sense of humor there, but something just doesn't gel. With Far Cry, however, you can see so many places where things could have gone wrong, but didn't. The AI could easily have been blindly aggressive or stone deaf. The load times could have been constant and distracting. In almost all major areas, Far Cry manages to walk the tightrope of game design over a chasm of Things Gone Wrong. I've always wondered why no one apparently tried to license the AI of the Marines in Half-Life, because after that, I was always a little bit disappointed with the FPSs that came after.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/13520/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Starting with the technical, Far Cry is a first-person shooter.  It was released in early 2004, to many positive reviews gaining a meta score of 89.  It uses the CryENGINE, now known as CryENGINE1, and was the first game released by CryTek, the same company that would go on to create Crysis.  It’s their party, they’ll ‘cry’ if that want too.\n\nAt the time of writing this I haven’t completed the game, but felt as though I’d played enough to get this posted.  But believe me, that fact has nothing to do with Far Cry falling short.  With my Radeon HD 4650 and 4 GB RAM I was able to push all the graphic settings to their max, for a very beautiful game.  But lets face it, its hard to find an ugly game that came out after aught-four.\n\nAs a non-linear sandbox game you have free range over an entire island, an island over run by bizarre mutants and mercenaries that are trying to kill you, but free range none-the-less.  As the game starts you quickly learn that this is not just a good AI, but a smart one, that works together.  I’ve seen this AI do things that blew my mind, but in the good way.  I’ve been flanked on both sides at the same time, I had heavy fire from the right distract me from a Merc sneaking up on my left.  If these are just totally random moments or in the AI code I haven’t a clue, but it always kept me on my feet.\n\nNow I can’t comment too much on the story, I know a few things, but a lot of it I’ve missed.  And that brings us to the first problem.  You see periodically you have these little chats with a fellow named Doyle, but the audio is always low, really low.  The only times I’ve heard them is A) when I got the headphones on, or B) when I know they are coming and I crank up the speakers.  If I played the game with the speakers blasting I would never miss a convo, but the volume level required is almost absurd, and if combat is going on you can’t even hear it over the gunfire and shouts.  Messing around with the audio options doesn’t solve this, at least not to any degree I’ve found. Now the really important story line stuff happens in cut scenes, so you always have the big pieces to the puzzle, plus there is a chance that this is an issue with the Steam version.  So I’m not knocking it too hard for it.\n\nGameplay mechanics are everything that you expect in a shooter.  Because really not a lot has changed since ’04. Some weapons have alt fire, some have different fire modes, some have scopes.  There are a good variety to choose from, but not so many that your flooded with choices.  However you can only hold four weapons at a time, so some picking and choosing is necessary. One slight annoyance I’ve found is with ladders, sometimes when you reach the top the game doesn’t want you to get off, especially if there is a lip between the ladder and the landing. Oh, and sometimes the ragdolls land wrong, but this is something I’ve seen in even the most current games.\n\nThat covers all the major stuff without taking too much away from anyone who hasn’t played Far Cry.  If you’re on the fence about, go find a copy or grab it on steam, it’s well worth the $9.99. I’ve owned the game for just over two weeks and have already logged 16 hours into it, given my schedule, that says a lot.  It’s got your vehicles to drive, helicopters to shoot down, stealthy places for stealth, and run-out-guns-blazing action.  And best of all, you get to pick how you do what, where, and when.  You make it your own game.\n\nSo a little more about the story, more so the ending.  Or the fact that you think it’s about to end, three times.  And by the time you get to the actual ending you’re somewhat surprised that it really ended. How this ranks on your personal scale will vary for everyone.  But for me this just kept the game amazing.  I think there were four times where I thought I had finished the game.\n\nThey even pull what I call the Half-Life-Moment (named after Half-Life the first game I saw do it), where you are stripped of everything and must continue on with no weapons or equipment. Always makes for a great moment and a real test of your skills.  Even if, like in this case, it’s a test of how fast can you run.\n\nA gun with only ten bullets in it, a Trigen charging me, and me needing to get to the other side of the island.  This part was the first time that I had to resort to checking a guide on how to get past it. I’d say I spent far too much time trying to figure it, mostly due to over-thinking the problem.  Really it’s a case of the simplest answer with the most convenient definition.\n\nAnd that’s another thing to really love about this, they change it up on you fairly often. The play style can switch pretty quickly, and if your not ready for it, you’ll spend hours trying to figure out how to get past a spot.  Only to eventually realize that you were going at it the wrong way. The need to stop think and assess is very common.\n\nStepping aside from the game for a moment, and into the compatibly realm.  Since this is a Steam game, compatibly it pretty much a guarantee, but there are a couple snags.  Other than the previously mentioned floating ragdolls, FarCry has a habit of crashing on exit.  Really it’s less of a crash and more of a freezing.  A simple Ctrl+Alt+Del and into the Task Manager to end the process will take care of the problem without any game data loss.  So a small nuisance.\n\nAnother bug is if you kill an enemy at the exact right time the audio clip of his machine gun will get stuck.  You’ll hear the gun fire, you’ll see the corpse, you can walk up and take the weapon, but the fire never stops.  You can tell the exact spot where they died, based on where the sound is the loudest, and so eventually you wont hear it any more as you leave the area.  This was never a serious issue, the sound wasn’t enough of a distraction to cause problems.  But was always pretty humorous.\n\nNot quite a bug, but a flaw in the modeling itself was this. It just annoyed me that they thought that that looked good, and didn’t take the time to flip the model around for a better look.\n\nI still missed most of the story early on in the game, but caught enough towards the end to get it figured out.  I did predict a classic “Hollywood Twist” and ended up being right about it. But was really disappointed with the ending, or lack there was.  Massive battle outside, having to load the save over twenty times, finally get inside the building, fire one bullet, cutscene, cutscene, end.  It really didn’t feel like an ending, and considering how many times it did feel like an ending prior to that.  I was a bit disappointed.\n\nBut now after spending 28 hours of my life inside the world of Far Cry, having beaten the game I can truly say, it’s well worth the money.  I got a hell of a bargain, but even for $9.99 it’s a steal.","May 16, 2013","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, it still holds up pretty well. The dialogue and voice acting are cartoonishly bad, but the ability to engage enemies on your own terms was and still is VERY refreshing. You can run in guns blazing, snipe targets from a distance, create distractions to draw people away, or even sneak past most places. There are a lot of guns, and the inventory restrictions ensure you don't get too complacent with any one weapon.\n\nThe visuals obviously haven't aged well, but they still have an old charm to them. Add to that a dynamic soundtrack composed by Inon Zur and some strategc level design and Far Cry is an aesthetically pleasing package. The plot kind of drags on, especially in the later chapters, but the philosophy of open combat areas and multiple ways to approach them hardly ever slows down. Not to mention, vehicles are a blast to drive.\n\nSo, who is Far Cry for? I guess in a nutshell, it's for anybody looking for a unique and still largely-untouched style of FPS and doesn't need super-clear objectives or an engrossing/serious story. It's for anybody who is seriously interested in the history of the FPS genre. I'd put it up there with the likes of DOOM, Half-Life, and BioShock. Despite being 10 years old, it's aged gracefully and it never tries to take itself too seriously. Absolutely a must-buy.","March 27, 2011","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are a bit dated, but there are some mods out there that do wonders to this game. Oh and there are no silly achievements, treasures or secrets to be sidetracked by, so you can just focus on the story and the action - exactly the way it should be.

Although the graphics are dated (it's 11 years old at this point) and other mechanics of the game were lacking or missing that can be found in modern shooters, I seriously loved this game. I have a weakness for old-school-style shooters and even though this was a 2004 title, it felt older in a way, in a good way. It's hard to explain but little things like the 90's-sounding music (I think the 90's never really went away until 2006 or so), the Duke Nukem-esque punchlines, the horrible voice acting, and the crude view models just made the game feel right. All of these things might be bad to people but I think it was a fun experience. The weapon variety was low but the enemies had a lot more variety as the game went on. I was surprised at how advanced and smooth the physics were for a game as old as this. Corpses were never stationary. You could always shoot them and see them slide, run through a banner and watch it swing realistically, and push things around at will. Very cool feature in a game that redefined the genre for it's time. The game is damn hard sometimes too. I played on the 3rd hardest difficulty and still found myself ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the game ready to quit. It's a serious challenge at times. Low on ammo, no armor left, low health, and still plenty of grenade-tossing enemies out there makes for a really interesting time. It's rewarding though to play through a checkpoint 30 times and FINALLY make it to the next one in one piece. There is no spoon-feeding on this game when it comes to difficulty. Enemy AI is relentlessly fast, attentive, and accurate. It works though because if this game had dumb or slow AI, the game would be too easy and not have that me-against-a-small-army-feel. You always feel outnumbered but not usually outgunned (Except for Krieger and Crow). You could be across the beach half a kilometer away laying down in bushes and a guy will notice you and raise the alarm. Damn. Better go back and try again from the checkpoint. Which leads me to my next point. The checkpoints on this game are HORRID. If there was one thing that made me think "What in the hell were the develoeprs thinking?" it was the checkpoints. AWFUL. They were so far between that dying once could mean redoing over an hour's worth of tedious sneaking and fragging. The worst was the final boss (Krieger) in which you could kill him, run around to the next elevator, pause (thinking that by now the game HAS TO have saved and put you at a new checkpoint), click back to the last checkpoint, and the game STILL didn't save your boss progress or create a new checkpoint: It would then spawn me back to the beginning of the boss fight (that I BARELY made it through on accident after 57 attempts. I guess 58 attempts never hurt?). Other than the checkpoints this game really kicked ♥♥♥. It had a good barebones feel, hilarious jokes, witty cutscenes, no nonsense but challenging gameplay, a cliche storyline (that at the time I think was probably inventive or still interesting), and a likeable protagonist. I really couldn't ask for much more. 9/10 for Far Cry.","January 19, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it on medium difficulty since I hadn't played a FPS in years and some of the levels were a pain in the butt but not impossible.

Overall a pretty good game, you can see how this game heavily influenced games today.  This game however pulls heavily from things people liked about Battlefield 1942 and Counter Strike in terms of gameplay, reload time, and hit detection.  A very good FPS single player game with monsters and soldiers.... that being said:  I found myself getting bored due to random difficulty between levels.  FLY through 2 levels and get stuck fighting a helecopter for a 30 mins.  The highlights - Good gun play, shooting, and the vehicles are fun.  The bad is very poor/Cheating AI and appears to be sandbox gameplay but its not.  I recomend as a discount fps but there is better out now. - oh yea...

This and Call of Duty 1 were those games. When I was about 7-8 years old I didn't understand at first at how insanely difficult this game is and how much skill it takes to beat it at least at medium difficulty. I was just replaying random levels that my dad already completed. Then in 2015 I finally got to play it again after all these years and it felt amazing. This game will ♥♥♥♥ you up. It is extemely difficult when you get to the second half of the game and those annoying ♥♥♥♥ing mutants come out. Nevertheless , the gameplay is what makes this game great. It has great variety of guns , vehicles and it has an open way to complete your objectives. But like I said , everything gets thrown out of the window when the second half of the game comes. Think of it as the dark souls of fps games.

However, it is in these older designs that the real challenge of the game is born. Having a finite amount of health at any moment and a highly perishable flak jacket means that trying to tackle the objective by running straight at it will (7 out of 10 times conservatively) result in you having to reload a save, even on easy. Another little gem is that the AI detection is so acute that cover has little advantage other than it's ability to stop incoming bullets.","April 23, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/13520/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","Far Cry was a real game-changer in the FPS genre. In fact, it still holds up pretty well. The dialogue and voice acting are cartoonishly bad, but the ability to engage enemies on your own terms was and still is VERY refreshing. You can run in guns blazing, snipe targets from a distance, create distractions to draw people away, or even sneak past most places. There are a lot of guns, and the inventory restrictions ensure you don't get too complacent with any one weapon.\n\nThe visuals obviously haven't aged well, but they still have an old charm to them. Add to that a dynamic soundtrack composed by Inon Zur and some strategc level design and Far Cry is an aesthetically pleasing package. The plot kind of drags on, especially in the later chapters, but the philosophy of open combat areas and multiple ways to approach them hardly ever slows down. Not to mention, vehicles are a blast to drive.\n\nSo, who is Far Cry for? I guess in a nutshell, it's for anybody looking for a unique and still largely-untouched style of FPS and doesn't need super-clear objectives or an engrossing/serious story. It's for anybody who is seriously interested in the history of the FPS genre. I'd put it up there with the likes of DOOM, Half-Life, and BioShock. Despite being 10 years old, it's aged gracefully and it never tries to take itself too seriously. Absolutely a must-buy.","March 27, 2011","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall a pretty good game, you can see how this game heavily influenced games today.  This game however pulls heavily from things people liked about Battlefield 1942 and Counter Strike in terms of gameplay, reload time, and hit detection.  A very good FPS single player game with monsters and soldiers.... that being said:  I found myself getting bored due to random difficulty between levels.  FLY through 2 levels and get stuck fighting a helecopter for a 30 mins.  The highlights - Good gun play, shooting, and the vehicles are fun.  The bad is very poor/Cheating AI and appears to be sandbox gameplay but its not.  I recomend as a discount fps but there is better out now. - oh yea...

Although the graphics are dated (it's 11 years old at this point) and other mechanics of the game were lacking or missing that can be found in modern shooters, I seriously loved this game. I have a weakness for old-school-style shooters and even though this was a 2004 title, it felt older in a way, in a good way. It's hard to explain but little things like the 90's-sounding music (I think the 90's never really went away until 2006 or so), the Duke Nukem-esque punchlines, the horrible voice acting, and the crude view models just made the game feel right. All of these things might be bad to people but I think it was a fun experience. The weapon variety was low but the enemies had a lot more variety as the game went on. I was surprised at how advanced and smooth the physics were for a game as old as this. Corpses were never stationary. You could always shoot them and see them slide, run through a banner and watch it swing realistically, and push things around at will. Very cool feature in a game that redefined the genre for it's time. The game is damn hard sometimes too. I played on the 3rd hardest difficulty and still found myself ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the game ready to quit. It's a serious challenge at times. Low on ammo, no armor left, low health, and still plenty of grenade-tossing enemies out there makes for a really interesting time. It's rewarding though to play through a checkpoint 30 times and FINALLY make it to the next one in one piece. There is no spoon-feeding on this game when it comes to difficulty. Enemy AI is relentlessly fast, attentive, and accurate. It works though because if this game had dumb or slow AI, the game would be too easy and not have that me-against-a-small-army-feel. You always feel outnumbered but not usually outgunned (Except for Krieger and Crow). You could be across the beach half a kilometer away laying down in bushes and a guy will notice you and raise the alarm. Damn. Better go back and try again from the checkpoint. Which leads me to my next point. The checkpoints on this game are HORRID. If there was one thing that made me think "What in the hell were the develoeprs thinking?" it was the checkpoints. AWFUL. They were so far between that dying once could mean redoing over an hour's worth of tedious sneaking and fragging. The worst was the final boss (Krieger) in which you could kill him, run around to the next elevator, pause (thinking that by now the game HAS TO have saved and put you at a new checkpoint), click back to the last checkpoint, and the game STILL didn't save your boss progress or create a new checkpoint: It would then spawn me back to the beginning of the boss fight (that I BARELY made it through on accident after 57 attempts. I guess 58 attempts never hurt?). Other than the checkpoints this game really kicked ♥♥♥. It had a good barebones feel, hilarious jokes, witty cutscenes, no nonsense but challenging gameplay, a cliche storyline (that at the time I think was probably inventive or still interesting), and a likeable protagonist. I really couldn't ask for much more. 9/10 for Far Cry.","January 19, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

AI is very smart here and the fact that you can't save whenever you want makes it even more difficult. This game's hardest setting have some hilariously hard parts where you'll  want to punch your screen after the 40th try (the part when the girl drives and you shoot, GOD DAMN THAT PART). Although the voice acting, the cutscenes and the story are terrible, the gameplay and graphics (for its time) are superb.\n\nIt is very satisfactory when you make a headshot with your good old M4 from a long distance. A good variety of weapons. The multiplayer is still there, but you have to be lucky to find someone playing. The rooms are usually filled up with BOTS. It can be pretty fun though when a miracle happens and a room fills up. If you want a challenging FPS, this is for you.","May 8, 2015","true","76.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankswaggins/recommended/13520/","dankswaggins","k.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankswaggins/","12 products in account","I recently bought all of the Far Cry games except for Far Cry 4 for $15, so I decided to play them all through, starting with the original.\nUpon opening the game, I experienced the most confusing opening cutscene I have ever seen in a game, followed by a blank screen. I closed it, reopened it, same again. To fix this problem, open the game, open task manager, go to "processes" right click far cry, go to "affinity" and make sure that only one cpu core is allowed to run the game. Another thing you may have to do, is turn lighting down to "high". Everything else can be on max.\n\nFirst impressions of the game:\nAmazing graphics. Just amazing, for a 2004 game. I would say it almost has as much graphical detail as a modern game, the main problem being that the graphics don't fit together very well, leaving sharp looking edges.\nHorrible voice acting by the main character. Some might find this annoying, but to me, it actually allowed me to feel like I was the player, and I feel it worked even better than a character who doesn't speak, of course, this wasn't the developers intentions.\nGood gameplay mechanics, one thing to note, you don't aim down sights, you just zoom in a bit.\n\nI'll just list the pros and cons of this game, in order of importance.\n\nPros:\nImmersion. This is, hands down the most immersive game I have ever played. As someone who never gets jump scares, I was amazed by this game actually making me almost fall off my chair from getting a fright. A lot of horror games get critisised for using "cheap jump scares", but this is not a horror game. If Call of Duty is the action movie of video games, then Far Cry is the thriller.  This makes the game fun. Really fun.\n\nHuge single player maps. Depending on what difficulty you play on, the maps will take about an hour. If you play on easiest difficulty, then it would only take 20-30 minutes, but the maps are still very large, and the game allows many different options to go into combat, with AI that make combat challenging and interesting.\n\nAn amazing, but flawed stealth system. The stealth system has a lot going for it. I'll list the cons further on but the pros are: you really feel like you're sneaking past enemies, again this ties in with immersiveness, and also, taking out enemies one by one actually works.\n\nAttention to detail. They thought of everything. Different stamina regeneration depending on if you're walking or standing still, different movement speeds depending on what gun you're using and more.\n\nVery long campaign. 20 large campaign maps.\n\nReally cool feel.\n\nCONS:\nStory isn't clear due to awful cut scene at the beginning.\n\nStealth sytem has flaws, such as, throwing a rock to distract enemies will alert them to your position 9 times out of 10.\n\nEnemies are very accurate, even at very long distances. Personally I enjoy this, as it means you can't just stand in the open shooting, and it encourages taking different options to acheive your objective.\n\nAlthough there are ways to sneak past enemies, a lot of the time you'll end up having to kill them anyway.\n\nMultiplayer is dead. I myself am quite upset by this as I would've loved to try it out, alhough it probably wouldn't have the things that made the campaign special.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to almost anyone. It's great, heaps of fun and an awesome feel.","April 26, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pranxtor/recommended/13520/","pranxtor","Pranxtor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pranxtor/","37 products in account","The main difference between this game and the newer versions is the perception of time. I have spent about 3 hours on both Far Cry and Far Cry 3. I have enoyed playing both but Far Cry has been more of a challenge all the way through. In 3 hours I feel like I have seen so much of the island and am about half-way through the game. In  3 hours on Far Cry 3 I feel like I have barely made a blip in the world. But this review is not about comparing games that were released 10 years apart!\n\nI don't normally play shooters and this game is very much a shooter. The binocular mechanic is cool and there is enough story to pull me through. I have found many of the levels very challenging, some taking multiple attempts to clear a stage. Each attempt makes me think and plan ahead. What weapon should I use? How can I use the environment to my advantage? How can I be stealthy in a game with very poor stealth mechanics? These choices and thought processes I feel are absent from the modern shooter.\n\nThe gameplay and story is linear. It follows a protagonist who's name I can't remember but  is the overly 'manly-man' (With some classic one-liners) as his private yaught is blow up and his girlfriend is captured by pirates? You are aided by a mysterious voice from the radio as you fight your way across the island in search of your girlfriend.\n\nYou can only alter the path slightly but you will always reach the same checkpoint. There is very little else to do other than the story. No money, collectibles etc. This feels refreshing for once. Most games have hundreds of achievements and collectibles that keep you in the game long after it is fun.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent for a 10-year old game and the environments look nice when viewed at a distance.\n\nThe AI is dumb.  The controls are okay.\n\nFor the $10 I paid for the franchise pack (1-Blood Dragon) it was a worthwhile purchase and I look forward to completing the game. You just can't go into the game expecting a modern shooter or something comparable to Far Cry 3.\n\nOn a side note:\nI haven't played the multiplayer but apparently it's dead anyway. Not surprising for a 10 year old game really. Still worth the $1 or so I spent on it.","January 27, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I figure I played the game 5 times that and maybe 10 times that. It's a great game. The eye candy is about as pleasant as can be for a PC that has limits on graphics power. It's a great game for single player action with the headphones on, on a rainy day outside and you're in the tropics, everything blue and sunny and your listening to jungle birds making nice sounds, waves lapping the beach and your looking for baddies. It's a classic. The enemy are not the smartest but they where never intended to be the smartest. This is a practice game, a learner, a reliable experience from beginning to end and you're going to love the scenery because it's nice to look at. The monsters are horrible and deserve no mercy and so it's easy fraging them and the enemy is a mix of fools, idiots and really bad nasty people. The vehicles are very good and the sound is very good. Make sure you can play it on the highest settings because this game looks very nice at the highest settings and that's when all the birds, little fish and insects com out. It's a classic and in the best of the best first person shooters of all time. There so many maps available for the game and there are map packs that are better than the game's original maps that are already excellent. You could buy this game, play out it's maps, install map packs and play it for years and never see the same map twice. A very good game with very good community support and it's very very stable with a PC built about 3-4 years after the game's release date. Around the game's release date the PCs had some issues with the game but that all changed when the PCs improved and software updates where released. The game is now solid. Buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/13520/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Starting with the technical, Far Cry is a first-person shooter.  It was released in early 2004, to many positive reviews gaining a meta score of 89.  It uses the CryENGINE, now known as CryENGINE1, and was the first game released by CryTek, the same company that would go on to create Crysis.  It’s their party, they’ll ‘cry’ if that want too.\n\nAt the time of writing this I haven’t completed the game, but felt as though I’d played enough to get this posted.  But believe me, that fact has nothing to do with Far Cry falling short.  With my Radeon HD 4650 and 4 GB RAM I was able to push all the graphic settings to their max, for a very beautiful game.  But lets face it, its hard to find an ugly game that came out after aught-four.\n\nAs a non-linear sandbox game you have free range over an entire island, an island over run by bizarre mutants and mercenaries that are trying to kill you, but free range none-the-less.  As the game starts you quickly learn that this is not just a good AI, but a smart one, that works together.  I’ve seen this AI do things that blew my mind, but in the good way.  I’ve been flanked on both sides at the same time, I had heavy fire from the right distract me from a Merc sneaking up on my left.  If these are just totally random moments or in the AI code I haven’t a clue, but it always kept me on my feet.\n\nNow I can’t comment too much on the story, I know a few things, but a lot of it I’ve missed.  And that brings us to the first problem.  You see periodically you have these little chats with a fellow named Doyle, but the audio is always low, really low.  The only times I’ve heard them is A) when I got the headphones on, or B) when I know they are coming and I crank up the speakers.  If I played the game with the speakers blasting I would never miss a convo, but the volume level required is almost absurd, and if combat is going on you can’t even hear it over the gunfire and shouts.  Messing around with the audio options doesn’t solve this, at least not to any degree I’ve found. Now the really important story line stuff happens in cut scenes, so you always have the big pieces to the puzzle, plus there is a chance that this is an issue with the Steam version.  So I’m not knocking it too hard for it.\n\nGameplay mechanics are everything that you expect in a shooter.  Because really not a lot has changed since ’04. Some weapons have alt fire, some have different fire modes, some have scopes.  There are a good variety to choose from, but not so many that your flooded with choices.  However you can only hold four weapons at a time, so some picking and choosing is necessary. One slight annoyance I’ve found is with ladders, sometimes when you reach the top the game doesn’t want you to get off, especially if there is a lip between the ladder and the landing. Oh, and sometimes the ragdolls land wrong, but this is something I’ve seen in even the most current games.\n\nThat covers all the major stuff without taking too much away from anyone who hasn’t played Far Cry.  If you’re on the fence about, go find a copy or grab it on steam, it’s well worth the $9.99. I’ve owned the game for just over two weeks and have already logged 16 hours into it, given my schedule, that says a lot.  It’s got your vehicles to drive, helicopters to shoot down, stealthy places for stealth, and run-out-guns-blazing action.  And best of all, you get to pick how you do what, where, and when.  You make it your own game.\n\nSo a little more about the story, more so the ending.  Or the fact that you think it’s about to end, three times.  And by the time you get to the actual ending you’re somewhat surprised that it really ended. How this ranks on your personal scale will vary for everyone.  But for me this just kept the game amazing.  I think there were four times where I thought I had finished the game.\n\nThey even pull what I call the Half-Life-Moment (named after Half-Life the first game I saw do it), where you are stripped of everything and must continue on with no weapons or equipment. Always makes for a great moment and a real test of your skills.  Even if, like in this case, it’s a test of how fast can you run.\n\nA gun with only ten bullets in it, a Trigen charging me, and me needing to get to the other side of the island.  This part was the first time that I had to resort to checking a guide on how to get past it. I’d say I spent far too much time trying to figure it, mostly due to over-thinking the problem.  Really it’s a case of the simplest answer with the most convenient definition.\n\nAnd that’s another thing to really love about this, they change it up on you fairly often. The play style can switch pretty quickly, and if your not ready for it, you’ll spend hours trying to figure out how to get past a spot.  Only to eventually realize that you were going at it the wrong way. The need to stop think and assess is very common.\n\nStepping aside from the game for a moment, and into the compatibly realm.  Since this is a Steam game, compatibly it pretty much a guarantee, but there are a couple snags.  Other than the previously mentioned floating ragdolls, FarCry has a habit of crashing on exit.  Really it’s less of a crash and more of a freezing.  A simple Ctrl+Alt+Del and into the Task Manager to end the process will take care of the problem without any game data loss.  So a small nuisance.\n\nAnother bug is if you kill an enemy at the exact right time the audio clip of his machine gun will get stuck.  You’ll hear the gun fire, you’ll see the corpse, you can walk up and take the weapon, but the fire never stops.  You can tell the exact spot where they died, based on where the sound is the loudest, and so eventually you wont hear it any more as you leave the area.  This was never a serious issue, the sound wasn’t enough of a distraction to cause problems.  But was always pretty humorous.\n\nNot quite a bug, but a flaw in the modeling itself was this. It just annoyed me that they thought that that looked good, and didn’t take the time to flip the model around for a better look.\n\nI still missed most of the story early on in the game, but caught enough towards the end to get it figured out.  I did predict a classic “Hollywood Twist” and ended up being right about it. But was really disappointed with the ending, or lack there was.  Massive battle outside, having to load the save over twenty times, finally get inside the building, fire one bullet, cutscene, cutscene, end.  It really didn’t feel like an ending, and considering how many times it did feel like an ending prior to that.  I was a bit disappointed.\n\nBut now after spending 28 hours of my life inside the world of Far Cry, having beaten the game I can truly say, it’s well worth the money.  I got a hell of a bargain, but even for $9.99 it’s a steal.","May 16, 2013","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What more can I say?\n\nThe extent of early open world technology really does this justice - you find patrols and vehicles scattered across the islands, and are met with secret tunnels and the like in some places. I love the early segments of the game, I really do. However, the only issue I can raise with the game are the levels towards the end, featuring the mutant "TriGens". This feels too much like Halo: Combat Evolved - zombie-like creatures are released towards the end of the game and spread havoc among the ranks of your enemy, and you fight them with the enemy. Very similar. I feel that had the game stuck with the original premise of fighting a pitched battle against mercenaries, this would have sufficed, as that is gorgeous fun.\n\n6 golden bananas out of Shigeru.","June 28, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What a wonderful suprise that this game is even better than I remember it!  The graphics may be a little dated compared to what's out right now, but they still hold up pretty good, especially the atmosphiric effects in some of the indoor maps, with distortion from steam coming out of vents and shifting shadows from swinging light fixtures.  The engine is fantastic, with great hit detection and a smooth solid shooting feel, although I did have some problems getting stuck in doorways or on ramps.  The AI is also not the brightest, but sometimes the mercenaries on the island did a pretty good job flanking me and popping out of the jungle where I wasn't expecting them.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is the amazing setting; a lush tropical island for the player to explore.  It seems that every new map has something cool to check out, from Japanese WWII relics to sandy atol outpost to misty mountaintop research stations.  The story is pretty generic, but it does a good job at propelling you from one interesting predicament to the next.  If you have never played this game, give it a shot.

Each section has different flora and flauna and soil and lighting (due to the different time of day). The maps are open and leave you free to use the various means at your disposal to get to your goal. The plot is amusingly B-grade Hollywood without the slightest hint of pretentiousness but still manages to surprise. The maps alternate between corridor and jungle levels and there is plenty of variety within that structure. Vehicle missions, hang-gliding, guarding a VIP, et al. The main voice actor does a funny and sometimes hilariously implausible cross between Napoleon Dynamite and Bruce Willias in Die Hard.\n\nAlso the music in some of the jungle stages is outstanding. Borrowed from Hollywood with eerie Japanese-sounding woodwinds and gongs.\n\nI think it's an excellent shooter all around, but I especially admired it for the tense and scenic jungle stages. It's also famously difficult, about which I have some comments.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe first review I saw when I scanned the reviews a moment ago said this was the Dark Souls of FPSs, and I think that is a good way of putting it. It seems extremely difficult at first, but unless you have the see-through textures bug it's not cheap (although you can be the recipient of flukishly lucky headshots, just as you can be the giver). You have to play very slowly and deliberately, especially in the jungle levels, and you have to use all of the items in your arsenal, particularly the binoculars and the nightvision. Above all you have to learn to keep one eye glued to the detection meter. Not only does it tell you when you need to back off and dive into the bush, it also lets you know that there's someone out there in your field of vision if you look carefully for them.\n\nYou also have to understand that the enemies have vision approximately as good as yours (that is, if you can see them they can see you). Sometimes they can see you when it's impossible to see them because of the draw distance, but that is more than offset by the fact that even when you're in their field of vision you get a grace period while the detection meter builds up. Also when you are in cover you can see them without them seeing you.\n\nAnother point is this game has an usually high bonus for headshots versus bodyshots. It feels like about 5:1 to me. Especially against humans you should always be going for headshots, except when you're in a really bad spot where you don't have time to aim (bodyshots have a slight stunning effect against humans and armshots cause them to drop their weapons).\n\nThe one matter related to difficulty that I think should have been fixed is it should be easier to track the source of gunfire on your HUD or in the world. The reason is occasionally there is an enemy, usually situated on higher ground, who can rapidly spot you when you come out of cover. If you're not playing with quicksaves you will often find yourself with low enough health that you will be killed in one shot, and sometimes you just can't find the guy with your binoculars while in the cover of foliage. So your only hope in those situations is to sprint for new cover and hope you can find the shooter from there.\n\nDifficulty\n\nWithout quick saves as originally designed the game's medium difficulty should have been its hardest difficulty, and the harder difficulties should have been for NG+. Personally I did the first half without quicksaves but then applied the FCAM patch for the sake of graphics and used the quicksave option that goes with it. It takes all the frustration out of the game but also most of the suspense. Without your progress being at stake it doesn't really matter if you fail. And certain very busy stages of the game become outright easy when you can save incrementally every time you manage to take out a few guys without getting hit. I would recommend playing without quicksaves for as long as you can stand it. Maybe consult a FAQ as a palliative.","January 25, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, checkpoint only saving which can result in replaying certain parts over, and over, and over...\n\nOnly play if you have an indomitable spirit and a fair amount of patience.

BIG mistake.  This is nigh on unplayable.  It is a "die and retry" game to the max (see Edge of Tomorrow).  Enemies kill you before you know they are there, and can shoot through obstacles that prevent you from even seeing them.  Coupled with a poor checkpoint save system, you will find yourself dying repeatedly and redoing everything over and over and over and over and over and over until you figure out that magic sequence of actions that will get you through to the end. And that's on "Easy".  On top of all that, despite the 2004-level graphics, it is a resource-hungry pig.  I could not even run  it on the highest settings (which I could for FC2 and FC3), and even on lower levels it would lag awkwardly just when you did not need it.

What a wonderful suprise that this game is even better than I remember it!  The graphics may be a little dated compared to what's out right now, but they still hold up pretty good, especially the atmosphiric effects in some of the indoor maps, with distortion from steam coming out of vents and shifting shadows from swinging light fixtures.  The engine is fantastic, with great hit detection and a smooth solid shooting feel, although I did have some problems getting stuck in doorways or on ramps.  The AI is also not the brightest, but sometimes the mercenaries on the island did a pretty good job flanking me and popping out of the jungle where I wasn't expecting them.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is the amazing setting; a lush tropical island for the player to explore.  It seems that every new map has something cool to check out, from Japanese WWII relics to sandy atol outpost to misty mountaintop research stations.  The story is pretty generic, but it does a good job at propelling you from one interesting predicament to the next.  If you have never played this game, give it a shot.  I honestly think it's superior to all of the Farcry sequels, and also a lot of other FPS games I've played in recent years.","March 10, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is definately not for the faint-hearted. Generally, it's a hard ♥♥♥ game; no running and gunning here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/13520/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Starting with the technical, Far Cry is a first-person shooter.  It was released in early 2004, to many positive reviews gaining a meta score of 89.  It uses the CryENGINE, now known as CryENGINE1, and was the first game released by CryTek, the same company that would go on to create Crysis.  It’s their party, they’ll ‘cry’ if that want too.\n\nAt the time of writing this I haven’t completed the game, but felt as though I’d played enough to get this posted.  But believe me, that fact has nothing to do with Far Cry falling short.  With my Radeon HD 4650 and 4 GB RAM I was able to push all the graphic settings to their max, for a very beautiful game.  But lets face it, its hard to find an ugly game that came out after aught-four.\n\nAs a non-linear sandbox game you have free range over an entire island, an island over run by bizarre mutants and mercenaries that are trying to kill you, but free range none-the-less.  As the game starts you quickly learn that this is not just a good AI, but a smart one, that works together.  I’ve seen this AI do things that blew my mind, but in the good way.  I’ve been flanked on both sides at the same time, I had heavy fire from the right distract me from a Merc sneaking up on my left.  If these are just totally random moments or in the AI code I haven’t a clue, but it always kept me on my feet.\n\nNow I can’t comment too much on the story, I know a few things, but a lot of it I’ve missed.  And that brings us to the first problem.  You see periodically you have these little chats with a fellow named Doyle, but the audio is always low, really low.  The only times I’ve heard them is A) when I got the headphones on, or B) when I know they are coming and I crank up the speakers.  If I played the game with the speakers blasting I would never miss a convo, but the volume level required is almost absurd, and if combat is going on you can’t even hear it over the gunfire and shouts.  Messing around with the audio options doesn’t solve this, at least not to any degree I’ve found. Now the really important story line stuff happens in cut scenes, so you always have the big pieces to the puzzle, plus there is a chance that this is an issue with the Steam version.  So I’m not knocking it too hard for it.\n\nGameplay mechanics are everything that you expect in a shooter.  Because really not a lot has changed since ’04. Some weapons have alt fire, some have different fire modes, some have scopes.  There are a good variety to choose from, but not so many that your flooded with choices.  However you can only hold four weapons at a time, so some picking and choosing is necessary. One slight annoyance I’ve found is with ladders, sometimes when you reach the top the game doesn’t want you to get off, especially if there is a lip between the ladder and the landing. Oh, and sometimes the ragdolls land wrong, but this is something I’ve seen in even the most current games.\n\nThat covers all the major stuff without taking too much away from anyone who hasn’t played Far Cry.  If you’re on the fence about, go find a copy or grab it on steam, it’s well worth the $9.99. I’ve owned the game for just over two weeks and have already logged 16 hours into it, given my schedule, that says a lot.  It’s got your vehicles to drive, helicopters to shoot down, stealthy places for stealth, and run-out-guns-blazing action.  And best of all, you get to pick how you do what, where, and when.  You make it your own game.\n\nSo a little more about the story, more so the ending.  Or the fact that you think it’s about to end, three times.  And by the time you get to the actual ending you’re somewhat surprised that it really ended. How this ranks on your personal scale will vary for everyone.  But for me this just kept the game amazing.  I think there were four times where I thought I had finished the game.\n\nThey even pull what I call the Half-Life-Moment (named after Half-Life the first game I saw do it), where you are stripped of everything and must continue on with no weapons or equipment. Always makes for a great moment and a real test of your skills.  Even if, like in this case, it’s a test of how fast can you run.\n\nA gun with only ten bullets in it, a Trigen charging me, and me needing to get to the other side of the island.  This part was the first time that I had to resort to checking a guide on how to get past it. I’d say I spent far too much time trying to figure it, mostly due to over-thinking the problem.  Really it’s a case of the simplest answer with the most convenient definition.\n\nAnd that’s another thing to really love about this, they change it up on you fairly often. The play style can switch pretty quickly, and if your not ready for it, you’ll spend hours trying to figure out how to get past a spot.  Only to eventually realize that you were going at it the wrong way. The need to stop think and assess is very common.\n\nStepping aside from the game for a moment, and into the compatibly realm.  Since this is a Steam game, compatibly it pretty much a guarantee, but there are a couple snags.  Other than the previously mentioned floating ragdolls, FarCry has a habit of crashing on exit.  Really it’s less of a crash and more of a freezing.  A simple Ctrl+Alt+Del and into the Task Manager to end the process will take care of the problem without any game data loss.  So a small nuisance.\n\nAnother bug is if you kill an enemy at the exact right time the audio clip of his machine gun will get stuck.  You’ll hear the gun fire, you’ll see the corpse, you can walk up and take the weapon, but the fire never stops.  You can tell the exact spot where they died, based on where the sound is the loudest, and so eventually you wont hear it any more as you leave the area.  This was never a serious issue, the sound wasn’t enough of a distraction to cause problems.  But was always pretty humorous.\n\nNot quite a bug, but a flaw in the modeling itself was this. It just annoyed me that they thought that that looked good, and didn’t take the time to flip the model around for a better look.\n\nI still missed most of the story early on in the game, but caught enough towards the end to get it figured out.  I did predict a classic “Hollywood Twist” and ended up being right about it. But was really disappointed with the ending, or lack there was.  Massive battle outside, having to load the save over twenty times, finally get inside the building, fire one bullet, cutscene, cutscene, end.  It really didn’t feel like an ending, and considering how many times it did feel like an ending prior to that.  I was a bit disappointed.\n\nBut now after spending 28 hours of my life inside the world of Far Cry, having beaten the game I can truly say, it’s well worth the money.  I got a hell of a bargain, but even for $9.99 it’s a steal.","May 16, 2013","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those games that pioneered what we take for granted in a modern shooter.  Like those pioneers, it shares a similar plot; guy with military background gets sent to a secret facility to beat up grunts and fight a bad guy, who is going to release an evil plot device that will ultimately destroy the world if not stopped.\n\nThose kinds of stories were the heyday back in the days, and Far Cry is no exception.  It's sad that what modern shooters have chosen to take from their roots to apply to their current games is just the cut-and-paste plot and the state-of-the-art graphics.  I had to stop playing this game and give it a break multiple times throughout the playthrough because I kept running into parts where the game was incredibly difficult.  This ranged from a lack of waypoints (which you find in almost every shooter game) which meant that it was nigh close to impossible to figure out where to go, to a lack of the right weapons (you'd think that having a pistol might actually be helpful in one of the early games where the great focus was the hitbox health system where headshots could one-hit-KO something), to having to deal with a horde of enemies all at once with almost no health and an escort mission to boot.  It's a game that makes you have to stop what you are doing and leave the computer for a while to think and recharge your brain cells before going back in again.\n\nI miss that in a lot of today's games.  Shooters could do with the increased difficulty that doesn't require cheat codes or a paywall to bypass.  It's nice to take a step back from the LCD induced graphics and hardware and just play an old game in order to appreciate how far we've come.","August 25, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game really tries to ♥♥♥♥ you over. It's one of those old games that are hard for all the wrong reasons. A lot of the levels, like the aircraft carrier one, are based trial and error. Imageine a complex, three-dimensional space littered with every nook and cranny filled with overly cafinated, paranoid, superhuman soldiers ready to shoot you in a femtosecond from appearing in their field of view. You just try again and again until you learn all the spots the enemies spawn in, and formulate the most efficient way to kill them while minimizing the damage you take and the ammo you use. Alot of the times this involves shooting guys from two miles away at the edge of the draw distance so they dont aggro you back, or driving a vehicles with a mounted gun to stupid places so you can cheese the upcoming section that you were supposed to confront on foot. The game is a fun challenge, because you have to out-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","October 23, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For its year of publishment it features very nice grahpics and a revolutionary level design. Controls and guns play out very well and the story line makes it interesting to carry on with the game.\nThere are some minor flaws in terms of the AI but nothing too significant to not recommend this awesome title.\n\nTo everyone that loves old-school shooters which are still a lot of fun to play, Far Cry is the perfect game for you!","October 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
