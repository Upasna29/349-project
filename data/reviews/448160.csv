They seem like a bunch of very talented people who really understand what makes games tick. Wolflame is no different.\n\nIf you're expecting a super innovative game that turns the Shmup genre on its head then this isn't for you. You have a shoot button and a bomb and that's it. It is built from the ground up to play like older shmups such as Raiden or any of the classic Toaplan titles, but without the arcade hard difficulty designed around milking quarters out of people. If you like those games you will love this one. It is challenging, but in a fair way, it keeps you wanting to play and overcoming the difficult spot you're in instead of giving up.\n\nYou have 3 different subweapon powerups, one is a powerful green laser that shoots slightly off to the side, a blue laser that locks on to any enemy it touches and a red spreadshot with homing laser. A cool feature is the ability to mix and match two of them, one for each wing, the powerup will show you which wing it is for with a direction, you can power each up to 5 levels, then you get 5000 bonus points for everyone you colect after that. I like to stick with dual green laser as it wrecks everything pretty hard.\n\nIt has checkpoints instead of instant revival, but unlike older shooters it is much easier to recover thanks to the ability to grab your previous powerups back contained in a single pickup, if you miss it then you may have a bad time :). Even if you get stuck with the peashooter starting weapon, the checkpoints are very well done, the game seems designed around having lower power weapons so if you're maxed out you will do serious damage, even to bosses. THe game is fairly long for a Shmup, expect to take around an hour to an hour and a half for a first run, it's even got a save and load feature. The scoring system is very basic, you find hidden medals and it tallies them up at the end of the stage, aside from that just kill everything you possibly can and don't die.\n\nThe game has many different enemy types and really good encounter design, they clearly put alot of thought into placement instead of just swarming you with enemies and bullets. This game isn't bullet hell, opting for simpler, easier to read but much faster bullets. Every single enemy in this game is deadly, you should fear even a lone basic tank which can easily snipe you when you least expect it and end your run. This combined with the checkpoint system makes the game very tense and exciting in a way that bullet hells can't touch. Bossfights are well done and memorable, though the first few die very quickly due to the stages being easy and your ship having full power. There are 10 stages in total with a nice difficulty curve throughout, there was no sudden spike in difficulty.\n\nThe graphics look nice, far better than the typical 2D game on Steam. Everything is very distinct and easily recognizable. The sound effects give it a nice punch and the music fits perfectly, though it isn't the sort of thing I would listen to outside of the game. You can change how loud the sound effects and music are seperately.\n\nFor video options you can switch between fullscreen and windowed, you can increase or decrease the size of the screen and the game supports TATE mode. Controls are fully rebindable with keyboard, cannot comment on controller support.\n\nGreat game overall, I highly recommend it. It doesn't do anything all that new, but excels at what it does set out to do, which is all you need.","April 21","true","3.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

No stupid scoring-systems, no weird bullet-patterns drowning the screen in pink and a complete lack of that moe-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? Look no further than WOLFLAME if you crave some really oldschool heavy metal action quite like the original Raiden STGs.\n\nNot much to say about it, really - you shoot stuff, it explodes. You pick up powerups - flavours are spreadshot with homing lasers, a laser that sticks to targets until they blow up and a ♥♥♥♥♥in' green laser that vaporizes everything it touches. With these tools of mass destruction you shoot a lot more stuff at the same time, much bigger explosions happen - filling the screen with fire and death.\n\nIf the action gets too intense (and boy, does this game throw a LOT of soon to be scrap metal at you) you can drop a nuke that acts as a shield (eats up bullets) and does damage to fools unfortunate enough to be in the blast radius.\n\nIt's simplistic, yes - but in a good, appealing sort of way. You don't have to be a ♥♥♥♥ing scientist to play it to a decent level - and I just love the absence of everything I hate about modern day STGs. Too bad it's not exactly Astro Ports most amazing work in terms of visuals (stage 7 is a beauty though, leaving the atmosphere with a booster-rocket and taking the fight to the enemy starfleet is badass - I love that ♥♥♥♥! - Delta Zeal is a bazillion times prettier though) and the music, while suitably "pumping", could be slightly longer than a 20 second loop repeated forever.\n\nStill, if you wanna rock out and just blast tanks, aircraft and mechanized fortresses Wolflame gets the job done very nicely, thanks to a no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-attitude and that feeling games like Raiden, SWIV or Raptor had back in the day.

Featuring several difficulties, you'll be able to shoot your ways through 10 levels, probably dying quite a few times along the way. Don't expect much in the way of story while you're in the game - when you start a new game, you'll immediately be tossed in the level and will get to start shooting. There are pickups you can get along the way which will give you two additional cannons that have one of three powers (depending on the colour of the pickup when you grabbed it).\n\nThe only bug I encountered in the game was an infinite lives glitch (video of this within my full review). It is fairly frame precise to actually pull off, but I was able to pull it off twice in one run.\n\nIf you're a fan of shmup games then be sure to pick up this one. Easy recommendation from me.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a code by the publisher for review purposes.","May 2","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Reminds me of Gradius and R-Type with that mechanic, and it provides a good challenge for anyone, and with multiple difficulty options it's approachable. It's a simple game with a good challenge, I think you'll find some enjoyment out of this, especially with ten levels to enjoy as you shoot down whatever is in front of you and destroy the end boss.","April 28","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It's not as complex as Crimzon Clover or Radiant Silvergun, but for the price they ask it's well worth giving it a try, and I have little to complain about. Haven't gotten too far in yet, but so far nothing's gone wrong, which is one of Astro Port's strengths: if you can get into the first parts of the game and enjoy it, it never dips into disappointment.","April 21","true","8.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brub/recommended/448160/","Brub","Brub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brub/","340 products in account","Pretty good game, feels and plays just right. Blowing up ships feels great and satisfying. However, I feel like there could have been more variety to the enemies and the levels. Music is alright, especially the rhythm, but again, somewhat repetitive.\n\nThis also might be one of the rare shoot em ups that doesn't make you restart at the very beginning when it is game over, you can always retry at the last checkpoint. So anyone worried they can never finish a game like this, this one you just might. There are 10 levels, each one of them relatively short, fun and challenging. And multiple difficulties.\n\nIt is as it says in the description, WOLFLAME is a return to the form. If you love Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun, you might find this game somewhat lacking and/or basic, you find upgrades as you destroy ships, you have bombs that destroy enemy ships and protect you at the same time from their bullets. And that is where it ends. There are no cutscenes or characters, no complex mechanics or rpg elements. Whether you are fine with this or not, that is up to you. I like WOLFLAME and for that price I think it is worth buying. It's a great throwback for diehard fans and a good place to start for newcomers because of how accessible it can be. I can see myself playing this from time to time, maybe even try the harder difficulties at some point.","April 21","true","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

No complicated scoring systems.  Detailed, great-looking hand-drawn pixel art.  Clear Toaplan and Seibu influences.  SNIPER TANKS!  Incredibly easy to pick up and play, and blowing stuff up is ultimately satisfying, just as a shmup should be.  The music isn't that great and doesn't loop "properly", but that's an otherwise minor gripe.  Shmup fans of any style should buy this, especially fans of older "memorizers".  This is also a great game for shmup beginners - easy difficulty can be completed without much experience in the genre.","April 23","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
