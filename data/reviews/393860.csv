This is a nice arcade style tennis game with lots of character customization and fun mini games. I haven\'t tried the multiplayer yet but soon I will. The game wasn\'t easy for me at first but it got interesting once I got the Hang of it. There is nothing much to say about graphics and there are no extra options for graphics other than changing the resolution. Overall I\'d recommend only if you are a fan of tennis games.","June 1","true","15.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

They are perfect if you want to play tennis in a different way (zombies??, star wars?!?!, that's just great). They are very refreshing.\nThe worst: I have to find something yet.","June 4","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don’t see anything related to what control use or not so sucks, I’ll get the refund.\n\nJust wait for some update to see if this improves, it seemed a fun game and shouldn’t had any issues like this","June 1","false","0.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","12"
