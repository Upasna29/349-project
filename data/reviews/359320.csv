Then I realised; I forgot to refuel at the next star I totally shut my engines off to try to get a clear picture of what was happening. Looking at my computers I found a small station about 16,000Ls away. I wasn't sure if I could make it with the fuel I had so I just did it, I was dead either way.\n\nFlying through space watching that fuel gauge drain is the scariest thing I've had to do in this game, The thing was so close to empty that I had all but written myself off. Then out of nowhere another play is trying to rip me from warp! This was the first time it had happened to me so naturally I succumbed to to the tear.\n\nI figured at this point the fuel issue was out the window and I wouldn't have a chance getting to the station, so I turn and fight but he's in an attack vessle so I'm getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me on a silver platter. On the verge of complete acceptance of defeat, I get a second wind. I decide 'No! I wont let it end like this',  I activate the warp drive and as it's charging try to put some distance between my attacker and myself. I'm on 6% HP at this point and take another hit... Down to 3%, one more hit and I'm done.\n\nThe warp drive activates! With a measly 3% HP I make my way to the station I had previously tried to get to. The fuel I have is scaring the crap out of me, the whole thing could shut down any second and at this point I'm not even thinking about how I'm going to dock on this low HP since in the past I have always damaged my ship.\n\nI drop from warp, thankfully in the right place. I begin docking preparation and then I see someone is trolling the airlock. The station quickly dispatches him but leaves a mess of debris in my way, Slowly I try to squeeze past it all I mage to get past most of it but then one stray unavoidable piece floats towards me and hits the canopy of the ship.... 1%. I crap my pants a little and then continue. I touch down the softest landing I have ever done and let out a massive sigh of release as repair and refuel.\n\n10/10 Would have heart attack again.","April 21, 2015","true","62.3"," 9,253 of 9,818 people (94%) found this review helpful 5,010 people found this review funny","94","253","9","010","105"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SurrealSage/recommended/359320/","SurrealSage","Surrialis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SurrealSage/","607 products in account","This game is really quite good, and there is a lot to it. The game's flight mechanics are simple enough that they can be easily grasped and intuitively controlled faster than with most flight games. Entering this game, you should expect a learning curve, and for part of the fun being exploring all the things you can do as you learn. If you're expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the game, you're going to blunder around for an hour, rage quit, and then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off. This game is a sandbox. Be prepared to find your own way. Lets get to the game itself:\n\nThe general point of the game is to reach "Elite" rank. You can do this via combat, trading, or exploration. Lets talk about each of these three types of play in turn:\n\nCombat: Excellent part of this game. There are a diverse range of weapons, each which function differently and place different strains on your ship's loadout. You want to use Plasma Accelerators? Well, those have major power drain, so you need your ship to have a large power plant. Bigger shield? More power. Shield cell banks? More power. Planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyable, and ongoing experience throughout the game. As far as combat goes, you can approach it as a bounty hunter, going out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice... Or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilots, breaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market. Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game. If nothing else, you'll get a solid 20-30 hours out of combat progression.\n\nTrading: This part is a bit more up in the air to a lot of people. Some people don't like the repetitious nature of trading in the game, but it really depends on what you look for. Trading involves going to different stations, recording what they have in high demand, and what they have in high supply, and linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demand, and which demand what the first station has in high supply. In other words, basic supply/demand economics, you trade the goods between stations. This can be a bit dull, other than when pirates are after you, but it really depends what you want. This is the Euro-Truck Simulator part of the game. If you want something relaxing, flying between stations while listening to a podcast, audiobook, or watching a TV show, trading is for you.\n\nExploration: The galaxy is big. Bigger than I think most of us have a grasp of. Many of us know "Well, the galaxy is obviously massive", but there's a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all. Sol, that is the solar system earth is found in, is a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center. It takes around 20-30 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in non-stop jumping from star to star. To travel all around the galaxy, you're talking months worth of time devoted to exploring. And that doesn't even count the time it takes to scan each system, and go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money. Why would anyone want to do this? Well, have you ever flown up to a black hole, and seen the light distort around it in an eerie, terrorizing sense of dread? Have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape? Have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole? These are the types of things you see when you explore, and for many, the feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile. If you're the first one to explore something, your name is also tagged to it forever. The civilized area of space only takes about 500 LY around Sol, with the rest up to being explored.\n\nPeripherals: The game works very well with a mouse and keyboard, with a XBox 360 controller, and with most joysticks (HOTAS or otherwise). There are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controller, as well as most market joysticks. So you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while you're learning.\n\nAlways Online Note: You have a multiplayer option in which you're around other players. Players will try to pirate you, others will bounty hunt for you, etc. You can set up wings, groups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights. Or, if you want to be a recluse, you can play Solo and avoid other players, and just play with NPCs. Or maybe you just want to play with your friend, you can set up a Private Group. All of these require a constant internet connection, but it is for a reason. Anytime you do something in the game, it shapes the political and economic landscape. If you buy resonating separators from Cemiess, you reduce the amount of supply in Cemiess, which makes the price go up. When this happens, the game pings the global server, and changes the value for everyone else in their own servers. So although you are away from other players, what you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyone.\n\nGalactic Political Landscape: There are 3 major factions in the game: the Alliance, Federation, and Empire. Additionally, there are Independent factions bound to specific star systems. Each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems. Lets say you look at a system like Lugh which was ruled by the Federation. Within Lugh, there are many "parties" that are in government, running for political control. The Federation party is in control. But if players start to do missions against the party in control, if they start to kill police, pirate traders, do things to disrupt the peace in that system, it spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system. They start to demand change. A civil war can break out between the faction in power, and the faction that is not in power, and they fight. Players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bonds, and help shape the outcome of the war. Depending on which side wins, the system may flip. In Lugh, the system did flip. Players turned out early on in mass numbers to test this, trying to flip Lugh from the Federation into an independent star system under the Crimson party. This was accomplished, and Lugh is currently an independent star system as the Federation backed down. Anytime you do a mission, it pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party. So even if you play solo, you can impact global politics.\n\nWhat this game does not do is give you a set path. You'll load up the game, you'll have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the game, and then you'll be dropped into a dock in star system LHS 3447. You wont get a quest prompt, the game wont say "Hey, go here and do this!". You'll be docked at a space station, and it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do. You need to find your own way. You'll blunder around and advance on your own terms.\n\nWhen you start out, you should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work. But the exploration, the learning of how things work is a lot of the fun. This is an open world space game, and the way you experience it is something you'll dictate for yourself.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. The combat is really damn fun, there are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience. Trading and Exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooks, or watching TV shows.","April 2, 2015","true","178.7"," 4,113 of 4,485 people (92%) found this review helpful 133 people found this review funny","92","113","4","133","172"

The expansion will cost 40 Euros, but come with the full elite dangeorus game + the expansion Horizons. The regular game will only unlock when the expansion is released, so no point in preordering (unless you already have elite dangerous and want the 10 Euro discount off horizon).\n\nDefinitely don't buy this. I did.\n\nDay 0: I buy the game at 10 PM sunday night. My initial plan was to download it and just stay up all night playing it. I managed to convince myself to sleep and wake up early.\n\nDay 1: I wake up at 3:30 AM way too excited to play this game. I launched it and thought "What the ♥♥♥♥... how do I even spaceship..." a few minutes later I figured out the controls and set off exploring the solar system I was in, I opened up my galaxy map and looked around and saw endless possibilites.\n\nI picked a far off solar system and plotted a course. Each solar system was as spectacular as the previous ones.\n\nI look up and realize it is getting dark. 13 hours have gone by. Wait didn't I have class...\n\nDay 2: Wake up at 9 AM. I started it up again and I had told myself that I would only play it for a couple hours, 7 hours later I made my way to a station to refuel, repair and get off.\n\nThen some random guy invited me to his Wing and we started flying around collecting bounties. He's explaining things I had no idea I could do and which upgrades to get for my ship. I looked at my clock again and 5 hours had past...\n\nDay 3: Now I'm writing this after my third day of playing. I managed to stop playing long enough to do the 5 hours of homework I had put off so I could play more. Do you see how much time I've played?! In three days, 72 hours, I have played 45.4 hours. I've slept 5 hours each night just so I could play more. That means I've spent 73% of the last three days sitting on my ♥♥♥ playing this game. The other 27% was probably spent eating and watching videos about elite dangerous. If that wasn't enough I got obsessed with flight sticks so I just bought myself a HOTA... Don't buy this game, you will get addicted and have way too much fun.","April 8, 2015","true","118.4"," 3,441 of 3,803 people (90%) found this review helpful 2,486 people found this review funny","90","441","3","486","96"

I’ve learned to manage my expectations of games that come with a lot of hype but that doesn’t always do much to soften the blow, especially when we are dealing with one of my favorite genres.  I kept thinking, “I waited 30 years and paid $60 for Euro Truck in Space? Seriously?”  Unfortunately many players have never moved past this stage. The basic gameplay at first does seem only to consist of navigating menus, watching some warp animations, trying not to crash while trying to park, repeat.\n\nAnd yet, while I kept repeating this thought to myself, I kept playing.  In fact, the more I played, the more I wanted to keep playing.  At the time I could not identify what was happening.  Shouldn’t I be packing this game up and dismissing it as another instance of hype without substance?\n\nWhat I realize now is that the game was operating on me on an unconscious level.  Tiny details from every corner of the experience combined with flawless internal consistency to build an emergent narrative structure somewhere inside of me that I was not even aware of until I was already a part of it.  I’ll give you the four examples that, in order, brought me around to recognizing how huge and emergent the E:D universe is and how immersed in it I had already become:\n\nWhen you request docking clearance at a facility, they give it to you in the form of a spot assignment and a timer.  So there I am trying to park my clanky old VW Rabbit of a spaceship on this backwater industrial platform, scraping it against the walls, generally not succeeding- and the timer runs out.  And I get a communication from the facility.  Move along, your spot is forfeit, you’ve been assessed fines and you won’t be welcome back until they are paid.\n\nA few hours later, I’m hurtling across a solar system towards a facility orbiting a gas giant.  I’m cruising at maybe and average of 150c.  The planet is between me and the facility and as the gassy behemoth grows in my viewport I notice something- my speed is dropping.  I haven’t throttled down. What the hell?  Several more runs and my suspicions are confirmed: the closer you come to gravitic bodies, the less you are able to break the speed of light. Furthermore, clip too close to a sun and it will anchor you, causing an emergency drop into real space and a seriously life-threatening situation.\n\nMuch later, still playing, I’m running a courier mission to a huge station in a densely populated area of the galaxy.  To get to the entrance port I need to fly around to the nightside of beautiful M-class gem...and I notice a twinkle in the corner of my viewport.  I activate head look and turn my gaze that direction.  And there it is.  The nightside of the planet is aglow with a sparkling network of living cities.  It took my breath away.\n\nHere is where things really got serious.  I go online checking supply and demand stats and I make a handful of runs carrying foodstuffs from this certain fringe base just within exploitation radius of the Federation. Well it turns out a lot of other commanders got the same idea, and the base’s food supplies are gutted.  Next thing I know, I’m returning for me- and someone tries to interdict my ship into real space.  Which is terrifying.  I find an escape vector and make it through safely, only to find my scanner alight with “conflict zones.”  Messages start pinging into my comms.  Things like You should not have come back here and There’s nothing left here except blood and We won’t let it end this way, we will die free.  When I finally make it to the facility and land,  I find out that a different minor faction unique to the base has taken over operation.  In other words, it would seem, faced with starvation, they staged a coup, and ignited a civil war with the Feds. Incredible.\n\nNo one, certainly not the game, explained these things to me.  These are things that I learned about over the course of my journeys.  The game is absolutely rife with these sorts of details: available, amazing, and yet existing without fanfare or gimmick.  They are simply part of the way the universe works.  By the end of these events I realized I had left my Euro Truck impressions far behind.  In fact, I had become thoroughly immersed.  I felt like I was truly sailing the vastness between the stars, one small part of an enormous world- a world far huger than I will ever be, that exists regardless of my interaction.  This recognition was nothing less than humbling.\n\nThe Truest RP Experience I’ve Had in a Decade\nWhich brings me to my next point. E:D is not a roleplaying in the sense we usually think of these days.  You accrue reputation levels in various ways, but there are no character stats, skill trees, experience points, or anything like that.  And yet this game is easily the most complete RP I’ve had the pleasure of playing in a very long time.  So how can that be? It happens because the game is almost complete indifferent to the player.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but the result is that all meaning has to come from within.  This is no Elder Scrolls, no one is going to tell you you’re here to save the universe.  And to be honest, in the games where someone does say something like that, I don’t feel special.  In fact the RP is largely broken because everyone gets that line. In E:D your decisions are yours alone.  And personally, I have watched CMDR Paklo develop a character organically when faced with the many decisions that are technically easy in game but they are difficult in a subjective moral or ethical sense.  For example, Paklo refuses to participate in the slave trade.  From a practical standpoint slaves are just a number on a spreadsheet in terms of gameplay.  But over time I’ve become invested in Paklo’s path through life- and Paklo will not trade slaves.\n\nThe world is emergent in such a way that these sorts of decisions happen on a much larger scale as well.  I’ll give an example. Having become disillusioned with the Federation I recently pledged my fealty to the Imperial Princess Aisling (aka Space Khaleesi), an outspoken critic of the Empire’s historical condoning of the slave trade.  A group of commanders, of their own volition, have banded together at various spots along trade routes known to move slaves.  From these spots they interdict ships, scan their cargo, and if they are carrying slaves, destroy them.  This activity does not occur at the game’s behest.  It is 100% organic roleplaying at its finest.\n\nSo to conclude on the merits of the game alone, without addressing Frontier’s business ethics- 9.75/10, the highest number rating I have ever given, absolutely essential.\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","June 14, 2015","true","52.7"," 2,476 of 2,833 people (87%) found this review helpful 119 people found this review funny","87","476","2","119","82"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/recommended/359320/","3InkSheep","3InkSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/","218 products in account","Elite Dangerous is a game of massive scope and ambition. The game consists of over 400 billion star systems to explore, each consisting of various planets, space stations and trade stations. Such an enormous game raises concerns that the universe may just be a huge, empty and dull skybox. With Elite Dangerous, this is not the case and with the planned future expansions, this title can only become more enriched with content as time passes.\n\nSo the universe is massive, but what is the objective?\n\nSimply put, whatever you want it to be. Elite Dangerous refuses to hold your hand and push you in a direction, instead, you begin in a hanger, with your trusty Sidewinder spaceship and you simply decide what you want to do. There is a tutorial for the game, although, this acted as more a practice scenerio to learn the buttons and adapt your control schemes opposed to a lesson on how to play the game, but it's an appropriate tone that is continued beyond the tutorial.\n\nUpon starting the game, you'll be seated in your Sidewinder. You have a few options here. You can:\n\n...take a leap of faith, set out into the universe and explore.\n...view the galaxy maps, locate trade routes and set about transporting goods in return for both reputation and currency.\n...upgrade your ship into a war hungry killing mission and set out to become a pirate, destroying other ships and claiming their loot for yourself. This will put a bounty on your head, and stolen goods will require you to sneak the cargo in through secruity to be sold on the black market.\n...set out in search for wanted criminals, destroy them and collect their bounties. Essentially making the universe a safer place.\n...seek out asteroids and collect resources through minning. You can either place these in a refinery or sell them on the market.\n...complete special missions located at bulletin boards at space stations. Each station contains unique missions to complete and often reward sizable rewards.\n\nIt's an open universe, free for you to do as you wish and create your own experiences. No two players will have seen the same worlds nor' have the same stories to tell. This is very much about you making your own objectives and forging a path in this enormous playground.\n\nAfter collecting money, what can I do with it?\n\nTwo options. Purchase additional ships at space stations, each of which will have different stock and models available, or upgrade your existing ship with new weapons, cargo containers, radar sensors, power supplies, thursters, heat sinks and so on. There's a great wealth of custimization here, more of which will come later in future expansions.\n\nWhat are a few of your experiences with the game?\n\nWithin the first few hours of playing the game, I immediately went into exploration mode. After blasting through the universe in hyperdrive mode, I was immediately pulled right in towards a gigantic sun, struggling to pull away from it's force. My heat warnings went off the scale and my components in the ship began to melt. My first ever death was the result of a small burn. Yeah...\n\nHm... How about the time when I detected a strong unidentified signal on my radar, so I swopped down, excited at the possibility of free cargo when I was immediately surrounding by a swarm of giant commander ships, those of which demanded my cargo in exchange for letting me escape with my live and vessal. At this point, my only option was to stall them whilst my hyperdrive charged. Just as they opened fire... VROOOOOM ZAP off I went flying through the galaxies.\n\nPerhaps this one. The first time I located some illegal goods, worth over 50'000. Jackpot! All I had to do now was nurse the cargo home, sneak it past secruity and sell it on the black market. So as I arrived to the station, turning off all my engines and allowing the heat signature to drop before coasting past the secruity, just five feet from the entrance to the dock, I accidently hit the turbo button and flew into the station, flying to the back and into the wall. Yup. Good thing there wasn't anyone around to witness that... except the fifteen or so players currently docking at the time. But we'll just wash over that.\n\nFaults with the game?\n\nThis is just a disclaimer for those who aren't aware at the moment. No, you cannot land on planets or walk around outside your ship at the moment. Both of these were announced as planned DLC back in 2013 and should be expected to arrive sometime in the near future. The details for this will be full 1:1 scale planets with life, cities, mountains, buggies, animals and varied atmospheres. For details on this, you can check out their YouTube channel and/or website for full details on these planned features.\n\nBugs, problems?\n\nJust one from my own experience:\n\nWhilst playing online and flying near huge amounts of players, planets or stars, the frame rate does drop about 60%. I can average about 80FPS with my GTX 760, but occasionally is does drop down to below 40. Minor issue, but worth noting.\n\nDo you recomend the game?\n\nIt depends. If you fully acknowledge the game is entirely designed around the principle of players developing their own experiences and objects; that the game is challenging and requires a sizable amount of time to be invested; then yes, I would recommend it. Ultimately, you have to make your own decisions based on reviews, screenshots and videos.\n\nI personally am not a huge space guru. The only other space-like game I've ever invested time into is Space Engineers, but this game, just days after playing it, ended with me purchasing a joystick, specifically for this game. It's definitely worth the money as it is, and it's only going to get better as more content is released.\n\nPros:\n\nGood graphics\nGood attention to detail\nHuge scope and exploration value\nVarious playstyles and roles\nWell optimized\nPerhaps most important; passionate and dedicated developers\n\nCons:\n\nOccasional frame-drops\nPlanet landing DLC and ability to walk around freely hasn't yet been implemented\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI may have missed a few points out throughout this review, so any questions regarding the game or the content in the review, please feel free to comment in response to this review and I'll respond as soon as possible. :)","April 15, 2015","true","30.6"," 738 of 843 people (88%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","88","738","843","58","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NASAScientist/recommended/359320/","NASAScientist","NASA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NASAScientist/","83 products in account","IntroductionI've played this game a lot. While most people appreciate the great lengths I went through to make a thorough review of the game, a handful remain vexed that I could put in 500 hours in a game and still have a negative review, so I updated this top section to include this explanation. The concept which said handful of people do not seem to understand is that mere hours-played does not reflect the quality of a game experience. In other words, how "good" a game is isn't simply a matter of how many hours were invested — what matters is how much fun you had in those hours. So yes, I played almost 500 hours, but after the first 20 I was already getting bored. The only reason I kept playing is because I really wanted the game to work, I hoped that it would get better/more interesting once I reached the "end-game" in terms of better ships/higher ranks/etc., and also because I found I could grind my way to all those things while watching TV.\n\nThe point is: Simply looking at the money to time ratio is a crude way of measuring the quality of a game. One might think if I played a $60 game for 60 hours, that's $1/hour, not so bad, right? I beg to differ, because again that doesn't take into account the quality of those hours. I would pay $1/hr for a really fun experience or maybe even for just an "ok" experience, but if all 60 of those hours were frustrating, boring, or otherwise not particularly enjoyable, that $1/hr doesn't seem so appealing. Elite: Dangerous — while briefly exciting at first when everything was new — became very boring very fast, and when I quit I felt like I wasted 500 hours of my life. My review is simply to inform people as to what they are really getting into such that I may prevent them from feeling the same way.\n\nThe Art AppealUndoubtedly, the visual presentation of this game is top-notch. The cinematic videos are misleading because you can only do combat from a 1st person view (looking out through the window of your ship's cockpit) and the ships are not nearly that manoeuvrable, but the graphics are in general well-done and the sound is even better. If you sit back for a moment with your eyes closed and listen to the creaking of metal as your ship accelerates, the ever-changing hum of your engines in response to your controls, and — if you're unlucky — the sound of your canopy cracking because you took too much fire in combat... you'll find the sounds really make you feel a part of your ship. The art team really deserves a big pat on the back for their work. Where this game goes astray, unfortunately, is in the game design and that's where all the potential they have from such an aesthetically beautiful game remains unrealized.\n\nGreat Potential... UncapturedThe problems this game has are a mix of two types:\nSome are just not designed well, and need to be completely redesigned.\nSome are designed well in principle but are underdeveloped/poorly implemented.Let's look at an example of the latter type first: As you may know, vast portions of this game are procedurally generated[en.wikipedia.org]. This is totally fine, in fact I strongly support procedural generation in games. The problem is that their algorithms for this (that generate the content) are woefully underdeveloped. Consider the mission system: You'll go to a planet and some missions are randomly generated for you. They may have a format like: "Pick up <random market item> from <randomly selected nearby planet> and return for <random number of credits within a range based on item cost>." Sometimes you get reputation instead of credits, and the chosen mission items are not wholly random (it's based on what that planet needs), etc., but you get the point. The problem is the system just does not have enough variety to it. You'll soon recognize a repeating pattern of 5 or so types of missions that you have to grind over and over to rank up. Not only is it extremely repetitive, but the rewards are almost completely useless: The missions that involve transporting goods will give you around 1000-50,000 credits depending on the product and will take you ~15m to do. The "Kill X NPC ship" missions will give you around 150,000 credits, but they can easily take 30m to an hour. For perspective, a half-decent trader can easily earn 6,000,000 credits in an hour. To top it all off, getting reputation in itself has almost no purpose other than to unlock a few ships which aren't any better than ships which can be obtained without rank. In fact the only reason people obtain them is because they enjoy how they look. But for everyone else there is no point in ranking up, and thus no point in doing missions at all since there is nothing else worthwhile to gain, even with the Powerlay changes. To be clear, the design is fine in principle but it is not well-executed: missions need more diversity and more rewards — you need to give players a reason for doing them.\n\nAn example for the first type of problem (something just plainly not designed well) is the play modes: Open (online multiplayer), Solo (online singleplayer), and Private (online singleplayer with friends). If you thought it was challenging enough to encounter people in the vast reaches of space by itself, trying doing so when at least half of all players are playing solo mode. Don't get me wrong, having a Solo mode is fine (in fact many people wanted an offline singleplayer which I totally support), but the ability to swap between modes at will creates a system where the majority of players stay in solo to avoid the risks, making Open play seemingly devoid of life, and all the while this game is marketed as an "MMO". Very misleading... this game is no more an MMO than Diablo 3 is an MMO.\n\nThese are just a taste of some of the issues with this game. In previous versions of this review, I wrote out a fairly exhaustive list but character limits prevent me from rewriting it here, so a link to a picture of them will have to suffice: Detailed list[i.imgur.com]\n\nSo it's a bit rusty now, but what about later?As many other reviewers have echoed, this game is a broken sandbox that lacks toys. Normally, there'd be nothing wrong with that as long as there were plans to improve the game with time. I'm sure the designers do plan to fix some things and add content. However, I honestly don't think the game will get significantly better because it appears that the designers are mostly satisfied with how the game has turned out. Those design decisions which I think need improving, the detailed list above — the developers seem totally fine with many of them, in fact they seem to think it's what most players want. Indeed, the primary reason I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone is that after two months of trying to get actively involved with the community it appears this game is essentially being designed by one or two people at the top who have little to no interest (or experience) with what would make their game most successful. Rather, it seems they follow their own desires even if they go counter to what the playerbase wants or what would be best for their company (usually the two go hand-in-hand). There's no player polls, little forum engagement... from the current designs and what little interaction they have with the community, it seems clear that this game is their child — the latest in a historied franchise stretching back to the 80s — and they are designing it the way they want, which may or may not be in the best interest of the fans.\n\nIt is for these reasons I feel the game is unlikely to ever shape up into something that will draw a substantial long-term following and why I cannot in good faith recommend this game.","May 23, 2015","false","493.5"," 6,606 of 8,116 people (81%) found this review helpful 371 people found this review funny","81","606","8","371","278"

Man, it was a long way out. But I persevered. Hopped to Docking points to refuel, planned my route carefully. I was going to make it.\n\nI jumped into the sector and for once was not hurtling towards the planet at 'ohmygod' miles an hour and the clock was ticking. Two minutes to pay day.

How did you get started?"\n\n"Well, believe it or not my first job was doing delivery runs."\n\n"Really? That must have been tedious."\n\n"It was. And the pay was terrible. You'd accept a mission in one star system and do nothing but hop from star system to star system for an hour or more before accepting your tiny payment.\n\n"Sounds pretty bad."\n\n"Yeah. I only did that for a short time before I got into smuggling."\n\n"Oh, cool. Sneaking into heavily armed facilities with illegal cargo? That sort of thing?"\n\n"Exactly. Although you only do the sneaking at the end bit of your journey. The rest of it was just as dull as the deliveries. And even the sneaking was only fun the first few times. After that it became pretty routine. The pay was a lot better, though."\n\n"So how did you become a famous bounty hunter?"\n\n"I'm afraid the stories are exaggerated. I took my first contract at my local station. It told me to fly to a nearby star and hunt down a notorious pirate."\n\n"Did you get him?"\n\n"No. I showed up at the star and he wasn't there. I flew around scanning promising signals, but each one turned out to be a dud. To make it worse, it took about 10 minutes to fly between each signal and there wasn't much to do in the meantime. After a few hours of this, the contract expired."\n\n"That's too bad."\n\n"Yeah, the next few contracts turned out the same so at that point I gave up, bought a warrant scanner, and decided to go freelance."\n\n"What does that mean?"\n\n"Well, it means you sit in one place next to a navigation beacon or resource extraction point, and hope to catch pirates if they show up."\n\n"Neat. How many did you catch?"\n\n"None. It took me about an hour to pick up the scanner and fly to a promising system. Then I waited around for a few hours scanning ships but no pirates showed up. Well, a couple did... but none of them came out of supercruise. After a few nights of this, I decided to dump the stupid scanner into the sun. When I got home, I received a strange message. Someone wanted to hire me to carry some mystery cargo to a certain sector and wait for further instructions."\n\n"Did you take the job?"\n\n"Of course! It seemed like the first interesting thing that had happened to me as a space commander. Yeah, I accepted the job and headed out to the sector they named. Took a lot of time to get there. Then I started waiting for my contact."\n\n"Who was it?"\n\n"I dunno. He never showed. I waited around for a couple hours and eventually the mission expired. I did get to fight some pirates, ironically. It seems like they really wanted that cargo, whatever it was. They should have just asked.

So time to add my opinion of this game for what its worth.\n\nI originally went into Elite on the viewpoint that despite what the 400+ hour people said it must have kept them at least entertained for 400 hours for that opinion. Nothing really could be farther from the truth anything further than 100 hours and you will find that sitting in the park watching the ducks is far more entertaining.\n\nTrue the game starts of really promising it gives you a lot of eyecandy (that hud is just beautiful in the extremes), some missions at the base go earn some credits your way approach. And at the start this goes all very nicely. Within a few hours you have probably dotted your way up a few ships. Then the game halts very abruptly.\n\nFor once you are in the midgame. The amount of credits needed to go up to the next level of combat ship or trader ship (I will attack explorer in a bit) is so much that you have to pretty much do rinse and repeat for what seems like an eternity to get anywhere else new. There are many people including myself who have done trade routes while watching a movie or something if that is a necessity then the game has failed to be engaging on that premise alone. Combat provides entertainment for a few minutes or so then the game just feels like any $5 arcade shooter space game.\n\nOn to exploration I kept this one separate because as soon as you get an Asp (mid-game)  or a kitted down Hauler (early game) you are pretty much good to go... absolutely nowhere. This game boasts an exploration system, that does absolutely nothing. The best part of the system I must admit is getting your pilots name forever locked in the universe map... I guess thats cool... perhaps... but lets face it nothing is new in this game at all. By the time you leave occupied territory you have seen most star types and planet types to be seen. The only goal really of exploration is to spend all your time trying to get to the black hole Sagittarius B. Nothing is going to wow you and give you a "no man has gone before" feeling. You are not going to encounter new lifeforms and civilisations as they simply do not exist, not even humans. Explorers don't need weapons as there are not even pirates past a certain point. You go to a planet hold you scanner button planet scanned move on. It is as dry as it sounds that duck pond is even more inviting.\n\nEven "exploring" the explored space yields little in interest. All the base types are of identical design moreorless. To the point one of my most amazing discoveries was finding a base that was an orangey colour instead of the usual metal grey. And for all I know that may have just been my GPU getting distracted from the boredom of rendering the same thing over and over again.\n\nDo I regret my purchase no not really. Its got a lot of potential and I know the devs may throw new things out. But Steam asks whether I would recommend it to others like in a purchase sense. No I could not thats why it gets a thumbs down.\n\nThe final point really aswell is while Dangerous could go somewhere, it feels very beta like... it has a core and wanted layers but got none before release. I have seen this far to many times with these big projects. Both from indies and big devlopers. Which the Elite devs have already decided on going for this Horizons project at the end of the year. Which in past experiences very rarely does a dev company acheive perfect synergy updating its older products while developing its new ones. While they promise new features for Dangerous I doubt there will be anything that will throw this downvote to an up.\n\nUpdate: While I am not reviewing Horizons as I do not own it. My lastpoint made in this review about Dangerous going somewhere but probably being moreorless left in the state it is at. Have not played recently but I am getting a lot of comments confirming this is still true, this Horizons release seems to have made Dangerous updates less frequent as stated would happen. Also seems pretty much from what I have heard (but I would read ther reviews on that page as I have no first hand of it) Horizons is a similar hollow shell state as Dangerous was released in. Now that game is early access still so it could be fleshed out but I ain't based on this experience going to hold my breath that this is not another $60 chocolate surprise egg with disappointing chocolate on the outside disappointing toy on the inside.\n\nDue to a lot of quite non productive comments I have gotten recently I will have to add this. I will delete comments based on but not necessarily exclusive to these criteria.\n\nObvious fanboyism with no mertiable argument - "You shouldn't have bought a space sim then"\nREASON: I love space sims I am the freakin fanboy of space sims. The original Elite, Wing Commander, Freelancer, X3 played them all to death still do. I have gone back to my witrhout hyberbole 5000th hour of Freelancer recently. So don't tell me I don't enjoy space sims and should nto have bought one.\n\nThe Played too many hours to have a negative opinion - "You have played 130 hours and wrote a negative review you idiot."\nREASON: I never understand these types of comment. They are either you havn't played enough or you have played too much. Again its general fanboyism I criticised your game and in reality no matter at which point I gave a negative review you would have used this argument. Its not even constructive especially when most people who post this don't give me the reason I should play more or should have realised sooner. In my opinion 100+ hours is a really great time to review a space sim on its merits or lack of. If it was a first person shooter with 10 hours of gameplay yeah maybe 100 hours may be a bit of an odd playtime for a negative review.\n\nDon't get me wrong I ain't just deleting posts that disagree with the review. There are comments here that disagree with me and they stay because while I do not agree with many of them they at least bothered to give a constructive counterpoint. But unless you have a counterpoint. Then thumbs down the review. I ain't dealing with fanboyism that is constructed in the same ettiquette I would expect at a kindergarten hurling insults and the such. We are all here for our love of games and our opinions may differ.

[and apparently full of repetition and devoid of content]\n\nThere is so much potential in this game that it pains me to write this, but as I see it consistently on the front page of the top sellers list, I think it's important to tell you what this game is and what it is not. The defenders of the game will tell you that you should have researched the game before buying it, or that in this game you are not the center of the universe. Both are true; however, there is something else to note:\n\nThis is pretty much an early access title without labeling it one selling at a AAA price.\n\nBefore I dive in, I first just want to say the graphics are breathtaking, and the actual flight mechanics are rather enticing. This leads me to reiterate that it is truly a game with a lot of potential. Currently there are really three main things you can do in the game: trade, bounty hunting, and exploration. There is also pirating, which is essentially interdicting (pulling a ship out of intra-solar system warp), and using either little robots or shooting at the target until they drop their cargo, which you scoop up and go sell at a black market.\n\nTrade is the purchasing of goods from one station at a lower price and truck them somewhere else to sell at a higher price. Does this affect the in game economy in any meaningful way? No. Can you exhaust the production of one station and create a shortage? No. Can supplying a station of a faction you like have any meaningful outcome? No. The in game economy is stagnant, and the goods are meaningless. In theory, the idea behind trade is that you are offering your services to benefit a faction of some kind, and currently this has no meaningful outcome...perhaps in the future it may.\n\nBounty Hunting is shooting at a ship that's wanted. They have a price tag on their head and you shoot them and go collect the bounty. It can be lucrative, but it can also be incredibly repetitive, just like trading. You are usually shooting at NPC ships because you will rarely, if ever, see another player even in online mode because of the sheer size of the game you are playing in, unless you go to an area known for having players.\n\nExploration is going outside of known space in the galaxy map and clicking buttons and scanning down planets, stars, and the like. The galaxy, a 1:1 ratio of the Milky Way is enormous with over 400 billion systems. Sounds cool right? It is, at least in the beginning. Eventually you will begin to realize that scanning is, again, repetitive (seeing a pattern here?) and the actual process itself seems to have no value what so ever other than getting your name attached to a celestial object and selling the data for credits.\n\nI already explained pirating, let me discuss PVP briefly. PVP rarely occurs because of the immensity of the galaxy map outside of known areas, but even in known areas, you can successfully just disconnect from the game before your ship is blown up and/or just not participate in the open play aspect and have no fear of another player what so ever. If you thought solo PVP in Eve Online was bad, e.g. flying around for hours trying to find an evenly matched opponent to test you skills on, try flying around for days and not seeing a single soul.\n\nWhat else? The game promises a lot. The next expansion, powerplay, promises to revamp the horrendous in-station missions that pay you nothing and are incredibly obnoxious as most of them require you to fly out and ping down 'unidentified signals' that randomly spawn and investigate, hope, and pray that it may contain something of value to help you complete your mission. Most of the time they have nothing to do with your mission and you get to go back into the solar system warp view and crack on until the next one. This yields you a pithy sum and your time is effectively wasted as you could have blown up one or two ships and received the same credit amount in currency. Powerplay could improve this immensely, but this remains to be seen.\n\nI could go on and on, but the problem with this game is simply this: the actuality of game content has yet to catch up even a fraction to the potentiality of what is there [and what they promise will be there]. If you don't mind grinding in the least bit, you will get a lot of time out of this game and if you like the genre, you should pick it up. If you don't mind a little grinding here and there, but want it to mean something, you will be disappointed, as I am, and finally, if you don't like grinding at all, you will probably loathe the game.\n\nSo what's my recommendation? Wait a year, yes...a year, for both a sale and numerous updates to provide you with the tools to play in the sandbox. This game should have been marked as EARLY ACCESS. This should give you a better idea of how much content there is. Instead, they chose to sell it as a finished game with a AAA price tag, which, I think, is disingenuous. Sure you can play it and have fun in the beginning, but unless you really enjoy the grind, you will quickly grow bored and tuck it in your hidden folder where it belongs (at least for now).","May 13, 2015","false","88.9"," 2,580 of 3,366 people (77%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","77","580","3","81","87"

From trading in an Adder, to running drugs and guns between systems in a Cobra, to that revelatory moment when I took my beloved Asp deep into the Pleiades and saw my first black hole up-close, there have been some fantastic moments in this game.\n\nHowever, once you've smuggled enough weapons to fund the next 20 years of wars, and taken your ship tens of thousands of light years deep into the galactic core, you start to realize how empty this galaxy is. It's a beautiful galaxy, but a lifeless one. The thrill of seeing your first black hole, or stumbling on a new type of exotic star, or dropping out of supercruise to surf the debris rings around a Jovian, can't overcome the vast emptiness of Elite's galaxy.\n\nThe complaint that this game is lacking content comes up so often because it's irrefutably true. There are only two general designs for starbases. Every starbase in the game has the same exact sign, scuffed in the same exact places, in every docking port.\n\nOnce you get beyond human space, you will never, ever be surprised by anything you find, you will never be in danger, and you will never encounter anything but planets, stars and astroid belts. There are no comet swarms, no dynamic phenomena, no stars going nova, This is a science fiction game, but there are no derelict starships, no long-abandoned starbases built by alien civilizations, no distant planets in far-flung corners of the galaxy with ruins suggestinig intelligent life, no Dyson spheres, no inscrutable megastructures, no ringworlds, no artilects or machine consciousnesses, no nanoswarms, no artifacts.\n\nThere's that famous J.B.S. Haldane quote that's often quoted in discussions about science fiction: "Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine."\n\nBut not Elite's universe. Elite's galaxy is a lonely, lifeless place where you will never be surprised by anything.\n\nRegarding the content, as other reviewers have pointed out, this is essentially a late stage alpha/early beta that needs a lot more content to help flesh it out. But instead of acknowledging how light the game is on content, the developers are releasing new content as expansions, condescendingly calling those expansions "Early Access," and using a pricing scheme that inexplicably punishes players who already have the base game.\n\nSo we've got devs selling a beta (at best), charging full price for unfinished "expansions" and calling them "Early Access" expansions to make up for the fact that the content expansions are lacking in content. It's essentially pre-ordering DLC for a game that isn't even close to being finished.\n\nAnd what do the expansions give us? The much-heralded Horizons gives us procedurally generated, airless rock worlds and buggies. That's it. If you were hoping for waterworlds, or atmospheric worlds with teeming jungles, or bizarre alien landscapes, you'll be sorely disappointed, because all you'll get is rock with a few random outposts thrown in for good measure.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautiful visuals\n- Sleek ships that all have different, realistic-looking cockpits\n- Probably the best representation of space as it truly is, in any game to date\n- Support for Oculus Rift\n- Stunning views, like seeing starlight bent by a black hole's gravitational lensing, or a blue star bathing your cockpit in light\n- The two existing starbase models are both visually stunning\n- The transition between supercruise (multitudes of light speed) and standard cruise in or between star systems feels seamless and realistic\n\nCons:\n\n- A galaxy completely devoid of life or anything interesting\n- Strangely, the planet textures are not HD\n- Only two models of starbases, with very little variety in layout\n- Most occupations boil down to grind, grind, grind. Traders, bounty hunters and smugglers will grind their days away.\n- Still no simple support for easily switching UI colors\n- Not a hint of anything mysterious or even remnants of other intelligent civilizations\n- No megastructures, derelict ships, Dyson spheres, ringworlds or other commonly hypothesized signs of alien civilizations\n- No dynamic events in solar systems, no comet swarms, no stars going nova or young systems forming\n- Ridiculous practice of labeling expansions as "Early Access" and forcing players to re-purchase the base game in order to buy the expansion\n- Even the expansions are extremely light on content, and include things that should have been in the base game\n\n\n","December 30, 2015","false","143.0"," 875 of 1,132 people (77%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","77","875","1","26","61"

I felt somewhat obliged to write a review.\n\nFirst off, quit steam and go to https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/ because every thumbs up review gets downvoted making steam reviews pretty worthless. It's not even a way to say "hey, i like your review, here, have an upvote!" no, it's more like: "oh you like the game? well screw you then!" that just depresses me.\n\nIf you're still here, (seriously, go to reddit) I'll tell some things why i spend at least 1.5 hours a day in this 'game'.\n\nYou get a starter ship, the sidewinder. and 1.000 credits (heard some other things on the starter kit, but I'll discuss how things went when i started.) and then... whatever your heart desires. (would advise you to go away from the starter area, some folks seem to like it killing people in about 2-3 shots and brag about it, don't ask why, that's beyond me. Fortunately there's a player group called Adle's Armada to defend new players.) Is someone going to hold my hand? No. you're on your own. (or ask someone in local chat, mostly you get helped out)\n\nI spend some good 5 hours to have a control configuration that pleases me mostly. (still not all too happy about some functions) after that you'll spend quite some time getting a better ship (missions, bounty hunting, trading... to name a few most people do early on) JUST DON'T MAKE IT A RACE TO THE BIGGEST, BADDEST looking ship (anaconda, imperial cutter, federal corvette) after all that time i don't even have those. and tell you what, the people who have a 'conda in the first 3 weeks they own the game, can be found easily: click on "show negative reviews only". Really, play for fun, not for credits.\n\nThere still are things that need work (like combat logging, reducing instancing problems, ...) overall it's a great game, very complex. A real challenge to master well.\n\nGrindy? I don't really seem to have a problem with it. make up achievable goals in your near future, like: "right, 80k credits for an adder, then I'll ENJOY some trading, with the money that comes WITH it I'll save up to buy a decent looking bounty hunter and get out of imperial space to work on utopia.\n\nLack of content. euhm... sure... I guess. But i make my own content so that's again no issue for me.\n\nOne of the biggest gems about this game is the community, a mature one. I meet more people married and/or have kids than I find 12 year olds whining about whatever negative comes to mind... A portion of those people's kids have kids! A community that helps others out, one that inspires others through role-play.\n\nIf you have questions for me, please do ask.\n\nSafe travels sailors!\n\nCmdr 0PPR3550R\n\nEdit 1: Grammar corrections, cmdr name\nEdit 2: Changed "I seem don't really have..." to "I don't really seem to have..."","April 24","true","080.7"," 423 of 530 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","423","530","14","57"

Most people who don't recomend say that the game is "Boring," "Grindy," etc. It can be, if you make it that way. E:D will be how you play it. There is no set story, there is no hand-holding (unless a buddy of your's is willing to do that, but the game sure won't), the game simply tells you: "Here's a loaned Sidewinder and 1,000 credits. Do the rest yourself." That's it. All the rest is by yourself. If you want to rush the biggest ship, go right on ahead. Fair warining: You will get incrediably bored, incrediably fast. Instead, have fun.\n\nFind something you like doing. If you like the constant rush of combat, try becoming a Mercenary, fighting for one (or maybe both) sides in Conflict Zones, or by wiping the scum of pirates clean from the void we call space, or perhaps become a pirate yourself. Maybe you will find your calling in the rather tranquill profession of mining (sit back, start playing some music, and enjoy), maybe you can find some enjoyment in trading (kudos to you if you do, can't stand it myself, lol), or try treking out into the vastness of our Milky Way Galaxy, finding planets that you can finialy and rightfuly write "Lol, first" on. Theres so much to do. And if you get bored of one thing, try something else.\n\nThe point is this:\n\nDon't play to win. Play to have fun. Find what you like, and if you get bored, try something else.\nHope this was some help to you who are trying to decide, but if your still wondering, look up some gameplay videos on youtube. Watch some of Scott Manley's videos, Obsidion Ant's, or someone elses, theres quite a few out there.\n\nSee ya out there, CMDRs\n\n-CMDR Dalgin\n\no7","November 20, 2015","true","162.7"," 1,568 of 2,077 people (75%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","75","568","2","63","87"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikindred/recommended/359320/","ikindred","iKindred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikindred/","1133 products in account","(!) This review might change as I get to know more about the game. It was originally written after 30 hours of gameplay.\n\nBottomline:\nAn enjoyable experience clouded by the lack of depth. If EVE and ED had a baby It would be the best game of all times. Get it, but there's no reason to pay full price.\n\nThe Good:\nAwesome Experience: The universe of ED is astonishing. I have to say I never saw anything like this and even after spending several hours I can't get enough of it. With the right lightning and volume in the room you get a level of immersion that I personally never thought It could be possible.\n\nLevel of detail: Everything looks amazing and you keep finding details even after spending several hours in the game. It's incredible.\n\nNo micro transactions: At this moment the game has no micro transactions of any kind. Of course If you feel generous there are some really cool skins for your ships you can get for a few bucks, but that's it.\nBut be warned that the developer plans to release more content for the game and that they are going to charge for it. We'll have to wait and see what It is, how much It costs and if It's worth it or not.\n\nGadget support: I literally plugged my x52 + TrackIR 5 and everything worked out of the box without any effort. I cannot imagine how epic this game would be with an Oculus (which is supported).\n\nGreat community content: If you get to judge a game by the amount (and quality) of content you find when you need help, I think ED would get a medal for sure. From tools, articles and guides to blog posts and videos. Just Google It and you'll see what I mean.\nThere's even an initiative to make market data available outside the game so that it can be used by the tools made by the community.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe tutorials: I picked a thing or two from them but in general they are not enough and to make up for this I had to spent several hours watching Youtube videos and reading articles. I wish they put more and better tutorials as the learning curve is really steep at first and some people might feel discouraged or bored before getting to appreciate the game.\n\nNo endgame in sight: I'm hooked right now as I'm trying to get the high-end ships and modules but I can't help thinking that's not going to take more than a bunch of more hours and the grinding gets repetitive fast. I'm uncertain about how much is left to keep me going once I reach the point when there's nothing else to do with credits.\n\nLack of content: For this price tag I would expect to be overwhelmed with stuff to do. But I don't think this is the case. You can make money to buy ships and modules, you can explore, you can bounty hunt or you can become a pirate yourself, and I think that's about it. No story mode, no goals, no clans.\n\nClosed data: The developer didn't provide a way for the community to access the game data from outside. It's suprising they didn't think about this given the public that follows this particular genre.\n\nLack of the social factor: Nowadays there's no excuse for not having support for clans/guilds/corporations in an MMO. Groups are great if you get to play with the same people every day but I don't know if this applies to everyone.\n\nMissing features: There are certain features that you would expect from a game of this caliber. Here are a few things that I thought about during my time playing ED:\nThere should be at least a few safe systems for newcomers to learn how to play.\nYou cannot purchase stations, build stuff in space or do things that truly leave a mark in the universe.\nYou cannot transfer cargo between your ships or with other players.\nYou cannot store cargo or you hard earned exploration data.\nYou cannot transport ships unless you are driving it.\nThere's no simple way to tell which systems you previously visited.\nYou cannot tag, mark or take notes about systems you intend to go back to.\nThere is no way to tell what's inside asteroids, you have to go one by one sampling. A sensor would be nice!\nDepleted asteroids stick around doing nothing more than getting on the way.\nThere is no way to help you collect what you mine, you have to pick up every single rock using a cargo scoop. A tractor beam would be nice!\nThe stuff you mine disappears after a few minutes. So you better hurry to pick it up before It's gone.\nThe sensors range cannot be limited beyond a certain point.\nYou cannot rename your pilot without losing everything. Players with a clean slate should have the chance to rename their profiles.\nAnd many more to come...Some of this might be planed for a future release or might even be in development right now. So please go to the ED forums and do some research if you want to be sure.","April 4, 2015","false","39.9"," 1,103 of 1,483 people (74%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","74","103","1","45","65"

I watched some gameplay videos and thought it looked amazing so I bought it and I absolutely adore it. Easily one of the top 3 PC games released this year in my opinion, along with Pillars of Eternity and GTA V.\n\nThe "MMO" tag is a little misleading, it's not really an MMO. There are three modes of play; Solo (where the world is populated by AI's), Open (where the world is populated by AI's and other players) and Private (where you and specific friends play together). The game itself is mind-bogglingly enormous, with 400 billion star systems. If you wanted to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other it would literally take you days or even weeks (I'm not sure, I've never tried). It's a sandbox; there's no story, you simply do whatever you want to do, be it exploring the vast amount of solar systems and finding cool stuff like giant (or tiny) stars, black holes, interesting sequences of planets and so on, or trading (which is mind numbingly boring, as in any game, but makes a hell of a lot of money), bounty hunting which is a lot of fun and will net you a respectable amount of cash, or being a dirty pirate and criminal.\n\nFrontier will be adding all kinds of new features to the game in the future, such as the ability to land on planets, walk in stations, more ships and I even hear they'll be adding alien races. If you're the kind of gamer that enjoys games that don't hold your hand and require to put a little work in before you start getting something back out, and if you enjoy flight sims (especially space sims) then I'd say this is a game for you. If you're from the spoiled brat Call of Duty generation and anything more complicated than pointing your gun with the mouse and clicking the left mouse button to fire is too much information for your brain to process then I wouldn't recommend it at all. It can be quite complicated at times and I've put around 50 hours in to it so far and I still make mistakes and learn new stuff every day.","April 21, 2015","true","170.8"," 312 of 398 people (78%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","78","312","398","29","6"

There's a very clear pattern here. 0hrs - 50hrs are negative, 50-200 are positive, and 200+ are negative. I want to say I completely agree with these reviews, I hated the game until I hit 30 hours, and I see how there isn't enough content for 200+ hours. (I'll try to keep this as short as possible.)\n\nFor starters, this game appeals to a VERY small amount of people. You have to be OBSESSED with sci-fi, you have to be okay with grinding, and you have to be okay with sitting around doing nothing for a few mins while youre traveling.\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way, the learning curve for this game is very very steep. You will be dying a LOT when you begin the game, and you won't really find much to do when you first start off. This is why the 0-50hr reviews are mostly negative. However, watching videos and getting help from experienced people certainly helps a bunch.\n\nAfter you start to understand how the game works and the credits start rolling in, that's where the game truly shines. This golden 10 hour period when things finally click is the best time in the game. It's where you have so many choices and so many things to do that it becomes overwhelming. The 50-150/200hr is where you'll have the most fun.\n\nSo to sum it all up, if you LOVE space and sci-fi, if you're okay with a bit of a grind, and if you're okay with nothing happening for a while as you travel, you'll love this game. It's essentially a walking simulator in space with lots of combat, trading, exploration, and politics.\n\nIf you're not looking for anything that'll last you too too long (maybe 100-200 hours) definitley pick this game up ASAP. Updates are still rolling in. See you in space, pilots!\n\n","May 15","true","69.1"," 292 of 380 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","292","380","13","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhettorical/recommended/359320/","Rhettorical","Rhettorical","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhettorical/","156 products in account","I really want to love this game, I really do. Sadly, the devs have caused me to never want to play again. Let me explain the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- A vast galaxy to explore. I estimated that in an exploration-fit ship, you'd be able to reach the other side of the galaxy in about 95 hours. That's not including the return trip, and that's assuming you don't stop to scan anything along the way.\n- A robust combat system. I'm not sure how you can really get more robust than flying around and shooting things with fixed or gimballed lasers or cannons or rails or plasma accelerators, or homing and dumb-fire missiles, launching chaff, etc.\n- Beautiful graphics. This game looks astonishingly good. You certainly won't forget your first black hole or neutron star.\n- Simplified flight model. It's not 100% realistic, but that makes for a more approachable flight model. The ships fly like jets in Battlefield, if a bit more responsive.\n\nNeutral:\n- Lots of frontloaded content. Your first 20-40 hours will be fantastic. Around 30 hours, you'll start to notice content slowing down. Around 40, things start looking familiar. At 50 hours, everything looked the same to me.\n- Ship customization. There isn't a lot of reason to try to come up with a clever build, since the time you waste min/maxing your build equates to about 2.3561 more seconds in combat or 8.65 seconds shaved off your trade route. It's fun to customize, but ultimately pretty pointless.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of depth. People will argue that if you got 50 hours of fun, you got your money's worth, but I find that to be a really dumb argument. This type of game is designed to be fun for hundreds of hours, yet I found myself struggling to find reasons to play after 70 hours, and finally gave up at 100. There just isn't a lot of compelling things to do. It's where the frontloaded content really starts to be a problem.\n- Dev response. The devs tend to add things to the game for the sole purpose of checking off a box, like "They want social interaction? Let's add the ability to group up to 4 people at once!" The community wanted guilds, chat channels, etc, and all we got was the ability to add a small number of people in a group at once, provided you're in the same instance. Which reminds me...\n- Instancing and the P2P model. This is what really kills this as a multiplayer game. Let's say you're trying to track down another player. You find him, interdict him, and start shooting. He activates his warp drive and heads off to the next system over. You follow him, but when you drop into the system... he's not there. You know he has to be there, he's not in the previous system, and this is the only system close enough to warp to. So where is he? Welcome to instancing.\n- Solo/Private Group play. Not that it exists (though the fact that Solo is not offline is bothersome), but that it affects Open play (multiplayer). There's a background simulation that affects the landscape of the galaxy (PowerPlay is one such system). This is influenced by player interaction. You could work together with people in Open, aligned to the same faction, to flip a system to another power's control. But, you can also do this in Solo or Private Group play as well. This means that you can successfully complete objectives without worrying about players attempting to stop you.\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is that the devs seem to have a grand vision of what they want their game to look like, and are willing to pursue that wholeheartedly at the expense of the players. They do not listen to criticisms, and the community itself is absolutely terrible when it comes to accepting critiques of the game.\n\nThe upcoming $60 "expansion", which is really just a Season Pass that grants access to all of the updates to be released in 2016, along with the announcement of additional "expansions", also likely $60, is what finally killed it for me.\n\nBut, if flying around in space is what you want, and you're not willing to wait for No Man's Sky or Star Citizen... I guess it's a good game. For $45, I'd say it's worth it. Just know that you can get more depth by spending $20 on a kiddie pool at your local department store.","August 27, 2015","false","103.4"," 1,991 of 2,767 people (72%) found this review helpful 244 people found this review funny","72","991","2","244","64"

The sequel to David Braben's seminal space sim classic is finally here, and it's fantastic! Having been an early alpha backer with several dozen hours of flight time logged, I thought I'd give my two cents for those considering buying.\n\nAfter years (decades!) of waiting, the day that fans never thought they'd see has finally arrived, we have a new Elite game that lives up to the promise of the 1984 original but with all the added graphics and gameplay that modern technology affords us. Elite Dangerous successfully recaptures the spirit of the 1984 original while adding the enhancements of the pantheon of great space sims both big and small that have been released in recent years, from big names like Wing Commander: Privateer and the X Series, and recent indie games like Paragon and Rodina.\n\nSo, what is there to game? Strapped into a shiny new ship the player is thrust into a truly massive procedural galaxy, able to hunt, mine and explore, facing off against or working with both other players and the A.I., striving to upgrade their ship with awesome new weapons or buy their way into more powerful craft. All in all it's an enthralling experience, and the meat of the game, from the beautful graphics and wonderful sound effects and music, to the silky smooth handling and personality of the ships and weapons comes together beautifully.\n\nThere are still kinks to be worked out of course, some areas of the gameplay seem like they still need to be fleshed out, and there are of course still bugs, but the devs seem to be doing a bang-up job of fixing the old girl up, and I have faith in their ability to continue to do so.\n\nTL;DR; Awesome game Y/N?

Mostly shame, self-loathing and guilt. But at least that's something.\n\nI went psycho. Here's why.\n\nI backed this game at Premium Beta (only got the Steam key today to leave this review). I spent the first six months of ED grinding my way up as a trader/courier. When I finally got into a Type 6, I had nearly lost my mind. Trading consists of looking at spreadsheets and then spending 95% of your time lining up dots with crosshairs. Once in a blue moon, you're interdicted and can almost instantly escape.\n\nBut during that time they introduced the Vulture and I failed to notice. So about a month ago I suddenly realised I could have had the best fighter in the game for some time. Picked one up and kitted it out to B/C grade. Went to a combat zone. Earned more in a week (maybe 8 hours of play) than I did in the previous eight months, tripling my net assets in that time.\n\nThe CZs and RESs are fun for a few hours. But the opponents are exactly the same with exactly the same tactics everywhere across thousands of light years of space. It takes you minutes to develop a strategy against each opponent and then you've understood all there is to know about NPC combat, forever, everywhere. The Vulture is the best fighter class ship in the game but it costs less than an Asp, the first large ship, so it's effectively placed right at the beginning of "mid-game". With just two heavy pulse lasers, you can take out any other NPC ship individually, even large-class Elite ships worth a hundred times as much hardware-wise, and most NPC wings as well. The only way to lose is to overwhelming numbers of high-level NPCs or to other players, and by "lose" I mean "retreat and then come straight back". It becomes incredibly boring with surprising rapidity.\n\nThere was literally nothing left to do. I tried Powerplay - exactly the same play with no tangible rewards beyond some nonsense about "narrative". I tried exploring - seriously, I would rather play solitaire than waste my life on that nonsense. I've done many months of trading and it's just grind to me now. I've done every mission type.\n\nEverything is just grind. Half of the grind is naked, exposed to view: the other half is barely hidden under a tissue of metagaming. Kill ten rats. Tell Bob I love him. I need a fish, go and buy one for me in the shop down the road. Go to another place and then come back and tell me you've been there. Rinse and repeat like a laundromat staffed by zombies.\n\nSo I went psycho, in a final attempt to experience any kind of emotion at all.\n\nI went to Eravate, noob town. My mission was to kill as many other players as possible. I racked up about 200k of bounty in about four hours of play, all from deaths and attacks.\n\nAnd it was so easy. I literally laughed out loud at how easy it was.\n\nFor the first half, I "advertised" my presence in the system as a "psycho". I warned players I was coming after them by crooning their names and giggling. I did pseudo-Gollum impressions. I stopped in the middle of fights to type out Wham! and Kajagoogoo lyrics.\n\nNo other victims spoke. The sum total of words uttered by all of the other commanders I met and attacked over four hours were "wtf" and "stop". That's indicative of the level of social interaction in this game. For the second half of my rampage I stopped bothering to talk and just killed.\n\nThe single time I died was to an outpost's turrets, when I started attacking people within the no-fire zone as they were landing. This had the side-effect of wiping my bounty. The cost of rebuy was a little over 500k. I'd earned nearly that much that from "accidentally" taking out players and NPCs with bounties during that time. Net loss to me for this psycho rampage: pretty much zero. Net loss to others: potentially hours of play wiped out on a stranger's whim, multiplied by at least thirty, in just a couple of casual sessions. Lasting reputation effect: zero.\n\nThe system, in the heart of some cardboard cut-out Power's space, did almost nothing to stop me. About once every 20 minutes I'd be interdicted by system security. Usually it was a single Eagle or Viper. Hilariously, it was once a single Harmless unshielded Eagle. That's right folks: the most advanced civilisation in the galaxy, with a population of trillions, is sending completely inexperienced lone rookies to intercept an Expert criminal tooling about in the most powerful fighter in the game right in the heart of their territory where people who bought the game yesterday are spawned. Police interdiction is as much of a barrier to griefing as a damp cardboard box.\n\nEravate also provides ample facilities for psychopaths, despite its location in the heart of civilisation. It has a number of outputs with repair and re-arming facilities. None of them are policed. You can land, repair, and then harrass its customers just a minute's sub-FTL flight away, completely unopposed. The government literally helps wanted criminals create a toxic environment.\n\nFor the first and last time, I "blazed my own path". It was the path of an idiot, and it was the only way to get my money's worth. I've finished the game. I now understand the joke.","July 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 1,947 of 2,741 people (71%) found this review helpful 693 people found this review funny","71","947","2","693","51"

Never had I heard about an Elite game. So, I read a few reviews and they promised depth within this game that you yourself need to find. I took the risk and bought this game.\n\nThe first 10 or so hours I spent doing low risk carrier missions. I made a fair amount of money and travelled 10 different systems or so. I wanted to leave though. This was amazing! I was like a trader in star wars moving cargo between solar systems! If i dove a little into bounty hunting and stealing cargo floating in space and selling it on the black market. However, there was more that I wanted, and I still strive for this. I want my name permanantely on a planet. NO. A SOLAR SYSTEM. I want every planet to have my name on it.\n\nI dreamt big. The nearest nebula. Or just one to see how far moving along the galaxy really is. I chose the pipe nebula. Using the money I had made from my first 10-12 hours, I bought a new ship, a few minor upgrades, and set off. I traveled ~500 light years to reach this nebula, and my name was not on a planet/solar system yet. One of the best parts about this begining journey to the pipe nebula, was only 20 light years out from finally reaching the nebula, I noticed its not just the same skybox placed for every single solar system. I could see the pipe nebula getting larger with every jump I made towards it. It was real. It was there.\n\nI discovered this no more than 20 minutes ago. And armed with this new knowledge, I jumped into the galaxy map and looked at countless other nebulae. What one do I want to see!? Where do I want to go!? So, thinking this, I decided I will return back the 500 or so light years I travelled to the center of the milky way, back into the established space (Space stations and such), and go the exact opposite way and move towards the pilleads cluster, and from then on, move towards the horse head nebula. However, im conflicted to wheather or not I would prefer to move into the elephant's trunk nebula.\n\nI have the entire Galaxy to explore, and endless stars to jump though. Just the fact that I can go to the center of the milky way is astonishing. The fact that I can move to the opposite end of it, just as awesome. I spent 8 or so hours moving 500 light years, and i look forward to many more with the hope that I will get my name on a planet. For now, im going to be a tourist. Then an explorer. If I get bored, a miner, trader, bounty hunter, renegade. Dont worry, I will send post cards.","April 7, 2015","true","136.3"," 179 of 230 people (78%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","78","179","230","37","5"

I've played it for about twelve hours, now, and I've racked up nearly 100k credits, so I feel as if I have enough credentials to write this review that may come off more as a, "buyer beware".\n\nLet's start off like this - Elite: Dangerous is hard and I don't mean that it's hard as in difficult.  A high degree of difficulty would imply that, although playable, a certain level of experience is required at a certain point within the game in order to proceed - a level of mastery, if you will, needs to be obtained in order to advance.  A game with a good difficulty slope will have its beginning areas start off easy and then slowly increase the difficulty as the player progresses.\n\nHowever, Elite: Dangerous is not difficult, it's just extremely complicated.\n\nNow, complicated is an entirely different term.  A game that is highly complicated is difficult to even learn how to play and has little to do with the actual content of the game.  From the word, "go", Elite: Dangerous can have a player completely baffled as to what to do and where to go.  Everything from flying your ship, travelling to a mission starting point, and even docking is ridiculously overcomplicated to the point where, if you really don't have an obsession with everything outer space, you're probably going to just give up.\n\nFurthermore, I use a control stick.  I couldn't imagine trying to play this thing with an XBOX controller or anything like that.  My stick has twelve buttons, plus another stick on top of it and despite that, a keyboard is still required for me to play because there are so many controls to know and memorize.  The amount of buttons actually required to play this game is absolutely absurd, especially given the game's content.\n\nFurthermore, I've consulted the internet and Youtube about the basic controls of this game more than any other game that I've ever played.  Everything from the correct orientation that I need to dock at to how to set my discovery scanner to a fire key to how to properly approach an object in space.  To be frank, you shouldn't have to consult the internet and watch videos in order to figure out how to do something so basic.  If there was some secret planet in a faraway star system that held an item that could blow up the entierety of the galaxy, and I wanted it, THAT would be what I should consult the internet for, not how to thrust properly.\n\nKeep in mind, lest anyone badger me for not mentioning this, but there are tutorials built into the game, but, again, I feel that this falls into the same argument that I made above.\n\nFurthermore - if you're looking for any type of character development, storyline, or anything like that - look elsewhere.  I can't really comment on the game's story because, well, there really isn't any.  There's some basic back story about the game's ships and their development, but nothing is really strung together.  There are factions and you can help them which will allow you to complete special missions, but you don't really feel as if what you do has any impact whatsoever.\n\nDespite there being such a gigantic world, there isn't even a lot to do.  The overall content of the game funnels down like this:\n\n1.  You're given X cargo.  Take it to X location.\n\n2.  You have to hunt X cargo at X location.  Once procurred, take it to X location.\n\n3.  Kill X amount of outlaws.\n\n4.  Kill a really, really, bad outlaw.\n\n5.  Discover stars and planets.\n\nNo matter what you do, you never really feel like you're making that big of an impact on the game.  Even if you're the first one to run a discovery scanner on some astronomical object, like a planet, there's really not much to celebrate about.  You just scan it, move twenty lightyears away, sell it to the cartographers at any space station, and move onto another system.\n\nAnother thing that I want to mention is that this game is kind of buggy.  For instance, yesterday I went to leave dock and, for no reason, my guns deployed and started firing by themselves with absolutely no input from me.  Of course, since I was in a no fire zone, this led me to be shot down and killed, making me lose all of the cartographic data that I had collected and hadn't been able to sell, yet.  By the way, if I had purchased any upgrades for my ship, I would've lost those, too, unless I had the credits to pay to get my ship setup back when I had died.\n\nFuel is a gigantic issue on this game.  If you run out of fuel in space, you are dead.  That's it.  You're dead.  Just like space, this game is extremely punishing.  If you make one wrong move, you're dead.  This becomes an even bigger issue when you use the galaxy map to plot a course to a distant star system.  It will graciously show you where you have to make smaller jumps to other star systems in order to arrive at the star system that you plotted a course for.  Even more graciously, it will tell you the exact star system that you can arrive at before you need to refuel.  All of the star systems that you have the fuel to jump to along the path will have a solid, yellow/orange line.  Star systems beyond your fuel tank's capabilities will have a dotted, yellow/orange line.  Neat, huh?  Just one problem.\n\nThe final star system along the solid line's route might not have a place to refuel, leaving you stuck in space.\n\nIn order to combat this, you need to make sure that either the last star system along that solid line has a place to refuel, or there is a place earlier along in the route that you can refuel.  Any system actually owned by a faction should have a station to refuel at, but, in any case, travelling is risky business and for a game that encourages exploration, I find the fact that it punishes you so harshly for doing just that, exploring, to be discouraging.\n\nAnd, again, so no one gets on my case, you can get a fuel scoop, but scooping fuel from stars is pretty tricky to say the least and isn't very affective.\n\nSo, I've bashed this game a lot, now, and you may be asking yourself, "So what is good about it?"  The answer to that is quite simple:\n\nIt's Outer Space\n\nAnd not just Outer Space.  The game's world is an actual, 1:1 recreation of the Milky Way Galaxy.  If that's not cool, then nothing is.  Despite there not being a lot to do, you can do whatever there is to do practically infinitely because the world is so huge.  Furthermore, it is really cool being able to explore star systems that you're familiar with like Fomalhaut, Betelgeuse, and Polaris.  You could even make a pilgramage to Earth, if you wanted to.\n\nSo, yeah, even though this game is absurdly complicated to a fault, incredibly frustrating, and mind-numbingly lonely, I'd still recommend to anyone reading this that they buy it, but if and only if they love the prospect of exploring Outer Space.  If that doesn't excite you, then buy something else.","April 16, 2015","true","59.1"," 236 of 314 people (75%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","75","236","314","16","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lodew/recommended/359320/","lodew","Lodew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lodew/","87 products in account","Updated on April 6th 2015.\n\nIntroductionAt the time of writing this I got 8 hours clocked + 5 hours spent in the "unofficial" combat demo the day before steam release. Thus I will not go into the "end game", but rather describe the initial experience. I'll update the review once I reach a 100 hours played.\n\nThis game is hardcore, do not expect it to hold your hand! Really, that's the most important thing to state, and it is the #1 point that the negative reviews list here. However, I don't think it is a negative point. It's an intentional part of the game, and you either like it or you do not. Expect to spend your first hours of playing by going through the combat and travel tutorials and really suck at it. Then spend the rest of your day on constantly looking up youtube videos and articles on the Elite: Dangerous wiki each time you want to try something new. It is part of the charm, and if you push through it you will truly enjoy it. Once you're past this and you managed to figure out how to make some money (tip: go bounty hunting near Nav points!), you'll notice the beauty of this game.\n\nA tip is to find the unofficial combat demo, and try for yourself whether you like how the ship control feels or not. Ask around on http://reddit.com/r/elitedangerous. You can ask any other question about the game there too! Also take the first few hours tweaking the controls. With mouse/kb: setting the Mouse X-axis to yaw instead of roll (and mapping A/D to roll left/roll right) makes a huge difference.\n\n\nTHE GOOD There are many ways to make money, and it's up to you which ones you want to do. You can have multiple ships, so you can switch up playstyles. The big money is in trading. Not your thing? Go hunt the other traders as you become a pirate! Want to be more "legal"? Become a bounty hunter and hunt the pirates! Want to explore the literally billions of star systems (most of which haven't been visited by players yet)? Grab a better jump drive and exploration scanner, and earn cash by mapping unexplored systems as a space explorer!\n\nThe game is visually stunning! Not just in its graphics, but also in the sheer scale of things; travelling from one end of the galaxy to the other might take months.\n\nControlling your space ship feels good. There are so many little options, and even a thing as docking is more than just pushing a button. Yes, docking to a space ship can actually be one of the most lethal things you'll be doing.\n\nTHE BAD Player interaction is minimal. Despite being a multiplayer game, it is actually hard to find other players, I expected it to be more like freelancer where it is easy to contact any player within your system or even further out (without being friends). Ultimately this game is mainly a solo PvE experience unless you find friends to play with. You can run some of the more popular trade routes for a couple hours and not encounter more than 2 or 3 other players.\n\nIF you find other players, you might not actually like it. Obviously there are players who shoot everyone on sight (even camping the new player systems), or just had the same plan as you for making money by killing NPC criminals in the same area, which makes you compete for kills (only the last hit on an enemy grants the reward). Others play pirate, but so far the player pirates I have encountered are kind people playing their role, so that actually does not bother as much.\n\nThe game feels shallow. It is a mile wide and an inch deep, as people say. There are big updates coming to the game though, so it'll gradually get better. It would be great if a thing like the EVE corporations (or guilds/clans) would be more incorporated into the game. Let the players craft the story. Right now, the most profit can be gained from interacting with NPCs (pirating, bounty hunting, trading), which make the multiplayer aspect a bit sad.\nEDIT 6/4/'15: As some of you have pointed out, the docking issues with too many players trying to dock at the same time might just be temporary, and are mainly a thing at the small stations in the new player systems. It is still a nuisance though, but I agree that the problem kind of solves itself after you're further out.","April 4, 2015","true","52.1"," 198 of 261 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","198","261","3","15"

Great game definitely worth grabbing on steam if you haven't bought this already. I have a Saitek X-52 joystick and this game was practically made for it. You definitely want to have a joystick for this game because it works great with one with no need to configure the buttons. BUY THIS GAME! P.S. they have great customer support and very fast responses, got two responses in same day both giving me solutions to the questions I had about switching my game over to steam. I had to get a refund and rebuy it, but they had no problem with refunding me so I could move over to steam and I did not have to create a new account, just add the new steam key and I was gtg. I would of loved to have just gotten a key for steam without refundning and repurchasing but hey lifes not always fair and considering how good this game is I did not mind too much.","April 2, 2015","true","57.9"," 379 of 529 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","379","529","13","14"

The Roleplay System  Unlimited Freedom. Can you be a Fighter, a Trader, or an Explorer ? Yes You can !. Be whatever you want. Just do it !  The Simulator it Self  Good flight mechanics. Not hard to control & very detailed. Turn off the Flight Assist for more challenge. The tiny thrusters around the Ship will mess you up if you do it wrong !  The Graphics  Awesome Art, Cool Ships, Beauty Star & Planets, Fantastic Space Station !. And also this is kinda graphics card friendly. That means you can run it well with decent frame rate on low specification graphics card  The Multiplayer  You can kill another player to obtain their Bounties, Cargo, or Just for Fun. Or you can form a Wing with your friends to do a lot of things easier with Voice Chat + cool Walkie Talkie effect on it  Overall  This is a Masterpiece for a Space Enthusiast like me !. Worth every penny ^_^\nTable above isn't enough for you ?\nDo you want to know more about this game ?\nAlright, i will tell you a bit of my in-game experience ! :D\nAfter i did the Training session for a whole day, i decided to start my career as CMDR RAFTOX.\nI Spawned in a Space Station on LHS 3447 system.\n\nI'm a bit confused at that time. The game didn't gave me some tips "How to get some Missions".\nSo i tried to find out. I opened the Starport Service, the menu appear. And finally i found the way to get some missions after i click the menu one by one. It was on Bulletin Board !\n\nThe starter credit was very low, only 1,000 cr. So i took 2 Smuggling missions at once to covered myself with some better Equipment faster.\nFYI : Smuggling missions have higher payment than the regular Trade mission. Actually there are more missions that offer higher payment but that's too risky because the mission type is Assasination. I don't think my ship can do some combat with starter Equipment.\n\nThe first Smuggling Mission was to deliver Slaves to A System. They gave me time 3 hours to complete it [distance from my location was arround 5 light years]\nThe Second one was to slip Narcotics to B System. They gave me time 2 hours to complete it [distance from my location was arround 12 light years]\nI open my Galaxy map to set the flight route, the first destination was A System because it was closer.\nAfter did a flight checks, i'm ready to take off & jump to A System.\n\nThe trip runs smoothly until i arrived at the destination Space Station.\nThe Federal Security scanned my cargo right before i dock. The result ? they fined me for some credits\nSo i tried to dock ASAP and enter the hangar [glad that federal ships didn't shoot me].\n\nDocking was successful !. i open the Starport Service, gave the cargo [Slaves], and they paid me for 40,000 cr.\nWell, that was quite a lot for me ^_^.\n\nI use that credits to paid the fine, refuel, & upgrade my Ship Equipment.\nI bought new weapons and some new internal [one of them is a brand new Fuel Scoop !]\nAfter i finished shopping, i prepared my self for the next Smuggling missions [Slips Narcotics].\n\nlearned from past mistake, i don't want that Federal Ships scan my cargo for the second time.\nSo i tried to find out how i can dock to the next Space Station without being noticed.\nAfter Googling for a bit, i got the answer !.\nThe solution for this problem is ->  Silent Running [elite-dangerous.wikia.com].\n\nI open my Galaxy map to set the flight route, the next destination was B System and i need to jump 2 times because my Ships jump capability was only arround 7 light years.\n\nThe second trip also runs smoothly, and you know what ? the Silent Running works pretty well !\ni docked at the destination Space Station without being noticed but my Ship got some Heat damage because i use it too long [Silent Running shut down the cooling vents so the heat is trapped throughout the Ship].\n\nI entered the hangar, open the Starport Service and gave the cargo [Narcotics], and they paid me for 60,000 cr.\nThese credits was enough to buy a new Ship ->  Eagle. [elite-dangerous.wikia.com]\nBut i can't bought the Ship at this Station. The "Shipyard" option is not available due to that is a small Station.\n\nSo i decided to flew arround the Galaxy to found a Space Station that sold Eagle.\nI jump to every System that i can reach with my Ship.\nAfter did a few Jumps i got a Sound Notification on my ship.\nThat was a LOW FUEL warning !\n\nAnd yes, i forgot to refuel on the last station that i visited !!!\ni checked the System map, Oh My God ... there is no Space Station here !\nThere was no way to go back, the Fuel wasn't enough to made another jump to refuel on the previous System.\n\nThat was a BIG moment of silence for me.\nI was stiff as a statue until i realized i have Fuel Scoop installed on my ship !\nSo i tried to flew slowly closer to the sun and YES ! It worked !\n\nThe Scoop slowly suck the Sun energy in order to get Fuel. And after a few minutes, my Fuel Tank was full !\nSo i continue my trip and finally i found the Space Station that sold the ship i wanted :D\n\nAnd now i can Sleep with a huge smile on my face ^_^\n\nThis is just the beginning, Frontier Development [the game developer] have a "10-Year Development Plan" for this game.\nYep ... 10 years. You can read it  here [elite-dangerous.wikia.com]\nSo, they will release 1 Major Update [or you can call it Expansion] per-year in 10 years period\nThe problem is, you must pay another bucks in order to get the new Expansion\nBut i think thats not a big deal, only once per-year ^_^\nI know that is insane ! i hope this game will last long :D\nBefore i close this review, i have a message for you. And please remember this : Don't forget to visit our home, Earth !. That planet is located in SOL system\nPlease visit it at least once because this Galaxy is so huge\nI don't think you can explore every single thing of this Universe in your life span :(\nAlright guys, this is my review.\nI'm apologize for some Typos & Grammar Failure ;)\nEnglish is not my main language, i'm still learning it ! :P\n\nI rate this game : 400 Billion / 400 Billion !Are you ready to be an Elite ? :D\nSee you in Space, CMDR !\n\nTHANKS !","September 27, 2015","true","204.9"," 1,777 of 2,589 people (69%) found this review helpful 267 people found this review funny","69","777","2","267","60"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/recommended/359320/","Isarii","Isarii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Isarii/","98 products in account","Elite: Dangerous is a difficult title to recommend. On the one hand, it delivers an amazingly immersive and atmospheric experience, truly excelling at pulling players into the game, and making them feel the awe of being in space with fantastic visuals and some of the best audio work I've ever experienced in a game. The ships handle well without being too twitchy - even with mouse and keyboard after a bit of tweaking the controls -, combat is satisfying, and its 'to scale' modeling of our galaxy offers unparalleled scope. All the core components of a great game are present, which is why it's so troubling that the game never really expands beyond those core components.\n\nEvery game system in Elite: Dangerous is a rushed husk presenting virtually no depth. Its economic market is the best example of this. It is player-influenced, with supply and demand shifting prices as players ferry goods between stations, but affords the players no control whatsoever in it. There is no manufacturing, no creation, no ability to do anything beyond shipping materials from point A to point B in the hopes of turning a profit. Trade goods are never used by the players at all, an unfortunate situation that makes mining not only incredibly ineffective at making money (as it's basically a more difficult form of trading), but also deeply unsatisfying, as the ore you work towards collecting will never go anywhere, only disappearing from the economy as you convert it to credits at your station of choice. This lack of depth extends to the development of basically every other game system, much to the game's detriment.\n\nWith the simplicity of these game systems comes a simplicity in objective. Your goal, as a player, is to grind more credits so you can buy a bigger ship (which tend to be strictly better than their less expensive counterparts) to more efficiently grind credits in.\n\nUnfortunately, this is made even worse by the game's horrifically poorly thought out reward structure, in which the missions, which at least have the potential to be mildly interesting, give laughably low rewards. In the time it takes you to complete a single mission, you could typically earn 20-100x's as much by simply sitting at nav-beacon or resource node killing pirates for their bounties. The disparity in reward of mindlessly grinding over doing the game's missions is mind boggling.\n\nTo the MMO player, the lack of depth in multiplayer is a massive let-down. There is no real reason to work together beyond the benefit of having another person nearby. Without the ability to impact the economy, players have no goals to collaborate towards. There are no multiplayer ships, and no player organizations to be a part of. What it all boils down to is that Elite: Dangerous simply should not have been a multiplayer game. Perhaps as a single-player entrant to the series, its sins would have been less numerous.\n\nElite: Dangerous is not a bad game, and even with its faults, it's hard to give it the thumbs down. It's certainly enjoyable in terms of minute-to-minute gameplay, but its current lack of depth and the developer's apparent focus on introducing more shallow features instead of adding depth to existing ones ultimately make the game mostly a good introduction to space sims for the newbies whose lacking features will surely have you looking to Star Citizen once the inevitable boredom sets in.\n\nThe Key Takeaway: Elite: Dangerous is, as others have so often put it, miles wide and an inch deep. Without any real multiplayer features beyond being able to group up (which was added in a patch) and shoot at things, it's better to think of the game as a single-player simulator in a shared universe than a real MMO. That said, it's aesthetically astounding, offers unparalleled immersion, and excels at providing minute to minute entertainment through solid gameplay basics. If you aren't looking for a multiplayer game with a lot of depth, you may be able to look past the game's faults to find a really enjoyable experience.","November 24, 2015","false","125.0"," 612 of 890 people (69%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","69","612","890","18","24"

The orbital line overlays outside the cockpit are beautiful and clean, and the short range map though messy in combat is easy to get accustomed to.\n\n-Sound is dead on and spectacular in all ways.  From the music, to the click/ping of metal flexing under boost stress, it all sounds AMAZING.\n\n-Smooth head tracking/mouse tracking/facetracking/camera movement.  (really noticable on 144hz monitors linked to two 980gtx's in SLI)  This reduces motion sickness dramatically for me.\n\n-Deep space travel model is robust:  3 modes dictate speed, the first mode used for docking/combat and feels like a normal interstellar sim, flying around with a basic cockpit view. The second mode multiplies your speed and allows for travel within system.  This mode is fun for many reasons but the orbital lines and glowing suns make space more festive.  The third travel mode is actually a fast travel from system to system..\n\n-Multiple Controller support.  Doesn't get any better than this.  I've had less issue getting controllers to work with this game than any other game I've worked with.  I currently play with a Saitek x52Pro, Logitech G27, Wired Xbox360 controller, Steam Controller simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Mission system is broken in a way I've never seen in a game.  It is hard to trust that any mission is completable or even worth the time to fly it.  Even if you get past the confusing objectives and complete a mission, it is likely you will be hated for it, wanted for it, fined for it, or blasted for it.  And the game isn't going to hold your hand so you will be boggled by questions of relevance regarding any new information.\n\n-The whole galaxy is playing "Cops and Robbers"  I noticed that I can go hours without a pirate interdicting me but as soon as I have 1 load of anything in my hold its non stop interdictions until I either drop it, kill the pirate, or get to my objective, and this happens a lot.  It's a mystery to me how the entire galaxy is interested in my stored clothes.\n\n-The space feels empty.  This could be because of the lack of NPC interaction, or perhaps the lack of diversity.  It feels like too much work, too much flying through empty space to get to something you've already done before.  This feeling is less oppressive around space stations orbiting planets, and other players of course.  I'm sure polish will help this feature, but the game needs a bit more life to reach additional players.\n\nIn conclusion the game is a must see on any high end system and that includes VR.  But wait for the sale.\nExpect to be completely wowed for 10-20 hours.  After that it will take a dedicated grinder to enjoy this game.  Because you are upgrading your ship simply to make what you are already doing easier.  I think it really hit me when flying a route  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and started playing a game.  I'ver never had a game so beautiful get me that bored.  I had to stop lying to myself.  I have no intention of choosing a game as a second job, and I need to be enjoying what I'm doing to keep playing.\n\nI have not uninstalled the game... why?  I get a very real feeling of excitement whenever Steam ques it for an update, and this reveals that deep down I'm impressed enough with the initial product to put some faith in the development.  At some point I expect my review thumb to swap directions, I guess that is worth mentioning.","April 16","false","82.7"," 213 of 294 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","213","294","8","14"

But utterly, completely devoid of content. This game is the dictionary definition of 'inch deep, mile wide'. You can experience the entire game in your first hour, after which you will just be repeating the same simple tasks over and over. But with no aim, since the enormous galaxy is procedurally generated, you can't actually change anything (excepting via the grind-fest that is PowerPlay, in specially controlled areas).\n\nElements that are static shouldn't be, like the ability for systems to evolve or collapse and things that should be static are not. For example you can fly to a Resource Site and just keep logging off and back on again until the RNG seed sets itself to one that gives you the pirate ships you want to farm. Not to mention NPCs are completely random and their cargo has no relation to what they are doing. Shoot up a mining ship in one of these resource extraction sites and what do you get? Washing machines, for me. Food. Yeah, come on, really. You're caught between an RNG and a procedural generator with nothing in between.\n\nThe developers have no idea what they are doing. They are creating this game as if its still the 1980s, having learned nothing from the mistakes and successes of contemporary online multiplayer games. In fact, the whole multiplayer aspect is utterly pointless (a cynic can infact say its just DRM masquerading as multiplayer), since the only interaction you can have with other players is shoot at them or get shot by them. No trading, no construction, no way to hire escorts etc.\n\nThere is also very poor quality control. Firstly, releases happen on Fridays, so the new bugs that are introduced each time are there all weekend, during what I would expect to be peak game time for most mature players. Secondly, the same bugs keep coming back, an example is after the 1.3 patch when the cost of repairing ships broke every other patch for 6 consecutive hotfixes. The game is no way ready for commercial release. With its poor, inconsistent and buggy content, it is at best still a beta.\n\nWasted potential. What use are 400 billion star systems if there is nothing to do in even one?","July 27, 2015","false","239.8"," 277 of 398 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","277","398","7","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterslippy/recommended/359320/","misterslippy","Mister~Slippy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterslippy/","106 products in account","I bought this game primarily to curb my anxiousness for No Man's Sky, and so far it's done a fantastic job. The first thing you want to know before you buy this is that there's a huge learning curve, so don't expect to login for the first time and go guns hot on the first thing you see. You won't know what you're doing, and you will die. People who complain that this game is too hard are simply people who don't care to learn how to play it; they can just stick with CoD as it is more suited for them.\n\nTrading:\n\nI think the trading system is nice. It's not easy to exploit and get way too much money, but it is simple once you take the time to get a grasp of it. On first glance is does look a little daunting looking at all the trade routes and the bright colors in your Galaxy Map, but really it's just simple economics: high supply = low demand and vice versa. Once you sit down and just read what's in front of you there's really nothing to be confused about.\n\nCombat:\n\nGetting into the combat in this game can be a little slow and you DEFINITELY want to play the tutorials and maybe even watch some videos on the web. Once you begin to understand how to get an advantage combining your thrusters and yaw roll/pitch together then it really becomes a lot of fun. I must say that winning my first battle felt like a real accomplishment.\n\nImmersion/AI:\n\nOkay so these two kind of go hand in hand in this game. Without the AI being as dynamic as it is this would simply be a boring game because the galaxy is so big you don't come across a huge amount of people that you actually interact with. Yeah you see them flying by in Supercruise but it's very unlikely that two people will end up in the same section of space unless they've already formed a group. So in order to create an immersive galaxy this game has very interactive AI. For example, my very first battle in space: I was in Supercruise (which is when you use your frame drive, or jump drive at lower speeds to travel inside the same solar system) and all of a sudden I had a warning flashing on my sensors that there was an "Interdiction" or something to that effect. Essentially a low level criminal (fortunately, this was my first time in a firefight outside the tutorial) pulled me out of Supercruise and demanded my cargo. Of course, I was going to just give it to him, so I deployed my weapons and the fight started. About 3/4 of the way through the battle (at which point I already knew I was going to win) the Federal Police dropped in because they had noticed what was happening. They done a quick scan of my ship and I assume his as well, joined my side of the battle and then it was 3v1. Yeah it didn't last much longer. The combat requires your full attention though as you have to constantly reassess the situation and divert power between your shields/engine/weapons to keep the advantage.\n\nTravel:\n\nOf course, in a game boasting a massive galaxy with 400 billion star systems you need to have a way to get around, right? Right. Essentially traveling in this game is done either with your Supercruise or jumping to Hyperspace. They both use the same button, but will activate one or the other based on what you're doing. So if you don't have another system targeted then you will simply jump to Supercruise which will increase your speed so you can effectively travel to other space stations, events, and people within the system you're currently residing. To travel to another star system you enter your Galaxy map (there are a number of ways to do this but I personally like clicking middle mouse button to go to headview and looking at the section of my cockpit where my Nav Interface pops up. This is a very cool way to keep the game immersive even in your own ship), select the star system you want to travel to and select plot course. Then you line up with it on your sensors and bam, hyperspace. Very cool, and you absolutely feel like an explorer out there going to all the different star systems.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10  (not a 9 or 10 just because there still are some confusing things that the game doesn't tell you about)\nControls: 10/10 once you learn how to use them\nReplay Value: 9/10 as far as I can tell there isn't really a main mission so the game is designed to keep you interested. However, it does seem that the missions might get a little repetitive after a while, but don't they in every game?\n\n\nI'm still mega-noob level in this game but I'm having a lot of fun nonetheless, and I haven't really played with anyone in a group. I'm sure it would be exponentially more awesome if you did.","April 6, 2015","true","62.5"," 160 of 220 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","160","220","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/359320/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","For newbies curious about the game I've made a guide at the bottom of this review as (to much irritation and annoyment) all the "guides" are videos and it doesn't cover everything you should start out knowing.\n\nElite: Dangerous is an amazing space simulator. Your hand isn't held. You decide what you want to do and you create your own story and adventure. Some reviews will tell you that there isn't much to do and in a sense it's true. There are only a few things. You can be an explorer and just simply go from station to station exploring areas and broadening your database and mind with breathtaking visuals throughout an immensely huge galaxy. You could become a pirate and hunt down cargo to potentially gain lots of good loot to sell and become rich. You could become a trader; risk your life transporting legal and /or illegal goods from one station to the next. Or you could become a bounty hunter and chase down those who've murdered, thieved or -drumroll followed by silence- .....DIDN'T PAY THEIR FINES! Or you could become a miner moving from asteroid to asteroid trying to find profitable metals and minerals to process and sell. The choice is yours.\n\nWhile the first trailer isn't gameplay, it could very well soon be that way. Developers have talked about two expansions they plan on releasing:\n1. Being able to dock and get out of your ship to explore stations (I don't know exactly what they'd plan to do with that specifically)\n2. Planetary landings and exploration. Frontier wants to put in wildlife, plant life, full blown cities filled with people and most importantly....buggies!\n\nSo in other words this game isn't done. In a way you could consider this a beta. And it does have minor bugs and crashes every once in a while so it makes sense. But it is a very polished, solid and fun beta. The negative people who just see this as 'pew pew you beat the game' can officially go screw themselves. Oh and I'll be very butthurt when you thumbs down my review for saying that. I will cry so hard. So please thumbs down my review for your griefer needs. Thank you.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this is not just a solo experience. The community is actually very friendly and it's very fun to enter a wing and do things together. So don't be shy, use that chat feature Frontier so cherishably put in so that you could complain about how no one talks or does anything together.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Wholeheartedly, yes. And it'll only get a lot better in the future....wait this is the future....FRONTIER WHERE ARE MY DLC?! ....Oh near future. Got it. Great space simulator and a must buy for futuristic/space game lovers. Or a great start to those who are new and curious about them.\n\nThis is the guide section I mentioned at the beginning of my review. Don't be ashamed or feel stupid using it because the game does have a steep learning curve. Also note that this guide is for keyboard and mouse users (sorry HOTAS users nothing against you).\n\n-In order to use the wing (party) system, simply hold shift and press W or alternatively press 2. In order to navigate tabs you use Q and E and space bar will select things. Select a commander and highlight the choices and choose 'Invite to wing'. If the person accepts you must go back into the friends tab and activate the nav lock on. In order for either of you to follow one anothers location in deep space you must have your wing beacon on. That is activated by pressing 4 or shift+D. Go to the functions tab, highlight beacon and select 'wing'. Note that every time you supercruise or go FTL it will go off so you have to re-activate it.\n\n-In order to balance or shift power to systems, thrusters or weapons the default binds are the arrow keys. You'll know which one to press to shift power don't worry.\n\n-While in supercruise and locked on to a destination it's best to start slowing down at around 10 seconds left. reduce throttle until your line hits the blue area and make sure it's at the bottom of that area as you'll just go right past your destination otherwise. Don't worry about having to adjust after that point. It will automatically control speed descent.\n\n-When prompted, in order to assign scanners and/or weapons, press 4 and go to fire group. You have the option to make them primary (1) or secondary (2) fire. Press space in order to set it to primary, secondary or make it unusable. You also have the option to put weapons/scanners in another group entirely. Press D to shift over and you will be in your secondary loadout. You have the same option of setting to primary and secondary fire. In order to switch between the two sets the default button is N.\n\n-In order to use a wake scanner, target (T) a wake in supercruise and follow your destination meters to slow down to the appropriate speed and you will automatically shift when in range. In order to hyper jump and follow someone you must deploy it in regular movement and hold down whichever you assigned the scanner to (primary or secondary). After the wake has been scanned, simply increase throttle and press J. Once prompted, align your ship with the destination vector and you will warp to the commanders location.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to post a question and I will do my best to answer.

I love trading. I love space and spaceships. This seemed perfect, and more immersive than just about any other space sim I've played.\n\nWhich leads to the two good points this game has:\nVery immersive\nVery pretty\n\nWhat are the problems? After about five hours, I felt I'd seen all the game has to show me.\n\nThere are only two types of missions that I can recall as I write this:\nCourier missions (bring X from Y to Z)\nCombat missions (blow X up)\n\nCourier missions include:\nFind X and bring it here. These pay terribly.\nGo to X and salvage Y and bring it here. These are often illegal, pay better, but take forever for crappy pay.\nTake X from here to Y. These basically cover gas plus a little extra.\nSmuggle X from here to Y. These are the only missions that pay anything worthwhile in the entire game.\n\nCombat missions include:\nFind some guy and kill him (pays decent, but he will be in the best possible ship and blow you up very easily, despite better paying missions being possible in the starter ship)\nFind X amount of Y type of ship and blow them up. Never did one. They don't pay well.\n\nYou can also just troll around for bounties, which pay about half as much as the assassinatino missions but you can do ten times as many in the same time frame. This is, as I understand, how most people make money.\n\nYou can also trade, which is usually my favorite thing in a space sim. Too bad I never once made more than the lowest paying mission when doing a trade run. If you look for tips, they'll all tell you to use third party tools to make money. So I'm going to say if you need a third party tool for it to be viable, that's bad game design and trade is broken.\n\nCombat is more difficult than it has to be unless you use turrets or gimbals. Mouse is actually better than joystick (what?). No matter what you use, trying to aim with precision feels like trying to balance a dinner plate on the head of a pin.\n\nThen there's also the touted "you can affect the galaxy's politics!" nonsense. It depends on your faction, but the one I joined involved ferrying a load of cargo several jumps away. Each cargo gave 1 point towards reinforcing or capturing a planet. It takes a thousand or more to capture a planet. It is impossible for a single individual to make a meaningful impact on this game. You need teams, or to work on stuff you see other people working on. You get paid almost nothing for it, too. True, you get a weekly paycheck, but you could get a better one doing actual missions instead of wasting time on earning the paycheck.\n\nIn short, the game does nothing well except immersion, so unless you like ferrying around illegal goods for dozens of hours, you should give it a pass.","August 5, 2015","false","36.6"," 199 of 286 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","199","286","4","0"

Hell yeah it's got potential.\n\nIs it atmospheric and do you feel as though you are piloting a spaceship? Look no further!\n\nSo then what is wrong with it?\n\nPoorly executed game mechanics. No. Not docking. Docking is the most exciting thing about this game! Oh, and sometimes space combat.\n\nI am talking about the things that make the game feel alive. Make it FEEL like space civilisation is all around you.\n\nOnce you leave the starter systems, everything dies. I played mostly on open play, for two days in Empire space I have seen one human player. Ch'eng, I am assuming is some kind of hub for the empire had seen one person in the 24 hours before.\n\nThere is no synergy in this game between the professions as they have nerfed the ever loving prince albert out of piracy, this kills bounty hunting. You are a bounty hunter? Better off making money to keep up with the traders by farming RES spots. Or just become a trader yourself and fund your own fighter.\n\nMining? HAHAHAHAHA. Looks cool as all hell. Seriously better off shooting at the bounties in the RES areas. One Anaconda goes down for 100k credits. That's 100 tonnes of gold. Do you know what it takes to harvest 100 gold?\n\nExploration. Explorers are probably the only people in this game exempt from criticism. Exploring is it's own thing. You don't do it for the immediate gain. It's a long term effort kind of thing. It's also the solo kind of thing. Once you get out 400 light years from the nearest civlised planet you will soon know if it is, or is not for you. You will never see another person. Ever. Again.\n\nELITE is just a Universe Sandbox with no soul. Will it get soul? Who knows. Feels empty 90% of the time. I don't feel a part of the larger universe. I feel like a dude driving through supercruise waiting for the next AI NPC to Interdict me.\n\nDocking is fun though.

I was in space for 4hrs straight not inching closer to my destination at all. ( i was 1.6 days away in real human life time, as in i needed to sit there for 1.6 days playing to reach my destination. However once i figured it out, i was there in 10 mins...Anyway if you can stick with it, put the effort into research aka play with google on your phone in hand. It slowly gets easier, and once its easy this is as amazing as it gets\n\n. Theres one feature in this game i wasnt expecting..." conflict zones" you can go to..low and high intensity zones like going to another star or planet, When you get there you will see ALOT of NPCs battling it out all over the place in a star wars style battle. Oh yes, there will be players attracted to the fun. I cant tell you how many were at the low intensity one i was at, but im gonna guess maybe 9...and then...30 or 40 computer fighters...hell maybe more, i think if the NPCs die they respawn as another ship so the battle never stops. These zones come and go as wars end, new ones pop up. Its awsome because i was expecting player battles to almost be staged as in hey everyone meet here at this time for said epic battle...I am thoroughly pleased to know if i get bored of space exploring i can just literally turn to fighting in large scale engagements.. Its an amazing thing i saw traveling to my first real planet. And i grinned as ships exploded around me and lazers went off everywhere...JUST LIKE THE STORE PAGE VIDEO! the thing some people wanna say isnt in the game. They are wrong. These zones can be seen and are in world with all players, so you could be an explorer and look out your window to see a big battle as you pass it by. But this is a sim so, if you die you wont respawn in the thick of it like the AI will,  youll respawn at the start. And youll have to\ntravel back to the battle.\n\nUPDATE : I did transport missions until i was able to buy a better ship And if you chat through the in game comms with players its the coolest thing ive ever heard online, transmission static and noise but done right, its wicked cool.. JOYSTICK Recommended amazing immerison.\nP.S. my buddy is black and the feds scanned his ship at a docking hub then told him to move along...ive never been scanned docking, i have 3 times the hours he does.\n\nThe missions are a way to make money,  Youll find them on the bulletin board in starports. The world feels alive, I was attacked by a pirate AI ship, in mid supercruise and AI 3 police eagles came to aide me. They actually saved me.  i have seen fleets. Im talking wings of 12 ships or more, cruising around together. 1 of them was a gang.  I went to an asteriod belt, saw 20 something mining ships blasting  asteriods with lasers then scooping up the smaller rock.Theres was also a War going on in 1 galaxy i went to. Big one lots of battles. The docs and ports are beautiful, full of life, and ships buzzing about in epic scale on some of the more popular ones. Im talking ships coming and going constantly, 98% real players. The stations have Extreme detail with little trucks drving about on them, blinking lights and many many docking bays. You will be issued clearence from them and given a specific dock to park at. At the docks you can order beer, wine, liquor, food, uogrades, weapons, ships, missions, the list goes on for a long time. The immersion is spot on. Its very real to me.\n\nThere can be alot of downtime in the game, as you travel well..space. whats neat is how theres routes that are well travels by other players and frigates and then theres just deep space, where you wont see much. The game always looks amazing,.. after watching interstellar earlier, and how beautiful the scenes were in that movie, this game is on par with it. Everything is jaw dropping pretty. You can invite players and buddies to be your wingmen, or even recruit up to 3 AI ships to follow you where ever.\n\nI dont know any other space game that you can explore so far that you could literally be 24hrs from the nearest human in real time flight. thats is space my friends, you can feel crowded in a large battle, or feel more alone then playing doom... .\n\nAnyway, i read the postive and negative reviews, got the game because I wanted to be an astronaut today, taking a chance. And at one point..3.5hrs in..i was lost, confused, bored, overwhlemed, shaking my head, running out of fuel and air thinking i bought the wrong game this is just too much.... and then..it all clicked, like a light bulb, and within 20 mins, i was engaging fighters in massive dog fights. some kinda federal navy ships attacking man i dont know. I promise this...if you stick it out, figure it out ( and it sucks to do) but once you get it...It may very well be considered one of the best space games out there. I personally...well lets see i bought it 6hrs ago i logged in 6hrs, its 7am, i dont want to go to bed or work, I dislike earth now. ..I. died twice, once intentionally, because i was confused and wanted to start over,  and the other..i accidently slammed into a space station the size of texas at a high rate of speed in my 1 man fighter\n\nFor once, im glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews. You should still read them, they give some insight. But some of their chief complaints were "space is too big, make the map smaller"     ...ugh..what? ofcourse you dont see another player when you get WAY out there in deep space. isnt that the point of WAY out there. (can you imagine the excitement of running into someone if you ever did, 70hrs of gameplay away from the spawn. Talk about adrenaline)  If you wanna see people some stay in middle space. Wanne see them everywhere stay in civliized space. Game could use solitare, mine sweeper, and angry birds on in dash computer to help pass time in deep space.\n\nIf your worried you wont grasp it...you will...you paid 60 bucks for it,...you wont stop til you get it, so you dont have that lost money sinking feeling in your heart anymore. Evntually that will turn into a sense of accomplishment and pride that you stuck it out. The graphics are out of this world,  pun intended..and i truly feel that i have first hand experience now at crashing into a space station.\n\nIn closing YES this is a sim,  I dont understand what else you do other then explore, meet people, form a group, maybe fight those massive battles in the conflict zones. (anywhere can be a conflict zone, just these are dedicated with a bunch of AI etc)  Upgrade your ship with customizables and guns etc, trading, mining, piracy, blow stuff up, missions..transport this, protect this ship, attack this ship, go to this planet deliver this cargo. So i dont understand what else these guys expect in space?      You can add your buddies and see their locations and meet up places. so your not left traversing for years calling out for each other asking players have you seen so and so? But your buddy must be in a galaxy or system, if they are in deep space, then you wont know where they are, If you like space, your really doing yourself an injustice not getting it. I think this game is worth 60 bucks and is the 3rd 60 dollar PC game ive ever bought.  ( i like the 19.99-39.99) games ya catch my drift.) but i think in this game youll die in real life of old age before you ever see the whole map.\n\nFor the record i skipped the training, i heard it wasnt helpful. Its easier if you and a buddy share the learning curve, try to make a friend at the starting dock.or play with a steam friend. (unless you wanna be solo joe by all means do so, most do)   Or as i said in the beginning, google. bing, yahoo, whatever, some kinda search engine and start learning to be an anstronaut from others mistakes and helpful videos and tutorials\nUPDATE: bought a joystick today, mouse and keyboard in combat is more difficult then a t-rex tryna do pushups.","April 7, 2015","true","143.2"," 99 of 136 people (73%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","73","99","136","31","0"

I enjoy seeing the hundreds of reviews who have 100+ hours saying "got boring fast" and "it's grindy" but that is their fault. They made the game a boring grind to them, most likely because they saw the big ships and wanted them bad enough they grinded away their fun.\n\nHave the attitude of playing for fun, not playing for the big expensive stuff. Because you will ruin the game for you by doing so. Those big ships are not unstoppable killing machines, they have drawbacks to being so big and slow. They cost a lot to buy and even more to outfit with proper modules not to mention the rebuy costs and repair costs. You can have just as much fun in a cheap and zippy little fighter ship or a small little miner with the added bonus is that they are cheaper to buy, outfit, and rebuy. Of course the bigger ships do stuff better than the small ones can.\nThat massive cruiser can vaporize my ship in 2 seconds! Yeah of course, but you are acting as if enemies sit still and let you do that. You can't dogfight in that massive ship, but you can in your much smaller ship. Besides, why would it be fun to just pull up to an enemy who doesn't move and kill it in 2 seconds? Much more fun flying around and having a fast paced and tense dogfight in an asteroid belt.\n\nA popular thing I hear from quite a lot of people who DID get to the point they bought an anaconda, cutter, or corvette (3 largest and most expensive ships in the game.) is that a lot of them sold them, hopped in a cheaper ship, and went to have some real fun, or uninstalled and made a negative review ;)\n\nTreat the bigger stuff as a milestone. Just play and do what you want to have fun, go kill some pirates, run some missions for stations, go explore the galaxy. You can do all of this in the starter ship. When you get bored with one thing, just go do something else. I spent a lot of time bounty hunting pirates and one day I just got super bored and it felt like a grind. Instead of writing a negative review I sold my fighter, bought a trader ship, read some trading guides and set off. I repeated this process with exploring as well.\nThis game is very much about forging your own path, go do what you like. If you happen to LIKE grinding then hell, do it if it's fun. Don't be a bitter person writing negative reviews for a game that doesn't deserve it. There is fun to be found in everything.","May 7","true","185.2"," 220 of 328 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","220","328","9","13"

Unfortunately the over excessive use of hyperspace makes it feel boring as most of your time is spent in hyperspace looking at said glorified loading screen for hours on end.\n\nAfter finding the station you want to get to is several light-years away and that full speed ahead will still take you over half an hour staring at the glorified loading screen for the sweet spot in which the auto pilot tells you to slam down on the breaks in an effort to prevent you from impacting with said station at however many times the speed of light.\nI don't mind this aspect, that is if the prompt would pop at the correct time, this simply doesn't happen and you will inevitably end up significantly off-course from your objective, god forbid you run out of fuel in doing so, as you have no option other than to twiddle your thumbs in a tin can floating in the vast emptiness of space with a limited oxygen supply.\n\nOf course you could try and chase your fortune in becoming a miner, which isn't worth the thought as it just didn't pay in my experience, you sacrifice a weapon on your ship to give it the 'mining laser' which can cut through some of the most expensive and most durable minerals and metals in space, yet it won't scratch someone else's ship. if you get caught by pirates you're gonna have a bad day as you are now essentially unarmed with a full cargo of rare dirt. you'll either die or give up the rare dirt and have a slightly lower chance of dying.\n\nSo I've covered how to make money, now what to do with it?\n\nYou can upgrade your ship or buy new ships, you can't buy stations or any static property, hence `building up your space empire doesn't happen` oh and there is no point in buying more than one ship as you can't control them and have to keep them locked up in a hanger of your choosing.\n\nAlthough I have said mostly negative points they are all negative points which could be improved upon or even fixed entirely, for instance adding an AI to player owned ships so you can command them to carry out the dreaded glorified loading screen jobs, as the galaxy they have made is a strong point I don't see why they couldn't add some player owned stations such as guild halls as it would offer a completely new front to the PVP field.\n\nAs for my recommendation, I wouldn't recommend this in its current state, especially not for full AAA price, I would however be willing to change my mind if the dev team concentrated on updating the balancing of the play-styles and sorting out the grinding aspects. It just needs a little dusting up.\n\nEdit:This review is now outdated and several major flaws that I ridiculed have now been resolved, please don't base a purchasing decision on this review.","May 21, 2015","false","132.6"," 197 of 293 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","197","293","4","2"

I spent a decent 8-12 hours in the game exploring, fighting, trading. I will say that it was quite enjoyable until I realized that the core game has not been improved in any way since the power play expansion. The game also suffers from some ridiculous frame drops ( I run 2x980's), so very poorly optimized and It has been two months since this expansion was released. The statistics of players that support and play the game has also been steadily dropping, likely due to the obvious money grab that this expansion has shown itself to be. It seems they forgot their initial goal of providing a solid PC space game and are now more worried about profits and maximizing their player base by porting to consoles.\n\nPlease, do research before you purchase this game. At one point I would have urged you to purchase this game without a second thought. Since the beta this game has progressively disappointed, mostly due to negligent development. (likely publishers pushing profit based logic).\n\nLots of potential in this game, utterly ruined. The game will likely die after this expansion, I will be surprised if another comes out. However, if that is the case and the game succeeds I will be waiting until all expansions are out, then purchase the most recent one and get ALL the content from the previous ones.\n\nSo let this one go for now. Maybe in a few years it will be complete.\n\n\nThis game is quite amazing, I would have normally given it a positive review, however, in light of the most recent "expansion" I cannot recommend this game.\n\nFD announced The Horizons expansion to the game, which will include lunar-like landings, a landing craft and finally some, I stress SOME landable planets. Be aware these planets will not be earth like at all, and as of now they stated only atmosphereless planets will be explorable, to what extent has been yet to be released. On top of that, walking around in your spacecraft (a mechanic that was available before in earlier versions but removed due to bugs in the system, on FD's part) is being offered as a major part of this expansion.\n\nAll that sound fantastic even though right!?!??\n\nWell, for someone who already owns the game or backed it as a beta player you will be forced to pay another $40 for this 'expansion'. (Unless you spent the $150 on the ultimate pass). HOWEVER, new players who buy only the expansion will get both the base game as well as the expansion at the $60 price point.\n\nThey have also announced that these sort of expansions will be recurring in years to come, following the season pass business model, which leads me to believe more $40 price tags for what I assume would otherwise be patches and updates. It could even go to a $60 per 'season pass' after this one, that is yet to be known however following their current line of logic it is likely.\n\nThis is a blatant move of disrespect on the part of Frontier. They are pidgeon holing their current consumers while enticing new ones in. I will no longer recommend or support this game until this 'expansion' is either free to current owners of the game, or is GREATLY reduced to a price befitting an expansion. The content that was already in (for beta this was the ability to see your commander, and walk around), and promised to be released with the game has now become premium content.\n\nThis game is 'pay once to play' as far as most are concerned, and this expansion is just paying for more content. This means the game IS NOT a pay once to play model, and in fact you are paying for a subscription fee every year you want to continue to be able to play with the active players.\n\nThis sort of business practice is what is killing the AAA gaming market.\n\nGo spend you money on something more worthwile until this issue is resolved.","August 6, 2015","false","17.7"," 215 of 323 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","215","323","5","4"

Elite: Dangerous is an awesome game trapped inside a good game. Don't get me wrong, it is absolutely oozing with potential. Most of my criticisms ape the problems other people had with the game the whole notion of A Mile Wide and an Inch Deep is no exageration here. The framework is there. It is played out on a lovingly crafted engine that creates beauty procedurally and lets you fly through it in a well programmed control system. This game has so much polish you can see your face in it. You can was the glee drain from your face as you realise that once you've run back and forth with a few missions, pirouetted in a bunch of dogfights and landed your ship a handful of times. You've burned through all the "gasp wow" moments the game had to offer.\n\nEverything else is just growth by increments. Fly back and forth between stations until you get a bigger ship that can fly more between stations. The missions are procedureally generated and fall into 4 broad categories "Take this mcguffin to this place", "Go out and obtain the following mcguffins then come back", "Go kill these people and possibly take their mcguffins". Oh and "Donate money to this station because reasons"\n\nThe dogfighting is tight and action packed but feels very lonely and inconsequential. It wouldn't feel entirely alien to have the fights played out in timed rounds like counterstrike or something similar where everything resets at the end of the fight and you roll out to fight again. The limited variety of weapons in the game leave the meta stuck at the ground floor again, similar to roundbased twitch games.\n\nAt the moment if I want to dogfight, there are better games for that, and if I want to haul cargo there are better games for that. There are games that offer more meta and certainly more human interaction.\n\nThis is less a "Don't buy this game" and more of a "don't buy it yet" wait for Frontier Software to fire out some more of the (very) promising additional content they are singing about. My flightstick now sits on the top of my wardrobe waiting for the day when I will look at what Frontier have added to Elite Dangerous and go "Daaaaaaamn I gotta play me some o that".\n\nBut that's not now.

Only bounties are really shared and there are no team missions. There are few to no objective markers and very little is co-ordinated.\n\nAll of the stations are the same and against the promise of scope there is in fact only a few types of planets and stars mixed endlessly to create the false image of a grand game.\n\nWhile the game certainly has promise there is no way to play with friends nor co-ordniate in such a way that would make it meaningful. Even worse, there is no real purpose to solo play and no way to generate money effectively short of trading, which very quickly becomes a torturous grind.\n\nI tried for over 40 hours to like this game. I wanted it to be good so badly. The co-operation, objectives and progression is so ♥♥♥♥ed up you will suffer playing this game. After you get the Type 6 freighter the price of ships raises exponentially, and profits do not. It would take well over 100 hours of pointless "back and forth" mindless deliveries of the same products to reach the best ship, and at the end of all of that, your reward is....\n\nNothing. Nothing at all. Your anaconda will be sent on the same missions you can acheive with a Cobra.\n\nThere's making your own fun, and then there's Elite: Dangerous. If you thought the real universe was empty, wait until you get into this gem.\n\nThat said. If random generated missions with no meaning and endless delivery is, to you, a satisfying backdrop to driving a starship, then you might get some hours out of it. I hope one day in the future the developers make this game into something worthwhile but as it stands it is a torturous waste of time.\n\nDon't get into it.","July 11, 2015","false","51.3"," 322 of 495 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","322","495","6","26"

It lacks direction for the player and is a complete sandbox that will probably keep many casual gamers away, but this is a great game if you are willing to put in some time to get started and figure it out.\n\nThe graphics and sound still blow me away.\n\n\nUpdate: After 20 hours of gameplay I can start seeing the bigger picture. I've also shown this game to a few friends and we now have a group of seven people for our private group (you play on a private server with people in your group).\n\nExploration is very time consuming, but a lot a of fun. Its mostly predicting where planets/solar systems will be in a specific system and trying to find them with scanners. We're currently trying to find unexplored systems with good spots to bounty hunt/buy ships/trade.\n\nCombat is what keeps me the playing the game for many hours at a time. Dog fighting is very satisfying and everything about it just feels right. Controlling the multiple systems while in a fast paced battle results in vastly different skill levels amongst different players. This doesn't mean you need skill to do combat. You simply adapt your skill to a style. The best players can play in fast ships with close range weapons while others can back you up with missles, take shields off with lasers, or even snipe with railguns.\n\nNone of us have engaged in trading as of yet. Likely to try it out once we can afford some nice trading ships. We do know that exploration ties heavily into trading. Finding two systems that have differing functions close to eachother results in easy money from trading as they will buy the other systems goods.\n\nKnowledge is a great source of power and wealth in Elite Dangerous.\n\nOur group started with goals. The first being to find a system to call home and work around. Followed by finding shipyards and stations with good ships and outfitting services which we are still working on.\n\nLater goals are likely to be extensive exploration / checking out faction wars / picking minor factions to support in our turf. Haven't decided if we want to play in the open world format. We are actually just looking to get our private group big enough to enjoy all aspects of the game as this game is a ton of fun with friends.\n\nGame has been a load of fun for us. If you like space simulation games you'll enjoy Elite Dangerous. Might want to wait for the price to drop if you are unsure, but I think many players will enjoy the game as long as they know what they are getting into.\n\nThere is no main story. There is no real direction of you need to go here and do this. You start in a station and can do whatever you want which many people will take hours just figuring out what that even means. If you create that direction for yourself this just might be the space sim you always wanted. If not you will likely quit from boredom within a couple days.\n\nExplore, Trade, and Fight. in 400,000,000,000 systems that are all massive in scale themselves.","April 4, 2015","true","29.8"," 103 of 145 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","103","145","0","0"

You are a nobody in the whole wide universe, but work with the community and you can change it little by little: Help terraform a planet and expand civilization by transporting the necessary materials - side with the rebels in a star system to overthrow the existing goverment (or the opposite, crush the resistance!) by taking part in the war - and who knows what the devs will come up with next..\n\nBest part for me though is you can play vastly different roles, that actually matter (even if only a tiny bit) within the universe - and you can do this playing solo (no griefers and still all the community fun).\n\n- Exploration: 400 billion stars to explore! The fun is in finding desirable rare things such as earthlike planets and black holes, then selling the cartographic data for profit and also putting your name on a planet as the first to discover it. Will you play it safe making short trips near on the edges of civilization ? Or will you go an a month-long journey to explore the edges of the galaxy ? What if you carry data worth millions and happen upon a skilled pirate ?\n\n- Pirating: It's not always as simple as blowing up other players. Many pirates will let you go for a price. But pirates beware, for as soon as you commit any crime inside civilized star systems you should be very afraid when another ship beginns to "scan" you. You'll be hunted down if you happen upon a security ship or even worse...:\n\n- Bounty hunters: You'll be having fun hunting pirates, taking part in small- or large scale wars. Or why not team up ("wings") with a trader and see hiim safely through anarchy space ...for a price ?\n\n- Traders: If you fancy yourself as a trader, prepare to be noting down prices alot (or use online crowdsourcing tools), searching the map for industrial and high-tech places or agricultural and terraforing places etc to trade between. Or maybe you'll make your mark as a trader of rare goods, which become more profitable the farther away you sell them.\n\n- Miners: Tired of blowing up ships? Then blow up some rocks! You'll be searching for pristine metallic reserves in asteroid belts and rings, hunting down the pieces you laser off said asteroids and racing to a place in need of your metals and minerals. Beware though, pirates are aware of your favorite places.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an immersive experience look no further. Just be patient in the beginning while learning the controls and understanding how the universe and your ship's parts work. It is well worth it - and this coming from a player who really seldomly plays the same game more than a couple hours.","April 15, 2015","true","152.4"," 82 of 113 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","82","113","6","0"

I say this as a compliment, this game is unique as it's one of the few games to truly embrace what is required for a game to have serious longevity, massive amounts of boredom seperated by instances of knee jerkery.\n\nWhat I just said probably won't interest most players though and that's the real shame here since this is an incredibly well done experience.  The level of immersion in this game is borderline annoying but somehow that just makes everything better.\n\nIn this quasi mmo experience you are not a unique and special snowflake like in every other mmo experience, you aren't here to save the world, you are not the prophecy fufilled and no one cares about what you do.  Just attempt to learn how to pilot your ship, try to make money and generally just get by...and that's pretty much everything you need to know about this game.\n\nI recommend everyone buy this game not because I know every one of you will like it, I want you to buy it to give more money to the developers so they can continue expanding this amazing game, but if you don't like it and you feel you wasted your money then you should come back here and say "This review was helpful" because clearly I warned you.\n\nSeriously, I really did my best to warn you.","April 5, 2015","true","11.5"," 96 of 137 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","96","137","15","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalileanMoon/recommended/359320/","GalileanMoon","Callisto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalileanMoon/","84 products in account","Rewriting my original review since 1.3 came out and changed the game in many ways for the better!\n\nAlso note that while I don't have that many hours clocked in at the time of writing, I played the game months before the developers gave pre-Steam purchasers Steam keys. I would estimate I have played 200 hours, 220 total if you include the 20 hours I've already clocked on Steam\n\nElite: Dangerous is a fantastic game. It's certainly not for everyone, but I don't see how anyone could deny that what it does right, it REALLY does right.\n\nElite: Dangerous is a space simulator game set in a recreation of our Milky Way, with 400 billion stars to explore. It uses procedural generation to keep that insane number up and it's gigabyte total down.\n\nBut only a couple hundred systems are actually inhabited, and if you don't plan on being an explorer, this is where all of the action will happen.\n\nThere's many different careers you can choose from. The most profitable and infamous one is trading. It's undeniably profitable, but also boring to many. This used to be the only way of making money quick, but post-release updates have made other careers viable as well.\n\nBounty hunting can be a good and fun way of making money, but you're gonna need a decently kitted out ship before you go down that path. You can also mine asteroids for metals and minerals. Mining was greatly buffed in the 1.3 update with the inclusion of collector drones, automated drones that collect cargo and bits of asteroid so that you don't have to pick it up manually.\n\nSmuggling is like trading except with illegal goods. You can smuggle drugs, slaves, or regular commodities that you got from an illegal source. Smuggling is slightly more profitable but also risky, because if you get caught while hauling a big load of drugs, you'll have quite the fine to pay off.\n\nThen there's exploration, which utilizes the 400 billion stars. Once you get a few hundred light years out, you'll start finding systems that *literally* no other player has been to before. When you eventually come back to civilization with your exploration data to sell, systems that you were the first to discover will be marked with your name on the map of that system.\n\nOnce feel like you've made enough money with any of those career options, you can dive into Powerplay. Powerplay was introduced into 1.3 and adds much needed end game content.\n\nPowerplay is a galactic conquest. You can pledge allegiance to a Power which will give you special benefits and rewards, and you'll then be able to help your Power out in a number of ways. These differ depending on what kind of Power you pledged to. Some are focused on combat, like the pirate Archon Delaine, and some are focused on diplomacy and finance, like Felicia Winters of the Federation.\n\nWhen you join a Power, you are subject to attacks from members of opposing Powers, which can be both NPCs and other players (you'll only see other players if you choose to play in Open mode).\n\nYou are also free to attack members of opposing powers without penalty from your own Power.\n\nThe whole point of Powerplay is to maintain the systems your Power owns while at the same time expanding into new ones. Both steps are crucial, as players of opposing Powers can attempt to undermine your control and expansion attempts, meaning you need to coordinate and group up with fellow Power players to get work done.\n\nThere's a lot more to Powerplay but this is a review of the entire game, so I should move on.\n\nElite: Dangerous is divided into 3 modes of play.\n\nOpen play will match you other Open players whenever possible.\n\nPrivate group is where you can easily set up a private game with up to 31 friends, where you all will be guaranteed to get in the same instance together, without interruption from unwanted players.\n\nIn Solo you are the only player.\n\nAll of these modes affect the universe in the exact same way. Solo players can affect Powerplay in the same universe as Open players, it's all interconnected. Some see this is a good thing, and some see it as a bad thing.\n\nMany Open players believe that Open should have some extra reward, since you are taking extra risk by playing in Open. Solo/group players say that would be unfair to them who chose to play the game the way they want.\n\nPersonally, I think it's a genius system, but not one without flaws. Open players do have a point. Solo play has a lot less risk for the same reward.\n\nBut at the same time, E:D is not supposed to be a game about huge player combat. Sure, there are PvP encounters in Open, but the game isn't about that, and the fact that the game is instanced means that it would never be able to support Eve-like encounters anyways.\n\nBut in the end, it's great that players have the choice to play how they want, whenever they want. I am exclusively an Open player but I see why people would like the calmness of Solo.\n\nLet's talk about the cosmetics. The graphics and audio of this game are fantastic. The audio has to be heard with headphones, everything is just so detailed and you really feel like you're in a spaceship.\n\nSame with the graphics. Space is beautiful, and the game's amazing lighting amplifies that even more, and it still runs great on almost any rig.\n\nElite: Dangerous is hands down the best VR game yet. I've had the chance to try it in an Oculus Rift DK2 with a full joystick and throttle setup, and it's breathtaking. It works so well because of the nature of the game. In real life you're sitting in a chair with a stick and throttle, and in the game you're sitting in a chair with a stick and throttle. It translates perfectly.\n\nYour inputs actually translate into the game, you can look down and see your character moving the controls the same way you are, which is obviously amazing in VR.\n\nSpeaking of controls, there's lots of options and they are all great. In VR you basically have to use a joystick and throttle for maximum immersion, but on a monitor there's tons of great options. Keyboard and mouse works perfectly, gamepads work great, you can even use a single joystick without a throttle if you have one lying around.\n\nThere's currently 22 ships in the game. The goal is to eventually have 30 ships, but what's there is already very diverse, and there's plenty of ships for each price range.\n\nThe game has a very ambitious future. What's planned for paid expansions is the ability to get out of your seat and walk around your ship, or even get out of your ship to walk around space stations or board other ships. They are also planning seamless planetary landings. We haven't seen any of this in action yet so don't buy it because of what the game might be, but it's still good to be informed on what they're planning.\n\n\nLet's end it with some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n* Amazing graphics and audio\n\n* Decent variety in career paths to keep it from being too boring\n\n* Best VR game to date\n\n* Great ship variety\n\n* Seamless mode transitions and easy-to-set-up private friend groups\n\n* Good co-op functionality with the Wings feature\n\n* Great range of options for controls that all work great\n\n* Implements real life astronomy. If you love astronomy in real life, there's tons here to keep you interested in it's scientific side.\n\n* Fun mission system\n\nCons:\n\n* Easy to get burned out when going for the high tier multi-million ships\n\n* Peer to peer architecture causes some connection issues and also makes it relatively easy to exploit the game (the devs are thankfully cracking down on this and have banning lots of people recently)\n\n* Some minor bugs\n\nThis isn't the game for everyone. It isn't non-stop combat and thrills. But the uncertain nature of the game makes those encounters all the more exciting when they do eventually happen.\n\nDo some research, watch some videos, and decide for yourself. This game is perfect for me and what I like, but if you are looking for an arena-combat type of game, this isn't it.\n\nThanks!","June 12, 2015","true","93.9"," 121 of 178 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","121","178","4","0"

Entertaining at first.\n\nBut then you come to know the grind. A boring grind, at that.\n\nI'm going to give you the basic ideas of this game and not get into the small details, such as ship hardware/weapons.\n\nThis is a game where you can do missions, trade, mine, explore and bounty hunt. Out of these options, only two, arguably three are worth your time.\n\nThe missions are all stale and repetitive as hell, and don't provide much reward for your time unless you're in the early game.\n\nTrade is basically just taking your time to figure out a good route, and going from point A to B and back again selling things. That's about it. Sometimes you'll get attacked by an NPC, but mostly you can just run away unscathed. Possibly the most boring and time consuming part of this game.\n\nMining is pretty RNG heavy and not very profitable.\n\nExploring consists of going very very far away from civilization and looking at planets and stars, scanning them, and then returning home. Eventually you'll find what spherical objects are more worth looking for and it will quickly turn into a stale grind.\n\nAnd finally, bounty hunting. Bounty hunting in this game is the number one reason I've played it as long as I have. The best way to get money, in my opinion. You go to a resource extraction site (mining area) and pick off NPC pirates that spawn and try to kill the NPC mining ships fruitlessly. The ship combat is fun to a point, but as with everything else in this game, turns into a stale grind.\n\nThe point of making all of this money?\nBuy a better ship. Buy better weapons and parts.\nAnd when the price gaps between ships go to extreme amounts after the early game, that's when you maybe begin to realize: "Oh. This game is a grind and there's not enough to do to keep me interested."\nAnd you stop playing.\n\nIf I only had to pay $25, or $30 at most, this may have been a more positive review.\n\nThis game is still in early access. The devs just don't have it labeled as such.","July 19, 2015","false","130.6"," 171 of 261 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","171","261","3","21"

No stations for atleast another 40,000 light years. It was at this moment I knew I was screwed , i turned off my engines , life support and all none vitals. An eery silence set in , as I started gasping for breath. 4 mins left of oxygen..... dont panic I tell my self while looking into the black abyss. I light up a cig while looking at the self destruct button and contemplating letting go of all i fought for:80 tonnes of cargo , solar system after solar system of map data and most of all my precious ship. I bring up my Firefox , a quick google search , "help im stuck in space and have no fuel". First result "fuelrats.com". Holy ♥♥♥♥ , is this real!?!? I think to myself. Only one way to find out. I turn back on life support and continue to breathe again , and frantically input my commander name , and location. Within 20 minuites a beautiful sight was seen on the horizon. My saviour! Luck would have it the fuel rats came and transfered some fuel to me , enough to make it back to the nearest space station with my hefty cargo hold. If only they knew what was in there , I just hoped they wouldnt do a cargo scan...\n\nThis is why I love this game , it's a game where you create your own stories and live them out fully fleshed , anything can happen at anytime while online and the most immersive space sim anyone could own. There are many communities in the game such as the "fuelrats" that go out of their way to make the very expansive world feel more full of life.

At first i was like yay let's play this awesome space game. This game is so boring that even writing this review is boring.\n\nGame constantly rips your soul and hopes with every patch.\nBefore community goals we had community that searched for ways to give you ways to make you rich. Like smuggling seeking luxuries. It got nerfed and deleted.\nWith power play there came high risk slave trade smuggling which made quite a buck, but fun is forbidden in this game, only Korean MMO grind is allowed here! So it gets nerfed 3x so it's actually less profitable than legal trade but with thrills and chills from possibly getting astronomical fine!\n\nWhat you can do in this game? Is it Eurotruck in space? Not even close, in ETS2 you have stunning scenery. Here you have red ball and black background with dots, more dots more dots. You trade from A->B you worry about pirates? Go to single player and middle finger those mmo players that try to bring something thrilling to the game.\n\nExploration? Be the first guy who gets shot by another guy in center of galaxy because lot of people try to visit this scenery, so once again you'll probably go into solo because your exploration ship is no match for full combat armed conda parked in the center of galaxy just to shoot you down. Exploration boils down to, red ball, hit scanner, yellow ball hit scanner, white ball, hit scanner, something ball hit scanner.\n\nSmuggling? Same as trading but without the profit and with risk of police scanning you and giving you big fat fine.\n\nBounty hunting? Why you even try? Bounty hunting in big ship will barely make enough credits to repair your ship integrity repairs.\n\nMining? Underpaid spacerock blasting and sending drones to pickup floating rocks, no skill required, no profit gained.\n\nGlorified grinding game where you have no sand in your sandbox. This game does not simulate anything. Trading same route for 4 months with no change to supply or demand. Solo/Open play does not matter same boring stuff.\n\nSound effects are epic in this game and that's about it.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo do other things than ultra boring grindfest trading, you have to do trading to fund your other desires. If you die in ship that cost quite a lot, expect hours of trading to pay back insurance costs. If you die you lose hours of tedious boring grinding trading.\n\n","June 10, 2015","false","116.2"," 291 of 462 people (63%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","63","291","462","29","2"

If that is a comment on the state of the gaming industry (AAA and unfortunately, now indie) or my general cynical bullsh*t is a question for another day.\n\nLike so many other titles I've played recently I was floored by the initial impression I got from Elite: Dangerous. The graphics are beautiful on my freshly built, glowy gaming pc, the flight mechanics are out of this world (enough to buy the game for if that's your modus operondi) and tooling around with a joystick is incomparable, and the scale and beauty of the universe (1:1 scale of the Milky Way I've read) is breathtaking. That being said, it feels kind of like... an arcade game? I don't know something crucial is really missing here. There are obvious culprits, the missions are lackluster, even when compared to the considrably dreary missions of EVE Online, the carebear professions are horrifically one note and not satisfying, and there is just a wall of boredom and shallow gameplay you will run up against that is utterly game breaking for me.\n\nI played my first week as a mission runner and then a bounty hunter when that got tiresome. At first bounty hunting, with my real life friend who also purchased the game, was a blast. We flew into nav points, resource extraction sites, and even interdicted a few wanted criminals and blasted our way to a small fortune. The fights are sometimes interesting, but 9 out of 10 times you will be assisted by security forces or other credit hungry players and the fight will be one sided, and like everything else about this game, decidedly one note and flat. I honestly can't bring myself to log on and its got me even thinking nostalgically about EVE, which is not healthy. I might keep playing every once in a while with my friend, because like i said I am a cynical a**hat and he thinks this game is great. I always feel like the odd man out when reading raving comments on so many games that just feel sh*tty or unfinished, like people are dancing around the problems to get what enjoyment they can out of a game until the community collectively decides it sucks. Elite: Dangerous feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ waltz around a gaping black hole in that regard, and a lot of waltzers will get aggressive and throw sh*t at you if you point out that black hole, but I think that sentiment might stem from a desire to see this game succeed because of the awesome flight mechanics and the scale of the universe. I get that, everytime I get into flying I want so badly for this game to be better, but it just plain isn't.\n\nThe developers have promised a heap of features, walking on planets, entering cities, more social and building aspects, but I don't buy anything devs sell in that vain without proof anymore because I've been burned and (/equip Tin Foil Hat) keeping customers playing with false or unrealistic content promises is a good model for making a quick buck by keeping a solid enough playerbase to attract more suckers - I mean customers. I could only honestly reccomend this game to space flight buffs and Oculus users curious to try something other than walking down a creepy hallway or looking around a classroom filled with dolphins, and only at a reduced price, in its current  state. Personally I'm going to hold out hope that Star Citizen lives up to the hype, try to stay away from EVE until then, and kick myself repeatedly when this title goes on sale for half price before likely going belly up when the Devs can't deliver the moon, or at least the ability to land on one.\n\n3/10","April 24, 2015","false","39.3"," 261 of 413 people (63%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","63","261","413","28","6"

Up to this point in my life, I've been just another star citizen trying to earn a living... Stuck with a dead end job as a courier, delivering random cargo from station to station. Getting a lousy 10,000 Credits per delivery. Getting nowhere and stuck with this piece of crap ship that I inherited.\n\nBut today I had a chance for a big break. Saw a pretty shady assignment on the Bulletin Board, the task was to ship some illegal goods to another station. It wasn't slaves or drugs or anything bad like that - just alcohol and liquor which were banned in said station.\n\nThe rewards were pretty handsome. They were enough to afford me another ship and pay the insurance. A ship that is much faster and manoeuvrable; effectively cutting the delivering time. I took a while to contemplate if I should do this. After all, if the security forces discover my illegal goods, they would most likely blow me into oblivion.\n\n\n// LOG #2178: All or NothingLooking at my current way of life, there isn't much "Life" in it. It's just slogging day in, day out - scraping and barely making it through. Living isn't living at all. At this rate, I'm better off dead. At least the dead do not have to pay ridiculous taxes and insurance. With nothing to lose, and everything to gain, I took the job.\n\nThe journey was nothing short of a heart pumping, adrenaline packed one. Filled with evasive manoeuvres and praying to the Gods that nobody bothers to scan the cargo bay. Palms sweaty and my helmet soaking wet - I made it through the security clearance. Landed on the designated pad and delivered the goods. With haste, I claimed the rewards, bought a new ship and got the frak out of the system.\n\nIn the midst of that, I still managed to get another courier job from the Bulletin Board. Some neighbouring station in the next system needed Mineral Oils. I’m headed there anyways, so why the hell not? I will get to test this new baby out in flight and cargo anyways.\n\n\n// LOG #2179: A Near Life ExperienceThat Gods damn supply run could have well been my last.\n\nI was cruising to the next system in Frame Shift Drive (FSD) when I suddenly got a warning from the ship’s AI system. Consequently, my cockpit started to shake violently due to some unknown turbulence. The glass panels were began to crackle as though it was going to just burst into shards and expose me to the void. My engines rumbled in protest to whatever it was that was making it distressed. This has never to me happened before. I froze. I have no idea what was happening except that I was going to die in this newly bought space coffin.\n\nNo flight training prepared me for this. If I were on my legs at this moment, they would've buckled and turned into jelly. My eyes began to heat up and swell and I almost felt like crying and shouting for help, but we all know that “In space, no one can hear you scream.”\n\nDad was right after all. Spending hours and hours in a flight simulator and getting used to the flight system is never a bad thing – and I’ve been doing just that. The training kicked in and the first thing I did was to redistribute all the ship’s power to the shield generator for maximum defence. I needed to stay alive long enough to figure out just what the frak is going on.\n\nThe rattling of the entire ship grew even louder until with a sudden stop of velocity, the noise disappeared. The ship AI stated it stated that I was pulled out of FSD and for a moment there, I felt relieved. The next thing I heard would prove to me it was short lived.\n\n“Your ship is under attack” were really not the words I wanted to hear at that moment. I came to a realisation that I did not just “drop” out of FSD, I was PULLED out of it… Now I'm being attacked being the same clown who disrupted my flight path. Scanning frantically, I finally found his location on the DRADIS map. It was a heavily armoured ship with 4 hard point weapon systems attached to it.\n\nWith full power still on my shield generator, I diverted whatever power that was left to the engines to aid me in rolling and turning during this battle. I saw two more blips on DRADIS and thank the Gods, it was the system security coming to my aid.\n\nThe next 5 minutes were my first ever space combat out of simulation. And again, the training had paid off. The Heavy ship was too bulky to allow agile manoeuvrability. With my new light craft, I was able to tail behind it and keeping to its blind spots; taking pot-shots at it while it struggles to alight its weapons towards me.\n\nThe arrival of the system security ships was the cue for me to divert all power to my weapons, and whatever remaining power to my engines. The clown who pulled me outta space didn't last long. Not in this 3:1 fight.\n\n\n// LOG #2180: Trade ChangeI'm done delivering nonsense for nonsensical people. That last supply run is really my last. I've tasted blood. I've felt the adrenaline kicking in as I tried to roll and weave around in my ship; and I love it. From here on out, I'm going to be a bounty hunter. Time to start a new Pilot Log. And this Bounty Voucher that I'm supposed to turn in, let's see how much it is worth.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// PILOT LOG\n// NOMAD DARMADEUS\n// BOUNTY HUNTER\n// DEATH COMPANY\n\n// LOG #0001: FIRST DAY, FIRST KILLFirst day on the job as a Bounty Hunter. I never know what roses smelled like, but I'm sure it smells like a blown up wreckage of a wanted pirate and the pay check that comes afterwards.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// SUMMARYThis was my personal experience while playing Elite: Dangerous.\n\nThe Graphics are fantastic and really well done. Space stations are filled with neon lights and advertisements. Wheeled vehicles can be seen moving about in the hangar bay. Space travel looks absolutely fantastic. The nebulae, planets, stars and EVEN COMETS are a sight to behold. Even on this old GPU of mine (GTX 560 Ti 1GB VRAM), I’m getting a stable 50-60FPS.\n\nThe sound design is fantastic and the whole design of the game really sucks you into it. It’s as though you are there, in the cockpit, manning the flight sticks and controls. This game has a level of immersion that I have never felt before. Because I literally felt like crying and my legs went jello when I was being pulled out of FSD.\n\nTip for new pilots: Master your training before you play in the open world. Practice your combat drills over and over again so that when something like this happens to you, you are prepared for it.\n\n10/10.","June 19, 2015","true","81.0"," 175 of 275 people (64%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","64","175","275","43","6"

Though the game is not SUPER complex, without knowing a few of the basics you will get lost, and traveling at ludicrous speed and trying to figure out how you get out of supercruise is not a fun chore.\n\nThe game really shines everywhere in my opinion, it is beyond measure in size, it is BEAUTIFUL even on an Nvidia 660TI, the combat is fun, but what I love most...\n\nThe immersion.\n\nHow do they do it you ask?  There is nothing you can't do from your cockpit, in fact, everything is done in the cockpit, as though you were sitting in the seat of your own spacecraft.  Need to check what sun that is you are flying dang near into?  Turn your head to the left.  Need to get into your ships sub-systems and turn on some external lights so you can see the wreckage you found exploring?   Turn your head right.  The way the menus are done just floors me, I feel like I am really there.\n\nStory time!\n\nSo, today, about 7 hours into my actual game play, I ended up getting a little to close to a sun.  Got warm, ok not just warm, like hot and it started to fry my systems.  I lost lifesupport, shield recharger and my FTL, crud, going to run out of oxygen in 4:30...how do I get to a station for repairs in 4 minutes without my FTL?  Well...lets see what sort of systems we have in this thing...holy smokes a reboot and repair option under my sub-systems, lets give it a shot.  *ship goes dark, sun is bright, ship systems rebooting*, whoa, what the heck.  FTL has been repaired to 10%, I can divert all shield power and scanners to my FTL to get it to spool up and wammo!  On our way to repair city!\n\n^^^ That right there was probably the best experiance I have had in a game since Master Chief met the Flood for the first time.  I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings, I am headed out to a system a bit farther from the start, do some exploring, come back and sell my data, I think it will be a good day.\n\nFor those that stuck with it and maybe enjoyed what I wrote I hope it helps.","April 8, 2015","true","49.8"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","47","62","0","0"

More general thoughts below.\nThe rank order is as follows: helpless, mostly helpless, amateur, semi professional, professional, champion, hero, legend, elite.\n\nPotential: Elite\nWorld size: Elite\nSound: Legend\nGraphics: Hero\nFlying: Professional\nShip Variety: Professional\n\nLocation Variety: Amateur\nEquipment Variety: Amateur\nBounty Hunting: Amateur\nMultiplayer: Amateur\nMining: Amateur\nLongevity: Amateur\nMission variety: Amateur\n\nEconomy: Helpless\nTrading: Helpless\nSmuggling: Helpless\nExploration: Helpless\nPlayer/NPC interactions: Helpless\nMission narrative: Helpless\n\nPricing model: Helpless\nOutlook: Mostly Helpless\n\nGeneral thoughts:\n\n- It's not feature complete and it's not content complete.\nAll existing features are bare bones, never or barely touched again after original release.\nFor all intents and purposes, one year from release and now with a paid expansion in tow, this is still an Early Access title.\n\nPrime example - bounty hunting is just sitting in a certain location waiting for a wanted ship to appear, killing it in about 30 seconds and waiting for the next one to appear a minute later, repeat ad infinitum - sadly this is the general level of fidelity to expect.\n\nTwo main types of activities - combat (random encounters/fish in a barrel scenarios) and fetching (A->B trading/smuggling/mining). There's also exploration, but that is just flying from system to system and pressing a button.\n\n- Paid expansions only come bundled with the base game, so you'd have to pay for the base game every time (DOUBLE DIPPING WARNING) - you can play in the same universe without them though. First paid expansion is as bare bones feature-wise as the base game.\n\n- Great setting with beatiful sound and visuals and enormous, yet unfulfilled potential.\n\n- Roughly 40 hours of enjoyment to be had in the honeymoon phase, mostly due to the above.\n\n- Contrary to the game description, it's not an MMO and never will be. Instancing could be compared to lobby multiplayer, where you will have a lot of trouble getting into the same lobby with your friend(s). Generally in Open Play there's a handful of places where you can meet players and 95% of the time you won't see a soul.\n\n- Shrinking active player base - outside of sale/update spikes it's falling steadily. Now that there is a paid expansion with (some) planet landing, the number of players you might encounter in space will be further affected by the number sitting on planet surfaces, if they're not already in Solo Mode that is (always online single player universe). Out of the estimated ~600k owners on steam less than 1% plays the game regularly.\n\n- The game is not very difficult or complex (it's not a simulator in the proper sense of the word and that's perfectly understandable), flying/shooting is pretty arcade, instead the perceived complexity stems from lack of in game information that you need to find elsewhere (no in game help tooltips/popups for entry level players). It's not hard, it's just very unintuitive.\nTrial and error should suffice though, you should be up and running in an hour or so, few hours is enough to breeze through all mission types the game has to offer (some missions are so unintuitive that you might need to read wikis/forums beforehand though).\n\n- Overall, it's a game of great unfulfilled potential, marred by a disastrous pricing model and the lack of proper feature iteration. In short, it's a 1984 game design with 2015 graphics/sound.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nON SALE ONLY\n(around 2017 or 2018)","December 16, 2015","false","240.5"," 155 of 243 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","155","243","15","5"

I got this game far before it even touches steam, then after a year the game come to steam and they gave me free cd key, I really appreciate that! Some other companies dont give a damn about this and require you to rebuy just to get it on steam, / Elite: Dangerous is a game where you gonna either hate it or love it.\n\nFirst of all I refuse to call this game an MMO despite of the tag on store page says so, therefore there's often times many people ask whether this game has similarity with the popular space-mmo EVE Online. But it is very different, you won't find that massiveness in this game, the systems here are instanced to max of 32 players, so you never see those super-super crowd system like EVE's Jita. (Btw there's system called Jita too in Elite). So in short Elite is not MMO, just space game with multiplayer features (That's what I think!)\n\nI often people asking about, "is the game playable with keyboard and mouse setup?" "Do I need to buy stick for this?". Joystick isn't necessary, you should be fine with just keyboard and mouse. I am a KB+Mouse player, and I have no problem hitting elite in combat (still saving money for a good stick lol). However, joystick does help, because it gives you spatial information when you controlling your ship, while simple keyboard + mouse dont. Joystick also gives more immersion while playing. And if you're into this genre, I suggest you to buy yourself one, not just for this game, but many other games that you would enjoy playing with one. A simple Joystick or HOTAS, just choose based on your budget and personal preferences, as for in-game pilot, your character uses HOTAS setup.\n\nThe game does have microtransactions inside, in form of paintjobs (skin color) for your ships. But it is not necessary really. The only time you got to see your ships' exterior are when you in outfitting mode and debug camera. Some people do ♥♥♥♥♥es about this thing saying that FrontierDev are stingy or w/e, but come on, you're not going to miss anything without these paintjobs, unless you are that selfie-selfie explorer guys who like to take a good screenshot in style.\n\nSome others ask if the game is like X-series, but not at all. In this game you are just puny little pilot, not some kind of big shot that can build your own empire, raise your own armies, and wreck havock here and there. No you are just a pilot, and you alone can't change the world around you. You are just insignificant compared to the world to make the changes, however you and others pilots can work together to changes it, via powerplay, community projects, or other things. So yeah the world is less sandboxy, but it is not static either, this is kinda game where you make up your own story in your mind.\n\nThere's mainly 3 things you can do in this game. Trading, Combat, and Exploration. Trading is pretty straightforward buy low sell high, can also do smuggling illegal items, or you can also become just a space trucker delivering cargo people ask. Combat can branch into bounty hunter, mercenary, or pirate. As for exploration, well you just explore, go anywhere and claim virgins planet to immortalize your name on galaxy map. So far there's no planetary landing, no walk around your ship or stations, you are forever sitting in your cockpit, they said these are planned but dunno when it's gonna be implemented. All I know they have done this before on their previous game, Frontier: Elite II, the seamless planetary landing\n\nThe game is grindy to a certain degree. The most expensive ship Anaconda, cost hundred millions and that took a god damn long time, and that's just to buy the ship itself, the module outfitting costs can easily triple the ship cost itself! The game feels less alive compared to others, leaving it up to the player's imagination to make themselves feels alive. and I feel the NPCs are there just for the sake of being there. There are many times I was in deep Empire owned space, got interdicted by a puny Kumo Crew pirates in Sidewinder with measly 400Cr credits, he interdicted me and attacked me just to die, I mean how the hell he get here, this system has a very high security, oh well. Also the NPC dialogues are stiffs, and repeated, they should work on more varied dialogues, because once you hit hundreds of game time, it's same phrases repeated over and over.\n\nTrading is the fastest way to earn credits also it is the most boring thing out of others, once you figure out a trade route it's just grind time. And Taxi like missions aren't here yet even though we have space luxury taxy called Orca. Though, if you don't mind relaxed play, like Euro Truck Simulator 2, I think you are going to enjoy this Space Trucking thing.\n\nThe game is 1:1 replica of milky way, some systems are hand drawn, while others (most of them) are procedurally generated based on computer estimation.  Exploration is lacking in terms of depth especially without planetary landing features yet, you just go to random systems, scan potential objects, and jump to other systems, and repeat. Sometimes you gonna find a beautiful sceneries, stars, but most of times you are going to see.... well just your normal systems with nothing interesting,.. time to move on...\n\nThat's all, from me. I personally think this game isn't a complete game, just a framework of a bigger and better game. I personally can't thumb down this game because it will be a lie, I do enjoy the game and will keep playing it and see what new stuffs they bring. Buy the game if you're into this genre, have watched lots of review of it, and on sale.

Elite Dangerous could have been the game I've been looking for ever since the original Elite. It's got an amazing engine for generating the world around you procedurally and I'm sure it's a technical marvel in that sense.\n\nHowever, and this is a big however, the game is almost absolutely empty. Every system is so similar to the last system. There is barely a difference between the major factions, beyond a few ships they give you. It's so frustrating to be presented with a universe that looks so gorgeous and you want to find your way in and then find that the universe is so shallow and that you're limited to a few roles that are super repetitive. The universe is beautiful, but quite dead.\n\nThe economy is almost completely static. Missions are limited to basically a handful of types. Once you've seen the few types of starbases, you've seen them all - they're literally the same in all the factions. There isn't even a difference in style between factions, let alone base types.\n\nThe more I play this game the more frustrated I get with how sterile it is.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is an amazing engine running under all of this.

Yes the graphics are beautiful and it's a huge universe but it's also generic and repetitive and has pretty much been done before just on a smaller scale. Don't get me wrong, I'll come back to it every now and then as I enjoy the combat but thats where it ends for me fpr the following reasons:\n\n1. Smuggling is 2 dimentional, you just line up with the mailbox at 7.5k out, ask permission to dock, fly at full boost speed untill your in the docking bay so you don't get scanned by authorities, it's easy, and boring. Trading is the same except your not doing anything illegal.\n\n2. Ship customization is minimal and linear.\n\n3. Exploration is repetitive and boring, go to system, hold down button to scan, congrats your capable of holding a button, here have data you can sell for a minimal amount of credits, repeat.\n\n4. Military career consists of joining a conflict zone, popping a load of ships for an hour, going to a station to hand in combat bonds, realise you could have made more in 20 mins by being a bounty hunter.\n\n5. Pirating is just as boring, you can't even interact with NPCs to order them to drop cargo or surrender, it's just the same process of scan for cargo, oh look they have goods, target cargo bay doors, shoot some cargo loose, blow up ship, pick up cargo, repeat.\n\n6.I never once thought that even the most densely poplated systems where teeming with life, which is a problem given the theme.\n\nElite: Dangerous feels like it's got potential and it's certainly aethetically pleasing but the content just isn't there yet, it's like what COD is to ARMA in some ways.

Sadly it wasn't, even if I tried really hard to discover something which was. I feel Team Braben has created a good looking game but have no clue at all what's making a game fun to play. Here are my comments of current state of game. It has more or less been the same recent half year. Nothing has really changed for the better about my negatives...\n\n- Trade system:  If I take a risk to carry very expensive cargo I expect to earn more than when I carry cargo cheap as waste for example. That's not the case at all in this game. Several monthes ago you could find really lucrative trade routes where you felt you could earn credits for a new ship. But it's completely gone. When I play a game like this I expect at least from time to time find a golden route, but that's not the case at all any more. All price difference is more or less the same. It doesn't matter if you buy very expensive cargo or cheap like waste. You will earn equal much. Several times I have been suprised about the prices. At one time I bought very expensive cargo and just got 23 credit in profit for each ton even if I expected the station needs those cargo like industry needs metals and agriculture needs crop machines. The galactic average price doesn't work at all as those planets which you expect to have need of food or minerals or whatever buy it below average price more or less even if the planet is on a different system. The trade system is crap. They have completely ruined the trade system.\n\n- Mission: This has also become much worse than before. Before you could earn credits by taking from time to time lucrative missions (it's like finding a treasure), but no, no. Not anymore. You need to do lots of missions to gain faction 24h a day so you after lots of time invested in just that sun system can take mission which gives you little more money. They have completely destroy the mission system. Not fun at all. It doesn't feel like a game anymore, more like a boring work. You will not find any golden missions here either.\n\n- Combat is bland. Not so fun to deal with as I hoped. It cost a fortune if you loose your ship as money is hard to come by.\n\n- Mining feels like a work, even if the mechanism is fun, as you earn very little from it.\n\n- No story exist. Not even conflicts between worlds or alien invasions which draws you into the game.\n\nHowever the graphic and sound is really good. Sadly the rest really destroys the fun. I will change my review if I see the game change for the better (see my critics above). I will try the game maybe once each other monthes.","June 7, 2015","false","10.3"," 139 of 219 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","139","219","4","3"

Per my original review the game lacked a lot of features and was quite boring after the intiial learning curve. The expectation was that the base game would be developed further.\n\nNow it seems the strategy of the developers is to keep releasing $60 expansions for features that should be added free to the base game. This is a real kick in the face for supporters that bought the original game knowing it was bare bones and trusting the developers to flesh it out.\n\nStar Citizen releases in 2016, I would wait for that rather than give these guys another $60.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nI could have gone both ways with my recommendation but 1 thing is sure, ignore those people writing a review after 20 hours or less of gameplay as they have no idea what they are talking about. The game is in honey moon phase for those people where you are still learning to fly, learning the various careers (exploring, mining, trading, bounty hunter) and you don't mind grinding a little to get the next ship because the grind is a few hours, the game is fun.\n\nAs the game progresses trading becomes more and more powerful until nothing else compares from a credit earning point of view and at that stage all you are doing is flying between 2 stations buying and selling commodities in order to buy your next ship which costs a lot of money. My next upgrade requires 22 hours of this back and forth trade grinding.\n\nI think the game has a lot of potential however at $60 and considering current content I cannot recommend this game. It should have been released for far less with paid DLC later on. It really needs a lot more meat on it at that price.","April 13, 2015","false","87.4"," 207 of 336 people (62%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","62","207","336","9","12"

I don't really regret it, as the procedurally generated universe here is truly stunning -- you can effectively visit every star in our galaxy. That said, there is only one boring activity to do at 99.999% of them, and what there is to do at the rest is either boring, grindy, or both. The combat is the only fun part, and that pales in comparison to Star Citizen's Arena Commander. The game is extremely wide, but has all the depth of a kiddie pool.\n\nThe real reason I can't recommend this game is because of the newly announced Horizons expansion pack. It is going to cost the same as Elite: Dangerous, and include the entire game. This is awesome for new players -- you can get the whole game + the expansion for the same price as I paid for the base game. For me and anyone who's already purchased, though, it's a gigantic slap in the face: they're only offering us a 25% discount, effectively charging us nearly double for the same content. This is on top of a game that still feels very unfinished and has almost no interesting content past the first few hours except for PvP, which again, is done better in other games.\n\nDon't support these greedy devs. Check it out in a year or two, maybe it will be worth the reduced price then. For now I'd recommend checking out Star Citizen, or a classic like Freelancer.\n\nnote: my time played is significantly higher, did most of my playing before the Steam release.","August 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 139 of 221 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","139","221","4","3"

There is little wonder in exploration and attempting to get started on most of the content feels tedious. And even in open play the universe feels incredibly lifeless. Maybe this will change in future expansions, but at its core it feels like there is a fundamental lack of purpose in the game. I will likely keep playing it in the hopes of discovering something... SOMETHING in it, and there are small moments of brilliance (sound design, the first time you emerge from a jump in front of a star), but as it is, I cannot recommend this title.\n\nEditing to add some thoughts: You will notice that my playtime in this game is still going up, despite my review here. I am certainly finding things to enjoy about this game -- most notably now that I've started to just Captain Kirk my way across the stars into empty space. But I stand by my comment that much of the experience is hollow. The lifelessness has little to do with the emptiness of the universe, but more to do with the interactions as you have them. The only interaction you get seems to come from bulletin boards and news feeds. You never see anybody's face or have their voice spouting faction propaganda at you. Basically, your CMDR is extremely isolated from anything that might be going on in the game. There is no soul to the interactions that you can have. I think the idea is for players to experience an emergent story, but it's hard to get drawn in when your experience is kept at a sterile distance. So I've decided to just forget about the community part of the game and embrace lonely exploration. Because the game seems to do a simulation of that very well. It is a beautifully constructed simulation, and I don't mean to detract from that in what I am saying. I just can't really recommend it to others. Read some of the replies that others have given to me, though, and decide for yourself.","April 7, 2015","false","61.5"," 232 of 386 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","232","386","6","10"

Period\nI will start with one thing... This game could be considered boring to many people who arent interested in its game style and lack of leveling and any type of ending.I personally arent that into the dog fighting aspect as fights can sometimes take quite a long time, I will at least get into it oncel I obtain a better ship and systems, however I am loving the exploring. Planning out a route through the stars, finding new planets, naming nebulae you happen to find first, checking out different planets and reading all the different makeups of star systems and sometimes finding gems where a system could have 4-7 super massive stars!!! The entire Galaxy is ours to explore. If you like developing good relations with certain government factions throughout the galaxy then there is plenty of trading opportunities and jobs available to take from simple trade missions to outstanding bounties on known criminals in nearby systems.... If you want to make a name for yourself in the Galaxy, here is ur chance!!! As a scifi nerd, gamer and science buff.. This game was made for someone like me who just wants to explore the galaxy and see all its wonders!!!\nCurrently I an flying a Eagle class ship making my way towards the inner galactic center where I hope to find the galactic black hole as I wish to watch as stars wizz by and the black hole eats everything that comes near!!!!!","April 11, 2015","true","89.0"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","43","61","0","2"

I was hesitant to buy this game initially, after reading about how grindy it is, from all the reviews here, but when the Vive came out, I needed a good VR game to play. And despite the grind, I loved it for a bit. When I got too burned out on one thing, I'd take on a different role (ex, trader, explorer, miner, smuggler, bounty hunter). But with the latest 2.1 release, that's no longer possible. The NPCs will blow you out of the sky, within seconds, unless you have max out your ship for combat, making it useless for any of the other roles.\n\nPros:\n\n* Huge, mostly unexplored universe.\n* Great sense of immersion in VR.\n* Nice graphics and ambiance.\n* You have a lot of control over your ship.\n\nCons:\n\n* Way too grindy. And as of 2.1, you can barely earn enough to cover your insurance costs.\n* NPCs are overpowered and cheat.\n* Not enough variety to ship types and modules.\n* Most missions are pointless. Repetitive, not too fun and not enough reward.\n* Takes way too long to rank up. Most people do it through mission exploits, but many of those have been removed.\n* Very high learning curve, those first couple of days.\n* No way of building your own base/station, means there's little to work towards.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone right now. I'd wait for those other space sims to come out first. I figured this would hold me over until those come out, but it's become unplayable since the last update. Even without the AI changes, they've removed the most fun smuggling missions from the game, while simultaneously making other means of earning income much harder. It's grindy and shallow and all of the casual elements have been removed. It might be worth a look, if you're unemployed, but the devs seem to be moving further in the wrong direction, rather than address the avalanche of criticisms of this game.","May 28","false","259.1"," 73 of 114 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","73","114","0","3"

I guess some sort of cosmic gravity.\n\nEven though you are flying near "huge" space stations and gas giants nothing feels epic. The scale is all wrong. Planets are these little balls that hardly dwarf your ship, asteroid belts are tightly packed chunks that are more like an arcade game version of asteroids than the gut churning, roller coaster in the Star Wars franchise or even SWTOR... while you are on rails the effect is still cool.\n\nThe "giant" space station's scale is wrong. If you got out of your ship (as they promise is up coming) then you would tower above the buildings that surround the landing pad. I guess you are a space giant...  Maybe it is your mass that pulls the bullets you shoot downwards.\n\nThe game feels as incomplete as it actually is. There is little need for social interaction and even less a point in it. You can go solo and earn tons of money until you can afford an uber fighter and then go kill noobies in Open Play. If you are a noobie then there is no benefit to Open Play other than you can experience bankruptcy if you get griefed a couple times.\n\nThe story is not creative or original. If the game was incomplete but there was a cool premise then I might be more forgiving. Basically you have a federation, an empire and an alliance. (How many times has this been done?) There are a multitude of smaller factions spread out through the systems but they are aligned with one of the three and have some basic stories that go along with each but it all feels like it makes no difference.\n\nFederation advancement for me stalled out with an invitation to SOL, but it mattered little since I had basically paid for the rank with some "donations" and seemed to get no benefit by being a "Federation Officer", not even help when under fire near a Federation ship...\n\nDespite the weak story and stale game play I kept playing in hope that somehow it would connect and I would feel engaged but it never happened. Even as I upgraded ship after ship I could not help but feel let down as each felt and operated not much differently from the intro level ships.\n\nA space game should feel epic. The large celestial bodies should dwarf you, make you feel small and in awe of their power, the zones should be full of engaging obstacles or visually appealing scenery like a huge spaceship graveyard or battlefield, clouds of dust or debris and asteroids that are threatening. Space stations should be huge to the point of dwarfing you or small and cramped with gritty machinery and and underworld feel. Garish neon or advertisements hawking escapism, not the same exact wear pattern on every single space station sign. Did they only make one decal for the game? Maybe we are to believe that the space stations are mass produced and wear in exactly the same manner... everything exactly the same, only the location differs...\n\nIn this game if you have visited three or four stations you have practically seen the universe. If you choose to go exploring the systems quickly blend together as an endless, forgettable tapestry of boredom.\n\nThis game is worth $10 at best. It is not a AAA game, it is not engaging, it is not exciting and it in no way is original. The story is a stale cliche of space dramas, the universe empty and unappealing with wonkey scale. It is space ship simulator sold as a "sandbox" with an endlessly explorable universe. The only thing epic about this game is the degree to which you feel let down.","May 22, 2015","false","200.6"," 111 of 182 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","111","182","8","5"

I'm fine with the switch as it now shows the 'expansion' for what it really is; I'm not fine with the censoring of all those reviews.\n\nThey also lowered the price (by $7) and removed the base game from it. Now you have to buy both if you're a new player (for a higher price). This makes Horizon's an easier swallow for existing buyers, but they're still charging us for content to an extremely bare base game.\n\nNo other company I know has a business model like this.  It's awful.\n\n---\nThere's only 3 things to do in this game.\n\n1) Fly around transporting text from identical hangar to identical hangar for minimal text profit.\n2) Fly around trying to find pirates and destroy them for a text reward (or kill innocents yourself to become a pirate.. which just means people get text for destroying you; die and everything is forgiven).\n3) Fly around and go AFK for hours while you try to leave the map and explore systems that somehow haven't been explored yet, for a text reward.\n\nThere's some slight variations on that, but it's basically all the same.  Mining is the only different one, but it's so barebones that it's not even worth mentioning (shoot at rock, get text, sell text).\n\nI got a week worth of playtime, and I had to push myself to do that.  Bought an x52 to do it with too.\n\nIt is fun (and very immersive) at the start, but once you see the game for what it is, there's nothing to do but grind and grind and grind for text (credits) or text (reputation).\n\nWhat's worse than having next to no content?  They're charging the full retail price for an update, a 'season of expansions' they're calling it, for a feature they promised to be in the game in their Kickstarter. Edit: Which is nothing more than the Mass Effect 1 planet rover. Actual planet life, and walking on it, dubbed "Atmospheric Landing" will "hopefully" be in the next paid "season of expansions" in 2017.\n\nWhat's worse than that?  They plan to have multiple paid updates.\n\nAnd even worse?  The season pass for those updates is $200. Edit: And was $50 in beta before most people knew about the game. Edit2: And now you can't buy it anymore.\n\nFrontier have rapidly become scumbags, like Bandai Namco charging for Dark Souls 2's DX11 update.  Hell, now that I think about it, I'm surprised they didn't charge for the Powerplay update. Edit: Apparently the ability to form a party was considered expansion content too.\n\n\nAvoid Elite: Dangerous, for now.  Maybe in a few years it'll be a complete game with a standard price; but until then, they just want to bleed your wallet dry so they don't bleed to death.\n\n\nOh, did I mention the flight controls are identical to a plane and not a spaceship? If this is your first 'space sim' with a joystick, you'll be forever tainted by the abnormal flight model compared to every other space game I know of.\n\n\nI wasn't terribly interested in No Man's Sky, but now it's looking like the game to play while we all wait for Star Citizen.","August 5, 2015","false","222.1"," 75 of 119 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","75","119","3","0"

Admittedly the older AI was fairly easy, but then again the entire playing community are not the hardcore extremists who want harder AI. This insane 2.1 patch has basically done 2 things, anyone who wants to be JUST an explorer or Trader, cannot survive, everyone has to become a Top Gun pilot otherwise no chance of survival and secondly it requires everyone to buy Horison season pass, otherwise fighting the super buffed AI NPCs with fully modded ships (something people who do not have Horizons cannot access) is insanely difficult if not impossible. So in essence the developers are blackmailing people into buying the season pass otherwise the games new AI is unplayable (for new players as well as at least 50% of the existing players). Funny thing is, I was about to buy Horizons, but when I played the current 2.1 patch, I realized I was being blackmailed, I dont bend to others will so easily.

I’m used to games where you grind for money such as EVE online, however, with EVE online you have a multitude of ways to invest your hard earnt money such as building player owned space stations or assisting in developing your corporation/alliance. With Elite Dangerous, the only thing you need money for is to buy a bigger ship or a better upgrade.\n\n2) Although this game is labelled as an MMO, player to player interaction is extremely rare at best and never encouraged. In my 140 hours of play, I came across 2 other players that said 'hi' and then went about their business. Not sure if the developers intend to improve this but DO NOT buy this game on the proviso that it is an MMO. Honestly... it feels like a single player game. Even a galaxy wide chat channel would assist this greatly as this would give ED a sense of community.\n\nI got to 140 hours of play and finally realised... WHY AM I DOING THIS???? I thought to myself…. after grinding for what would likely be 100’s of hours to get the best ship, what would I do next?\n\nI really wanted to love this game and it has A LOT of potential, however, it just doesn’t deliver in its current state. I will continue to keep an eye on this game in the hope it will become something greater, but for now….I’m done!","February 12","false","140.0"," 54 of 83 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","54","83","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stasisthebest/recommended/359320/","stasisthebest","KiKaHa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stasisthebest/","22 products in account","In this world, the world of steam, the world of "free" games, the world we let our minds take a journey in order to live the life we can't, wont experience, or maybe some feel like they need to relive those exact moments, Elite: Dangerous grabs us right by the "feels" and does not let go. This game is astonishingly beautiful and at the same time simple. It is huge and at the same time pretty small. It is filled by the stars but it delivers a perfectly empty feel to the space.\n\nIf you are one of those players like me that simply love flight simulators of every form and shape you WILL ADORE this game. if youhave ever played any other space simulators (freelancer in my case) you wont even be able to let it go. If I might parafrase a comment I read this game is a skeleton, a solid, made out of high carbon steel skeleton but it is still a skeleton of an awesome game but it lack some meat and even a little fat on it.\n\nDon't get me wrong. from my point of veiw, if YOU are even considering of buying this game and therefore are reading this comment then you are most probably couple of minutes late, YOU should have bought it already, yes it is expensive, but so are your jeans. and even if u are having doubts think of it this way: how many cinema tickets will you be able to buy with this money? now how long are u planing on playing a SPACE ODYSSEY MMO? and all that time you WILL enjoy.\n\nSO I WILL GIVE YOU MY GOOD AND BAD INPRESIONS, AFTER ALL THIS IS A REVIEW.\n\nGOOD\n\n1). Space, more precisely milky way all of it as we know of it.\n2). You can do quests (kill, assassinate, carry cargo, carry mail, find somewhere ressources),\n3). You can be a trader (buy low sell high)\n4). Pirate (hunt traders) - I do not recomment starting with this as your gear will make your targets laugh in your face.\n5). Explorer (find something new, analyze it, sell that info, and map will forever say: first discovered by "your name")\n6). Boutny hunter (just go fly random and kill bad guys (go on a ringed planet where u can find exploration location and camp there = profit) which gives you their bounty and increases reputation).\n7). There is a single player.\n8). in a master pilot's hands even the begginer ship that costs 40k can win vs 20mil ship (notice: luck also required) therefore you are not only as good as your gear are.\n\nBAD\n\n1). quests are repetive and give low time to profit ration but are best to begin.\n2). not borring but repetitive docking procedure ( I advise on buying docking computer ASAP)\n3). Space is to big and empty, what I mean is that number of random events and unique locations is somewhat low.\n4). No leading/main quest/campaign which makes you wonder around if you are new to this genre.\n5). being a bounty hunter is the only profitable AND fun thing.\n\nSEMI\nnot exactly bad but not a good thing: the range and variety of ships in this game is somewhat lacking. from the starter ships just farm till you get cobraMK3 (DONT BUY ANYTHING SOONER) and then your choice is either to farm over 100mil for endgame ship or get a cargo-ship for ... uhm 10 or 20 mil, aside from that cobra is just better than it's price is. considering the viper that costs 150k vs cobra 350k... if you put into the viper what cobra has as default it will cost you more than cobra's price.\n\nI really hope it helped you and I sure hope to randomly encounter you in this game.\nPS: no point going to "SOL" in the beginning since you need high reputaion with federation.\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","139.0"," 49 of 75 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","49","75","3","0"

Now some people are going to say that "OOO you should just go bounty hunting" or "AHHHH your doing it wrong trading doesnt make you money thats why your wasting time"... well the game is advertised as a SPACE COMBAT and TRADING sim. I should be able to make money trading without having to waste so much time. I wish at times there was a fast forward button, Or at the least an auto pilot mode, because on some trade runs i will waste 20-30 min going from one end of the system to the other, or from one system to the next. The game advertises as a living universe, and it is to an extent in that it utlilizes real time aspects and what not, but thats where it ends. can players influence things, yes they can i wont say you cant... but the only way to truly have any impact is if you align yourself with hundreds of other players who want to do repetative missions over and over again and again to just ajust a systems government from one side to the other. and that will take not hours or days, but WEEKS or MONTHS even. And thats if it changes at all, as the devs. have pointed out several bugs in the regiem change and market/economic properties. Still, it is realistic i will admit, but who has the time to implement weeks or months of constant gameplay to effect the outcome of a system change or totally buy out a market?\n\nAnother thing is the size of the game. the galaxy is huge with billions of billions of stars. that is true and when they said 400 billion systems in game, they meant it! I first thought "WOW COOL THATS SO HUGE" but over time it became rather lonely. players stick to the central human regions and the beginner regions mostly, so if you wana see lots of people go there otherwise you end up just drifting along alone. Perhaps they wanted again to emphasize the realism, but in my opinion maybe you could remove a couple billion stars? make people feel more like a community than "holy ♥♥♥♥ thats far away im gna stay in this clusterf*ck of stars"\n\nthen comes the players... Truthfully some people want to help and i joined a group of alliance players that are helpful and make the game more fun (however i joined because i was looking up lore didnt join while playing). But at first when i played, and even now, you have to watch your back and not trust anyone unless you made a dear friend of your husband/wife buy the game and play with you, because everyone wants to make money and stealing your ♥♥♥♥ is a good way to do it. Pirate players run rampant and while its fun for me because i get to hunt down those jerks who pick on people, it is frustrating to spend so much time flying around cataloging stars and what not, only to get killed by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off player who insults you while killing you because you have no cargo to drop and he decides "well time for you to die then"\n\nHowever, one of the main problems i had was simply trying to learn HOW to play. the tutorials (if they can be called that) seemed to me more like a haphazardly put together series of equally confusing instructions that dont really tell you how to play, or what each button does. I learned via trial and error, and a good 45 min rearanging and organizing and reading and looking over my control key bindings.\n\nAll this being said, I still love this game. i am a big space sim fan and love these kind of games. However i fear that this release is very very very VERY similar to how X REBIRTH was at release. Looks STUNNING, like giving me a nerdgasm just thinking about it 0_0 but just like X REBIRTH at launch, this game is Filled with many bugs, and very confusing and just not working at times. Now that being said, X REBIRTH was patched and fixed with time to a point where it is now one of my favoite games and is (in my opinion) perfect. I hope that ELITE DANGEROUS will take notice of this and fix many of the issues faced with this game at the moment. Until then, i have to give it a thumbs down and while il still play those issues are still in my mind and make me wana go back in time and have me wait for a sale.\n\nOverall: ATM, not worth 60$, wait till a sale, or wait till there are several patches made to the game.\n\nI still look forward to the day when i change the thumbs down to a thumbs up :)\n\nEDIT: to all those who have said in previous comments that i cannot spell, i think i changed the errors lol. please keep comments relative to the game, or how to help people who are playing it and just need some assistance. Thanks\n\nEDIT PART II: Ok had a fun time trading a few days ago. And when i say fun it was because i was with friends and we were all talking via skype and just doing stupid things while trading. I wouldnt recomend doing it alone as it will take forever and you will be insanely bored. Anyways while trading we all got interdacted (or however you spell it basically we got forced out of warp) and my friend just shouts " OOOO GOD BABY JESUS! SPACE BANDITOS THEY WANT MY GOLD AND SMALL ARMS!!!" and we burst out laughing! In our attempt to flee (we removed all weapons and shields etc to make more room for cargo and the like) me and my friend accidentaly crashed our type 6 transporters into each other and burst into flames!!! 1 million credits worth of cargo down the drain! most would assume we were very upset. but we just laughed so hard and couldnt stop! All in all the soul draining advernture that is trading turned into something fun and exciting:)\n\nI still feel like this game should implement more things in order to be up to its potential, and while i still wish several things would be fixed or added on to make the game great, I will admit that this game, with friends, time, and a painfully large amount of insanity over the soul-sucking journey that is trading, it is very fun:) Still not worth 60$ in its current state, which is why i wont recomend it until things are changed/implemented, and the price decreased, but if you can get people to play with you it is an enjoyable journey.\n\nTo those who own the game, Hope to see you with the stars.\n\nand please dont steal my gold and small arms :I I worked hard to buy those >:(","April 3, 2015","false","39.9"," 537 of 939 people (57%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","57","537","939","39","42"

Which would be fine if you own Horizons.  But in this hypothetical situation, you don't. You may have spent 2 hours doing this, as well as spent money on commodities used for said mission; which does not in any way shape or form allude to the fact that the last part requires Horizons.\n\nThis is extremely questionable game design right there, if its working as intended (it could be a bug). If its a bug, then move this particular iteration of the multi-part assignment mission to the "available surface missions" on the bulletin board, which to my understanding can only be seen by Horizons owners.\n\nIf this isnt addressed then ill assume its working as intended, in which case id urge the developers to employ some good business practice and include some sort of a warning/caveat. Like for instance: "Expansion may be required to fulfill certain mission prerequisites, though the majority of available missions will not". Ideally, it would be better to not have this happen at all. If someone wants to buy Horizons, let them make their decision based on what it offers. Not because they might feel forced to pay so as to inhibit their game from screwing them over with a paywall (eg. "buy our expansion to complete this mission you've spent hours and credits on").\n\nOther than that, there is nothing i can state here that isnt already mentioned by the other reviewers. I just found it necessary to bring this particular issue to the attention of potential customers. Its a sneaky move that i personally have experienced and am now hearing a friend experience too.\n\nIf you already have your mind made up and you're going to get this game, go all the way and get Horizons. Plenty of other reviewers here have well stated with good reason why the price isnt necessarily justified and i would agree. They also touch on how the game, when broken down into its most basic form, can be very grindey and eventually you'll have nothing to do at the end. I cant really argue with any of those points. It took me a while to get this game due to the reviews but i made the plunge during the sale and im enjoying this game regardless of the many issues that people have with this game and its seemingly strange business decisions.\n\nFor these reasons I do not recommend Elite Dangerous on its own. Though if you're willing to see past some of the issues, the whole package can be a really enjoyable experience.","January 9","false","54.5"," 109 of 182 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","109","182","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImTheRatKing/recommended/359320/","ImTheRatKing","The Beyonder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImTheRatKing/","233 products in account","My experience thus far.\n\nThe beginning of this game i got pretty lucky. I ended up in a big battle against a single ship, it was maybe 6 vs 1. In the end after a few died we won and i gained 50,000 credits, i was hardly even 30 minutes in the game. I went to buy a new ship because i thought i could make a lot of money trading. I was dead wrong... trading is not as profitable as i hoped or i'm just the worst trader in all of elite.\n\nLater on i lost my ship to a really stupid reason. I was on my way to a destination carrying expensive minerals. Out of warp I'm flying directly into a white dwarf. I veer off but the heat is real intense. Thinking I'm safe from this little monster, i try continuing to my destination. After i enter warp my heat climbs up to 330%... What? I'm not even close to the sun and I'm taking intense heat damage. The damage was so severe more than half my ship was disabled. I start shutting off modules and redirecting power to my last thrusters, i was so glad my power distributor and power plant was still functioning. Sadly though, my life support was down, i only had 5 minutes to get to my destination. After an intense battle with MY OWN ship, I made it! But didn't have enough time to dock... I died just outside the docking station in front of like 5 people. Completely humiliated, I'd still definitely choose to die again, the feeling of being on the edge of death in deep space is too entertaining. But this isn't the reason i permanently lost my ship, it's what lead up to it.\n\nAfter you die in game you are have the option of re-spawning your ship under the condition of a loan, which they take 10% of all profits till that percentage pays it off. I foolishly thought i could choose which ship i could spawn with and still keep my hauler which i spent 48,000 on. Lost my ship... for good. After enough scavenging with my sidewinder, i finally get enough money to buy another ship, I bought my first Eagle. before buying my Eagle i said "F*** it, I'm getting no where trading so I'm just going to kill everything." So i go out building a wild bounty and attacking people, I'm also coming across other with bounties on them. That's when it hit me... Just how much easier it was being a bounty hunter than a trader, i was racking in the money! 5,000 here, 10,000 there... finding myself in 4vs1 battles where I'm the big guy unlike the first battle i fought. I will never trade again... deadly bounty hunter for ever. The game went from boring flights back and forth to criminals fleeing for their lives after i rip them out of warp space.\n\nSorry if my experience isn't too entertaining to read, but this is a highly recommended game.\n\n9/10 (after switching to bounty hunter)\n\nUPDATE*: I'm trading again... It's so damn boring too. But some of my biggest catches while bounty hunting was 88,000, or 50,000. And those are big ships that don't pop up too often. But with my new Type 6 I'm hauling more than 500k of cargo and gaining about 120k profit per run. The many hours I've put into this game, I'm still only ranked a Novice (Level 3) in combat, which is more than 500k credits. You gain Competent (Level 4) when you make 1.7Mil. I've only put about 8 hours compared to the other 50 into trading and I'm already on the verge of reaching Merchant (Level 5) which comes at 3.8Mil. So, if you haven't caught on to what I'm saying yet, regardless of the path you choose, whether it's Bounty Hunter, Pirate, Explorer, or Trader. Buy a damn trade ship, more cargo the better. Only problem with trading is there is no real money trend. Regardless of what you buy the profits of that item only seem to set around at 800c profit. So the idea is more cargo, more profit.","April 27, 2015","true","144.3"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","43","65","5","0"

That's right, you can only ever play with 32 other humans in the same instance, and everything in this game is instanced.\nAn evolving narrative... that the developers control the creation of, pacing of, and ending of. You're just an observer.\nYes, the galaxy is very large.\n\nStarting with only a small starship and a few credits, players do whatever it takes to earn the skill, knowledge, wealth and power to survive in a futuristic cutthroat galaxy and to stand among the ranks of the iconic Elite. In an age of galactic superpowers and interstellar war, every player’s story influences the unique connected gaming experience and handcrafted evolving narrative. Governments fall, battles are lost and won, and humanity’s frontier is reshaped, all by players’ actions.\n"Doing whatever it takes," = grinding in Resource Extraction sites, or grinding trade routes, or if you're incredibly masochistic grinding exploration (more on that later).\n\n"Every player's story influences the unique connected gaming experience and handcrafted evolving narrative." = I guess if you grind enough you can make a name or number change on a station or system. Literally nothing else happens. Stations all look the same, and never change regardless of what happens. You can't build stations. You can't make stations appear. All that is chosen by the developer.\n\n400 Billion Star Systems. Infinite Freedom. Blaze Your Own Trail.\nInfinite freedom... to do what? There's very little interactivity in this game, almost non-existent.\nYou can really only shoot things to interact. And don't even get me started on exploring, hint: you basically watch loading screens 90% of the time... I wish I was joking. Fanboys literally say that watching a loading screen is a major part of the gameplay. I seriously wish I was joking here.\n"Blaze your own trail," I like this saying. Totally meaningless. There's only one way to get ships, grinding credits, and boy oh boy is it a grind. This is a worse grind than vanilla WoW back in the day. This is great if you want to fall asleep staring at your screen. Expect to hold down your fire button (bounty hunting), or fly back and forth repeatedly until your eyes bleed (trading in a nutshell). Exploration consists of watching loading screens and is awful at making credits. This is my biggest letdown. Exploring is so awful, downright offensive really. It's the height of non-interactive gameplay. You literally point your ship in a direction, and then watch a loading screen. If you want to scan an astronomical body you point your ship in its general direction and if you're close enough (which to get close you basically watch an ETA timer count down) you start scanning. God is it ever mind numbing. And 99% of everything looks exactly the same, so don't bother getting close enough to make anything bigger than a handful of pixels.\n\nA Galaxy Of Wonders\nThe 400 billion star systems of the Milky Way are the stage for Elite: Dangerous' open-ended gameplay. The real stars, planets, moons, asteroid fields and black holes of our own galaxy are built to their true epic proportions in the largest designed playspace in videogame history.\n"The largest designed playspace in videogame history."\nAnd the only way to interact with the environment? Well... there is none.\nI guess you can shoot an asteroid, but that doesn't do anything.\nThis game is like Minecraft, massive huge world.\nExcept it's a version of Minecraft where you can't craft anything. Or build anything. Or destroy anything. And all you get is a bow and arrow, you can just shoot things. That's it. Truly open-ended, I guess, so open all the content must have fallen out.\nPrepare to use a tonne of imagination to make this epic proportions game interesting whatsoever.\n\nA Unique Connected Game Experience\nGovernments fall, battles are lost and won, and humanity’s frontier is reshaped, all by players’ actions. In an age of galactic superpowers and interstellar war, every player’s personal story influences the connected galaxy and handcrafted evolving narrative.\nThis is a repeat. But yeah, there's nothing uniquely connected here.\n\nBlaze Your Own Trail\nUpgrade your ship and customize every component as you hunt, explore, fight, mine, smuggle, trade and survive in the cutthroat galaxy of the year 3301. Do whatever it takes to earn the skill, knowledge, wealth and power to stand among the ranks of the Elite.\nBy "customize every component" they mean you're given a set of internal modules you can switch out, and there are a few varieties of weapons. Very limited selection. (which you have to grind for).\nOh and you have to pay to change the colour of your ship. A single colour for a single ship(!) is $7.00. Seven dollars. Only applicable to one single ship.\n\nMassively Multiplayer\nExperience unpredictable encounters with players from around the world in Elite: Dangerous’ vast massively multiplayer space. Experience the connected galaxy alone in Solo mode or with players across the world in Open Play, where every pilot you face could become a trusted ally or your deadliest enemy. You will need to register a free Elite: Dangerous account with Frontier to play the game.\n"Unpredictable encounters," if you're new to playing and you're in Open mode there's only one thing to expect - to get griefed.\nWhat does "connected galaxy" even mean? From what I can tell there's no connection. You can't see what other stations are selling, what price they're selling it at, what ships they have in their shipyard, etc etc.\n\nA Living Game\nElite: Dangerous grows and expands with new features and content. Major updates react to the way players want to play and create new gameplay opportunities for the hundreds of thousands of players cooperating, competing and exploring together in the connected galaxy.\n"A living game" well it must be a living rock, because literally nothing changes. Everything looks the same. There's no way to interact with anything other than shooting at it. I guess life in the year 3302 consists of shooting everything, flying from point A to point B to point A, or watching loading screens.\nAND BY THE WAY: NEW FEATURES AND CONTENT, MAJOR UPDATES = YOU NEED TO PAY FOR. They don't say this, strangely, but every year you need to pay for what "content" they add to the game. This is the cost of an entire game. $60 DLC.\n\nThe Original Open World Adventure\nElite: Dangerous is the third sequel to 1984's genre-defining Elite, bringing gaming’s original open world adventure into the modern generation with a connected galaxy, evolving narrative and the entire Milky Way re-created at its full galactic proportions.\nSo much potential. SO much wasted on grindy brain dead simple mechanics with no interactivity.\nIt's a beautiful game though and I love the audio engineering, there's that, but it's wasted eye/ear candy.\nAnd it appears the mods on the Steam discussion board are in full damage control and are deleting negative remarks/threads about the game.\n\nedit: formating\n\nAND ALSOThere is NO:\nGuilds\nPlayer banks\nPlayer to player trading\nYour party group is limited to 4 people. Four people!\nYou can't even bookmark systems in game. And it doesn't save flightpaths if you exit game.

Seriously this game got me so excited and I loved it...for a while.

Nah, was never going to work.\n\nWell I couldn't have been more wrong.  After a month or so down the line I have dedicated over 300 hours to this game so far and not touched another game since.  Simply very impressed.\n\nCurrently I play in Solo mode (PvE mode), though you can play in PvP (player v player v AI) - though I am happy with Solo for now.  The tutorial is worth checking out for this will give you a chance to get used to some of the controls, I also found it useful to priint out the keyboard layout, though this was only needed for the first 24 hours or so.\n\nFirst time I played I had little to no idea what I was doing, there is no hand holding in this game and it is very much down to you to find "your way" in it. Though you will want to try a little of everything, fighting, trading, exploring.... version 1.3 has added a lot of new features to the game which is helping to make the galaxy feel smaller and more interconnected.\n\nLoads of ships to choose from..... small, medium, large... fighters, traders, explorers or make a mix of the three.  Essentially any ship can be what you want it to be, but of course a small ship isn't going to hold many tons of cargo....\n\nEarning money takes a little time at the beginning but can be done with ease once you know what route you want to take in the game.  I personally have always enjoyed trading, so stuck with that initially and did very well with it.  Yes, there is a 'grind' at times, but only as much as you want to make it one.  And money makes money in this game, ie get a ship, earn a little money, buy a bigger ship and earn a lot more money and so it continues... at least with trading anyway.  A person looking for action with a lazer beam will not be dissapointed and you can make good credits from just going down this route and the more skilled you are then the more money per hour you are able to earn.\n\nPretty much bug free.  I have been kicked from the server/game 3-4 times since I have had it, considering half of those were due to version 1.3 coming into play then I do not consider that at all bad - especially having played many an MMO over the years you get used to a bump in the road occassionally.  They update their servers on a Friday night btw, which I found out to my horror and disgust - patches should always be done mid week and not on peak gaming hours/days.\n\nMy system is a mid spec system these days, I get a solid 60 FPS.  So no complaints on the performance whether I am sitting in a docking station or fighting a load of bad guys - the game always looks very impressive.\n\nMore features are on the way and I am pleased to have jumped into the game early(ish).  I can see this being my main goto game for some time to come.\n\nHope to see you in space - but not before you see me of course! ;)\n","June 7, 2015","true","511.5"," 63 of 101 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","63","101","6","0"

They reduced the price because of a rediculously overpriced DLC, but originally it was 60$ for the game alone. Now they are releasing a DLC for full price called ED: Horizons, which restricts everyone from being able to use the new content added that allows people to land on planets unless you pay the same price the game is now AGAIN for it. These guys made an awesome game, but they are going down the same money-hungry trail that Evolve and COD went. The game itself is good, the implementation is bad, and they're making a bunch of super overpriced DLC. By the way, there is a season pass. It cost 130$ 175-200$. Yes, I am serious. Don't get into this.\nThe implementation is just boring and repetitive, travelling through space with cargo or grinding at a resource site for bounties. That is the only way you can make money, the missions are trash and are either scooping up cargo in space or transporting cargo or killing someone. That's it. However the game is beautiful, it has great potential, but it's sad how they've ruined it.\n\nNo Man's Sky or Star Citizen, this is trash.","August 28, 2015","false","86.2"," 73 of 119 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","73","119","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzhirian/recommended/359320/","uzhirian","Uzhirian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzhirian/","153 products in account","So what kind of game is Elite Dangerous you wonder? In a word, contradictory.\n\nIn a few more words: impressive, dull, beautiful, hollow, detailed and repetitive.\n\nThe galaxy is immense in size and scope with millions (billions?) of different stars and planets to explore but travelling across it often takes a very long time and once you've seen a few stars and planets they all more or less look the same.\n\nThere is a lot of missions you can sign up for but they are just the same few basic job types (deliver cargo here, kill this person, mine some ore, etc) which don't offer you much engagement or sense of purpose/investment and they pay pathetically little compared to the time invested and the amount of credits you'll need to buy the higher level ships. Worse, they often involve travelling somewhere and hanging around for a contact to show up (well the contact might show up anyway).\n\nCombat can be fun, it certainly looks and sounds fantastic, but has very little variation as there is only a handful of weapons/combat upgrades to equip on your ship. Even the different ship classes (in similar price brackets) don't vary much as they've been 'balanced' against each other for PvP.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of attention to detail through the game (each ship has a unique engine sound, beam lasers leave glowing score across your targets hull, etc) and that will keep any space sim fan entertained for a short while but eventually you realise that you are just grinding and don't have any sense of purpose or goal outside of buying another ship.\n\nSo is it worth playing? Absolutely. The first couple of hours in game had incredible atmosphere with the huge attention to detail that has been given to the travel/fuel system, the ships cockpits and sounds/visuals. After that though it becomes a tad tedious and time consuming in a bad way (jumping into a system, flying to a station and docking can take 10+ minutes even if you're only doing it to spend 5 seconds to click the refuel option).\n\nIf you can pick this up during a good sale, then you'll probably get your money's worth but I can't recommend it for full price, not when you could pick up the X3 Albion Prelude pack for a lot less, and though not as pretty it is a solid game with a lot more variety and content.\n\nAnd if the wall of text above looks too daunting or simply too boring to read, here's the translation...\n\nPros:\n- Incredibly beautiful graphics\n- Amazing sounds\n- Attention to small details often overlooked in other games\n- Ship insurance (pay a fraction of the total cost to get your ship back if destroyed)\n- Realism (atmosphere when travelling around is well created....)\n\nNeutral\n- An immense galaxy to explore (albeit pretty repetitive and shallow)\n- Customisation (can be fun but very limited options and not always clear exactly what benefit an improved part will give your ship)\n- Has an array of tutorials for some basic skills to play the game but not totally inclusive of everything you need (after doing all of them I still had to go searching for some controls for the cockpit like changing tabs in the console screens)\n\nCons:\n- Realism (….but damn, does it take a very long tedious time to travel around)\n- Lack of purpose/investment\n- Quickly becomes a grindfest\n- No depth. The great visual feast disguises a pretty hollow and basic space trader/shooter\n\nFind this review helpful?\nJoin Immortis Gaming for more reviews, cheap game deals, bundles and giveaways!","January 11","false","39.4"," 92 of 153 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","92","153","2","3"

You can choose several ways to grind out your fortune. You can be a bounty hunter, an explorer or a trader. All are grindy which is an aspect to all games but you grind to get a bigger ship then grind more to get an even bigger ship. What can you do with the biggest and best ship out there once you get it? You can grind to put the best parts and outfit your ship. There is no endgame, nothing to do once you get the better ships but more grinding. There is no ultimate goal to achieve or epic battle to be fought. Zero endgame unless you count getting a title next to your name of Elite as a worthwhile endgame achievement worth all that grinding. The game just feels like it is missing a reason to play.\nThe best part is instead of game updates to get the game where it needs to be the developer is releasing "expansions" PAID expansions so you get to pay extra to get the game from it's current Alpha state to a good playable version.  This might be ok if the initial purchase price of the game wasn't in line with AAA game title prices. The price for the expansions are also $60 which in line with a AAA game initial purchase price per expansion.  To top it all off if you buy it now you get to buy it again when the "expansion" is released as the expansion will cost $60 and include the core game. If you buy the core game you still get to pay $45 for the expansion so you get to pay twice.\nThis game has great potential and I think it will be a great game in the future, maybe after 6 more $60 paid expansions it will realize it's potential and be a great game to play. If that sounds good to you then order now if not there are plenty of other space sims out there that currently offer more bang for your buck.\n\nI know I am showing a lot of hours played and some of it is the case but keep in mind if you just close the game window and leave the background screen up Steam continues to count that as "in game time" in addition the hours and hours I have spent in game have consisted of 99% of going to one space station and buying goods to sell at another space station that looks exactly like the first rinse and repeat. I have done some battles as a bounty hunter and fought in conflict zones but both pay very little in credits (the in game currency) and the battles arent very exciting either. Shoot for a while , use a shield cell booster , shoot some more the enemy is dead rinse and repeat until you run out of shield booster then return to the space station to get more shield cells and return to battle.\n\nThere is no MMO aspect to the game. Players all (as in everyone) play on solo mode and the maximum number of players in an instance is 32 anyways so it will never have the MMO player interaction or social aspect to it. The number of players you can see or interact with will always be limited because Frontier chose the cheap way out and all player interaction is via a peer to peer internet connection.\nI play with friends and there is very very little we can do together due to the way the game mechanics don't allow you to share profits or credit for actions. My friend can escort my cargo ship and he can get 5% of my trade profit.  I can't opt to give him more or less it is always a straight 5%. Not even enough to make it worthwhile to be an escort. Players can team up and bounty hunt together and share profits and that is about it. (Just make sure you are bounty hunting NPC's see below comments for the explaination on that)\nThere is very little reason to group up or to do anything other than solo with the current gameplay model. To be more specific there is no in game content that is very challenging when playing solo so there is no reason or benefit to teaming up and therefore few people do it. There are no guilds, There is no matchmaking. There is not even a system in place to find out who is online unless someone is already on your friends list. The chance of you randomly encountering someone in game is not very high because everyone plays solo so finding another player to team up with is near impossible unless you buy the game with friends.\nThe good, The graphics are nice and overall the game  does provide a very good immersive experience. When I play it I do feel like I am just some average joe trying to make a living in a vast uncarring universe. The immersive experience brings me back to the game but it always feels like it is missing whatever it is that makes an ok game a great game.\n\nI feel like the developers wanted to bring back the game for the old fanbase. Literally the space stations are shaped the same, the same ships, the same trade mechanic, the same missions ETC. of course with better graphics but graphics don't=gameplay. Unfortunatally what was considered exciting or a super game in 1984 doesn't cut it in 2015. It needs more content and more( READ ANY) endgame! Something to do with my epic fleet of  ships besides be able to look at them in the hangar or tell people on the Elite Dangerous forums how cool my Anaconda is.  That is about all the end game content there is at the moment, and all there is to do besides grind away to upgrade your current ship or to by the next ship.  I see a lot of reviewers quoting the phrase the game is a mile wide and an inch deep and that is exactly how it feels. It has potential but Frontier already got my money based on the games potential and now they want more money to pre order an update that has "potential" they are really selling the potential of this game into the ground.\n\nThis game has more holes than swiss cheese\n\nYou want to be a pirate or bounty hunter and you pirate or bounty hunt other players, all they have to do is "report " you ( it doesn't have to be anything legit just the report is enough) and if you get a few reports you will be "shadow banned" what this means is when you click to join the open world the game makes you think you join the open multiplayer world but you really don't you just open your very own solo world. The game doesn't tell you it is doing this so you just think wow the world is emptier than usual.\n\nThey don't feel like reporting you since the game is all peer to peer networking all they have to do is block your IP and they will never see you again\n\nForget to ip ban or report someone no problem there either, if they are winning the fight just combat log as again since it is peer to peer networking as soon as you log your ship disappears and the fight stops. Since your going to be badly damaged when you log back in you might be concerned but again this is no problem because you simply log into solo mode and get your ship back to a station for repairs without any threat.\n\nYou want to effect a power in game so you get your buddies together to blockade a system, no problem everyone just goes into a private game or solo game and runs their cargo, it is as if your blockade doesn't even exist because they moved to another game instance. They can also just IP block the people doing the blockade to the same effect like magic the blockade disappears!","August 6, 2015","false","581.4"," 74 of 121 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","74","121","2","0"

For those of you that remember Earth and Beyond this is a much more in-depth version of that game. It is a simulater first and foremost so keep that in mind, but it is not overbearing like current flight simulaters.\n\nWhat I like most about this game is that you have complete free will on what kind of star commander you want to be. You can join a federations military and patrol starports and nav points, you can be the space explorer and search unmapped space, be the trader/smuggler between star systems. Pirates are very real and yes you can join them as well or become the bounty hunter and hunt the pirates. A full on PVP enviornment makes the game intense as soon as you see another player performing a scan on your ship, you immediately begin to wonder what, where, and why!!\n\nI also highly recommend a Joystick for this game, it really adds to the immersion of flying your own spacecraft!

I thought controls were easy and straight forward to learn. I am however old enough to have played the original and so the mechanics of the game were somwhat familiar.\n\nI've also heard people saying it takes ages to get anywhere (distance wise)  but to me (compared to the original) it seems about right. Judicious use of the frameshift drive eats up distances in no time at all. If there is an issue there at all dropping out of frameshift is a little clunky, it's very easy to overshoot, but I'm sure that will come with practice.\n\nThe only other issue I've had is sometimes finding your designated landing pad can be frustrating, and it sometimes takes an age before it realises you have landed. May be something I'm missing as I've skipped so much of the tutorials.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface of the game, but the game itself is shaping up to be the amazing sequel we all know is possible.

Elite: Dangerous is a single player space exploration simulator dressed up to look like an open world MMO.\n\nYou can do three things.\n\nTrade: spend countless hours jumping from station to station, maybe slightly harassed by easily avoided NPCS, farm cash so you can buy the biggest baddest ship and then continue trading because there's noone worth PVPing with.\n\nExplore: After farming enough cash to outfit a ship for exploration you can venture out into the void and spend your days scanning(way more boring than you think) and scooping fuel from stars(tedious and you might blow up thus negating all of your efforts), if you find some undiscovered worlds you get your name on them as the first discoverer(whoopy). Eventually you return to civilized space to sell all of your exploration data, buy the biggest baddest ship, and PVP with noone.\n\nCombat: The least lucrative way to farm cash is to hunt NPCs, for bounties or as part of a simulated and meaningless war, you can also steal their cargo by blowing them up but it's far from worth the hassel. Eventually you can buy the biggest baddest ship and continue fighting NPCs because anyone worth PVPing with is playing in SOLO.\n\nThat's it, I've literally described everything you can do in this game. This is not EVE, you cannot go around pirating people or even taking over their solar systems. Everyone worth pirating simply plays SOLO.\n\nSOLO is the game mode where you are in the exact same universe and your actions still affect other players, you can do all of your exploring and trading free of hassel from otherwise fun seeking fellow players. You can literally farm in SOLO until you have the best ship, then switch to the "Open World" and PVP with noone.

With over 400 billion potential experiences like this with the game’s model of our own Milky Way Galaxy, you are sure to have more than one experience like this.  But this may be a bit too much or lacking for others who choose to join the ranks of the Elite.\n\nElite Dangerous sticks you right in the pilot seat with nearly full control over ever aspect of the craft you will be using to navigate and traverse our galaxy to make your name and stake your claim in the galaxy.  There is training available in the way of mainly combat, however most of the other activities in the game that can be used to make money for new ships and upgrades, as well as upkeep are left out.\n\nThere is very little hand holding in Elite Dangerous, for some people that can be a great thing, however for those who need a little direction, you may be a little overwhelmed.  Nearly any façade of generating a credit flow with a space craft are feasible to you as a pilot in Elite Dangerous.\n\nExploring:  If traveling on the edge of the known galaxy is your thing, equipped with a fuel scoop you use to gather fuel for your exploration vessel and a few scanners to identify systems and the surface of space bound objects, exploration is by far and nearly an endless venue for you.  With your ability to collect and gather data as an explorer you are able to make your credits by going where no man has gone before.  Selling the information for varying prices based on its value, is how you will be making most of your money as an explorer.\n\nCombat:  If strapping as much firepower to your fighter and doing various missions for the highest bidder as a soldier of fortune is your thing, a combat focused profession holds a lot of potential.  With bounty hunting, pirating and various missions for the multitude of factions that exist within the game you are sure to always have something new to test your metal in the heat of battle.  Commanders have the ability to interdict, check bounties, and pirate their way to the top with different outfitting options for any ship in the game.\n\nMining:  Staking a claim in a system’s resource extraction point, gathering minerals and refining them into money producing items is the miners claim to fame.  It isn’t easy and it takes a special type of person to achieve this livelihood.  But with the right ship and the right tools and even allies this can be a good way to make large sums of money without having to travel too far.\n\n\nTrading:  If finding product in high supply being sold at a lower than galactic average price and selling it to another system that has a high demand is your thing; trading is one of the best ways to make large sums of credits quickly.  This profession isn’t for everyone but with various ways to accomplish roughly the same goal like smuggling, pirating, stealing, scavenging, and even running rare goods long distances, it feels as though Frontier spent a lot of time making sure the games economy was fleshed out.  Stolen goods?  No problem, sell them on the black market.  Don’t let the feds scan you or you will be space dust.\n\nOverall graphics and sound in the game is done very well.  With the ability to use your HOTAS, pedals, gamepad, keyboard and mouse and even products such as the Oculus Rift you are sure to get exactly what you want out of your desired level of immersion into this galaxy.  Keeping the lights dim and minimizing distractions can suck you right in and before you know it hours could have gone by.  Gameplay is great if you are one of those who love’s the sandbox feel.   Being put in the middle of the galaxy with nothing but a few credits and the ship you own, it is up to you to go where you want and do it how you want.\n\nThe conrol you have over your craft is not limited in any way.  You can cycle through systems and toggle them on or off, making contact with stations to allow yourself permission to dock, deploying cargo scoops, full 3d movement, its all there.  The game is a bit "simmy" in that sense, however with a bit of time and practice as well as patience you will be piloting your craft like a well trained Commander.  With the ability to switch flight assist on or off you can pull stunts like those seen in Galactica or fly your craft more like those seen in Starwars with flight assist on.  Control is not lacking in any sense of the word.  Shutting all your systems down to minimize your heat signature and floating through space to scoop up cargo right under the fed's nose?  Check!\n\nFrontier has promised many expansions for the game, of which include the ability to have crewmates, ship boarding, landing on the surface of planets and exploring space stations on foot, I believe we have only witnessed the very pinnacle of the ice burg with the ambitious and genera bending plans the studio has in store for Elite Dangerous and those hungry enough to give them the time they need to release more.\n\nWith the patience and willingness to get past some of the minor frustrations in the game like no hand holding, and carving your own path, Elite Dangerous can have a little bit of a steeper learning curve, but for those of you who thrive on this I would strongly suggest reading more on the game, most importantly in the various profession that seems to sound like something you would want to do.  There are no obligations in the game so if you want to be a trader one day, and a bounty hunter the next, you are free to do so.\n\nIn summation, Elite Dangerous is a very large game, with nearly infinite possibilities for those who have a bit of imagination, but if you like games who tell you where to jump and when to do it as well as games who’s stories are laid before you with you being the center piece of the game’s focus, Elite Dangerous probably is not for you.  To add to that the galaxy is driven by player action and doing one thing in one place all has consequences or effects on other places.  Elite Dangerous is sure to keep you tied over for a good amount of time.","April 30, 2015","true","300.5"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","39","60","3","2"

AND these modes use the SAME save file.  for those who despair of getting out of the starter system w/ ship intact ( a valid concern on some servers) this means that learning to play alone and/or w/ friends does not mean having to start anew when entering open play.  this aleviates _some_ of the game's harsh learning curve.\n\nas to the learning curve i recommend completing _all_ the tutorials before entering play in any mode.  this will put a player above the skill of the default ai and above most players.  it will not help a player who is hopelessly outnumbered and unwilling to disengage for refit/repair.  note that it is a good idea to pay fines as early as possible unless going the outlaw path (fines must now expire).\n\nwhich leads me to my next point.  it is the player's responsibility to make their own story as they go.  this may seem a daunting task so i will suggest only a few.  trading - find profitable trade routes and maximize local economies.  though this has a low impact on the game galaxy, a good trade route can return enough cash to upgrade ships and internals and allow for more ships on hand for time of need.  scouting - even w/ a starter ship (sidewinder) one can equip a scanner and a fuel scoop to enable unlimited flight.  bulletin boarding - this one is a bit tricky in that it will involve factions.  taking jobs for one or allied factions will boost reputation w/ said faction(s).  taking jobs for opposing factions will, at best, cancel out reputation gain.  this is most notable in the trans-sytem factions of Alliance, Federation and The Empire.  taking missions for these last 3 will eventually unlock rank missions.  rank unlocks certain ships and grants passage to sequestered systems.  outlaw - do what you like, when you like, where you like.  i recommend any independent system w/ good facilities for a base of operations.  these are only a few of the meta games i can think up off hand.  make your own and play your own game.\n\nsurvival skills:\n1. know when to bug out.  if your cargo is worth more than your insurance claim for a new ship or your _entire_ balance is invested in your current ship and its current cargo you would do better to submit to an interdict and fly away from attacker(s) until your FSD comes back online then escape to supercruise.\n\n2. dont shoot the cops.  when doing business in a system it is unwise to encur the wrath of the local constabulary.  this is unavoidable in certain jobs board missions but those are special cases.  if you are patrolling a resource extraction site or bounty gathering at a nav point be aware of the ships near your target.  also mind your turrets are not engaged when selecting targets which might not be wanted or could be system security.  shooting a cop or a ship w/ no bounty will give _you_ a bounty which in turn makes you fair game for anyone w/ a gun.  should this happen i recommend you disengage and fly to nearest platform (not station mind you) and clear your fine (patched - fines must now expire before being paid.  the term of validation is based on the severity of the infraction).\n\n3. anarchy means anarchy.  in an anarchy system even non bounty ships might attack you.  this is key when plotting a trade route.  just be aware of all ships around you in anarchy systems.\n\n4. power management.  big guns need big power.  when outfitting your ship be sure to make note of the total power draw from ship's systems.  nothing worse than bringing up hardpoints and causing a power loss.  thats right, your a sitting duck until you pwer down enough systems to get total @/below 100%.  to enable bigger guns and higher shield regen and turbo regen i recommend the highest power distributor you can afford.  the need for a higher power plant becomes evident in outfitting.  the need for higher FSD depends on desired jump range.\n\n5. dont run out of gas.  be mindful of nearby systems you can use for refuelling.  a fuel sccop can lessen this need but be aware that some stars it is very dangerous to gather fuel from (and yes im looking at you t-tauri stars).  you can very nearly fly and supercruise forever in any given system but you will need sufficient fuel to reach a scoopable star or a system with accessible ports (note ship size vs landing pad size).\n\nwith the powerplay update you can ally yourself w/ any of a number of galactic powers to further their goals and by extension your own.  i do not play this aspect but i recognize that it bears a passing resemblance to a story mode so there is that.\n\nTL/DR Summary:\nrecommended for hard core space sim and new to advanced pvp, co-op play w/ friends highly recommended.  warning - this game is a time sink.  have audiobooks and music playlist ready and waiting.  (note - acquired steam key for game through frontier store's account manager.  actual game time is not reflected by steam.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY6J5kCK0J8\n\n*added note about fines must expire\n*added CQC PVP and some spelling","July 10, 2015","true","187.5"," 67 of 111 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","67","111","2","0"

I named my planet & space station after my late Dad. I was heavily involved in the Design Discussion Forum (DDF) all the way through. Needless to say, I wanted this game to be good. Pay no attention to the hours played on Steam - I have been playing since Alpha 1.0.\n\nUnfortunately, once the initial "wow" factor of the huge galaxy wears off, you discover there's very little actual game there - and, worse, even less opportunity for you to create your *own* game. The systems are very similar, the stations are even more similar, the NPCs serve no purpose whatsoever, and the ill-advised & badly implemented "multiplayer" doesn't make up for the overriding feeling that the game is largely devoid of purpose. Everything feels "fake".\n\nIt looks pretty in my Oculus Rift (bought for the game during alpha). It's a useful tech demo in that respect. The menu systems are terrible. Having to take your eyes off the action to fiddle with menu options to do some basic task is stupid. I'm not surprised that they're releasing a console version, as the "game that is designed for the PC from the ground up" (as promised during the Kickstarter) clearly wasn't.\n\nThere is no pause button. Even if you only play solo (as I usually did) if you accept a (boring, fetch and carry) mission, you better finish it in that play session because the timers will count down on it even if you're not playing. Then you will lose rep. It would make sense if there was an actual effect on the system / faction if they didn't receive their 6t of Tea in time... but there isn't.\n\nIt's incredibly grindy. There's nothing to do except grind for more cash to... buy a bigger ship... just so you can grind faster to... what? That doesn't count as "progression".\n\nThe overriding feeling I have is one of profound disappointment & regret. I wish I hadn't spent so much money on it. I wish I hadn't named a space station as a memorial to my Dad as the game will now only exist for as long as Frontier continue to pay for the servers, thanks to their disgraceful last-minute bait'n'switch on offline mode. I am happy that some people are getting enjoyment from it, and it is clearly aimed at a demographic, but I am now acutely aware that this demographic does not include me... a huge fan of the originals and a high level Kickstarter backer.","June 25, 2015","false","45.8"," 59 of 97 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","59","97","4","12"

When I paid $60 for a game like this I expected a lot more than to fly around a randomly created galaxy performing randomly generated missions. Every aspect of the game has the same feel of unused potential.\n\nTo begin with, I enjoyed the simple act of piloting my spaceship in and out of spaceports because it seemed so realistic, and I was excited to see what the game added. Unfortunately, the answer was "not much."\n\nI soon learned that the developer's goal was to milk as much money out of its players as possible. I thought that charging additional real-life money to customize your paint job was an ominous sign. I wish I had listened to my gut. Now to add essential gameplay elements to the game, you will be required to pay for expansions that cost as much as the base game. The developers even dared to offer a lifetime pass for expansions that they charge over $100 for.\n\nThe game did seem too good to be true.

Devoid of any meaningful content, goals, or challenge. Not an MMO as described. Online and offline modes share the same character.

Pvp does not exist because yay just log to avoid death. No challenge in the AI ships either. A potatoe can defeat the deadliest of AI in this game.

Every faction shares the same few space station designs (but sometimes the lights are different colors!). There is no variation in behavior among the factions.

The world is massive. There's a lot to love about the world this game is placed in. You can be anything from a pirate to an explorer to a trader to a courier. You can find groups of real people to play with, and the community is excellent and generally friendly. However, there is one thing that really matters: Is it fun?\n\nNo. It's not.\n\n"But you've played for 100 hours!" Well, yes, but I look back on it and see nothing but grinding while listening to podcasts and Youtube videos. Combat is not interesting when you've realized the easiest way to do it. Trading is literally taking one thing to another location and back. Exploration is literally staring at planets for 30 seconds at a time waiting for your planet scanner to finish scanning.\n\nThe people behind Elite: Dangerous expect people to play in a lake 10 miles wide and a foot deep. What do I mean by this? Well, the game is huge, there's plenty to do. The problem is, the things you can do are extremely simple. Traders haul goods back and forth. Fighters blow up ships/steal cargo. Explorers scan planets. There is nothing more to it than the idea itself. Quests barely exist, being nothing more than paying you extra for fighting/trading.\n\nThis game isn't finished, the devs have said this. This game is in the making, and it's slow going.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/359320/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Elite Dangerous is a space/flight simulator, with an emphasis on trade, as well as elements of action and mining. It is also an "MMO".\n\nIn Elite: Dangerous you start out in a basic ship in the same general starting area as everyone else. From here on, you're free to go about and make something of yourself in the universe. At first, you believe there is a lot of options available to you in Elite: Dangerous, but you start to realise there is little depth to the game, and everything is tedious and slow.\n\nElite: Dangerous is a meandering grind for money. With this money, you can buy and outfit a new ship, to make more money at a faster pace. However, there are huge gaps between prices of ships, and outfitting a ship in the best gear usually costs twice as much as the ship. Because of this, the grind never gets easier, just harder and more tedious.\n\nThere's three things to do in Elite: Dangerous: Trade, Combat, and Exploration.\n\nTrade consists of either taking up trade contracts to earn measly amounts of cash, smuggling illegal goods to make slightly better amounts of cash, or finding a trade route on your own or online to make as much profit as possible. You can also mine goods to sell instead of simply trading. However, mining is hardly ever worth the time and effort, as there's only 2-3 goods that can only be obtained via mining, and therefore the only ones which turn a profit. Finding these goods take a long time, and you usually spend most of your earnings on more drones as well as fuel.\n\nCombat consists of either bounty hunting, piracy, or civil/faction war combat bonds. Fighting NPCs is fun at first, however after so much fighting you start to realise each NPC has the same flight pattern. Due to this, combat becomes dull after a while. You can always try PvP, but this (shoddy) "MMO" uses peer-to-peer instances, consisting of 30 players each. If you're lucky, you may run across another player. Good luck killing them though, as many experienced players simply press Alt + F4 to close their game, completely removing them from the instance. This means all the effort you spent trying to kill them has gone to waste.\n\nFinally, exploration is another option. Elite: Dangerous has around 400 billion procedurally systems. When you eventually get the money, you can gear out a ship for exploration. From here, you can head out into uncharted space, scanning stars, planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. Depending on what you find, exploration will net you various amounts of cash. Usually, scanning everything is not worth it, and people just target the most valuable bodies. A huge downside to exploration is you're screwed if anything goes wrong. If you run out of fuel, if you overheat and blow up, anything that'll strand and/or destroy you will make all your effort go to waste. You will spend weeks exploring space, and just as much time getting back to sell your data, and it can all be lost in a second if something goes wrong.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Elite: Dangerous is an MMO. However, it's buy to play and doesn't require a subscription. There is no dedicated server though. You're connecting to other players via peer-to-peer networking, which has many flaws. You can be dropped from an instance at any time, which can also cause you to drop out to the main menu. Players can simply end the game process or Alt+F4 to drop from the instance and suffer no consequences, such as being destroyed by NPCs or other players alike. Single player requires an always online internet connection, which leads one to believe the "MMO" nature is a front for Always-Online DRM. The shoddy and lacklustre MMO side of the game is what leads me to this thought.\n\nElite: Dangerous is also a grindfest, with no real goal. You can rank up three different categories, earn measly amounts of credits via contracts, or just trade/fight/explore until the grind bores you. Your only goal is getting the next ship, to grind even more whilst being illuded into believing the grind is going quicker.\n\nElite: Dangerous has a lot of content on the surface, but deep down the game is empty and void of everything. Much like space, in Elite: Dangerous there is nothing.\n\nOverall, Elite: Dangerous will keep you addicted for a few days, but eventually fall flat if you're not the type of person who loves to meaninglessly grind in games. I cannot recommend this game at $60. Instead, get it on sale for 50% off or more.\n\nIf you're in the market for a space combat & trade sim, check out X3, as well as previous X titles. There's also some space games on Early Access now, which deliver a lot more than Elite: Dangerous.\n\nNow I'd like to move onto Frontier Developments. A company that has screwed over people who backed via Kickstarter, as well as changing promises and borderline lying to people.\n\nFor a start, they lied to people about offline mode. The game was never an "MMO" at the start. It never required an online connection, until they suddenly changed this in one of the alphas. Many called for refunds, and Frontier did not wish to grant them.\n\nNext off, let's move onto expansions. As an "MMO", Elite: Dangerous will be getting a series of expansions. However, they work differently to other games. Instead of getting an expansion that is content complete, you pay for the initial set of content, and hope they add more over time. You can pay extra for the "alpha" version of the expansion, getting earlier access to lacklustre content.\n\nThe first expansion to be releasing is Horizons. This adds planetary landings. The first set of planets that support landing are rocky planets with no atmosphere. They stated they "hope" to add more in the future, not that they "will". There's no guarantee your expansion will be complete. When you buy an expansion, you're paying for content to be given to you over time, rather than having much of it up front.\n\nBut how much does all this cost? $60, however for a limited time you can get a $15 discount. But don't worry! If you don't own the game, you get the best deal! Buying the game for $60 will give you both the base game and the expansion, meaning everyone who paid before you gets screwed over, whilst you're rewarded for buying in late!\n\nI further cannot recommend this game due to Frontier's terrible business practices. They're shady, quiet, and very anti-consumer. Do not support anything they do.","September 6, 2015","false","73.6"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","45","72","2","6"

People left, people want eve with good mechanics, not a game with good mechanics but no player created events. Essentially they made an online game for loners.\n\nPriorities on releasing content are bad, like amateur bad, i haven't seen a dev group with experience do things so stupidly as this in my whole life or my time in the game industry.\n\nYou don't release a cruise ship when the gameplay for them isn't implemented, just no.. but frontier thought it'd be a good idea.\nYou don't release a mining laser without a good way of picking up the ores, mining has forever been unprofitable by a huge marging until they finally released mining drones to pick up the ores, it only took several months..\nYou don't nerf missiles to the point people don't use them at all and then don't revert the changes, no... if the playerbase stop using something wholeheartedly then you've obviously done something wrong.\n\nLastly, you don't spend over 3 months reworking a mission system that sucked for a prettier version that is very shallow and on beta (hasn't been released yet but will soon) has people going.. "This is pointless?!, it affects nothing and some parts are broken" and not bug broken or accidentally broken, broken by design.\n\n\nAll that being said i did enjoy elite : dangerous, but like archeage it is one of those games where the developers/publishers have a game with such huge potential yet out of sheer incompetence, selfishness and dumb pride, have decided to go with what they and a very few want rather than what their community wants.\n\n\nProof in this is that the game has lost way over half its steam users and keeps dropping, as for the base players before it released in steam, going by how back then i felt it was getting dead i'm guessing its numbers don't fare too well either.\n\nAlso there is a reddit post on the elite dangerous reddit where a player asked people to post good reviews :P\n\nOne person commented that the upcoming powerplay update is basically community goals but with a pretty paint of coat.\n\n\nThey are releasing useless ♥♥♥♥. If only they'd get the stick out their rear end and work on stuff that would make a community in game where anything can happen, politics will form, players will come together etc :(\n\n\nWay i see it, they are probably not doing it because of lack of faith in their servers to run well when too many people are together in same system nodes, they need to get their ♥♥♥♥ together, fast.\n\nShamefru dispray.","May 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 57 of 94 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","57","94","2","4"

It's wide and big, but shallow.\n\nI've been an X (from Beyond the Frontier to Albion Prelude) player for a long time and I've never been this bored in that series, even though it's learning curve is much harder. At least there were stories there and you could actually have impact on the universe around you (universe that actually felt ALIVE, unlike in Elite) - for example, a friend of mine genocided every other race in the game and took over the universe.\n\nElite on the other hand is just grind, grind, grind - the point of the game is grind. There are expansion packs coming, but each will be the price of a whole, brand new game!\n\nThere is no single-player. There is no offline mode. For single player you need to be connected to the internet and their servers.\n\nReminds me of Diablo III and that whole disaster, but at least there's no fear people will crash ED server, because it's far from over-loaded.\n\nPeople compare it to Euro Truck SImulator 2, but at least in it's MP mod you are constantly around other players and can interact, for good or bad. And ETS2 at least isn't frustrating, unless there's a troll it's actually quite a calming-down experience, serene. They also like to compare it to EVE online, but where are then the player-owned stations? Where are the corporations? Where is the player interaction?\n\nThen there is the launcher.\n\nFirst off, I should not need to create a new account with a 3rd party other than steam to play a game I bought on Steam and then have to go through a bit too long process to even launch the game. That's a peeve.\n\nWhy not expand on the demo included (but is it a demo when you get it only after you've bought the game?), give it a set universe and make it an open game and let it be played as offline singleplayer? Apparently not good enough for Braben, but I'm sure  a LOT of people would be happy with that. And I DO mean OFFLINE play.\n\nYes, the game looks amazing, even on my system, and the trailers on steam make it look mind-blowing to play.\n\nOn that topic, the trailers and teasers themselves are misleading. Station space is no-fire zone, so there won't be any skimming-the-station-surface-while-evading-fire moments. The ships in the game are actually not that maneuverable. And you'll never actually see the outside of your ships (unless you enter the screenshot mode in which you have no control over your ship, but are vulnerable and can be killed) because you fly from the cockpit.\n\nAnd even that has unpredicted problems. If, like me, you use headtracking (TrackIR or Freetrack) you will see a second copy of the HUD flicker on the screen.\n\nThe developers seem satisfied with the end product (even though it's far from finished in players' opinions), so unlikely to fix the biggest problems, especially ones that would need a change in philosophy.\n\nIn the months that I've owned this game there have been 2 patches. None of them has added anything new to the game, they were only fixes of bugs producers acknowledge as such.\n\nBottom line, I don't recommend this game.\n\n.\n\nWhat I would instead suggest is to rather buy a game of the X-series. My favorite is the X-3 line, particularly Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. They are not perfect, but in my opinion much better than ED is at the moment.\n\nIf you want excellent space combat that can involved hundreds of ships at the same time, X3 are the games for you.\n\nIf you want space economy that actually has meaning and on which you can have impact then X3 are games for you Example: factories only produce goods - that are needed by other factories for their production, only if they are supplied and in many cases you can be the only supplier, so you have direct impact on what gets produced - for example, your Argnu beef factory is in the first chain of production for anti-capital-ship cannons - if there is no beef supply, you won't be able to buy those cannons and equip your M2 battleship. With mods you can set up system and universe traders that earn you money without your constant babying them.\n\nIf you want a space sim with story, then X3 is for you. ED has none, while in X3 every race has a story that you can be part of and that takes a different approach. Some may want only your combat skills, while others will need you to become a successful industrialist. Rewards vary from better ships, unique equipment to goods or money (credits).\n\nX3 has one of the most epic soundtracks out there - excellent example being compositions in systems like  Kingdom End and Getsu Fune.\n\nIf you want your grind to actually have effect, then X3 is for you. You start out with a very basic fighter, but can end up having FLEETS of BATTLESHIPS and CARRIERS, that each can carry up to 60 fighters and are protected by corvettes and cruisers and light and heavy fighter wings, EACH of these ships being playable. Mods (of which there are hundreds) give you even better control of them.\n\nIf you want multiplayer where you will feel lonely and won't see another player for days then Elite Dangerous is the game for you. In this respect it's no more multiplayer than X3 and for X3 you DON'T need to be connected to the internet and some servers to play.\n\nIf you don't want to have any impact whatsover on the universe around you then ED is for you.\n\nIf after a few days of playing you want to be bored, then get ED.\n\nIn the end it's your decision and if you buy it and are happy even after weeks of playing, then I'm happy for you. But if you end up bored soon, then don't say I didn't warn ya. ;-)","August 7, 2015","false","13.1"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DANG3RUSS/recommended/359320/","DANG3RUSS","Carl DB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DANG3RUSS/","43 products in account","Disclaimer\n\nThe recommendation comes with a heavy grain of salt.\n\nI have played this game for 425 hours on steam and around 300 before it was on steam, and I think I have done enough of every aspect of the game to give a fair review of the game.\n\nThe Beginning\nI am sorry to say that I can no longer testify to the opening hours of the game as accurately as I would like because I first played it around 1.5 years ago and many things have changed since then, but some things I believe to be the same are immense, but IMO rewarding learning curve, adjustment to the vastness of the galaxy, and beginning to make money effectively.  The amount of learning will depend on your mileage with space/flight sims.  The galaxy is breathtaking, but the novelty wore off for me around 50 hours in (which is still longer than some games offer).  The money is a whole other issue which takes me to the mid game (Yes I consider the beginning to be the first 50 hours, even after that I still learned new things that I didn't know).\n\nThe Middle\nThe main part of the mid game is doing various types of careers or missions to earn money.  The game is a grind, a huge grind at that.  I can hardly think of more than 20 of my 725 hours that I spent playing the game in which I was not grinding.  This is where the grain of salt comes in.  I spent around 600 hours in the mid game in which I went from the cobra (small versatile classic ship) to the Federal Corvette (huge war machine with massive guns but turns like a truck).  I went through many ships and every profession (minus exploration, I'm waiting on VR for that one) and grinding my way to riches, and federal rank (in game faction).  The reason I liked this game so much is for 2 main reasons\n\n1.) I love space and the idea of a game like this keeps on fascinating me\n\n2.) I, for some reason liked the grind. I hated it and stop playing for a while at about the 200 hour mark, but then I came back and loved it.  I have no clue why, maybe it was something like stockholm syndrome but I was pulled in and I loved just going on endless 'farming' sessions for 8 hours just blowing up pirates and never got bored.\n\nMy final notes on the mid game are the following.  I am sorry, but I don't think a review can tell you whether you will enjoy this game or not, even if you hate grinding like I did this game can change your mind.  You have to try it, and you also IMO have to love space and be able to set a goal for yourself (Corvette for me) otherwise I don't think there will be enough motivation because that is the kicker with this game, everything is self motivation.  The game doesn't give you an end goal and a lot of people don't like that because there is not a ton of gameplay and there is not much sense of progress besides a number on the screen, and if you don't like that, which most people probably don't, then don't get the game it will just frustrate you.\n\nElite leaves a lot of blank spaces for the player to fill in and does not give them a lot to fill it in with which leads to an understandable outcome of a lot of people not liking the game.  However, I liked it for some reason and I just think this game is too different from most other games to quantify it as good or bad.  Its weird and different and grindy and has cool space stuff.  If you don't have a strong interest in games like that don't get it.  If you aren't sure, give it a try.  At the very least it will intise you for maybe 20 hours and give you an interesting space experience.\n\nThe End\nWhile I liked the mid game, lots of people don't for understandable reasons.  The weird thing about Elite is that there is no true end game, but I would say a lot of players find a point where they don't feel the need to have monetary progression anymore, which by my video game logic I guess would mean you are at the end game.  I had this when I got my nice big ship and went out blowing up pirates for hours on end, but this is where my only gripe with the game comes in.  It was the same as before, now I just had nothing to work towards, so I got bored after another 75 hours of doing various things with my new ship and stopped playing.  I was left kind of unsatisfied, but I thought to myself, I got 400 hours of really fun time from this game and while the first 200 hours and the last 75 hours were kind of rough, I got a lot of enjoyment out of this game and thought the $60 was well worth it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nElite is a weird game with tons of grinding and waiting and space stuff (lazors and ships).  I liked the grind so I liked the game, but ultimately it depends on whether you have to motivation (or desire to waste time as some may call it) to spend tons of hours working towards an arbitrary goal you set for yourself and then feeling happiness from seeing all your progress.  Or maybe you just like flying through space forever on your computer, whatever floats your boat.\n\nSide Note\n\nI have not been able to try with VR yet but I heard it is quite amazing and could bring new life into the game for me and many other people.  I also recommend a second monitor / phone / tablet so you can watch some videos or movies while playing to ease parts of the grind.","April 7","true","564.2"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","33","51","0","3"

Stay away from ED and Frontier. They have changed the buisness model of how new content is going to be added and released and it is absolutely screwing everyone. I bought this game for $40 on a sale and now it's regular price is $30. Why? Because Frontier knew it was lacking in content and was going to add the bare minimum in future DLC and charge players out the ♥♥♥ for it. Hence ED:H. For me to get ED:H I would have to rebuy ED, as well as get the DLC since it is now a seperate listing at $60. That is outrageous. It should be a $20 DLC for anyone already owning the game. Hell I would begrudingly pay $30 for it. But Frontier has turned their backs on the loyal fans and are now sucking up as much money as they can. It's quite a shame to have greed ruin a project with so much promise. Now I must hold out hope for Star Citizen, yet that too seems to be dying a fate caused by greed.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis is a tough one.\n\nBottom line, is the game good? Yes, it is if you like space sim meets eurotruck sim.\n\nIt was fun in the beginning. It really was and everything is there for a *fun* game.\nBut it really was lacking content on release for the $60 I paid, clearly they've reducded the price now. Which is another thing. The dubious prices for things. I new expanions were going to cost money. But the Horizons expansion would of been cheaper for existing owners if they bought it bundled with a new copy of the game. And I use "expansion" lightly. They only thing it adds is ladingings on nonatmosphere planetoids. and the use of a surface vehicle. Thats it. Progression is slow and grindy and the game just gets tedious and doesn't really even have fun, exciting, or deep mechanics. Game gets pretty dull, even for a space sim. Not sure how all this potential back from the alpha and kickstarter got wasted. Worth $40 for the game and another $40 for the "expansion" No, hell no. Maybe pick it up on a sale if you're a fan of the genre.","September 4, 2015","false","98.1"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","39","62","0","0"

Overpriced, boring techdemo and they want you to pay basic content extra (calling it "addons"). You're better off watching some let's plays or streams before you seriously consider buying this. Don't listen to overhyped fanboys telling you this price and addon policy is normal, it's not. The base game is not even finished and they're already throwing full priced addons at customers. Mkay.\n\nThe game "looks" and "controls" nicely and could actually be very fun if the devs would just add some interesting missions and balance the trading / and mission reward system. "Powerplay" Update... who cares? It's not like it's actually adding something to the game, it's just the same nonsense you'd do anyway with worse (non-existent) rewards.\n\nHowever, I recommend StarCitizen instead where you'll get WAY more content which is better at the same time. And it's even cheaper if you decide to buy the smallest package (won't give a disadvantage and it's no p2w system, google it).\n\nI call Elite: X a ripoff, deal with it.","August 5, 2015","false","272.2"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","29","44","0","8"

They're using their time well and the development is going great.\nStar Citizen is NOT good right now, but it WILL be.\nIf they finish it. Which I doubt. They're taking way too long despite their absurd amounts of money.\nIf you want something that won't cost you an arm or a leg to play right now, get Elite. Planetary landings and more are on the way soon, and although that's an expansion, it's not DLC. It's a proper expansion. I haven't seen one of those in years.\n\nSo if you wanna fork out like, idk, 60 quid (?) total for Elite and the Horizons expansion right now? Do it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwongwah/recommended/359320/","kwongwah","kwongwah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwongwah/","62 products in account","It's been twenty years or there abouts since I played Elite First Encounters, first picking up after friends raved about how great Elite 2: Frontier was. For those that remember, First Encounters was bug ridden at launch and I suspect derailed the development of the Elite francise til now. I will make most comparrisions between Dangerious and First Encounters or egosofts X reunion/rebirth game as this is the most recent and perhaps most familiar space sim (not counting Eve Online)\n\nFirst of all to anyone familiar with the old Elite games, Elite Dangerous will instantly feel like an nice fitting old glove you have not put on in a long time and it'll appear so comfortable wearing it again. The radar and weapon systems are just like I remember it from First Encounters twenty years ago, but with up to day graphics. Grapically it looks amazing for a space sim, reminds me a lot of the X series of games when I first played those. An easy way to summaries this is X series (egosoft) graphics with Elite game mechanics. Music is very nice from what I heard. Space combat is just like I remember it from the old games. In fact much of the game mechanics, and galaxy map/system is pretty much the same as the old elite games but better looking. Only one major change is docking is manually done, it's not autopiloted as found in First Encounters\n\nFor those who never played any of the Elite series before, you are loaned a starter ship from the begining and given a handful of credits to start your adventure. There is no real definite goal in this game other than what you set yourself. YOu can become a trader, explorer, pirate, bounty hunter, mercenary or a plain old space taxi driver. There are three main activities in the game in which you are ranked, combat, exploration and trading. You can eventually achieve elite ranking in each and every one of these three but it's not something that is going to be done overnight. Much of the game you will spend either in the space station working out the best trades to make or how to avoid loses and traveling in space. The game is based within our own milky way galaxy as a reference and it is massive in terms of scale. Significantly bigger than the universe in egosoft's own series\n\nThe game has a number of ships many of which will be familiar to fans of the Elite series and all are costumisable in their loadouts to suit your needs.\n\nThere are major gripes I have with what I have seen thus far.\n\n1. The tutorials are horrible and poor, they virtually DO NOT explain any thing clearly and literally require a bit of inititive on your part to find out what does what and a fair bit of time staring at the keymap settings. I gone through three of the tutorials and it feels like being asked to take a driving test blind folded! Here you're probably better off looking for a youtube video by someone to explain how things work! Instead go to their website and watch their tutorials on their website, link here..\nhttp://www.elitedangerous.com/guide/training\n\n2. The game doesn't seem to be desinged with a mouse user in mind, mouse sensitivity is very high, in default you can easily spin into a loop if you just nudge your mouse left or right, you'll often have to change the settings or switch to a joystick or controller. The controls are highly costumisable so its not that huge an issue as much as it is an irritation.\n\n3. The game can not be played in an Offline mode, this is part due to the economy being influenced by what other players of the game do. The economiy and price of goods is impacted by other players, if everyone trades far too much in one type of good it will change the trade conditions in that area. As such trading in Dangerious is a much harder and complicated affair than what it was found in First Encounters. All in all that is not really a problem when you consider the reason.. What may become an issue is that the servers the game use, you may have some problems connecting to them. Not sure of the cause of this\n\n4. Docking, what's seemingly not mentioned anywhere is that you need to be facing a particular direction when you dock else you won't be able to dock. I lost count of the number of times i had my ship backwards and failing to dock, leaving me wondering for a few seconds what was wrong as I got everything else right\n\nBased on first impressions, and of what I know of the old Elite games...\n\nHighly recommended if you are any of the following\n1. A fan of the old Elite games, Frontier, First encounter etc.\n2. Like the combat and trade element of Egosoft's X series, but not keen on empire building in terms of owning space stations\n3. Someone who loves open world games where you set your own goals... The game galaxy is absoluely massive!\n\nI do not recommend the game to the following ..\n1. Instant gradification players, the game is slow to get into in that much of the game will revolve around very long term goals.\n2. Players who like zero inertia space sim games, there is no instant turning on a dime in this game, you will easily travel a few AUs or Light seconds before you make a turn if your speed is very high.\n3. Anyone expecting to have the empire buidling element of the egosoft X series like owning stations and a whole host of fleet owned ships.","April 4, 2015","true","11.0"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","37","59","0","0"

The scale and depth of the game continues to blow my mind. I had to reread the description to make sure. The interface is beautiful and will integrate seamlessly into any VR technology. The graphics are fine, basically what I would expect out of a 2015 release. The sounds lend the the immersion of the game and the music is atmospheric as well.\n\nCombat in the game takes the form of outerspace dog-fights a la Battlefront 2, but again contemporary features from the past decade add finesse and flexibility to the system. You can be a pirate or a bounty hunter and I assume (though I have yet to participate in) there is some faction related content as you progress. You take the money that you earn to upgrade your ship or trade for more profit.\n\nFor me, all of this really takes a back-seat to the exploration element of the game. It's the entirety of the milky-way. You get rewarded for exploring as you can sell data that you've accumulated to space stations in order to fund your adventures. Like startrek for profit. It's probably not the most efficient way to make money in the game but it's super fun.\n\nI don't know if they have plans to expand an avatar system. AFAIK the most personal you get with your pilot is seeing their hands as they do their piloting. Customization there would be cool. It would also be pretty neet to land on and explore the planets you discover, but I guess that would present a new set of challenges.\n\nStill as it sits, Elite: Dangerous is both polished and fun.

It's an intellectual, immersive space game. The story evolves slowly and it's a game filled with thought. People are so used to games with constant non-stop action and senseless violence these days, a game like this is bound to have it's haters. That said, the combat is still brilliant.\n\nThe fact is the technology alone is incredible. They have a real-scale replica of the ENTIRE Milky Way Galaxy, all 400 BILLION star systems. I can't even begin to imagine how their systems are capable of simulating that real time, procedurally or otherwise.\nThey are also hosting a full-scale MMO without charging a monthly subscription. NICE.\n\nBecause of the plethora of negative reviews I very nearly didn't buy this game. Since I did, I showed my parents and they got so excited they went out and bought flightsticks and extra copies just so we could all play together. My Dad ended up buying a Saitek X52, a seperate-throttle super high-quality flight controller that was actually modelled into the game's cockpits. That's right, it's the exact same one as what's in the game.\n\nWe've bought numerous copies to send to friends so we can all play together, and many of my friends went out to buy their own flightsticks as well.\nIf you're bored of hauling cargo, get a gun and go shoot someone.\nThe consequences of this are, you get chased by cops, and you get to shoot them too!\nIf you like combat, the game has combat.\nIf you like exploration, it has that too.\nIf you like ongoing development on an MMO style game but without a monthly subscription IT ABSOLUTELY HAS THAT.\n\nLong story short, the technology alone will make your jaw drop, the seamlessness is perfect and it plays just like a AAA title should. It's well designed, fun to play, very immersive and a MUST HAVE for any Sci-Fi enthusist. This game and Star Citizen almost single-handedly revived the Sci-Fi game market.","April 9","true","371.1"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","33","52","0","1"

Maybe you mine a little here and there or have a boring dogfight with some pirates or the law. It takes at least 2 hours just to learn the controls which makes the steam refund worthless. I couldn't even get a verification email and when I contacted support they gave me this brilliant reply "Change your email." After awhile you'll start to notice how little content is really in the game too. Sure the universe is big, but it's full of mostly the same textures and objects. You get very few ships and can't customize much on them other than what you equip.  Mostly it just feels like they tried to stretch a small amount of content over a really big canvas, which made it feel watered-down.\n\n\nUpdate: So after playing for at least 20 hours I enjoyed it a little more than at first, but it still just doesn't seem fun. My original review pretty much nailed it. People keep telling me "It's about your journey" which seems like a lazy excuse for "Hey we don't have much content so figure out something to do on your own." The missions are almost all copy paste (Deliver this here, kill x amount of pirates or specific generic pirate). Trading is pretty boring you just figure out what commodity pays the best carry it back and forth between two systems. The only even remotely fun thing is PvP combat, which tends to get old after a few hours. If you could get out on randomly generated planets, build bases, and some sort of fps aspect too, I would love it to pieces. Right now though it just seems like a half-finished attempt at what could be a great game.\n\nUpdate: So Horizons costs $45...I barely wanted to pay the sale price of $15 I paid, and somewhat regret that.

Three ways to make a living and it's hard to do any one without doing the others to some extent, Exploration, Trade with a sub class of miner, and Combat subbed by bounty hunting, piracy, or a military career. The game is awesome in that you make it what you want. You can configure a fighter's hull for mining or a traders hull for combat, while those may be poor choices, it's all up to you. I use a Flightstick Pro and combat is pretty easy for me except for the deadliest targets as long as it's 1v1.

The flight mechanics are superb, handling the ships can be hard work but the result is a real in-game skill, and not some computer assisted variant thereof.

I watched some gameplay, and noticed a few people complaining about the game charging for new content when it was released as if early access. I understood why they were annoyed, but I though hey it's a kickstarter game company, they must need the money to fund development and I can get behind it.\n\n\nMy first 2 minutes of the game were spent signing up via the launcher/website, and being bombarded with in game purchases I could make. Seeing that some of the 'only 8 pounds' offerings were tedious things like changing my ship to green or yellow made me very wary. But I plowed on and started the game up. I picked my commander name and spent a further few minutes being told that my usual go to names were already taken, which was a first but not surprising as they're space themed. I settled on a meh variation of my usual and started.\n\n\nRealising there is no default third person option was very very jarring for me. I play almost all of my games in that view, and to be honest it's kinda expected nowadays. I spent some time getting a feel for the controls, but they were really messed up as I later found out my mouse had loaded off centre. I reloaded the game but again my mouse was off centre, meaning I struggled to actually click the menu controls etc. At this point I gave up.\n\n\n\nI really don't like badly polished games, games that are 'EA like' in their money farming, or games that lack depth. I'm sure this game has loads of depth, but with the other two in mind I just can't bring myself to have paid full price for a clearly buggy unfinished game that's already trying to squeeze every penny out of the players.

Normal flight, supercruise and hyperspace.\n+Immersive UI design with easy hotkeys.  You can easily switching to left or right panel with single click, or just stare to open the panels if you have VR such as Oculus Rift.\n+Nice Universal Cartographics.  Very easy to navigate and very informative.\n+Random signatures give more unsure possibilities to your flight.\n+Decent background music and AI voice.\n+Persistance Universe is very cool.  Game time sync with real time, A.C.2014 as A.C.3300.  Makes you feel like living in that universe.\n+P2P + Server-Client connection mechanism creates a no lag MMO experience.\n+Really nice optimization.  Currently the game only need 5.5GB harddisk space.  And about 800MB RAM while running.\n\n-Few ships design.  Currently only 20 flyable ships and some ships have quite similar appearence.  i.g.  Sidewinder, Cobra MKIII and ASP Exploerer.\n-Few space station / starport design.  Currently only 1 type for small station, and 3 types for large station with all the same interior design.\n-PowerPlay makes no sense in some place.  i.g. Zachary Hudson controls tons of Federation systems with Independent capital?\n-Lots of missions but most of them are low profit.  If you want to make money, illegal and smuggling is the only way to make money fast.\n-No or few coop/team mission.  Team play is very weak, mostly single player missions in the universe now.  So does PvP.\n-Poor training tutorials.  They help you to understand how to fly the ship, but not telling you how to get started, even no UI instruction.\n-There's no mechanism for player to own multiple ships.  You can only fly one ship at a time, and all your other ships can only park at the shipyard and do nothing. (X series can remotely control your ships to trade or fly to station.)\n\nIt's really fun at the beginning.  But you'll gradually find that the ships and the stations are all the same, and the multiplayer is not completed.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥meplay with Persistance Universe, Elite: Dangerous could do more than this.  Lots of potential for Elite: Dangerous and it needs some little tweaks.\n\nGenerally speaking, Elite: Dangerous is a nice game if you like space and futuristic game.  I believe it'll be even more completed with the upcoming patch in the furture.\n\n\n這是對 1.3 PowerPlay 版本的簡評。\n\n首先，我喜歡宇宙和未來設定的遊戲。Elite: Dangerous 是一款富有潛力的太空遊戲，我的意思是目前遊戲整體玩起來還算不錯，非常漂亮又有趣，但有些地方感覺尚未完成或是仍待改進。\n\n+精美的畫質和壯麗的宇宙。\n+流暢的導航設計，普通飛行、超光速飛行和超空間跳躍。\n+融入感強烈的介面設計以及方便的快速鍵，你可以按一個按鈕就輕鬆切換左右面板，或是如果你有VR顯示器，例如Oculus Rift，也可以盯著適當的位置自動開啟面板。\n+好用的宇宙星圖，很好操作而且資訊充足。\n+隨機的太空訊號讓遊戲增加更多不確定要素。\n+遊戲背景音樂和AI語音十分到位。\n+永恆宇宙非常讚，遊戲時間與現實世界時間同步，西元2014年開始同步遊戲西元3300年，讓你感覺就像住在那個世界一樣。\n+P2P + Server-Client 的連線設計提供一個不會lag的MMO多人連線體驗。\n+非常棒的優化，目前遊戲只佔5.5GB的硬碟空間，執行的時候也只消耗大約800MB的RAM記憶體空間。\n\n-星艦設計貧乏，目前整個遊戲只有20艘可飛行的船艦，而且很多船艦外觀看起來十分雷同，例如Sidewinder、Cobra MKIII、ASP Explorer。\n-太空站設計貧乏，目前只有一種小型太空站和三種大型太空站，而且所有太空站內部設計都長一樣。\n-PowerPlay有些設計不合邏輯，例如Zachary Hudson的母星系是獨立星盟(Independent)，但他統治的領土幾乎都是聯邦(Federation)的星系？\n-遊戲中有很多種任務，但是大部分利潤都太低，如果真的想賺錢，非法任務和走私是唯一的快速管道。\n-沒有或是很少的合作/團隊任務，目前遊戲團隊合作機制非常差，幾乎都是單人任務居多，而PvP相關機制一樣貧乏。\n-模糊的教學，教學只告訴你該怎麼飛太空船，卻忘了教你新手該怎麼起始遊戲，甚至連介面都沒介紹。\n-目前的設計讓玩家沒必要擁有多艘太空船，你同時只能開一艘太空船，其他的船只能停在太空站內什麼也不能做。(X系列中玩家可以遠端操控其他自有的太空船進行貿易或停靠太空站。)\n\n一開始的時候的確很有趣，但隨著遊玩你會漸漸發現船艦和太空站怎麼看起來都好像，而且多人遊戲的部分感覺也不夠完整，MMO多人連線加上永恆宇宙的設計，應該可以做出更多的變化，Elite: Dangerous還有很多潛力並需要一些調整。\n\n整體來說，如果你喜歡宇宙和未來的設定，Elite: Dangerous是一款不錯的遊戲，我相信在未來的更新中會慢慢的讓遊戲更完整。","July 13, 2015","true","160.9"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","46","77","2","6"

[T]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maniac_sniper/","87 products in account","Elite: Dangerous the title says it from the get go and all the trailers make you feel it stepping into the vast empty space between worlds ready to take on anything that comes your way. There are games out there that fail to deliver on what they promise but this isn't one of them. I've spent the entire 50 hours of this game playing it with my best friend cruising around through space and there have been heart attacks and mockery and laughing beyond count, also shared by utter moments of terror.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand and in all honesty it benefits from the fact that it doesn't, you are exploring the vast space something that is suppose to be new and foreign and exciting and sort of blundering your way through everything makes it just that much more enjoyable if a little frustrating at times. The learning curve is extremely steep but the challenge is what's really enjoyable. The controls at first are extremely overwhelming but as you spend more time familiarising yourself with them you will learn tricks that at first you thought weren't possible, some of the maneurvers you can manage to pull off fully utilizing all the directional thrusters can make for very exciting dog fights. It'll feel really counter intuitive at first especially using a mouse and keyboard, once you get use to it though you'll find the default setup and controls are really effective. That being said I'd still recommend playing the game with a joystick if you have one nothing beats the feeling of maneuvering with a joystick.\n\nThe game is a challenge it's not an easy or quick advancing game, you will need to put hours of work into it to get where you want to be, 50 hours in and I've manage to put together a nice little fighter in the Cobra MK III which is one of the lower ranged ships and it's utterly satisfying having achieve just that small task. The selection of ships at the moment is adequet though the jumps and options between them could be a lot larger, there are plans and concepts of new ships that are in the works and you can have a look at them as well so the game is being worked on to expand the variety which is reassuring that you will get more choices and chances to have different experiences down the track. You will also spend a lot of time outfitting and finding the right kind of weapon combinations and different alterations you can make to your ships load out so that it feels just right.\n\nA lot of the reviews indicate the game as a space trucking sim and it can be if thats what you want it to be, it does make more money the further you progress through the game but you don't have to do it if you don't want to. You can spend hours aimlessly jumping from system to system scanning for planets and finding  new exciting things if you want to, or you can go to a hot spot and fight off pirates defending miners to earn bounties, if you are up for a bit more of a challenge you can go hunting special character bounties or drop into fleet battles and try to tip the scales in a battle, you might be the person that just likes to kick back relax and just shoot rocks to make some money mining or you can spend hours on hours jumping between systems hauling cargo from one port to port just chilling with music enjoying the beauty and vastness of space. The point is that the universe is huge and you can do whatever you like out there and this game gives you the different options to.\n\nThe graphics in this game I can only run at medium settings because my system is a little lacking but even at that setting everything is utterly gorgeous. It's grandeous in every aspect and can be quiet terrifying. The feeling of hauling a load of cargo worth almost as much as your ship is to somewhere you haven't been before to try make a big score on credits only to drop out into the system ontop of a white dwarf and have it pull you into it's gravity well. Fighting against the pull of the sun that's trying to suck you in and vaporize all your hard work on your ship and your investment in the cargo. Something simple as just jumping between systems became something unexpect and dangerous and that's what this game can be summed up by. Space is vast and you never know what is going to happen to try ruin your day and on ocasions it will. My advice is get the game with a friend or 2 and play it together from the get go you will have a lot of fun and laugh at each others mistakes and in the end learn and enjoy the game more.\n\nThe best moment my friend and I have had is fighting in amongst an asteroid field and I accidentlly hit my boost key and he's just watched as my ship has gone full throttle straight into an asteroid as i've tried desperately to pull up, bounced off it and for a moment he thought i'd lived before 2-3 seconds later I exploded in a glorious fashion. If I had to score the game it'd get a 8.7/10. It's a lot of fun needs a little more options in regards to stepping stones in ships and weapon variations but it is a lot of fun.\n","April 29, 2015","true","152.0"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","27","42","0","0"

This implies that there are more than one available paths for individual success. This was somewhat true until the recent patch. A lot of people are complaining in the official forums that their funds are severely hurt by the new changes. I have noticed and felt this too. As it is, this game is not fun unless you have the mental attitude and skills of a fighter pilot. And even that may be insufficient, because progress has been made extremely difficult. You get blown up without the any means to affect your fate and the insurance payments quickly begin to dwindle your available funds. I, for one, have spent a full year playing this game and like exploration and trading. Nowadays there is only combat, which a) does not interest me b) is highly in favor of the NPCs.

All the following prices will be quoted in NZD.\n\nIf you buy Elite: Dangerous at full price you'll pay $51.99. Or you can buy Elite: Horizons for $84.99. Elite: Horizons is the 'enhanced' version of the game with all the original content, not a simple case of DLC.\n\nAs a current owner of Elite: Dangerous I can purchase Elite: Horizons at a 25% discount, paying $63.74.\n\nThe difference between $51.99 and $84.99 is - for a newcomer who doesn't own Elite: Dangerous already - just $33. So, as a newcomer, you can essentially pay just $33 for the additional content, whereas someone who has owned and supported the game with a launch purchase (and a handful of cosmetic upgrades from their store) has the privilege of paying twice what a newcomer does for the additional content.\n\nIn total, as a present owner of Elite: Dangerous, if I wanted to upgrade to Elite: Horizons it would mean I've paid a total of $115.73.

Flying by a ringed planet? Drop out of supercruise and fly around the icy ring, dodging huge chunks of ice and rock. Very nice, very detailed environment. Want to land on that planet? That'll cost you more than you paid for the base game.\n\nThe base game is fairly basic on features. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it. If you're trading, it's difficult to use the market features to find good prices (which essentially requires the use of the clunky map and a lot of clicking. Some kind of market data screen like EVE would be fantastic). If you're doing missions, it's very difficult to know the prerequisites for a mission or how to complete certain types of missions. Going out and finding bad guys to kill is probably the most fun thing you can do, and you'll end up grinding that for a while to get enough money to upgrade.\n\nBeyond that, I'm pretty disappointed with the way Frontier Developments is expanding on the game.

In the end, I decided the only way I would be able to have any kind of judgement on the game would be buying the damn thing and playing it myself. One thing I can tell you right here and now is that I DO NOT regret this purchase.\n\nElite: Dangerous is a true joy to play, being my first ever space simulation game I expected a lot from it and I was not disappointed. I wanted intergalactic travel and dogfights in asteroid fields, I wanted to feel like I was in a f*cking Star Trek movie and you know what? I got just what I f*cking wanted.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game is an absolute b*tch to learn to play. The control scheme for a mouse and keyboard is probably the hardest part about the learning curve, there are so many controls that need adjusting and key bindings to change to suit your play style but once it's all done and dusted and you know the controls off the back of your hand you can finally enjoy yourself.\n\nOne thing to note - Elite: Dangerous is not a game where you will see hundreds of people everywhere you go. Being in a universe with 400 MILLION GALAXIES there will be times where you see nobody, and there will be times where you see a sh*t ton of people all at once. The game can get rather quiet and lonely at times, which is why I HIGHLY recommend playing with friends when/if you can. Playing solo isn't terrible by any means, but you need to really be dedicated to getting something done if you want to have fun with it for a prolonged period of time.\n\nGraphically, this game is gorgeous. The first time I jumped into hyperspace I was like "holy f*cking crap" because that is just how awesome it is. Upon exiting hyperspace however, I sat back in my chair and giggled to myself because of how incredible it looked. The attention to detail, the animation and visuals, they just blow you away.\n\nOVERVIEW\n------------\n\nElite: Dangerous is an ambitious and unhealthily addictive space simulation game which truly embraces the community that have helped build the game from the ground up. Sure, it may grab you by the balls and throw you into an open universe, but my god you can't help but love it. With many updates planned for the future, and with all the content it has available to you now, this game is set to be, in my humble opinion, one of the best space simulation games of the century.\n\nFrom me, Elite: Dangerous get's a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 BUT learning the controls for keyboard & mouse can be a true chore... That, for me, was the only negative part of the game I have yet to come across.","April 8, 2015","true","110.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","29","46","0","0"

I was really excited about Elite: Dangerous and it is a game I have really tried to love.  Technically it is very impressive with a huge game universe and nice graphics and decent combat.  But at this stage I have to say that out of the last decade or so this is the gaming purchase that I most regret.\n\nIn practice this has taken the worst elements of the older games (grinding, repetitive generic missions, predictable NPC AI, etc) and combined them with an innovative range of modern annoyances (crackpot developers, troll players, sometimes toxic community, shared online universe even in 'solo' mode, etc).  I'm not saying the game is terrible - but overall I found it disappointing, lacking both features as an MMO and content for it's (sort of) single player experience.\n\nNow, however, with the release of Elite Dangerous: Horizons I believe it is time to throw my toys out of the pram.  Horizons being a season of DLC for Elite: Dangerous in the format of a new AAA priced game.  I can't see how driving around empty planets is going to adress the games more basic flaws, and I don't have much interest in the games other allegedly upcoming features.  I won't be purchasing Horizons - but I'll still be sharing a universe with Horizons players with an economy that I imagine will become geared towards players who can loot and craft and so on.  I can't even be happily obsolete in peace in the non-existent single player campaign.\n\nApparently this is part of a ten-year development program.  So as far as I can tell it's an early access game for the next ten years and early adopters get the reward of buying the game full price ten times?  In the circumstances I am even offended by the 25% 'loyalty discount' I have available for the purchase of Horizons, given that I'd still be paying £30 for a season pass of DLC with much more to follow while I still don't have anything that feels like a complete game for the expensive title I already bought.\n\nIn conclusion, big jobs to Elite: Dangerous and then some.  This now obsolete version of the game isn't great as a standalone product, and anyone happily signing up to the ten year schedule of payments for a space MMO needs to be far more optimistic than myself that someday a lot of depth will be added to the game rather than just it's vast empty breadth.","December 16, 2015","false","9.8"," 56 of 96 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","56","96","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudezer88/recommended/359320/","dudezer88","Dudezer88","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudezer88/","124 products in account","A game that has all the makings to be something special, but never seems to deliver. There's a lot of good groundwork in this game, but it never feels whole, and at a certain point you will find yourself grinding forever for that next ship or upgrade. Nothing fundamentaly changes once you have that next piece of shiny either. You'll just gain money from the three things there are to do in the game; trade, fight, or explore, slightly faster. Another reviewer noted that the early portion of this game is the best part of the experience. And this is largely true, although the game does nothing to guide you toward what to do first. This is fine too though, I think there's a place for games that don't hand hold. The game does have some decent tutorials to get you through the basics of flying, landing, and fighting.\n\nOnce you have a handle on things you can upgrade to a few new ships fairly quickly. The ship design is probably one of the strongest aspects of this game. Each ship is rendered beautifully, and is balanced for it's particular role. Some ships are better for combat, while others are obviously only good for trading, and some sit somewhere in the middle. They each sound and feel different as well, larger ships have an obvious heft to the way they maneuver, but also sound heavy when the engines kick in. This really gives each ship a bit of a personality, to the point where I found myself getting attached to a particular ship.\n\nThere is a point where this game turns into a much different experience from when you are starting out. It's the point at which every step you want to take turns into an insufferable grind. It feels like the result of developers creating too big of a universe to actually fill. And to fix that, they made the progression artificially long. This really only serves to highlight the monotony present in this game though, because now you're engaged in the process of min/maxing for progression. If you want to make credits, forget about missions, most of them don't pay well enough to be worth the time. Forget exploration too, that definitely doesn't pay well. You'll spend your time at a resource collection site blowing up the same enemies over and over again, or if you feel that isn't soul crushing enough you can run a trade route, which typically boils down to flying back and forth between two systems in a slow heavy ship where nothing much happens. And don't get me wrong, combat is fun and has some depth to it here, but it's ultimately repetitive especially after 100 hours or so in the same ship or maybe two. It also doesn't give you the same sense of scale some old space sim games like Freespace do.\n\nSo, I think it's time for me to take my leave from this game. The grind is just too much of a time suck and doesn't have much more to offer. The combat is fun, so I might continue to dabble in that here and there. Exploration is cool too, but a whole galaxy to explore isn't much more than a marketing bullet point. There really isn't much out there and what is there takes way too long to get to. If you're going to make the conceit that you can travel faster than light, why can I only jump a limited distance? I'd like to make a trip to the center of the galaxy, but I don't have a spare 50 hours to spend watching loading screens. There needs to be some sort of challenge to exploration, right now the only challenge is to your attention span.\n\nI can't fully recommend this game. It's fun for a while, but it gets pretty repetitive, and turns into a major time sink after a while. They would do well to add some more variety to the game, make missions viable, more varied and complex, make exploration a bit more of a challenge somehow. Enjoy the first 20 to 40 hours or so, but try not to get sucked into the black hole that is the progression grind.\n\n","January 17","false","378.0"," 56 of 96 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","56","96","0","2"

But that's it. After it took me about 3 hours to get my hands on the controls only, I had absolutely no idea what to do: I did some missions, which are repeating themselves in a loop, then I was like "Ok so what's up now? What's next?"\n\nNothing is next: you just choose your playstyle and you repeat the same stuff again and again. I know that because I've been browsing reviews after I started to get real bored, I thought it was me who did not understand the essence of this game, but no. I believe the devs have made a very beautiful and appealing game, without the means to follow-up on its developement. Oppoosed to its direct competitor, Eve Online which is litterally animated by its active community, Elite: Dangerous has failed where it should not have. Like I have read in another review: "They have made an immense game, but forgot about depth". That's right.\n\nAh and finally, talking about Multiplayer mode: unless you start the adventure with a friend, playing online does not bring ANYTHING to the game: I started my playthrough solo, because I wanted to avoid getting griefed like it happened to me on Eve Online back in the days. When I got my first real ship (Viper MKIII), I went online and OH MY GOD people are silent. I spent a full hour trying to get someone to play with me in a group, but no one would. I don't blame them, it's pointless to play in group and it's tedious too apparently. No gameplay elements is here to have you think about grouping with people: missions are easy, the only reason you'd want to group with soomeone is if you find yourself a bounty that is too tough for you, but even then, you'd have to tail the bounty as you recruit and wait for the person to join, which most likely would take an eternity.\n\nI think this game should have been a solo adventure, with a real scenario. THAT would have been awesome. Yes, I'm thinking of Freelancer. I'm going to reinstall it.\n\nBottom line:\nThe game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful, the dog fights feel GREAT too, but this game is like a Big Mac: it looks good on the cover, it smells nice when you open the box and you would LOVE the first bit, but once you've come to the end of it, it leaves you a stomach ache, you are still hungry and you'll eventually poop liquid.","January 2","false","33.0"," 57 of 98 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","57","98","5","1"

It has good combat/trading/exploration options for varying degress of space enthusiasm. You can lose youself pretty quick or run out of fuel and not know a close space station to dock at. But if you take your time and learn the game, you CAN get your moneys worth. You must be invested, it is not just a sit down and beat it quickly type game. You can spend several hours and not make a dent, or get attacked by space pirates and are forced to take a loan to get a new spaceship to continue your adventures.\n\nThe game offers basic to expert level tutorials for all space travellers and video guides to show you how to play (external links to youtube, not ingame videos)\n\nIf you think you can handle the extreme, the void and the great beyond... Then get this game and invest some time into it, You (probably) won't regret it if you learn how to use all the games mechanics to your advantages.\n\nI personally spent 2 hours when i started learning the basics of the game through the tutorials (and cursing alot too when the mechanics proved to be difficult to master) and I am now several hours into the game and it is still frustrating, yet the more I play the better I get, and the more fun and further I can travel and explore. I'm still in the learning phase and It is still throwing new mechanics and gameplay at me.\n\nSo much to take in and learn when you start playing, but from a review standpoint, $70 is expensive if you don't plan on investing time into learning how to play and getting the most out of your time spent playing. So visit the forums, ask questions and watch the tutorial videos and play the tutorial missions (You will need it and won't regret doing it!)","April 3, 2015","true","43.9"," 41 of 69 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","41","69","3","0"

The flying mechanics are beautiful, the graphics are beautiful and the sounds are BEAUTIFUL.\n\nWhat is actually in the game so far is very, very well done - but that's just it. The game has been out for just under a year now, and it's recieved 4 major updates (with a 5th one very close). Although these updates add cool things, it just doesn't feel like it slots in properly and they just feel unneeded on the whole. When you get down to it, there is a distinctive lack of things to do.\n\nBefore the game came to Steam though, I put a conciderable amount of time into it (close to a week, I think). In this time, I exhausted the game of everything it had - I'd traded, pirated, bounty hunted, mined and explored, in almost every ship available until I was bored senseless. I really want to play it again, but there's just nothing for me to do.\n\nThe largest problem though, the one that really gets to me, the one that turned this review to negative, is Horizons. If you don't know, Horizons is the upcoming update adding the ability to control a rover on a planet. Planet transitions were promised since day 1 of the alpha - since people were backing the game on Kickstarter. So why then, do existing players, even if they had the Beta of the game and paid £50 ($75) for it, have to pay the full price of the game to recieve the update (which to be honest looks a little underwhelming) when new players will recieve the update completely free of charge?\n\nSo really, if the game sounds appealing to you (and you can wait for No Man's Sky), wait for Horizons. Otherwise, even if you're slightly unsure, just wait for No Man's Sky. It'll be worth the wait.","November 28, 2015","false","6.0"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","35","58","2","9"

You cant share missions/transfer credits/Give ships. The game needs true coop, or at least the possibility to transfer funds to other players, so that you could pay people for their services (bodyguarding/mining/shipping)..\nBecause of the limited content in the base game it fells very much like an early access title.

For newcomers this isnt an issue, as they wil upon purchase of elite dangerous horizons, recieve the base game including the new "season" named horizons. On the other hand if you already own the base game, you´ll have to pay full price, eg. base game+horizons.\nTHIS has got to be THE worst ripoff i´ve ever seen from a developer.\nCalling horizons a "season" when in reality it is only a dlc, does not justify the insane price tag!

It's immersive, it's vast, it's exciting - you never quite know what's going to happen once you jump into a new star system. Yeah, there's a bit of a learning curve as people mention, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some critics would have you believe. One bit of advice though: A good HOTAS is its own reward. Was pleasantly surprised to discover they already had a profile for the Saitek X55, so all the agony of binding controls was taken care of for me. This made things much easier to learn, and I'd imagine it'd do wonders for anyone just starting out.\n\nAnother thing I have to applaud is that this is not a pay-to-win sort of game. Microtransactions are the bane of modern MMOs in my opinion, but this one hits it dead-on by avoiding all of that. Yes, there's DLC, but we're talking paint schemes and decals for your ships, not overpowered superweapons or XP boosts. When you buy the game, you're buying *the game.*\n\nThe level of immersion might be the crown jewel though. I have a TrackIR, and being able to look around and interact with the cockpit's instrumentation and menus as though I was actually sitting inside of it has probably been the biggest thing I love about the game. There's a feeling of badassery when your ship is transported to the docking area of a space station and you take off for the first time, and being able to look around and take it all in just makes it that much better.\n\nOh, and the ability to play by yourself with computer NPCs? Yeah, that's the good stuff. Sometimes it's nice to enjoy a game like this without worrying about griefers or trolls coming by and ruining your day (although you'll discover in due time that NPC pirates like to try and do the same thing.)\n\nOverall, I recommend picking this title up. There's no shortage of things to do and I'm honestly very excited to see what future developments bring.","April 6, 2015","true","096.0"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","28","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonarismusic/recommended/359320/","sonarismusic","SONARIS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonarismusic/","103 products in account","This is a long read.\n\nElite:Dangerous is probably a game you will not enjoy. Wait, what? Yes, statistically speaking you probably will not like this game. It's not like other games, this is a game for a few very dedicated players, and pretty much no one else. This is actually why I LOVE this game. The community is exclusive, but tight.\n\nThe game is dying. Well, you certainly could say that, but you would be very much wrong. With 6.5 years left in the lifescycle, this game is barely even born yet. As for activity, just look at the E;D subreddit, and you will quickly see that people not only play this game every day - much like I do - but have a love for it which few games earn.\n\nIf you read all the negative reviews, they typically come from three types of people:\n\n1. The player who put in 200+ hours and is complaining that the game is now boring. Two. Hundred. Hours. That's a lot of playtime before you get bored. I love Skyrim, but I haven't even squeezed 200 hours of of that one. Basically, if you've played 200+ hours, you've at least gotten your money's worth, compared to 90% of games out there.\n\n2. The player who bought E;D on sale, expecting some sort of Star Wars adventure game. This is not an adventure game, it has no story, it has no real plot and the missions are pretty much all the same. It's a simulator, which I think is the part a lot of these reviews don't get.\n\n3. The player who complains about the expansions costing money. No ♥♥♥♥, people are working, probably full time, to roll out expansions and they have a small team. They have to eat too.\n\nThe game is grindy. When you play any open world game, there will be some activities which must be done repetitively. My favorite is when people try to tell me that this game could be more like WoW. Really? Because WoW isn't grindy? I played WoW for years and stopped reading the quest descriptions after like a week. Just click quest, kill, click quest, repeat thousands of times. Run the same dungeon and battleground a thousand times to get some gear. Do daily quests, literally the same exact quest every single day, for months to buy a sweet mount. Come on. Yes, E;D is grindy, but it's grindy becuase it's simulates a real world kind of environment, where you have a job to do - if you want to - and you have to do it a bunch of times to buy "better" ships, wow - real revelation there. How dare the devs require players to work to buy new ships?\n\nThis game claims to be multiplayer but isn't really. Well, it is and it isn't. The good thing about this game is that you don't really need to rely on anyone but yourself to get ahead in the game. So, in that respect, it is a single player game. However, it's a game you could play with other people, if you wanted to. In fact, there are player factions which all work together, groups of explorers who travel hundreds of thousands of light years together. There are groups of traders, bounty hunters, pirates and more. You may not find them in the game, so you may have to look around the internet for communities. I spent three hours yesterday trying to help a buddy of mine refuel his ship when he got stranded on some random system. In the process, I almost blew him up. An experience was created, laughs were had, and a feeling of ahcievement, when we got things to work, was present.\n\nThe best ships take forever to get. Again, this is totally false. Some might argue that the Asp Explorer is the best overall ship in the game, because it basically allows you to pretty much do anything you want in the game, and do it pretty well. Are there better options for cerrtain tasks? Obviously, but no one is forcing you to use them. The Asp Explorer is attainable by even the most casual player in maybe a month of gametime, and I'm talking about doing barely anytnig in the game at all.\n\nWith all that said. I repeat, this game is probably not for you. But, it could be. And, you'll never know if it is until you try it. If you like the grind, and you like the feeling of working for something, this game is great. If you like linear progrssion, hand holding and pre-scripted stories, this game is definitely not for you.\n\n200 hours in and I'm still constantly learning about this game. I spend a good amount of time, outside the game, reading about the game, communicating with other players on reddit, looking up trade routes on various websites. This game is so much deeper than what you see on the surface when you fire it up. And, it's totally up to you if you want to do all the reading and commmunicating, but it helps, it keep the game more interesting and it adds a layer to the game which many other games lack, because everything is handed to you inside the game. When I fly, I listen to audiobooks or music, sometimes I chat with other commanders who are also playing and flying somewhere in the galaxy.\n\nIf you enjoy a  solitary, raw, no hand-holding totally open world experience and you want to feel like you're in space, then this game is for you.  If you enjoy literally anything else, then this game is not for you.","April 12","true","312.2"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Major disappointment.\n\nAs an owner of E:D, I was really disappointed when I learned that they are charging new customers the same price for both E:D and Horizons as they were charging us, old customers, for Horizons. I decided that I won't pay the money for Horizons because I didn't think planetary landing was something incredibly special that would justify the price. As it turned out, I was right to do so. Planetary landing offers nothing special for me, to me it's just another setting for a base.\n\nGiven the controversy that the expansion created upon launch, we had Frontier telling us that the original game will continue to be developed alongside Horizons and many people, like me, accepted this as a compromise. As long as we play in the same universe with people playing Horizons and as long as we're not at a disadvantage against Horizons players, everything's OK in my book. That's not the case with 1.6 and 2.1 anymore. Frontier, being the greedy bunch they are, decided that they will give an edge to Horizons players by making "the engineers" unavailable for people that don't own the expansion. This means that if you don't own Horizons, you'll always be at a disadvantage against a player that owns Horizons. A very cheap and dirty move by Frontier. Well guess what, Frontier, we're not blind.\n\nI'm sure I speak for a bunch of people when I say this - I won't be buying Horizons because it's not worth the price. It's a mechanic that should've been part of the base game. I'm sure there are many, many more people like me that play the original Elite without the expansion and Frontier decided to "extort" us for our money with this "engineers" fiasco. Well, you ain't getting my money, that's for sure :)\n\nNow that this is out of the way, let's talk a bit about the mission overhaul. When you hear the word "overhaul" you'd think they did some major work and some major changes on the mission system. That's totally not the case. You have absolutely the same missions (with a dynamically added waypoint here and there, which is more of a nuisance than anything) with the only real change being the way better paying jobs are unlocked and, oh, pictures of the fraction leaders giving you the missions... Now, 1 out of 4 missions with this dynamically added waypoint that I was talking about just can't be finished. When you arrive at your end destination, you're not given the option to end the mission. This results in a fine and reputation loss. The bug is known since beta but they couldn't fix it and it went live.\n\nThe new AI is pretty brutal, which is not a bad thing but then it hits you, they are using "engineer" upgrades, upgrades that you won't be able to get if you don't own Horizons. So you're not only at a disadvantage against human players, you're at a disadvantage against the AI. It's not a big deal for people that fly e.g. Cobras but I can imagine how frustrating it must be for someone piloting a heavy cargo ship.\n\nI know the fanboys will be all over this review but I'm giving you my honest opinion. Elite could've been a great game but it really lacked and continues to lack substance. They will probably add the ability to walk around your ship, stations and planets and will charge more money for that alone. But ask yourselves, what's the point in walking around if there's nothing that you can actually do?","May 30","false","100.7"," 43 of 73 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","43","73","0","0"

"SEASON PASS".\n\nHorizons being a standalone thing, calling it a season pass would be me going easy on it (which I wont).\nLeaves me no other choice but to ignore it writing a review for this game.\n\nSimply put, not worth a buy.\n\nGet Horizons instead, why I hear you ask?\n\nWell its standalone, is has everything the original has plus... (it hurts to say this) - It has more...\n\nWhile its still a hollow, bland empty game which enables you to land... Yeah.\nIts still a tad more than the original.\n\n-Now if you bought the original like me, and played it like me, and bought a skin for your beloved ship like me.\nAnd you were excited for Horizons, like me.\n\nYou got ♥♥♥♥ on, here's to you developers.\n\nBuying Elite, 50,- Euros\nHorizons, 53,99 Euros - Wha-wha-what?\n\nWorry not, I get a discount allowing me to buy their "SEASON PASS" for 40,49 Euros.

If its on sale.\nOr if they fullfill the Horizons season pass lists of things theyre putting in yes it will be for this price.\n\nI still dont recommend it, the fact that it still needs a lot of work.\nAnd I might forgive but I dont forget, the stunt they pulled off cant be wiped away like this.\n\nOh wait...\n\nYou did not just discounted Horizon after a month from its official full price release...

I've seen varying responses as to what the game lacks and what the game consists. Furthermore let me start off by saying that this game is still early in development and a successor to the Original Elite. The game does not contain a campaign, and optional campaign, or any of the such, instead it relies of interactions with the universe around you as a whole. You are only a mere cog in the gears that is the milky way galaxy. What lies ahead? Well certainly anything, which is exactly the point that Frontier Developments wants to make.\n\nYes you are paying full price for a video game and after that an upfront cost of seasons. However the case is that we are paying for future development of an ongoing game. Frontier Development has taken this game across leaps and bounds since the kickstarter phase in 2012. The game itself is 1:1 scale of the Milky Way galaxy, and utilizes a Faster-Than-Light drive or the FSD. Which is an Alcubierre Drive[www.andersoninstitute.com]. This works in coordination with the ships, which are essentially giant quantam computers..... Yes, they calculate coordinates in realtime. The FSD works in two modes, Supercruise, which is a form of interstellar travel, and Hyperspeed, which gets you to the point of largest mass in the next system. The Flight Model also works in conjunction with this, and has two modes outside FSD. Atmospheric-Simulated and Newtonian-Assisted flight models come with every ship. Essentially its Flight Assist on, and Flight Assist off. The reason why i say this is that, Flight Assist on, you are basically flying through a simulated atmosphere of space, capable of still moving in multiple directions, and azmuiths still however. Flight Assist off you are full newtonian, with a little bit of assist, there is still some slight yaw resistance and a speed limit, these are for safety reasons, as newtons third law would surely disagree.\n\n\nThe game engine is the Cobra engine, which was an inhouse engine that Frontier plans on using in their second game. The game uses StellarForge[www.space.com] and you can just stare off at the depth and beauty of the universe, watching as planets, stars, even blackholes orbit around you. Fight through cloudy thick asteroid fields[www.polygonpi.com] with 7.1 surround sound blowing you away as a Federal Corvette boosts over you. Visualise\nnebula and other entities like never before. Land on various planets as they become available in time. Influence political powers as humanity slowly turns a cold war into a hot war. Watch as various anomalies and unknown artifacts get discovered. Listen to rumors of Thargoids........ Maybe who knows you might just find a barnacle or two while doing donuts in your SRV.\n\n\nAll in all, in my opinion this game is very much worth the price tag, as we are all but sure there is more to come. Frontier Developments does post weekly newsletters, updates, and the like. They are a public company and do post public monthly finance reports. Therefore its just a well structured game with a good company at its head with a bright future. So yes, I do recommend it.\n\n8.5/10","April 16, 2015","true","170.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

Why am I required to look up tutorials of the game because the in-game tutorials aren't sufficient for newcomers? Nonetheless, I really want to be good at this game.\n\nI haven't gotten into online yet, as I still have trouble navigating and locating a mission/contract way-point. I've gotten the hang of combat, but I still have much to learn.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful and smooth, even on my garbage laptop.\n+ Audio and soundtrack is extraordinary.\n+ Has a solo mode so beginners can get the hang of the controls, navigation, and screw around.\n+ People have said exploration would only be fun if you're familiar with astronomy. I can't speak for everyone, but I enjoyed cruising around different galaxies and systems despite my lack of knowledge of astronomy.\n+ Once you've mastered combat, it gets really fun.\n\nCons:\n- As others have said, in-game tutorials.\n- Navigation is confusing sometimes, such as looking for a place to dock.\n- Customization is okay, however I haven't reached the point to purchase good parts.\n- Beginners will have trouble adjusting to a genre they've never played before, although I don't see it being easy to learn since there are many elements in the game which make it magnificent.\n\nHopefully, by the time I've had 5 hours of gameplay I will be able to answer most of my questions about the system, functions, and navigation of the game. For now, if you're like me and have never or rarely played space games, then expect spending some time learning the ropes. Otherwise, if you really want a simple space game, go play mass effect.","April 4, 2015","true","15.3"," 44 of 75 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","44","75","2","0"

I'd say over half of my hours played were speant in super cruise.... just travelling. Sometimes when I would "hyper space jump" to a galaxy or star, I would then have to super cruise (auto pilot) OVER 15 MINUTES before I even reached a station or whatever point of interest I was headed too. Now, some of you might actually enjoy auto-piloting for 15+ minutes at a time, but I for one DO NOT and that is why I do not recommend this game. The missions (random generated missions like kill x, haul x, find x) take anywhere from 15-45 minutes to complete and usually pay out 10k to 150k credits. Trading stock via best market prices can generate over 5 MILLION credits per hour. Take a wild guess and figure out which method makes more credits.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nSo here I am trading, in super cruise, and at full throttle it will take me 12 minutes to get to the space station I want to go to. Awesome. I leave throttle on max... go make a sandwhich... get a drink... bring items to desk... see I still have 8 minutes left of super cruise... go take a dump... wash my hands.... come back to desk and finish up the last 2 minutes of super cruise.\n\nIf you like to muli-task while you "game" then look no further you need to buy this game right now.\nObviously the supercruise route I was taking was on the high end of distance... but rest assured, you will more likely be stuck with a route that takes 4-10 minutes instead of 15+.\n\n\nThis game is advertised as an action packed MMO with secrets and treasure just waiting to be uncovered.\nWhat it ACTUALLY is, is a space flight simulator. Think..... microsoft flight simulator..... but in space.\nDon't get me wrong, the flight simulator portion of this game is done VERY well. As a space flight sim, it is extremely immersive and accurate (aside from the nerfed space physics).\n\nWhile this game does have endless random available missions, and random combat wars that you can participate in... Trust me on this when I say that the majority of your time playing this game will be speant traveling. In super cruise.\n\nIf you EVER want the hope of purchasing all the top grade ships, forget about the random missions and combat because they simply don't pay enough. The only way you're going to get the top grade ships in this lifetime, is by trading back and forth between space stations. In super cruise.\n\nIf you want to explore the vast emptiness of space... you will be doing so hardcore AFK. In super cruise.\n\n\nI'm keeping this game because it's the only flight sim I have, and will probably be the last flight sim I ever purchase.","October 20, 2015","false","41.8"," 59 of 103 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","59","103","3","0"

This game is very physics based and because of that navigation can be tedious, if you have patience with that then you're golden.\n\nAfter you've figured out how to not zoom by stuff when going at light speed you also have to figure out docking and tailing a target.\n\nIf you were going to make a real life based space simulation where light speed is like horse and carriages then this would be it.\n\nAfter that complexity then we get to the complexity of understanding your ships gear. Just basing it on the arrows isn't enough as some stuff costs more but are crappier than the cheaper stuff.  So in the end you will end up on youtube looking at what weapons do before buying one.\n\nCombat is normal flight sim stuff the UI makes it pretty simple to know where your target is, you can also target specific subsystems which is nice.","April 4, 2015","true","158.3"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","30","49","0","0"

I played this game before it was on Steam and it totals in approximately 950 hours at the time of writing.\n\nDo not expect this game to guide you. There are no tutorials that explain the gameplay mechanics, watch tutorials on YouTube or ask people to help you.\n\nIn Elite, Cash = Progress, so go get that money! How? Be a peaceful trader, feel the tension of smuggling, kill criminals for their bounties, explore the vast space, pirate other people - It's up to you, all those are pretty balanced and give money scaling with risk.\n\nI play this game since 31/12/14 and I've surely sunk some time in it. If you are looking for a space game in which you can feel really immersed, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a bug free game, this might not be for you.\n\nThe game has instancing issues (It uses P2P for player interaction), NPC AI is pretty bugged at the time of writing (2.0.08/1.5.08), there is a bug in the mission generation system that can be abused to get tons of cash in a short time, and a few more. Those are not really gamebreaking but many of them will be fixed in 2.1/1.6 that releases in June. It overhauls the mission system, NPC AI and a few other things. The instancing issues can be overcome by relogging most of the time so it is not really gamebreaking.\n\nIt also has compatibility for Gamepads, Flight sticks, TrackIR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, this game is basically must have for VR, it is made for it.\n\nTL;DR: Good space game but expect bugs and a lot of learning.","April 9","true","604.3"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","0"

No boundaries.\nYou could go out bounty hunting, you could go courier style, mine asteroids, trade various goods or explore the vast, seriously freaking huge space and sell the exploration data.\nI will admit, that a story mode or story missions would be a great addition to the game. Like one major quest and maybe some bigger sidequest revolving around the three main factions in the game, a bit like the guilds in Oblivion and Skyrim.\nBut it's still in its baby shoes and they'll add that, but even now the game is entertaining as hell.\n\nThe controls are, I admit, a bit hard to grasp at first and there's a lot of them and you might need some time to set them up properly so it fits whatever you use. I use a keyboard and a joystick and it works great, but also tried an Xbox controller, which also worked good. People said that even mouse and keyboard only work fine.\nThis is a space sim, where you control all the functions of a damned spaceship and not a bobby car.\nThis is not, install, start up and jump into the action game.\nIt needs some time and its complex, but once you worked out the majority of the stuff you'll understand.\n\nThe graphics are, well, gorgeous.\nIt looks highly polished and smooth. No graphic glitches or similiar.\nThe The effects are amazing and the HUD design (or really, the cockpit of the vessel you control) is nicely done.\nThe first time I jumped into hyperspace to travel to a new system...I just sat there in awe and all I could say was "wow".\nIt's really well done.\nThe stars are well animated and are nice to look at. There's currently only a handfull of different space station designs...so it's not all that diversified in that regard.\nThe ship designs are...well. The following is only my own opinion, in question, just look up the different ships online and judge yourself.\nSome of the ships look really really cool. But those are mostly the end game ships. The early ones are derived from the original Elite games...from the 80ies. Some ships just look like geometrical shapes with cockpits smacked on them. Cobra, Sidewinder, namely. They have appeal, and I understand the nostalgia factor for some of the players, but that's not the majority.\nBut I hope they'll add some more nice early to mid game ships in the future.\n\n\nThe gameplay itself is smooth and as polished as the graphics. Very well made.\nThe combat is awesome and challenging.\nTrading, courier stuff and mining is for me personally too boring and has too less PEW PEW LAZORS, but some will surely like that.\n\nYou can play the game in a MMO enviroment with other players, alone (but you need to be online) or in a solo world, but with a friend(s).\nThe MMO version is barely any different from the solo one and players are friendly and don't just KOS everything that moves. But docking at some stations is annoying, since there's lots of players who want to dock at the same time.\nBut then switching to solo quickly is easy and happens smooth.\n\nThe soundtrack is also well made and not too obnoxious. But it should be noted, that this game is very well suited to let your own music play while gaming.\n\n\nAs a side note, my internet at home died two days after playing, because our provider had issues, so I played solo only and used USB tethering with my phone and it's data plan.\nIt worked very well and used up after 10h playing only 22MB.\n\n\n\nIf you like games like Skyrim and Oblivion and you like Space and ♥♥♥♥ and don't mind a somewhat lacking story mode alltogether, then you won't regret buying this.\n\n\nMy rating:\n\n2001/10, "An Der Schönen Blauen Donau" plays while docking ;)","April 19, 2015","true","67.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","23","36","0","0"

Graphics, sounds and all the fiddy-bits that people either love or hate just make it imersive (at least to us who have never been in space). I'm not afraid to claim they nailed it, toss in a VR headset and triple WOW.\nNow, yes space is a big place but sadly playing the game feels so empty. They need to figure out a way to personalize an engagement mechanism for the players, other then some community driven event that seems to happen somewhere on the other side of the universe.  Myself I kept on playing cause I didn't put myself myself in the grind to buy the most expensive ship. I've did a bit of roll playing as a miner, bounty hunter, trader or pirate but those are short lived lives which did pay for my ships. P.S still can switch between those jobs with my ships to suit my mood.\n\nNow what I dont like is their roll out plan, (canada right now is) $40  for  Elite Dangerous , + $40 for  Hozions , + unknown more money for who knows how many more  passes/DLC  are in the pipe? My guess is as many as it's profitable, I feel like it's the Half-life 2 episodes all over again. At least none of the 3 were at full "triple A" price (which I think anyone can google to find out how that concept/back story went).\nSo there lays my problem, I feel  Elite: dangerous  is a unfinshed product which I can't recommend paying full AAA price for.  How much will we have to pay to play the game fixed? I dont know but I'm not dropping another dollar. Sadly every update that is not included for the vanila  Elite: dangerous  just makes me not want to play it. So everyone better to be prepaired to pay more then $40 to experiance the game in all its glory.\nNote: others also have paid $40+ to experiance the game and when it's sold for less Fronter will find they will have a worse PR rep.\n\nI don't know what is the correct solution as it's being treated as a"game in development" no mater what is typed or said  and wages need to be paid while they procced, but I'm worried how the new seasion/DLC breaks the vanila   Elite:dangerous  as they progress. As Im sure they found out many are not willing to pay $80 as the game stands, with maybe the next season costing say in total $120 for someone to play a game still in development.

There so much length and width to the universe it's pretty amazing - however, they forgot depth. There isn't really alot of content. Basically, it's a huge, empty universe with the same assets re-used over and over. Wings exist, but they can only be four players deep - dash your hopes of starting a huge inter-stellar guild or company. You can't trade items or money to other players. For a multi-player game, Frontier seems to have gone to great lengths to make it feel almost entirely singleplayer.\n\nBut, there are some good points to the game - It's a huge universe. You could lose yourself in it; I have once or twice. The assets, like I said, get re-used over and over, but they are very pretty so it doesn't get old for awhile. Combat is repetitive but still satisfying, it's not a 'true' space sim in that they use gun sound effects (whereas in true space, the sounds of explosions or gunfire would be soundless. I am a space nerd.) and the physics are made deliberately nerfed to increase difficulty (yawing, for instance.)\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend the game to any but fans of space games. There is a decent trading and combat system in place, and alot of potential for explorer-types.","December 31, 2015","false","148.0"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

That's right, it is a 1:1 scale of the Milky Way with 400 billion star systems, and i've maybe seen 200 in the hours i've played (kep in mind that the last dozen or so hours i was bounty hunting and then i was involved in a war that i believe i caused) but nonetheless its huge. Yes, trading will net you hundreds of thousands or more, but that really depends on your ship which is what a lot of Youtube videos leave out -  the initial cost of your ship and subsequent outfitting. Getting the smallest trade vessel, the Hauler, will only allow a maximum of around 20 or so cargo spaces if you want a decent Frame Shift Drive that will allow you to travel farther distances so that you're not just jumping across stars for 45 minutes. Travelling around 160 light years from your initial system will allow you to net the most cash for your goods (recommend rare commodities at this point). 160 light years is a long, long time if you are just flying. Refuelling also costs time or money, and certain modules on your ship can cause the ship to overheat very quickly (bigger guns, more guns, lasers over projectile weapons) all have a certain power draw effect, although you can play around with the modules to turn some off completely.\nThere is a bit of a learning curve to the game, but it can be played quite well with mouse and keyboard with a bit of rebinding for us budget-constrained gamers who dropped full price for this game. Bounty hunting has to be by far my most favourite, with Nav Beacons or Resource Extraction Sites being prime locations for many bounties. Now you might destroy a sidewinder and be like "Oh great, that was like 3000 credits WTF can i do with that" but nay, hold your horses. For the time that it took you to destroy that one sidewinder, there will be more ships to come that are subsequentally wanted, and will net you more money (also helps to have Federal Security or some other to help out with bigger targets which = more bounty) thus reducing the overall time it takes to make a big buck. I went from mostly harmless to Competent in a matter of hours, and trust me, that would take a while if i had not been as successful. finding the right targets to take down (with the use of a Kill Warrant Scanner if available and time permits as it takes a while to use) will allow you to spend most of your time taking down the best targets price per kill wise. Then all thats left is upgrade your ship, get a new ship, sell that ship once you test fly it and notice it flies like a boat (cobra) ;) ,  or switch it up and go trading or exploring! A little nifty feature that i like but is probably not recommended outside of civilized space is that once you are buying a new ship, you have the option of selling your ship, or storing it! Then if you decide, oh i want to trade/explore now, you can head over to the space station where your ship is stored and swap out saving the repurchase of a brand new ship.\n\nAll in all this game is huge, but i have yet to play in the new "Wings" feature or with anybody really which seems like a blast i guess people dont like my area of space... or me </3\n\nCMDR SleekRogueMedic signing off, enjoy the rest of space Commanders!","April 25, 2015","true","207.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Its really a shame that the game is not better than it is. I has all the core things needed to be one of the best space flight sims ever but it falls short on so many levels but ill do my best to give a fair review.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The game looks really good, though im not sure how it would look on a system that is just making the min req. My rig is pretty high end.\n\n2. The combat it self is pretty good and is very fun ( for a while ) the controls are easy to get used to but not so dumbed down that it takes away from the game. ( the way the ships in EA Starwars Battlefront are a total joke to pilot )\n\n3. A few options on how you want to advance in game that are different from each other ( more on this in the bad section )\n\n4. The size and scope of the game is pretty nifty ( more on this in the bad section )\n\n5. The weapons are fun to use\n\n6. ummmm the game looks good .....\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. Once you have done something one time you have pretty much experenced the most fun that thing will ever be ( example: going out to explore was almost fun, It took a lot of grinding to buy and equip a ship that would be able to do the job well but once I left charted space and flew around a few systems scanning thigns I wanted to smash my face on my desk because it was so boring )\n\n2. what ever you end up doing its going to be a grind to get anything cool, and TBH the best ways to make money are offten the least fun, hauling cargo pays well once you have ship that can hold a huge load of goods but its zero challange  ( as a example )\n\n3. The mission system is garbage, offten times you fly places and nothing happens or they lack the info needed to find objs and you end up just flying off to do something else. The pay outs are also so crappy you will never earn any cool ships/gear doing them before you lose intrest in the game\n\n4.Huge lack of varried fights, with only a hand full of weapon systems to pick from a lot of the combat ships feel the same to both fight and pilot. So while at its core the combat was done pretty well once you have killed 60 ships or so, or taken part in a NPC fleet battle mission you have pretty much seen what combat has to offer.\n\n5. zero depth, some of this I have already said but just to not end up pointing out every flaw it just boils down to "zero depth" nothing is fleshed out at all the game feels stale like they just gave up and said "well we have all the basics and it looks really good so lets pack up shop and call it a day"\n\n6. Broken promises from the company, So many big claims as the game was in the works and starting to come out only to change things up and go for the cash grab with all this paid DLC crap when the base game still needs so much work. when Horizons was revealed and they were asking for 120$ USD for the season pass I sent the company a email asking what the hell was going on. In the reply the guy told me it was " A surprise to them as well " Then they end up offering the entire DLC with base game for less than the price I got the base game for in the frist place. It just rubs me the wrong way how flip floppy the company has been on the way this game is suported and marketed. Its left me with zero faith in anything they have to say.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSave your money, wait for reviews of Nomans Sky or for Star Citz to come out, this game is 5/10 at best and the compnay that is making it is a 2/10 IMHO\n\nHope this helps happy trails\n","February 13","false","227.7"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

While it has a lot of promise, it also suffers from one of the harsh realities of space - it's big, mostly empty, and it takes forever to get anywhere. Elite sticks a bit too closely to its venerable lineage by being a bit too shallow in an age where we all want depth. Firstly, while Elite can be a very pretty game, it's also awfully sparse and boring for a lot of the time. Exploration yields some very pretty vistas, but after you've seen a few of them it all looks the same. There's really nothing to do except look at things. The trading mechanics are shallow. Many systems look the same. There's no character in the game world to speak of. There's some backstory floating around and supposedly driving the universe but it doesn't matter a single bit to most players. Combat is pretty boring even with the Newtonian mechanics.\n\nIf I could sum up my problems with this game, it boils down to this - it isn't much fun, and I play games to have fun. The exploration aspect is pretty awesome but even that will wear thin, and most of that will be spent jumping between systems that aren't memorable and aren't interesting. You can acquire a load of credits but it doesn't matter, there's no real purpose. This is a big sandbox but the sand is only half an inch deep.\n\nElite: Dangerous has a lot of potential - it has a vast universe, the new DLC adds planetary landings, the universe has the elements to be quite dynamic, and they could do quite a few things if they wanted to. But it's too big, too empty, and too shallow for me to recommend, and I doubt the developers will ever achieve the potential here. The universe is too sterile and they don't seem interested in injecting any life into it. Freelancer suffers from shallow gameplay but was enjoyable because it had a lot of character and didn't adhere too closely to "space is big". Elite does, and it's all the more boring for it.

I would actually say this game isn't for the most people. It involves a lot of imagination, damn you will have to imagine everything, almost. But let me start with the good things because there are some but also few of them.\n\nThere is a HUGE universe to discover, the map is insanely large. This can be good but also bad. So we've decided to talk about the good things first. I don't think you'll ever see the whole map, that's how big it is. Graphically speaking it's good. Not the best but it's at that level that it doesn't bother you or brake the immersion. Sound is also good, with some problems here and there depending on your configuration. Well that's all I could find good about this game.\n\nNow let me tell you why I don't recommend this game. IT'S BORING! I know, most of you stopped here, but if you are still reading let me tell you why. All you can do in this game is: be a trader, explorer, miner, mercenary, smuggler, pirate. All that sounds good at first but once you understand what every of those “jobs” mean you'll move on to another game.\n\nBeing a trader involves getting cargo from one place to another. That's it. You will have to remember where that good seels at a higher price and where you can buy it a lower price, there is no in game feature to tell you or remember where you found best prices. Then you take the cargo from a space station that looks like the other one you've been on, there are like 2-4 models, and you pilot your ship through space. You might encounter someone that tries to stop you and kill you and so on. A little pew pew, you kill them and move on.\n\nBeing an explorer. Well you must think with that huge map this must be the most fun of them. Well it's not, it's the most boring one of them. Why? Because all systems are alike, you've seen that type of sun, that type of planet before and you'll see them everywhere you go. You enter in a solar system, press one button to scan and that's it. You've discovered, mayb,e a few planets!!! WOW! Now repeate.\n\nBeing a miner, you get your mining laser and try to find some asteriods to mine them. You get the resource and then try to sell it.\n\nI won't even bother to explain the rest cause I think you got the idea. There is no story, you have to make your own, most people would say that's the fun part. But in reality it's not, because you don't have the tools to do so. I could've imagined the same thing without the game and I'd have the same amount of fun. It's a sandbox without the sand. If you ask me I would've prefered a map with 20-40 solar systems but with more than having millions of solar systems that look alike and nothing to do.\n\nMost ships look like boxes, nothing interesting to see there. Check Cobra MKIII as an example. Although I understand why they used this kind of desing, they wanted to keep the feeling of the old game and I must say this wouldn't bother me if the game would be fun to play. In the end you rarely see your ship from outside. The interior is almost the same on every ship and GUI is actually the same on all of them. Sound will crackle from time to time, depending on your configuration.\n\nI've seen there is an expansion, almost more expensive than the actual game, that allows you to land on planets. That sounds cool until you realize that every planet is empty, just dust, nothing to see there. I don't understand what the developer is thinking. How is this fun? Ok maybe the first time it's fun to land on a planet, but if you do this 10 times, than it's becoming boring because it's the same story. I'm already bored of repeating my self, but this is the game.\n\nIf you really like space games, for 10euros it's a good price, you'll spend a few hours having fun and then you'll forget it even exist, but it's worth for that amount I would say. I don't recommend buying the expansions because there will be more of them and in the end you'll realize you've spend over 1000 euros on a game. Maybe not that much, but I don't think it's too far since they presented what they want the game to be and what they actually released in this expansion. I mean it's way too far from what they are wishing for this game, it will need another 10 expansion packs like this one. Remains to be seen.\n\nI sincerly wish to like this game, I really want to play it but there is nothing fun to do in it right now that I haven't done before. I love how they gone into detail with ship systems, but I don't see the same attention to details in the actual universe. Right now it feels like an early alpha. Maybe that's how I should take it, but at the same time when I see that expansion and for that price... it's a shame.\n\nWhat I can say to developer is thank you for trying at least, dunno if this is what they intended the game to be but there is still time to fix it, although it's hard to change a first impression, but not impossible. There hasn't been a space game for a long time and we needed it. At other developers that are looking to make a game like this would learn from their mistakes.","February 17","false","20.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","6"

Its really a shame that the game is not better than it is. I has all the core things needed to be one of the best space flight sims ever but it falls short on so many levels but ill do my best to give a fair review.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The game looks really good, though im not sure how it would look on a system that is just making the min req. My rig is pretty high end.\n\n2. The combat it self is pretty good and is very fun ( for a while ) the controls are easy to get used to but not so dumbed down that it takes away from the game. ( the way the ships in EA Starwars Battlefront are a total joke to pilot )\n\n3. A few options on how you want to advance in game that are different from each other ( more on this in the bad section )\n\n4. The size and scope of the game is pretty nifty ( more on this in the bad section )\n\n5. The weapons are fun to use\n\n6. ummmm the game looks good .....\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. Once you have done something one time you have pretty much experenced the most fun that thing will ever be ( example: going out to explore was almost fun, It took a lot of grinding to buy and equip a ship that would be able to do the job well but once I left charted space and flew around a few systems scanning thigns I wanted to smash my face on my desk because it was so boring )\n\n2. what ever you end up doing its going to be a grind to get anything cool, and TBH the best ways to make money are offten the least fun, hauling cargo pays well once you have ship that can hold a huge load of goods but its zero challange  ( as a example )\n\n3. The mission system is garbage, offten times you fly places and nothing happens or they lack the info needed to find objs and you end up just flying off to do something else. The pay outs are also so crappy you will never earn any cool ships/gear doing them before you lose intrest in the game\n\n4.Huge lack of varried fights, with only a hand full of weapon systems to pick from a lot of the combat ships feel the same to both fight and pilot. So while at its core the combat was done pretty well once you have killed 60 ships or so, or taken part in a NPC fleet battle mission you have pretty much seen what combat has to offer.\n\n5. zero depth, some of this I have already said but just to not end up pointing out every flaw it just boils down to "zero depth" nothing is fleshed out at all the game feels stale like they just gave up and said "well we have all the basics and it looks really good so lets pack up shop and call it a day"\n\n6. Broken promises from the company, So many big claims as the game was in the works and starting to come out only to change things up and go for the cash grab with all this paid DLC crap when the base game still needs so much work. when Horizons was revealed and they were asking for 120$ USD for the season pass I sent the company a email asking what the hell was going on. In the reply the guy told me it was " A surprise to them as well " Then they end up offering the entire DLC with base game for less than the price I got the base game for in the frist place. It just rubs me the wrong way how flip floppy the company has been on the way this game is suported and marketed. Its left me with zero faith in anything they have to say.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSave your money, wait for reviews of Nomans Sky or for Star Citz to come out, this game is 5/10 at best and the compnay that is making it is a 2/10 IMHO\n\nHope this helps happy trails\n","February 13","false","227.7"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

But if you think the hours i have spent into learning all the tricks and curves there are in turn based strategy, well f*ck it, i'm gonna try it for this game.\n\nEverybody has played the original Elite (1984), and if there are people who have not, i recomend they read about it before even thinking if they should buy Dangerous or not. People talk about classics like, diablo, tomb raider and various other 90's titles that made people jump up and down like monkeys. I laugh at those titles, i sh*t in their mouths, the sheer simplicity and low thinking scope that made franchises worth millions, with corrupted developers making fun of their customers, offering supposedly GRADE A material that usualy comes out broken and is bearable after heavy patching, and maybe a year or two of waiting. A little i have read about this release, tells me that it was made with a very low budget, compared with other releases, and that on official release game (meaning not beta) it had minimal to no bugs and glitches, now this ranges from RARE to NONEXISTENT in our gaming age, since every game comes out with it's own quirks and forums of frustrated users begging for a fix, much like junkies beg for a fix :)\n\nBeyond that, the first battle i had in the tutorial in which i had to destroy a similar vessel with my own with just a pair of silly lasers that would not seem to help me on aiming, turned into a 15 minute epic struggle through an asteroid field.  That of course happened after 2-3 hours i spent tweaking my controls. I have read people's reviews about how difficult the controls are, even with a xbox controller and i tell you, it's all turds and lies. People love to complain. Besides the first elite, as i said, i have never touched another simulation game. That is not entirely true, since i own evochron mercenary and all the X3 serrier. i played about 14 mins each game, and then i abbandoned them because of the effort it needed to learn those games. But not with this one, i will give it all, even if i am SH*T with this kind of games, i can figure out how to support my team leader in multiplayer open world, so maybe i am not an ace in combat but i can surely help in a bad situation. If i can do it, everybody can, don't be afraid of this game, once you tweak your controls and you figure what everything does, it will start to become natural and player-friendly.  Also this is the first time i am going to spend good money on a joystick/throttle combination, and this happens not because i don't like how the controller works, but because i want to feel it, be in it, role-pay it, hell, if i have money on my hands i will gladly get a vr system for this baby, and usualy i am AGAINST vr.\n\nNow we move to the most essential part of this "review".  I will not go behind numbers of ships (stop crying, more will come), how cool the lasers look, how amazing the explosions sound, how immersive it feels when you free look in your cockpit while cruising,  how you can loose track of time because you decided to travel to a nebula because why the ♥♥♥♥ not, no, this will not be a technical review (the game doesn't need one, it feels and looks amazing), this will be a spiritual one.  This Game needs YOU, and it needs you to develop. As i said, the devs already released a full, playable, oppend sand universe with a bit of lore, so the users will go in and create it. Think of it something live EVE on it's begginings i guess. In order for this game to become BIGGER, and have all the features we want and need, it needs people to make it so. Now understand this, you get dedicated servers, open world universe that has some billion starsystems for you to explore and play with anyone, and they don't ask for a monthly fee, the only thing you can buy ingame with money is paint-jobs for vessels, so there no pay to win, to be elite in this one you have to actually be elite :)\n\nSo after several hours of doing and redoing training missions (i actually wanted to perfect my flying, jumping, landing, launching, supercruising before i went online), i got 20 hrs in the open world. It is amazing, always something for you to do, someone to get away from, something to deliver, systems to explore, asteroid field to mine, cargo to steal, get angry because you have a delivery to make and the station has only 3 landing pads. EPIC. EPIC in every scale, i still suck at combat, although one of my last encounters was quite interesting. This dude drags me out of supercruise while i was going to a starving station to provide them with coffee and tea for a considerable ammount,  he was faster and better equiped than me, so all i could do is to put maximum speed in reverse while i wqs facing him and shooting my pityful lasers on his face, when i got down to 40% health i said ♥♥♥♥ it, remove flight assist, full throttle, engine boost and i rammed his ♥♥♥, it felt really strange that he panicked and run away, thus creating a small window for me to get into supercruising and run for the station to repair, and get paid for a job well done.\n\nAfter 100+ hrs i have to say these things.  Elite:Dangerous is the greatest game i have ever played. Reasoning is simple,  after 28 straight years of spectrum/amiga/consoles/pc good chances are that nothing will have more freedom than that. People moan about no content. ARE YOU EVEN PLAYING? People moan about no quests. Needless to say faction quests are limitless, sorry for not puting the tavern keeper sending you to kill rats in the cellar eh? next time we'll tell frontier to throw a couple of spaceorks and nazis inside to make you feel better. 400 billion stars. The possibilities are trully endless, learn to create and adjust the game to your needs. The lore is there if you bother to read what's happening, besides, people should help create the lore. the universe is there. go at a system with a couple of friends and become influential, help in wars,end piracy, be a drug lord, be an explorer, be a miner, be a bounty hunter, trade, steal, stalk, cruise, buy a bigger ship, customize it, throw in a paint, go in much bigger fights ect ect. Oh and for those who are compairing it with other games like star citizen, NO COMPARISON HERE GUYS. s.c. is single player with co-op multiplayer possibility, much smaller universe, pay real money for ships, while the other is open world mmo should you choose it, with the biggest universe ever in a game so far. NO MONTHLY FEE. This game is trully a gift to gamers, should they realise the potential.\n\nThis is for people who actually want to play the game and think it is too vague and without content. Find a group like i did. Completely changes the game. I began to understand the true scope of the game. Everything you do matters. Where you do it, who you help, who you sell to, where you buy from who you hunt, where you sell exploration data, even where you cash in your rewards has subtleries and changes the politics of the game. I mean wow. The group i found are called Elite Diplomatic Group and they are awesomely organized. If anyone is interested info is here: http://elitediplomats.com/  they also use closed groups which is cool for people who don't want to participate on open play. Although let me tell you open play is where the game shines, i am in a player busy system away from the starting one and i can't tell you of the epic misadventures i am having.\n\n\n09/10 -Only reason does not get a 10 is because i want to stress that game certainly needs much more developing to further expand it to heights unimaginable. not that it is lacking in something,","April 3, 2015","true","964.1"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","26","42","0","4"

I've spent the last week doing little else but play Elite Dangerous. As a programmer I enjoy the discovery of a complicated, well-designed piece of software. This software is a contender in the big-universe genre of games such as Eve Online and Star Citizen.\nEvery piece of software has to start somewhere. This is always the "first thing" it does before it does anything else. Call it the seed of the program. In Eve, it's relationships; the game is inherently social. In Star Citizen it is the immersive avatar that can walk around and climb into ships that can travel from planent to planet like a genuine space marine. The seed of Elite Dangerous is a space combat simulator. It is from this simulator that they are creating a game.\nOnce i overcame the steep learning curve of operating a space ship in a realistic flight simulator, I eventually managed to complete some missions without exploding for the usual reasons: pressing the boost button inside a hanger with no shields, running out of fuel on the way to wherever, shooting the wrong space ship with my guns, flying in space without guns, etc. If you have ever played this game then I'm certian you can certianly relate to these troubles. For a time I was confused by the flight mode transitions; I didn't realize there were just more buttons to learn.\nEach step on the learning curve opens new dimensions of gameplay; each bit of information on the screen has meaning and there is skill to develop to absorb that much data. From the maps of the galaxy and star systems to the tables of commoditites for trade to every last panel on a ship's dashboard. Mastering the controls with the Flight Assist enabled has been it's own challenge. It is core to the seed of this game. I think i have played enough to grasp the physics of managing power, heat and momentum, and munitions in a space dogfight. I have learned which panels mean what and which ones i should look at when. I feel like a goram fighter pilot! Then I see videos of smugglers loading contraband under the noses of system police in Silent Running mode, then watch them land with their illicit booty without any flight assist. Suddently I feel like I've barely started to play the game.\nThe game that Frontier has built around the seed of a space combat simulator is an RPG. There are a miriade of ships available and the roster is growing all the time. The prices of the various ships go up as their capabilities increase. The cost of the weapons and various modules in the loadout can increase your ships value emmensly, and the configuration of your modules with can change the dynamics of ship dramatically. The barrier to the best ships is money. The game is earning money to upgrade to more effective ships. There are a lot of ways to do this and it make take some figuring out. The game is well designed to prevent making more than a certian number of credits. I think these decisions fit seemlessly into the gameplay and actually help create a more dynamic experience that evolves at a reasonable pace. Do more things to make more money to get better ships so you can do more things. The seed has grown into something very intricate and beautiful. I'm excited that it is still growning, too!\nPlaying this game requires that you experience a space flight simulator. It is captivating to shut down the engines and drift among the ice rings of a planet to watch the sun set behind it all. It is exciting when the target scan shows 'WANTED'. There can be some urgency about getting back to the air in a space station when your canopy is shot open and your life support clock is ticking down. It is vindicating when you land, alive, and cash in the bounty you earned on the guy who shot your canopy off.\nPlay this game and you will enjoy what I think is the best space combat simulator available, today.","April 8","true","418.1"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","26","42","0","1"

I started doing some basic missions, they weren't exciting, but I loved the controls; One of the few games where I can use my X52 properly.\n\nI gained enough money with the missions and bought and outfitted a small miner. After following a friend's recommendation I found a very rich mining location. No hostiles, lots of painite and other expensive ores.\n\nI got enough money to be a bit more flexible now! So I decided let's try something else that could bring me profit. I bought and outfitted an explorer ship. I went to distant unexplored stars, I explored for hours, I explored nebulas that were surprisingly boring once you got in them, I scanned suns, planets moons, asteroids (which later turned out to be completely useless), and after hours of doing nothing but looking at stars, planets, moons and after looking up some coordinates: blackholes, I was getting tired of doing that, so I returned to civilized territory to sell my scans. I received two hundred thousand. Disappointing, maybe I just wasn't meant to become an explorer then.\n\nI started realizing most ships are rather unappealing. (There are always doors between the engines which I don't get, you get a door under it, and often on the front landing gear too. Why a door on the back, that even has a welded railing on it?)\nI bought a Viper which looked somewhat decent. I figured I might become a mercenary. After experimenting with weapons I found an okay combo, and could destroy the enemy if they were alone. After killing several, my rank was still at "Harmless" which I found rather insulting. But I found a mission that pays well, let's try that one! Rescue someone who was taken by Some Pirates. I search the star system and found the guy they were talking about. I shoot down the shields, I take the prisoner out of the ship then I shoot it down, and take the hostage in. I go back to the mission station and find out that I still cannot finish the mission. You need "Hostage (mission specific)" to complete the mission. The guy I found had -the exact same name- as the guy in the mission details. He also carried a hostage. Why are they not accepting it?! Only one logical thing to do now, I sold the hostage to slavery and tried to do some missions. Some succeeded, but none of them gave me a reliable income.\n\nI tried trading too, but soon I realized that if you aren't trading with illegal goods, you aren't going to make a profit more than 5000 with the ships you can afford mid and early game.\n\n\nI want to compare the game with X3TC or Freelancer. Missions were more reliable, giving a reliable amount. You did not have to go to random stations to get the bounties. You could trade and make good profit from the -cheapest- resources!\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n-Elite Dangerous wants to offer much. Fighting, trading, smuggling, but the missions aren't exciting or rewarding. The only early method to profit easily is mining on a good spot, which is boring.\n-Space is less pretty then one would think after you get used to seeing the stars jump in your face.\n-Ship designs are one of the ugliest I have ever seen\n-Does not offer a lot of multiplayer options, even when I play with friends, it does not feel like it. It also doesn't feel like I'm playing with other real people, and every NPC you meet has a joke name, killing the immersion. You cannot even give money to your friends, only if you buy expensive items and drop them so they can sell it.\n\n+Has good controls with the joystick, good sounds, good UI.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but I can't. It 's not worth the money, not even when on discount. I haven't tried horizons, they say it makes it a lot better, but I don't think the core gameplay is supposed to be this empty.\n","January 28","false","61.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I had fun at first and the idea behind being able to play multiplayer/single player is great for avoiding griefers. Flight itself was fun, combat is fun except the AI isn't a challenge. I find AI is hard no matter what you try to do with it, it's either too good or not good enough so i can't fault the game for it to badly.\n\nWhat drove me away from the game was two parts:\n\nA-My friend from Australia could rarely get into group with me and wings only support 4 people. I have 8 regular playing friends. upwards of 20 depedning on what were all doing. PVP would be great but it would take us half an hour to get groups going and one guy never got in period no matter what we tried. Then if you all weren't dropping in at the same exact time then poof we would have to go through the process all over again.\n\nB-There isn't really enough substance. Grind out ships, undermine for merits to get a paycheck, trade for real money ...snore. Mining would be fun but doesn't pay enough, exploration would be awesome but again doesn't pay and supposedly you can only go so far away from Sol.\n\nC- have to add this one I know I said 2 parts but...influence of powerplay could be done in 1 player/private modes so you could literally pvpve without any way for anyone to get back at you so it turned into hauling wars basically...snore. Don't get me wrong I like being able to mine without asshats acting liek their gods for blowing up a vessel that has no guns but some of it shouldn't be in solo mode.\n\n\nI hope the planetary stuff brings more to do. I also hope they start to allow ship items to be stored or at least 1-3 alternate loadouts per ship. sucks to refit to do sometihng then not be able to find the items you once had to buy again because each station only has x type parts. Also allow for ship part trading also, you can buy and sell items but not ship parts?\n\nTo be fair community goals and the news aspect of the game is awesome, and flight is fun. If you are a solo player this game will work great for you.

Simply put the way the devs plan on selling this game is to sell a year worth of expansions and then re-release the game at full price with another year of expansions. Don't buy this game, even with a discount. I'ts only half the current game and 1/10th of what they plan to have in the game content-wise. If you really want to get this game either buy horizons (the newest version of the game at the time of me writing this) or go to Frontiers websight and cough up the $200+ to buy the lifetime expansion pass.\n\nUpdate: So as of 02/16/2016 it appears Frontier has gotten a grip on there head and has started to pull it out of their ♥♥♥. To my understanding they're re-releasing (again?) horizons as a DLC, as it should have been, and are now using Elite: Dangerous as the base game.

Sadly, the devs have caused me to never want to play again. Let me explain the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- A vast galaxy to explore. I estimated that in an exploration-fit ship, you'd be able to reach the other side of the galaxy in about 95 hours. That's not including the return trip, and that's assuming you don't stop to scan anything along the way.\n- A robust combat system. I'm not sure how you can really get more robust than flying around and shooting things with fixed or gimballed lasers or cannons or rails or plasma accelerators, or homing and dumb-fire missiles, launching chaff, etc.\n- Beautiful graphics. This game looks astonishingly good. You certainly won't forget your first black hole or neutron star.\n- Simplified flight model. It's not 100% realistic, but that makes for a more approachable flight model. The ships fly like jets in Battlefield, if a bit more responsive.\n\nNeutral:\n- Lots of frontloaded content. Your first 20-40 hours will be fantastic. Around 30 hours, you'll start to notice content slowing down. Around 40, things start looking familiar. At 50 hours, everything looked the same to me.\n- Ship customization. There isn't a lot of reason to try to come up with a clever build, since the time you waste min/maxing your build equates to about 2.3561 more seconds in combat or 8.65 seconds shaved off your trade route. It's fun to customize, but ultimately pretty pointless.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of depth. People will argue that if you got 50 hours of fun, you got your money's worth, but I find that to be a really dumb argument. This type of game is designed to be fun for hundreds of hours, yet I found myself struggling to find reasons to play after 70 hours, and finally gave up at 100. There just isn't a lot of compelling things to do. It's where the frontloaded content really starts to be a problem.\n- Dev response. The devs tend to add things to the game for the sole purpose of checking off a box, like "They want social interaction? Let's add the ability to group up to 4 people at once!" The community wanted guilds, chat channels, etc, and all we got was the ability to add a small number of people in a group at once, provided you're in the same instance. Which reminds me...\n- Instancing and the P2P model. This is what really kills this as a multiplayer game. Let's say you're trying to track down another player. You find him, interdict him, and start shooting. He activates his warp drive and heads off to the next system over. You follow him, but when you drop into the system... he's not there. You know he has to be there, he's not in the previous system, and this is the only system close enough to warp to. So where is he? Welcome to instancing.\n- Solo/Private Group play. Not that it exists (though the fact that Solo is not offline is bothersome), but that it affects Open play (multiplayer). There's a background simulation that affects the landscape of the galaxy (PowerPlay is one such system). This is influenced by player interaction. You could work together with people in Open, aligned to the same faction, to flip a system to another power's control. But, you can also do this in Solo or Private Group play as well. This means that you can successfully complete objectives without worrying about players attempting to stop you.\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is that the devs seem to have a grand vision of what they want their game to look like, and are willing to pursue that wholeheartedly at the expense of the players. They do not listen to criticisms, and the community itself is absolutely terrible when it comes to accepting critiques of the game.\n\nThe upcoming $60 "expansion", which is really just a Season Pass that grants access to all of the updates to be released in 2016, along with the announcement of additional "expansions", also likely $60, is what finally killed it for me.\n\nBut, if flying around in space is what you want, and you're not willing to wait for No Man's Sky or Star Citizen... I guess it's a good game. For $45, I'd say it's worth it.

The game is beautiful. The graphics are amazing. Suns and planets look spectacular. But it could be more awesome. I know that this game is going for a more realistic approach in terms of speed, scale and so on. But put some nebulars in the background and it would be way more awesome.\nI hear some of you: "But wait! There are nebulas!" Right! There are! But why go there, besides scanning some plantes that always look (kinda) the same? There's not really much to do there. So you stay in the core systems with NPCs and sh*t. But the skybox is always the same there, so you get bored by the view quite quick.\n\n2.) The combat... It looks awesome, it sounds even better... but the handling of the ships, oh boy... There's a thing or two these Devs could learn about "fun"... look at the star citizen dog fighting, it's a lot better IMHO. Also, it seems to be weirdly balanced. Either you kick everyones a** or you get your a** kicked by seventeen thousand anacondas.\n\n3.) There's so much to do, but at the same time, there isn't. There are missions you can do but they lack variety BIG TIME. So it becomes a stupid grind. There are factions you can fight for, but to earn points for them, you have to participate in battles. And you don't get a lot of points from that. So it becomes a stupid grind. You can go exploring, going into systems no one has been to before you, but they always look kinda the same and you don't get a lot of money from that. So it becomes a stupid grind.\nSee where I'm going with this? Good.\nAnd the only thing you do with all the money: buy better ships and guns and other equipment to grind better... yay!\n\n4.) There's a wing system, that has no point besides your wingmen getting colored a bit differently. You don't automatically share bounties (if they haven't shot the target) so you always have to stick together either way. There's no sense in making a wing.\nAlso, at the beginning, there was talk of player guilds with armadas and cap ships? Haven't seen or heard from that at all.  There's no point in interacting with other players or anything. So... yeah... why even multiplayer?\n\nIt's a sandbox... with a lot of sand, but you have no other tools or toys. So you let the sand run through your fingers, find the occasional piece of cat poop and eventually get bored and move on.\n\nAnd you should, too.

Great graphics, sound, control options, and an expansive universe, but lost between 'game' and 'simulation'.\n\nWithin 5 hours you'll see 99% of what it has to offer and there's very little driving you forward. Grind missions (the only type of mission since there is no story) are either "carry this to here" or "kill this guy". "Kill this guy" would be fun, but the combat is somehow totally unrewarding - slow, limited weapons selections, and uninspiring effects. Go watch a few clips on YouTube if you're curious. The combat feels too simulation-like and the multiplayer aspects (while  better than at launch) are almost unnecessary. There are billions of systems, and while people try to flock to Sol, outside of the immediate vicinity, you're probably not bumping into many people.\n\nSo, play it like a relaxing sim, right? Nope. If you're trying to belt out missions to save up for that new ship, you'll be confronted constantly by hostile NPCs. They have no motivation and are either stupidly under- or over-powered. Good thing the security services are there... well, 9 times out of 10 they'll zip between you are the target, take 1 shot and turn on you and place a bounty on your head. It's like the game wants you to play the 'game parts', so it just shoves them in your face, but has no idea how to handle it if you actually engage.\n\nI backed it after it left alpha (so my Steam hours aren't accurate), and thought I was investing in this game that was going to grow. It feels like I bought the shell of a game and am being asked to pay full game prices to get any real 'game' content in the expansions. I wouldn't mind in game cosmetic microtransactions, reduced price expansions, or even an in-game currency that could be bought for money to speed up buying new ships. There's no way to make this game 'pay to win' since there is no 'winning', so I don't see the harm.\n\nIt feel like slap in the face to early backers. "Give us more money so you can get the full game, instead of the pretty tech demo you have now."

Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106216639/","12 products in account","I will briefly sum the game so you can read other reviews in the shortest time necessary:\n\nElite Dangerous is a fun game. For the first 100 hours for me at least since I got help from friends. I can buy many cheap ships on the first day.\n\nThen things get slightly repetitive, where I have to continuously grind for money to buy and outfit a decent ship. At here the game is still fun, but not exciting anymore.\n\nAnd then comes the worst part. O grind for an end-game ship and modules. Everything you do in this stage is boring and repetitive because the only way to earn lots of money is to trade. Very boring. In fact I probably spent 300 hours in this stage.\n\nAnd finally, once I had money for the best ship and modules, I went on a shopping spree. This is the stage where the game suddenly becomes very exciting again, where you can sit back and kill any player in any ship. Then after this things get boring.\n\nTo summarize, the game goes like this: Stage 1(FUN) Stage 2(Decent) Stage 3(Extremely Boring) Stage 4(SUPER FUN)\n\nMost people I know who play ED stop playing the game at stage 2 to the beginning of stage 3. In fact, I think the only reason that I played so long is my ambition to  pilot the ultimate battleship in ED.\n\nWill I recommend this game? No. The fact that Frontier charges 50$  for the original game and another 50$ for a dlc is preposterous. This game is a mile wide, but an inch deep.\n\nGo save your 100$ and spend it on Star Citizen.

Since then, I've been playing Elite-like games, most recently X series. X3 was my favorite, while X Rebirth was a disappointment at release, while now, few year later and after 4.0 patch, it is a fantastic game. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Elite Dangerous.\n\nI've really tried to like ED, but game is fundamentally flawed. Which is a shame, as I have very fond memories for the previous Elite games. Like all other people say, the game is empty. It doesn't matter if you have 400 bil starts if they all look all the same, and you have 3 types of stations where you can land. Rebirth has completely the opposite approach  - easy system is an art itself, and the stations vary in shapes. I'm flying around the stations just to see all tiny details, it's mesmerizing.\n\nTraveling - it's boring as hell and it takes you 10min in real world to dock to another station is some other system. And since you always see the black screen, I dont see this can be fun.\n\nSave games - while other games, like Rebirth, allow you to save games when you dock on stations or even mid flight, this is not true in ED. Server will always save your position and state. So if you travel for 10 mins and then some pirate intercepts you, you better defend yourself or you will lose ship (or at least money if you have insurance). What it does is, it discourages you to experiment, but to fell anxious instead. No fun in that.\n\nCombat - maybe the best part of ED, but far from Rebirth. In Rebirth you can capture capital ships where you must disable turrets, engines, shields and then send marines to board. In some way, it feels like taking over the outpost in Far Cry. It's very rewarding.\n\nThe only part I like more in ED than in Rebirth is sound, especially engine noise - it's fantastic. Other than that, ED is an empty, boring game, not worth its name. Go buy X Rebirth instead, and have fun.","March 23","false","10.9"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","6"

Braben is up there with Molyneux in terms of snake oil salesmen and honestly should have had the “are you a pathological liar” treatment thrown at him at the same time ol’ Pete did. Elite Dangerous took a great platform and proceeded to do virtually nothing with it, instead selling promises which have managed to con a great number of people out of a great deal of money (first on kickstarter, and then via horizons) which have kept Frontier afloat. Braben is trying to do the *exact same thing* with the Planet Coaster mess, an always online game that you’ll not be able to play despite being an ostensibly single player game in the past. All in the name of wringing out more monies for Frontier.\n\nWhen the whole thing comes crashing down, I will be stood with a bag of marshmallows and a cup of hot chocolate. Frontier deserves no less, along with 22Cents. Both of them represent the absolute worst of current dev practices.

That isn't really that bad of a thing.\n\nI think a lot of people got suckered in by the games positive review rating and video's, bought it on sale, then realized it's a glorified early access title. There's virtually no content, and it has the mechanics of a single player flight simulator rather than a vibrant world you can actually interact with as one might expect of an MMO title.\n\nThis absolutely should have just been a single player game with coop and direct IP connection. I suspect that since the developers only seem to have expierence doing that style of game that they just seriously underestimated what most players expect from a cooperative/MMO style game.\n\nWe'll see if the next two or thee expanions change any of that, but something tells me not many people are going to buy them at the price the developers seem to think they're worth.\n\nThe only pro's to this game are that it is very pretty and the Hyperspace mechanics are also quite pretty. However, the in-system 'Supercruise' works in ways that don't make a lot of sense and requires a lot of sitting there doing absolutely nothing to get from place to place. In a game with faster than light travel, you might expect that you could actually get where you're going quickly but in fact it can take you up to an hour and a half of real-life time to get from a star to the furthest station in a given system.\n\nThis game is a fan-driven kickstarter game, and believe me it really shows. If you aren't a fan of each of the previous Elite games, you will probably quickly grow bored of this title unless you enjoy sitting quietly and doing nothing for your entire gaming evening.","October 21, 2015","false","76.6"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","0"

If you think any of these aspects of game design are important to you, you will find this game not "somewhat lacking" but rather completely devoid of these features.\n\nAs the developer also only sees a game offering as a one-year prospect of releasing a product without finishing all of the features intended, and then abandoning it in favor of releasing a "new" game which consists of the following: the old game, plus the ability to land on planets and drive around in a buggy.\n\nFor full price.\n\nMisusing the word "expansion" to describe a re-release of the same game to try to garner more full price sales is a disturbing trend which demonstrates the attitude towards customers: "you'll buy the same empty game again, and all we have to do is get you to hope we'll eventually add something to do with all this empty space."\n\n\nUpdate: Not content with their first attempt to avoid people reviewing their game, they have once again performed the "Steam Store Shuffle" to move their "new game" to a DLC item, providing them with yet another clean slate.  It's not faring any better.\n\nJust avoid these people, they have zero integrity.","December 13, 2015","false","26.2"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","45","78","0","0"

So at first this game was awesome. Completely open world, you can be anything you want, pirate, bounty hunter, trader, explorer, the list goes on. Combat and travel is also great, really makes you feel like your in space doing what you want to do and answearing only to you. After you get over the iniatial HOLY CRAP! factor thats when it gets maddening. Even with a decent starter ship (mine was the Viper after i got rid of the default Sidewinder) with good upgrades you really cant do a whole lot until you get a mid to medium high tier ship. This applies to all career choices. For instance my Viper could only take on at most a cobra and if there were 2 enemies it was iffy to beat them if they were decent low to low-mid ships. This also restricted the kinds of missions I could take. So i didnt get very many decent paydays. So final reccomendation? ONLY get this game if you have the patience to grind for several months to get to the mid tier ships.(may be shorter or longer depending on how much time you have and how good you are at the game) After that you'll probably love it.","January 14","false","181.8"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

It goes thusly -\n\nPeople bought the original E:D for £40, and with that came an entire years worth of updates. After that year ended, you had to pay an extra £40 for another year of updates. The first years worth of updates is called E:D, and the second years worth of updates is called E:DH. The yearly updates in 2017 will be called something different. And so on.\n\nNow here comes the fun bit. Because E:DH builds on E:D, and therfore includes everything from E:D, people are viewing this entire thing as shafting the original customers, all for different reasons. Some don't see it as paying for yearly updates, they see it, understandably, as having to pay twice for the same content. Technically they're not, they're buying content that hasnt been created yet - however this new 'yet to be created' content also comes with everything they've already paid for - and brings with it the illusion that they're buying an 'expansion pack' with little additions for a full £40.\n\nSome other people realise that the people that pay £40 for a much later version of the game (say, the one coming AFTER Horizons) will get much much more 'bang for their buck' than the people who, up till that point, have had to pay £120 in total for each version.\n\nPersonally, im not angry - its a horrifying way to sell your product, but all in all, I can't get angry because the game is absolute turd-pancake anyway; It stretches for miles and miles, but the depth of the game is an inch thick. It doesnt matter much to me where i am in the universe, because the missions are the same, the ships are the same, it all looks and feels the same.\n\nMaybe - MAYBE - after all this is done, and the game has many many years of additions added to it, it will be worth exploring, worth playing.

Fly from 1 station  to another trading or killing a few ships on the road and that's it. grinding until you next upgrade or ship and start over... Their is no soul, no campaign, no story it is a empty boring Universe.\nEach planet has just one station and you see over and over agin the same station, Just the name changes. even the Welcome text in each station is exactly the same, Funny how thousands of stations have the same paint falling of in the word Welcome and all have the same color....\nNo external views and the combat is just awfull flying in circle trying to follow the ship.\nThe bounty hunting is to flat and repetitieve it is to cry for....\nJumping on the sun on each jump over and over again is getting seriously annoying, infact each system is a copy and paste of another one, just less or more planets.\n\nCan't go on planets, like in Elite 2 but hey wait they just announced that you will be able to go one some planets soon but as a 45 $ dlc... If this game was good and had full of features already sure I would agree. But in This half baked state (beta state) it is not even a good game. Train simulator or flight simulator is 10 times more fun and challenging. I am amazed how bad this even ended up and they gone make you pay for all their changes... kickstarters who helped them to make a new Elite and being backstabbed this way is really  low. The planet landing should be free. Only thing we received is the awfull Power Play.\nIt's a pity because I was so happy to have a new Elite, but it end up to be a greedy unfinished game.

"As is", Elite does not offer enough value for its price. Not enough content within the package. As customers, people have every right to make their demands and comment on their purchases.\n\nYou don't have to compare entirely different genres. A more reasonable way of comparing entertainment products in the same price range is their "life time" or the "hourly rate" customers expect from a trivial product such as a video game. If you pay 60 USD for hundreds of hours of game time whilst playing, say, GTA V, the same must be expected from a game of similar price. How many hours of enjoyment did you get from Skyrim? One hundred? Five hundred? One thousand hours?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but it takes roughly 10 hours to see all there is in Elite Dangerous. Huge sprawling empty universe, copy and paste stations, random repeatable missions, no end game content.\n\nAnd finally, the "pay to play online" model seems nice at first glance, but given how awful the online interactions are as of now - the multiplayer aspect of Elite is very, very poor -, it'd have been preferable to have a dedicated offline mode with player-created content (mods) et cetera to this."\n\nSo there you go. Purchase at your own risk.","April 7, 2015","false","32.2"," 98 of 178 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","98","178","4","3"

The audio is great but you know dull as well because you know deep space not much sound out there. Exploring is awesome, grab a mate or two go out have some fun... hell bounty hunting with friends is so damn fun I love it.

The ships are so damn overpriced I might as well grow old before I even attempt to buy one of the end game ones.

Was not one of the backers though! However, seems like it was one of the best decisions I've made so far when it comes to pre-orders (Played over 1000 hours already, easily).  Is it good? Is it worth your time and money? Yes and no, depends what kind gameplay you're expecting from something as huge as elite dangerous. A game with over 400 billion star systems ain't really something you come across everyday.\n\nBig it might be but how about the actual content? Is there always something for you to do in game or are you just going to wander around all the time? See this the interesting part about the game, there is -always- something you can do in elite dangerous though it doesn't really tell you what. There's trading, being a pirate, bounty hunting, smuggling illegal goods, stealing floating cargo, mining, hunting wanted targets, exploring the ridiculously huge galaxy...a lot of things to be done. How is it lacking content then? Well it's not really...though it's up to you to find that content.\n\nFor a starting commander the tutorials might seem extremely confusing but there's a lot of youtube videos which covers the very basic if you find it hard to get into the game. I must say though, if you're not into -simulators- elite dangerous is definitely not your game. You need to manually land your ship, manually collect the cargo (Unless you use collector drones), manually do a lot of things! Perhaps that's just one of the many reasons why I love this game so much.\n\nThere's also quite the selection of playable ships in the game, nothing OVERLY huge except the anaconda which is basically a freighter instead of a small fighter ship. That said, there's no real big ships to be destroyed in the game either...unless you find one of those high intensity conflict zones with a capital ship jumping in, one of the most amazing things you can find in elite dangerous!\n\nA lot of things are still not in the game so expect this title to grow and grow. Perhaps even someday claiming the spot as my favorite game of all time which is currently Freespace 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SF666/recommended/359320/","SF666","Pomf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SF666/","1800 products in account","At the time of writing this review, I have only played around a bit in the training but regardless of how good the "actual" game might end up being, there are major design flaws to this game that make me want to recommend people stay away from this game and not buy it and not support it.\n\nFirst a bit of background: I have played some of the original Elite game, c64 version, and I consider my first "real" PC game to be Wing Commander 1. So, I have a lot of experience and time with starfighter type sim games and have liked the genre for a long time.\n\nThis is relevant because back then space sims were limited by tech and what people have, which despite many decades now since the original Elite, the devs seem to think they has been no progress save graphics.\n\nMajor issues with this game so far:\n1) No native multiple monitor support. This is pretty major, imo, especially for a game that came out post 2010 and even more so when the game was specifically showing off how you could turn to the side and look and access side panel UIs, which is in NO way supported in-game with multiple monitors. This really is unforgivable, especially in light of the fact that this game isn't brand new alpha anymore, but been out of years now and with a few expansions, but this still has not been added, absolutely ridiculous really.\n2) Very limited controls and options over your controls...\nDoing the target training mission, I was blown away to find out there was no way to simply "select next target" control option. There is target in front of you. Target highest threat. Target next hostile ship. But no "select next target". So even though I could lock a canister target in the training by moving my front over it, I could not select the next canister (as there is no option and it technically isn't a "hostile" or "threat"). I have never seen the lack of such a simple and most basic keybinding option in any type of decent flying sim (air or space). Again, imo, this is really f*cking ridiculous that this is not in-game.\n3) Very poor tutorials\nThe first training mission is target training, There is no basic flight controls training mission. There is a video, yes, but no mission which again is pretty ridiculous. I guess it would have been EXTREMELY difficult to program in a basic flight controls mission in-game.\nIn addition to this omission, the training missions that they do have are so extremely basic and do not give enough step by step, even decades older space games like Freespace had full voice over training missions that covered everything clearly and in step by step format.\n4) Extremely unintuitive and lacking common sense\nThe game gets very frustrating with how many times you run into stuff that by common sense terms should be in the game but are not.\nSome examples: 1a) Lacking a detailed damage control screen. For all the UI consoles this game has it doesn't have one of the most important and simple things. 2a) Lacking the ability to setup multiple nav points and/or return to previously set nav points. For example if you set a route for a multi-jump system, but then want to check some "new contacts" on the way, you have to go back to the galaxy map and reset your path or if you decide you want to stop at a base on the way to refuel you have to replot your course to your real destination again.\n3a) Lack of organization options for powerplay info. Say now you want to do some control missions for your faction and you want to sort by alphabetical order or by which system needs it the most? Too bad, you can't.\n\nIf this game was an alpha still or a first ever starfighter type sim game, then sure, I couldn't complain about any of the above, but the fact is this game has been out for years now and there has been decades of spacefighter type games that can be looked at for how these types of games should be designed and made makes the points I make completely unforgivable.\n\nUpdate: After still trying to give this game a chance, I tried to do a control system mission. I completed it, causing the system to surpass the trigger point. I log in again the next day and see ALL the progress is gone. I google to find out what the issue is and it turns out it is a official forum reported bug from over two months ago that has yet not been fixed obviously, despite me a MAJOR bug. The ONLY response from the thread is a "QA" guy that asks if it is still happening. (Great QA work that you can't even check yourself as part of the dev team).\nIn addition, I would have liked to also reply to said bug thread but could not due to how extremely anal the forums are. It would not let me edit my profile which it said I had make at least 3 posts, which I could not even make 1 post as I was restricted from making any post at all. I think this just illustrates how basically ret*arded Frontier is handling their own product, a real shame.\n\nDisclaimer (and TL;DR): I REALLY want to like and enjoy this game, but SO MANY major design flaws (that despite a lot of passed time from release still exist) are really making it difficult. I have for a VERY long time wanted to get back into space flight sim type games, since my obsession with Wing Commander days, but sadly with all of this game's promise, it is failing miserably. I guess I need to just wait for a truly promising new age starfighter sim from the original master, Chris Roberts in Star Citizen. Which, really, I only got this game to "hold me over", since to be honest, I kind of sensed this game was going to fall short (for one it is multiplat, probably a big cause of many of the design flaws).\n\nUpdate 2:\nAs I continue to play this, I do not cease to be amazed how at every turn, Frontier seems to gone to lengths at throwing common sense and logical out when it comes to their game design philosophy.\n\nStory follows:\nI am trying to make money doing nav point bounty hunting. After doing this for 2 days, I finally make a mistake once when very tired and shoot a friendly faction fighter. I do not destroy it. I only hit it once while locked. I disengage and find that I am now wanted for the first time ever. Well, what do you do when you are wanted? That's a good question, because it was never covered in any in-game tutorials, but whatever, fine, I'll just simple logic and common sense to solve this, right?! Wrong, not in Elite Dangerous. However, I guess I didn't learn this lesson yet, because I used my common sense and logic to say "I'm wanted? Well, I'll just go back to the starport and pay my bounty at the security office". I do so, to find that for some reason I can't pay off my bounty even though it is listed still on my 1 panel. After having to google the solution, which even on Steam forums and a mod there was some confusion in a thread about how to do this.................. turns out you can ONLY pay off your bounty if you at least once FULL frame jump to another system. So, I had to leave the station, and get ready to jump, only I couldn't jump because there no close enough system in range for my fighter designed ONLY to bounty hunt at nav point which really is the only good way it seems early game to make money fast. So, now, I have to go back inside the station and upgrade my FSD for the sole purpose of dealing with how ret*rded the system is in this game as to how to pay your bounty for a previous wanted status.\nSo, this allow proves how stupid some of their game designs are, but it doesn't stop there.\nThe next IRL day, I do more nav point bounty hunting, but decide to keep my upgraded FSD since I will probably have to use it again to deal with the pants on head ret*rded wanted system. Fine, whatever, I get wanted somehow....not even sure how, I think maybe because if you attack a wanted enemy before they are fully scanned (even if you know they are wanted because your allies are attacking them but because you attacked before the full "technical" scan, you were attacking an innocent even though they weren't...)","February 26","false","106.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","17","26","3","20"

As it turns out, my insurance did not cover flying into the sun. But I made up for it when someone pulled me out of warp, threatened to ♥♥♥♥ me, and then tried to attack me. Five minutes into the noob fight I was victorious... just kinda sitting there wondering what to do. I felt pretty proud after I docked successfully on the first try, what with everyone else crashing into the station around me. 11/10 Would explore the sun again.\n\nEdit: Updating this review to reflect the fact that I now have over 60 hours in this game.\n\nOn the serious side, this game is a simulator. The reviews both good and negative will tell you that. You're in a space ship, and you do stuff. Your path is your own. Since I've written my original review, the powerplay feature was added. This basically allows players to participate directly in the games evolving story by doing things like completing events and pledging allegiance to leaders. The in-game news, Galnet, has actually featured special player groups and so on. I even saw a story with a guy with a 35 million credit bounty on his head (that is a metric ♥♥♥♥load, for those who aren't aware). As such, I've made it my end game goal to make the front page of Galnet and assasinate the Emperor.\n\nIn my time playing in open play (cause I'm not a peasant) I've had plenty of interesting encounters with other players. I've been invited to join wings and go bounting hunting by randoms, I've had chats regarding the situation of the system's economy, and even been sexually harassed. My favorite to date is when a friend and I had just arrived at a star port from a neighboring system carrying a haul of polymers to trade. We noticed a bunch of other players at the port, and decided to mess around in the chat. I proclaimed myself the Billy Mays of polymer salesmen, offering to sell my "dank polymers" for only 1999 credits. Only one guy inquired as to what the ♥♥♥♥ I was babbling on about.\n\n12/10 everyone should hang out at Eravate, best of the 400 billion star systems.","April 6, 2015","true","134.5"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","60","26","43","11","0"

Therefore, missions, while you're a newbie on this game will earn you a lot, in order to help you advance.\n\n(+) The game is already HUGE. 4 billion solar systems ready for you to explore...\n\n(+) You define your own destiny in this game. Either good or bad, either pirate or vigilante, either headhunter or mercenary or pilot, either smuggler or trader, or even explorer, it's up to you, as you advance in game, to decide which path will fit to your gameplay style.\n\n(+) The whole thing about space: it's magic! When you jumpdrive or when you see dock at a space station, it's absolutely  marvelous. Those players who came from games such as Master of Orion (wow too old!), Star Trek Online and -especially- those having experienced the beauty of the "X-Universe" games (X2: The Threat, X3: The Reunion), will definitely adore this game.\n\n(+) The future of the game itself (cross-platform features, playable nowadays even from MACs) is promising of the creation of a whole universe and a gigantic community.\n\nThe "minuses"\n\n(-) Indeed, the game remains expensive... The price of 49,99 euros is totally forbidding for anyone to purchase. This, in my humble opinion, remains the biggest minus of this game, although it's a once-and-for-all purchase (there's no monthly subscription fee, which is excellent). However, I hope ED's creators will rethink about the retail price soon. When I bought it, I didn't care about its price, I was a fan. But not all gamers are fans...\n\n(-) The game still has a very poor community system. And to explain this in a few words: you feel alone, as you play. But this can be easily be corrected, if the game developpers refit the community/chat/party system into an integrated world, where you will have the opportunity to make new allies and -why not?- even friends.\n\nAll in all, with some corrections, I believe the game is excellent. Thank you for your attention, see you in game!\n\nCommander Sectaroth Sheogorath","June 7, 2015","true","99.1"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","35","60","0","3"

As always I played for several hundred hours before writeing a review.\n\nThe game itself isn't a bad game, it has lots of potential, and could one day be great but currently, in it's current state it has some severe limitiations, as well as some severe community issues.\n\nPros:\n\n- 400Billion star systems ( unfortunately 99.9% of them are empty excpet for the systems around the core player area.)\n- Missions\n- Factions, and Power play (Pretty neat ideas, though currently very shallow)\n- First person Cockpit twitch game\n- Few noticibal Bugs.\n- Interesting ships to chose from\n\nCons:\n\n-  As stated above the Star systems are virtually empty (of content) except for the NPC human populated area's which make up less then 1% of the game.\n\n- Very little actual content beyond whats listed above, and that content is very very grindy.\n\n- Toxic Community, a lot of fearmongering about social groups and guilds, includeing the moderators.\n\n- No in game social Structures or guild Support.\n\n- Gustapo Censoring Mods. Especially on the topic of Guilds, a few reads through their posts and it's obvious to see how either you agree that guilds are horrible evil entities bent on ruining all games, or you are a pyria and a black sheep of the community.\n\nI posted a week long debate in this thread for guilds: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=166180\n\nEven came up witha brand new mechanic never before seen in an MMO which would fit perfectly with ED's and FD's views on guild managment Here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=174869\n\nAs you can see, the post was censored and closed (About an hour after I posted it). Hmm So much for FD's statemtn on "We love our playerbases Opinions and Creative ideas!.\n\nI was also banned from the forums when I reported the Mod for censoring the thread and poll, Only for a week but still, apparently they have something called Moderator Cotestment, which essentially from what I gather means your not alowed to disagree with a mods ruleing, even if that ruleing itself obviously, is an abuse of power.\n\nBut anyway,\n\n- Again, for it's size and the money that was put into by kickstarter (over 14 Million) though the game is large the content is very very lacking.\n\n- Most content is derived tword, get better ship metality, get better gear. It only takes a few weeks to get the best ship and gear. Power Play as stated above is broken and shallow dealing with mostly "take these materials here and come back to get more and do the same".\n\nOnce you have the best of the best, everything is easymode and there is no challenge to the game at all, in fact it suddenly becomes a chore to do anything as everything suddenly becomes the same thing.\n\n- The game is not an MMO, be aware of this (even though it is advertised as such it supports none of the functions common to an MMO). it is a Single player game with Co-Op, and a mode called Open, in which you "Can" interact with up the 32 people at a time, unfortunately you will never see more then 3, (if that) as most of the systems even the npc populated ones, are very very devoid of life, except of course the NPCs.\n\nMost of the time I spent in Open, I found myself still playing solo. I did find one of the powers HQ systems with people in it once, about 4 of them. but after I left I didin't see anyone else again.\n\n- Very low population. I realize FD attempts to state that they have over 600k people, they don't. It's more like 10k-15k max spread across SOLO mode, Group Mode, and Open mode. I know this because after I got my python all  I did was troll system after system looking for people in the suposedly core populated areas (according tot he forums). All I found were empty systems with NPC's in them going about their business. Except for that one PP HQ system I metnioned earlier.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n* If you like single player space games with co-op and decent content (As long as you don't mind repetitively doing the same thing for weeks) that will keep you ocupied for a bit, Get this game.\n\n* If your interested in a Space game with loads of in depth and immersive content, Social structures and the ability to comunicate with your friends without needing a 3rd party program. Without a toxic close minded community bent on censoring anything they do not agree with, and a population you can actually "Play with".\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\n* Without social adpations and features which support large social groups (Guilds), I don't see this game having a real future in the market, it's a real shame too done right this game could have given EvE online a run for it's money, but the anti guild mentality of the developers as well as the staff, and the anti social behavior therin, I fear will prevent the company and the game from becoming anything more then a C Listed 9.99 game with trinket content every so often.\n\nThey claim Elite Dangerous is for Niche players, maybe it is, but maybe they overestimated how many that would be also, and the profits associated with such.\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\nI will update this review if anything changes, Horizon is set to release in a bit, so we will see what they add, and change, it's a shame you have to pay more for the expansion then for the original game however....","August 13, 2015","false","260.9"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","0"

Now i have Horizons and I am excited to see if they can pull off what they promised, but I'm not holding my breath. Like other reviews have said this game is empty. it's void of anythign interesting outside of the few things you can do in the game right now. There are a lot of mechanics in the game but they are not utilized much at all in most of the experience. What is there is fun to do for the most part, but really you don't need a whole galaxy to use them. It makes the game seem spread thin. I would rather have more random events that can be done in one place than more of the "go here go there" missions. i am hoping that once we are able to walk around that there will be more to do and that missions can get a little deeper in scope and narrative.\n\nI will say that if you stay in the starter area and see this game as more of a late alpha that you can just try out and play for a few minutes then you can enjoy it a lot longer.

The production value is outrageous. Every ship has a distinct feel an sound. The scope is massive. Any star you can see as you're flying around, you can visit. The lore is interesting and presented in a kind of passive way through news stories where the player can just choose to ignore it and do their own thing. Elite Dangerous has the frame work of an excellent game. Unfortunately, the experience offers nothing beyond the surface.\n\nThe first parts of the game are magical. Docking for the first time is an excellent experience. Grinding to get out of the most basic ship and start to specialize professions is entertaining for the novelty at first. The flight simulation is easy to learn, tough to master. I enjoyed myself a lot at the start. Then I had finally saved up enough money for the ship I wanted. As soon as I had the ship of my dreams, the game took a sharp downturn. There was no more reason to grind for money. So what else is there to do? Not much. The end game content is shallow, convoluted, and designed so that the player is supposed to feel important while not actually doing anything different than the first part of the game. The multiplayer aspect is basically nonexistent without joining a player group. The CQC arena shooter style mode is fairly lacking balance and functions mostly as a bandaid over the lack of action in the main sandbox mode. They added planetary landings to nonatmospheric planets as part of the Horizons season dlc, but it's confusing, poorly optimized, and offers little different from the main experience. Until recently, multiplayer features essentially didn't exist and what they have now isn't great.\n\nI can't help but feel that this game should be in early access. So many of the systems are unimplemented, unfinished, and shallow. The pricing structure until recently was absurd especially to early adopters like myself. It's unfortunate because Elite Dangerous in 5+ years might be so much deeper and fully fleshed out. As of right now, I can't reccommend paying anywhere close to full price for a game you'll likely stop enjoying after you put in a bunch of hours.","March 17","false","110.7"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","1"

I hate games where I cannot save before a hard mission, try, fail and go back. what's the point? diskspace? (it sure was back then, but really?!). nothing against a good hardcore-mode, love those, but for that kind of money, I want a checkbox!\n\n2.) mission-time = real-time? whoever thought of that? I have a life outside of elite, guess most old geezers from the original do. I just failed a mission because it had 4 hours when I logged out yesterday and the time was up today. apparently it keeps running when I'm logged out. no, sorry, I dont go looking for the one pirate ship that I've apparently missed when I need to log and go spend time with my family. epic fail!\n\n3.) unable to act during docking-sequence: they are boring after 100th time and I cant escape them. It feels like watching a movie (short one, over and over), not like playing a game. Besides, docking leaves you on the launchpad. you actually have to tell the bloody game to enter the hangar and open station services (another sequence). Anyone know what else I would do on that pad? why is that even a button?!\n\n4.) the game is nice, when I actually get ot play it. 90% of the time I seem to spend in supercruise, managing my speed so I dont overshoot or take hours to arrive. and the time it takes to boot menues in the station like the trade-screen? that was actually quicker on a 286-processor with a 40mb harddisk-drive.  why is it that I need to wait for everything I want to do in the game? It used to be dogfights, quick supercruises and trade/refit-screens. now it's 4s-wait on engine spinup, long, boring sequences of hyperspace (found those boring after 6-7 episodes of stargate SG-1 back then and I find that I still find them boring now.)\n\nso all in all, Elite Dangerous is a rich and complex but rather uncut gem that's in dire need for someone to eliminate all the boring waits out of it.

Yes, it's massive, and is supposed to simulate the entire Milky Way galaxy (altho, currently only contains a tiny fraction of the "400 billion" star systems that it will eventually have according to the devs).\n\nHowever, the ships I've tried maneuver like they are stuck in mud, making combat very difficult, and I was flying one of the more agile ships available.\n\nThere is a "solo" mode where you can play by yourself which was fine for me as the game universe is so big that it seems unpopulated when playing in "open" mode.\n\nDocking at stations is tedious and you are time limited after requesting docking permission and if you haven't docked in that amount of time, you get attacked.  Or if you "hit" the station by accident too many times, again, you are attacked  by station security.  This is stupid and I lost several ships this way.\n\nThe missions are repetitive and usually involve you hauling stuff between stations.  The more interesting hunt/kill missions are nearly impossible because the locaiotn is simply "space" in a particular system and the few times I mananged to fnd my target, I kept overshooting him, doubling back, only to overshoot again.  This was extremely annoying and the flight mechanics needs major adjustment.\n\nMaking money is apparently "easy" by doing bounty hunting, but hell, the ship turns like a slug so I don't see how this is feasible unless the player/NPC is freaking standing still.\n\nThere is a new expansiom where you can land on planets,  but I just can't get past the emptiness of the game and sluggish controls.\n\nI'll be playing EVE On-line and Star Citizen from now on.","February 14","false","21.3"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","10"

But frankly I can't, with the state of the game at the moment.\n\nHere are the good things it's massive when you fly around you get the immensity of space.  The distances are staggering the way they have done the transision from going from "warp" to sublight is well done.  The ship designs are enjoyable and interesting.  The systems as they are pretty cool.  Landing your ship successfully for the first time is a triump that is an experience I think everyone should have.  When you get into a fight it's exiting and fast paced.  Knowing when you jump out is an important skill any pilot will need.\n\nThis is unfortunately where the enjoyment starts to end.  The deisgn is for it to feel like your in the cockpit and they do this well.  But once you've enjoyed flying around awhile and delivered your umpteenth delivery of foodpacks.  You start to see the thinnest of this game.  You really only have two things to do, shoot people to collect bounties, or be a trader and run goods around.  What about mining?  Well that is so poorly done that almost no one does it.  The design for mining is horrible and after you spend two hours trying to collect 10k worth of minerals to find you friend made 400k bounty hunting you'll understand it is pointless.    In any case this quickly becomes a bore that leaves you wanting more.  on top of this the utterly steep learning curve is going to drive many players away as you really need to commit 10+ hours before you start have really an idea of how to play.\n\nI could of forgiven these short comings with the idea they are going to continue developement, but it it's now they are already pushing paid expansions.  Frankly this game isn't finished into something that is fun and emersive.  It's shallow and leaves you wanting so much more.  Many in time there will be some meat on this but for know unless you really want a space sim and are willing spend many hours on getting the hang of this, it's probably not the game for you.","August 11, 2015","false","101.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayyiduna/recommended/359320/","Sayyiduna","Sayyiduna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sayyiduna/","400 products in account","I enjoy this game quite a lot, but I simply cannot recommend it. The reason can be summed up in a single sentence:\n\nLack of content\n\nIt has been an oft-stated criticism of this game on Reddit and many other websites that the game is a mile wide and an inch deep, and my play of it has confirmed this. I have waited since late 2013 for this game to roll out enough content to be worthwhile and purchased a HOTAS setup specifically for it. I still don't think it's worth the money.\n\nElite has a few things it does right:\n\n- Fun, skill-based combat\n- Unique, specialized ships\n- Excellent sound design\n- Good if not great graphics\n- Incredible universe (400 billion stars!)\n\nThere's also something to be said about how immersive the game feels, the world is built with an exceptional internal logic. For example, landing at stations requires permission and a careful approach with your ship to an assigned landing pad. It feels like you're really taking a spaceship in for a landing and can screw up and crash easily.\n\nThere are other elements that help this immersion along. Ship subsystems can fail and require a restart. You can and more likely than not will run out of fuel at the worst moment and get stranded. If you crash into another ship or station it can blow out your spaceship's glass canopy, leaving you running on a few minutes of oxygen and gasping for air until you get to a station. There are loads of touches like that throughout the game.\n\nThe simple fact is though that beyond all these great little details and features, there simply isn't much to do in the game.\n\nHere are some of the worst offenders:\n\n- Half-baked "background simulation"  -\n\nThe game doesn't actually allow you to cause surpluses and shortages in the economy, a developer has to do it. There are "community events" where players can help build a new space station but this only happens if a developer allows it. A vast majority of the game's "simulated" events are actually started and maintained by the development staff and not a result of simulation. This is inexcusable when games like EVE and the X series run full simulations that allow players the ability to affect the simulation any way they want. System populations don't shift unless a developer changes them, so a protracted war or tons of slave smuggling does nothing unless they change populations manually, you get the idea.\n\n- No module or weapon progression -\n\nEach ship can be fitted for different tasks, which is awesome, but there are only a small handful of modules and ALL of them can be purchased from stations. Weapons also come in only 2-3 varieties and then get more expensive the more DPS you want, but you can buy it all. There's no rare black market modules to hunt down, no "loot" in hidden space wrecks, no specially-branded modules that have cool features/looks. There is no crafting either, you just earn enough money and buy whatever you want until you have the max class/rank for each.\n\nYour equipment choices are: gatling cannon fixed, gattling cannon gimballed (it turns a little), gattling cannon turret\n\nCopy/paste this for maybe 4-5 types of weapons (cannons, lasers, railguns) and make higher DPS cost more and that's it. No special features of any kind.\n\n- Poor economic simulation\n\nSure, you CAN be a trader, but once you find a profitable route, it will never change because the simulation is static, you can run the same route forever and it will still be profitable. This makes dynamic, interesting trading impossible because you're just hauling things from one place to another instead of dynamically seeking shortages and surpluses.\n\n- No engaging PVE content -\n\nYou will not destroy a station, you will never be part of an intense assault on a pirate outpost, aliens will not invade your system and make you fight for your life. The enemies all pilot the same ships as players (more or less) and are found, predictably, either at special instances or in asteroid fields. The enemies don't "drop" or provide anything of interest, all they provide is money so you can buy better versions of ship parts you already have.\n\nIf you form a multiplayer group (wing) you can find instances where you can get into dogfights with a handful of enemies, this is fun, but it carries no reward or depth besides just more money.\n\n- Shallow, repetitive missions -\n\nYou can pick up "missions" from stations, but these are ALWAYS of the variety "go here kill this" or "go here take this". There are story vignettes but they're randomly generated from only a handful, so you'll see the SAME 15-20 missions texts on EVERY single mission. There's no narrative, no choices, no multiple-mission structure, no unique mission-specific areas.\n\n\n- Summary -\n\nThis game is not complete, to be completely honest after waiting longer than a year for it to become complete I don't think it ever will be. The developers recently introduced "Powerplay" which allows you to enlist and help a major galactic power. However, as with everything else, the stories, events, and overall arc is completely developer controlled, players have very little influence.\n\nThe Powerplay feature itself is nothing but a soul-crushing grind. You have to grind out thousands of "merits" every week to reach a high rank, which pays a measly salary that pales in comparison to what you can get trading the never-changing profitable trade routes.\n\nI said before this game has great potential, I believe it still does. However, the developer is struggling and failing to bolt on meaningful, interesting content on a universe that was built to be too limited to allow for the addition of such depth. Powerplay is a great example, it sounds wonderful on paper, but shoehorning gameplay systems like that into such a shallow game didn't work, and I suspect many features will be this way.\n\nThe developers are promising the sun and stars, better modules, more ships, better and more interesting missions that tie into the simulation. However, all of this is conjecture and the game has had a development process that has yet to successfully implement any depth to the game.\n\nThe entire progression is about money, you explore for money, mine for money, fight for money, and then get a better ship to earn more money faster until you get tired of it. There's no endgame either, once you're sitting on hundreds of millions with the best ship there's not much else to spend money on.\n\nYou will marvel at this game for the first 10-15 hours while you learn the systems and get used to the game's exceptional attention to detail. After that, you slowly realize there's NOTHING meaningful to do in this vast universe.","July 20, 2015","false","27.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

You start off with the weakest ship, which is ok considering thats what all games would do, but not when every enemy in the game no matter where you are has a much, much better ship than you. And another problem is getting a better ship. You need credits! Whats the best way to get credits? Missions! Unfortunately after flying to every space station in the system I started in, I learned you need to be higher "level" or whatever they use. So in order to power up, I need to do missions. But I can't do missions because I'm not powered up.\n\nNow lets get to the worst part in my opinion. The controls. If you are planning on playing this game with a controller, you are out of luck. If you use a controller, you still need to use your keyboard for some very important things, like coming out of a jump at the right second. Because if you don't manage to reach over and hit that "J" key, you have to turn your ship, another pain in the ♥♥♥, all the way around. And you need the keyboard to just turn without spinning. Why? Who thought we would want endless barrel rolls instead of turning on the controller?\n\nThis game was an absolute waste of my time and money. I mean dear god, I couldn't even suffer through two hours of this game.","January 16","false","7.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

And it was. But as I got over the nooby euphoria of it all I saw the true barebones of this game. Elite Dangerous has a massive scope in terms of size but very little content to actually coincide with it. You'd be better off playing Eve Online and using your imagination to compensate for the lack of a cockpit just to get some content or meet other players. As a player you feel like you have very little control or impact in this galaxy with 400 billion systems. The game is polished in terms of graphics but that'll only carry it so far. I hope they address some of these issues but until them I will not be playing Elite Dangerous.","March 5","false","20.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

I've played all of the X-Wing series games including X-Wing Alliance, Freespace 2, and Freelancer immediately come to mind.  I believe that Elite: Dangerous builds off of the best of these games by having a well balanced approach to the following:\n\n* Open world spanning a model of our real-life galaxy.  You can travel to the galactic core, fly around nebulas, fly inside the rings of planets, fly inside the corona of stellar bodies, and more (oh, and you can make money by doing so!!!).\n\n* Ability to FULLY customize the weapon and system loadouts of each ship.  You can take the cheapest ship and make it fill many different roles (trading, bounty hunting etc.), but each ship has its own strengths and weaknesses that make it great for a couple roles and less than perfect for others.  Some ships like the Cobra Mk. III are multipurpose and let you change out components easily without having to constantly trade out ships.  You are never locked into a role like in other mmo's or RPG games where classes form the basis for gameplay (tank/heal/DPS).\n\n* Its almost like each ship is a unique person:  "Real" feeling flight model that is different for each ship.  Each ship has hardpoints and cockpits that require a unique approach to dogfighting, evading, landing, escaping, etc. per ship.\n\n* The combat in this game is amazing and isn't always about "who brings the most power to the fight" (unless you play solo or are fighting one-on-one, then its about power and balance).  Fighting on a team with other NPCs or players means finding that unfilled need in the fight and taking advantage of it.  Its often about fighting SMART and about fighting HARD.  You'll think about approach vectors and team tactics on top of managing your own ship systems when you've gained experience.\n\n* You have the option to play in "Solo Play", "Private Group", or "Open Play."  Be warned that an active connection to their servers is always required.  This makes sense since even solo play is fully synchonized for events and trade data for all players.  This means that if players are competing for a resource in a station, then going to solo mode isn't a way to cheat the system, but a way to isolate your interaction with other players.\n\nOkay this game is amazing.

Throughout the development, we were promised quite a lot. A fully explorable model of our galaxy, landable planets, hundreds of thousands of stations and so on. What we got instead is a shell of game, with promising looking holes where features might get placed eventually. Some have compared this to Euro Truck Simulator in space - and I have to only partially agree here. It is about flying from one place to another over and over again, sort of like in ETS, but the difference is, that both the starting and the finishing locations, look mostly identical. ETS has at least some style to it's 'cities', you can look at the horizon and say "hey, this is Warsaw!", "that's Paris!". Here, it's the same identical planets and the same 4 models of stations, over and over and over again. We're looking at something around 5-10 hours of vaguely enjoyable gameplay involving trading, followed by around 3 hours of mostly ok dogfighting. After that - you won't be able to look at Elite anymore. Having played Train Simulator for a while, there's only so much braking at stations one can do, before one gets annoyed by it, and without the autopilot, "slowing down your ship in time", is pretty much 90% of stuff you'll do in Elite.\n\n...and then... came the DLC. So apparently, this is about to become DLC central, the like of which will put Train Simulator to shame. Features that were supposed to have been in the game, like being able to land on planets are now called expansions ("Horizons" is the first one). The official chart for the near future, details around 200EUR worth of DLC like that. The game's creator, clearly decided to go all "whale-economy" here. Can't see how any sane person can support such things, so there's no further reason to associate oneself with mr. Braben and his "creations".\n\n"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THE CHOSEN ONE" - is the sentence and the scene, that best describes Elite: Dangerous.","August 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I preordered the game and was really excited for what this game had to offer and for a while I was having a great time. However, after your 500th time jumping into hyperspace or docking at a station, it definitely loses its appeal.\n\nTo be fair, since launch they have added some features and content which brought me back for a while but at its core nothing had really changed much.\n\nStarting with the pros:\nThe game looks incredible. There is nothing like having a first-person view from inside your cool ship while you fly into a giant space station or drop out of warp speed and see a giant blue star in front of you. Flying through an asteroid field while dogfighting with space pirates makes you feel like you're watching a blockbuster movie and smuggling illegal goods into a spaceport gives you a Han Solo-esque feeling.\n\nThe sounds and music are pretty nice and give the universe a good atmosphere.\n\nThere are lots of options. The controls are completely customizable for keyboard and controllers and the game supports all kinds of flight sticks from what I've seen online which is nice.\n\nThe content that is released currently is quite polished and runs well (except for a few long load times here and there). I have a laptop with a midrange graphics card and I can still get 60fps at 1080p so I appreciate how optimized it is. They must have some crazy quality assurance testing too because I haven't run across a single bug that I can remember.\n\nBounty hunting is probably the best part of this game and is something fun you can actually do with friends in this game.\n\nNow for the cons:\nOnce you get past the awesome visuals and smooth gameplay, there honestly isn't much left. I've tried long enough in my opinion (about 70 hours at the time of this review) to find something in here to get me to keep playing but I just can't find it. If I had to choose a few words to sum up my experiences over the last year or so of owning the game, it would be: be prepared to grind.\nTo get anything cool in the game (bigger ships, better guns and equipment, etc.) it requires an absurd amount of credits which are stupidly hard to earn. Since the launch of the game they have added more varied missions with increased payouts but it simply isn't enough to be worth your time. I know a lot of people have said this but I have found it to be quite true: this game is a space trucking simulator.\n\nTrading\nThe  only  way to make a reasonable amount of money in this game is trading which is excrutiatingly boring and time consuming. In addition, the market system is quite weak, especially when you compare it to a game in a similar category like Eve Online. In Eve you can manufacture and sell your own goods, place buy and sell orders, and actually have a good time at trade hubs where you can feel like you're on Wall Street or something. Elite doesn't even come close to this in terms of complexity. Based on the system you are in, they demand and supply certain goods (with either low, medium, or high amounts of supply/demand)...that's it. The goods you are trading have absolutely no effect on your ship or progress in the game and you can't even buy or sell ship equipment like you'd expect. Additionally, there is no way to view surrounding market information without flying your ship over to the adjacent system and writing down the prices with pencil and paper which is very frustrating. You can try to use online trading tools but they frequently are outdated and don't give reliable information.\n\nMining\nIf you think picking up rocks for an hour is fun, then this should be in the pros list for you. Mining in Elite is tedious and unrewarding from my experience. You have to spend large amounts of time looking for a suitable place to start mining and even then when you start mining it's pretty much based on chance. You shoot your mining laser at a rock until a little piece breaks off and usually it is some crap mineral that sells for nothing, then you have to go fly over and pick it up without accidentally crashing into it and breaking it. Then once you have enough little rocks you can refine it into 1 unit of some mineral. So you can spend an eternity mining and make like 5000 credits. When you buy a mining laser it should come with a free handgun so you can blow your brains out once you realize how much time you've wasted.\n\nDoing Missions\nYou'd think, being a sci-fi MMO, that Elite would have some awesome quests that involve stopping the alien threat in the galaxy, destroying the home base of a warlord space pirate, and building up a faction to conquer all other factions, right? Well you were so wrong. There are no alien invasions, no evil space conglomerates, and no way to build your own space stations to house your freedom fighters. Instead you get to fly to a station and choose from 10 generic missions (75% of which are locked because of your level) from some faction that nobody cares about. These missions are usually either: deliver a message, deliver some cargo, or kill some pirates...oh boy. These missions also range in difficulty and reward levels:\nLow risk - Low reward\nMedium risk - Low reward\nHigh risk - Low rewardThe developers seem to want to artificially extend your length of playtime by giving you jack squat for your time and effort. This is unfortunate because it means I will never be able to experience everything the game I paid $60 for has to offer because I simply can't grind for hundreds of hours to buy the biggest ship in the game which I will talk about in the next section.\n\nGetting Money\nIts pretty sucky to say that I will never be able to fly the biggest and coolest ships in the game because I refuse to spend 200 hours grinding missions and trading when I'm not enjoying it. To make it worse, the developers, for whatever reason, don't want players to make any reasonable amount of money in a reasonable amount of time. Any time there is a whiff of a money-making opportunity they nerf it. For example, recently you could make a good amount of money (for me around 2 million credits in an hour) by flying hundreds of lightyears to the edge of colonized space and collecting highly illegal cargo and ferrying it to the inner systems. It wasn't a get-rich-quick scheme though because while you have the cargo you are being chased by cops and pirates and it takes a long time to travel the hundreds of light years (around 700 round trip) since you can only warp about 25-30 at a time. But of course, as soon as I start doing this I hear that they are going to nerf it, just like they have nerfed every other way to make money in the game. Just to give you some perspective, if I were to make 2 million credits per hour by doing this, it would take me approximately 104 hours to buy the biggest ship in the game, and that doesn't include any upgrades, so double that time. I'm sorry Frontier but "playing" your game isn't my full-time job. And remember they are going to nerf these quests, so...there you go.\n\nSummary If you've made it this far, you can probably see why I don't recommend this game, but if you skipped to the summary here are the main points.\nGreat atmosphere and visuals\nOptimized and polished gameplay\nDull MMO universe, especially compared to EVE Online\nBoring quests, endless grindingIt's unfortunate because I really wanted this game to be everything I was hoping for in a space sim/MMO, but it just fails to deliver. I don't want to dump all over the developers because they have obviously spent thousands of hours creating this universe and it is a labor of love for them, but I have to be honest and say that there is not enough interesting content to justify a purchase.","March 17","false","79.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

But, the God's honest truth is that this game just isn't worth the cash in your wallet.  It's grindy, probably on purpose, but there's little to be enjoyed once you've established yourself.\n\nGood Stuff:\n- Graphics are top knotch.  No gripes here.  It looks great.  Bases look well designed and believable.  The ships have great detail, albeit, they all look clunky and odd.\n\n- Docking.  It's a small matter, but I love that I can dock my own **** ship.  Thank you for not resorting to cutscene style docking.  There's auto-dock modules for those who get tired of slapping their ship into the side of the station.\n\n- Dog fighting is fun* (see Bad Stuff).  Through Interdiction (being pulled out of sub-light speed), or just passing by, the AI is challenging and is attempting to kill you and evade you, as expected.\n\n- In-game menu's are clever, being implemented as screens within your ship.  Kudos to cleverness\n\n- Maps are well designed.  Maneuvering the galaxy is easy.\n\n- You can make money by exploring and wandering around, then selling it systems that are far enough away.  Pretty cool way to make money that doesn't involve lasers or trading.\n\n- Bounty Hunting is fun.  Unfortunately, it's not very profitable.  An hour of this will probably net you around 200K space bucks.  Which sounds like a lot, until you get to the level where you're flying a Cobra.\n\nBad Stuff:\n- Travel.  It takes a good chunk of time to reach certain places. They opted for a bit of realism here as some of the places that are 10K Ls (Light Seconds) away take several minutes of flying through an otherwise bland chunk of open nothingness with nothing to do in the meantime.  Generally speaking, places this far away tend to have somewhat desireable goods.  Ultimately, they're not worth the time spent doing nothing.\n\n- Heaven forbid, I tried to go faster to cut down on travel time and I've overshot my approach to a destination.  I now need to pull a "U turn" to get back there and approach at the speed of a snail (though I'm told I'm actually moving thousands of meters per second!).  Where the heck is my auto-approach module?  We are in the future, aren't we?  You'd think they could automate this.  By far, the least fun part of the game is making sure you cut your sub-light engines at just the right moment.\n\n- The ships are ugly and there also isn't much variety here.  Strange, because games in this genre tend to have a decent amount of ships.  To be fair, they did just add quite a few, however, even with 31 different ship types as of the time of this writing, you'll probably only encounter 5 types in any given system.\n\n- There billions of stars you can warp to.  I managed to make it to one of the unique ones and it was a bright, blazing blue star.  Nothing else was there.  A niche feeling, perhaps, but I felt like the star looked like all the others, save for the fact it was twice as big as the typical ones I'd seen.  I felt as though I'd stopped to see the world's largest pancake.\n\n- As wide as the ocean, but as deep as a kiddie pool. Despite the many locales, bases feel same-y.  Planets feel same-y.  The game is very much the same experience, over and over.\n\n- Combat is fun, when you're on even playing ground.  Missions I've taken for my level of player somehow felt lopsided.  I'd show up, tell the evil-doer that they're going to die in heroic fashion, only to have them turn around and blast me a couple times with their death lasers.  Upon sparks flying and my shields crying, I rethink the situation and tell them, I must have gotten the wrong guy.  Tally ho!  Oh, I can't afford "those" lasers.  I can get money if I do some missions....oh wait, I see what you did there.  Oh, I have to "trade or travel" to get the lasers?  Ugh...\n\n- I killed a bad guy.  His loot is there for the taking.  Oh, it's stolen.  I'll have to pay his fine in order to sell it.  WTH?  This is asanine.  I do the system the good deed of blasting one of its tyrants and I can't even keep the spoils?  Fine, what if I return them for a finder's fee?  No.  I have to pay for it as if I was the one who stole it.  F*** that noise.\n\n- I get this sense of "Now what?".  I've done the trading thing.  Meh.  I've done the bounty hunter thing.  Fun, but not profitable enough to get ahead.  The travel thing was fun, but jumping from star to star becomes, surprise surprise, a repetitive experience.  Warp to one burning orange sphere, Warp away to another burning orange sphere.  Warp away to another burning white sphere.  Oh gawd, my eyes!!!!!!\n\n- No 3rd person view to fly around in.  Camera screenshot mode does not count, I don't care what the fanboys say!  This would improve the travel experience I have by at least 50%.  I'm not sure why, but the science of percentages says so!\n\n\nOdd Stuff:\n\n- This is a supposedly multiplayer game.  Supposedly.  I've yet to encounter anyone, ever.  That's not necessarily bad though.  People are ****s.\n\n- The Political Powers update.  You align yourself with some space politician and carry out their influence upon the nearby sector of the galaxy.  In order to do this, you effectively need to take X to System 1 before Politician_Bad_Guy has his people take Y to System 1 and something happens where the system effectively changes color.  Your efforts in going back-and-forth from one system to System 1 determines whether it remains your Politician's favorite color or changes to Politician_Bad_Guy's favorite color!\n\n-The developers released the "SAME **** GAME" as an "expansion".  You can now land on moons and drive on them, for a price of $40.  If you want an experience like that, get Kerbal Space Program.  It'll be more fulfilling and enjoyable.  Oh, there might be other cool stuff they add to the game.  Probably.  Maybe.  Way to give your early supporters the middle finger with DLC priced like that, devs.  Oh, they said you could customize your Commander's look, that you can't see, because you're in a ship, in HUD only.  That's worth the cash, right?  Right!?\n\nSummary:\nI've tried to come back to this game and play it again, but it's just the same bland experience over and over.  There's nothing really that innovative going on here.  It's cool that they tried to cater to the different buzzword space roles that we've all seen in the past: Miner, trader, fighter, pirate, explorer.  Each experience falls flat though.  There's no real fun aspect to mining.  Trading is just the traveling stock market (buy low, sell high).  Fighting, while arguably the most enjoyable piece of the game, has very little rewards.  This game is a timesink, with little to show other than having the ability to gloat that you bought the most expensive, fattest, and ugliest ship in the game.    In a galaxy that has no character or uniqueness, the devs are taking it in a direction that doesn't make much sense.  I suppose they're focusing on industry buzzwords for the genre rather than adding quality content.","March 29","false","83.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","4"

I have low play time due to not buying it on steam i only got steam key recently i bought this game before release.\n\nGraphics are nice etc but game is terrible. Huge huge game but its the exact same content copy and pasted over and over and over and over. Every place you go looks the exact same there is almost no content in this game, just the small few bits of content copy and pasted a few billion times.\n\nWherever you travel its just the same same same same. Its ridiculously slow and boring which might be forgivable if it wasnt the same thing over and over and over again.\n\nWhen I originally bought this game i enjoyed it for a small few hours and then it was just the same over and over. I literally felt robbed. It was a con much worse than destiny which is another piece of junk con but this is actually wrose than destiny somehow. Developers made all this talk about the future of the game so I accepted this and thought well at least it will get good eventually. How foolish of me how could i believe that this would be a one time con that would eventually be worth it.\n\nThe "improvements" to this empty shell of a game are going to be sold in expanisions. So basically they released a game with nice graphics and plenty of potential which was empty, void, nothing in it and then  they decide to sell the rest of the game to you in bits. Except for the graphics this game is emptier than an early access title but at least with early access (in most cases) you actually recieve the rest of the game as part of your initial purchase. With this destiny style sales plan they will sell you the game in pieces over the span of a few years or as long as they can keep suckers on the hook.\n\nA lot of people will rip me apart for this review because there will always be a subset of people who like that kind of thing but also because some people need to justify themselves, true believers etc.\n\nThis game is junk. It should be called the emporers new clothes just like destiny. Maybe one day when all the content has been put in after a few years and when its sold as one product at a low price it might be worth it then but id say until that day comes if it ever does avoid this like the plague.\n\n","August 8, 2015","false","2.2"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","23","38","0","0"

For a little while, I did. And in some ways, I still do. But after nearly 300 hours, a lot of agravattion in the forums and looking around for developer diaries and interviews, I came to the conclusion that this game can  be better described as a disappointment. But why does a game that offered me such long playtime cannot be recommended?\n\nThe main positive point here is the visuals. When you first enter the 'bulk', the subtle humming noise of your ship's engine, the frantic and chaotic combat, the amazingly well done stations and ships... You simply get overwhelmed. Everything is done with attention to detail and quality. But, as it is with most visuals, only the most gullible players remain entertained with sparkle and fizzles after a while.\n\nThe bulk, something you find amazing at first, eventually becomes more an annoyance then anything. The constant FTL jumps fruit of a compartmentalized game world severely break the immersion, detracting from the game. The sound and music, so repetitive and limited, eventually fade and, often, you'll see yourself listening to something else on headphones. The stations, amazingly well done as they are, are not unique in any way, being one a copy of the other with minor differences.\n\nAnd after this fades away, the grinding of the gameplay shows itself and the games loses all momentum and, much like the Gamespot review puts it, the billion star wide game shows that it's one inch deep. Just to give some perspective, from my total play time, over 170~180 hours consisted of my grinding trade routes. I watched series and films in a second monitor and simply paid minor attention to the game - it became a chore. The combat, that is so rewarding on itself, does nothing for the immersion, because after hundreds of faceless, expressionless enemies downed, every ship you blast away is nothing more than a little more credits in the grind.\n\nBut in all honesty, I could live with all this and still recommend the game. What makes me warn you to stay away are the two features introduced earlier this year: Powerplay and CQC. Both are unbalanced and unwanted features that were not promised during early backing that simply try to add depth to the MP aspect of the game - and fail. Basic MP features, like player guilds and global chat are nowhere in the game, things that could considerably improve the game's focus on a MP experience, but they choose instead gimmicky, 'new' features, to entice players into buying the game - instead of pleasing the community. CQC in particular is something that I've seen very little vocal support, if we can consider 'uh, I don't know, maybe I don't care if they add it' as 'support'. Powerplay is laughable: instead of improving and expanding on minor factions - which were a source of real fun for players, who could help shape the galaxy in really interesting and seamless ways - they added 'middle' factions, that are utterly and totally unnecessary.\n\nAnd these days, I log into the game once in a while, and gaze, sadly, the stars of what could have been the best game of all time, knowing that the moment a better experience appears on the gaming horizon, this game is going to never be played again by me.","December 16, 2015","false","295.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

The graphics and effects are great, all-in-all I'd say the game is quite well executed.\n\nThe problem for me is the universe is completely dead outside the initial region of space where you start.  What is the point of having an entire galaxy to explore if there is nothing to do when you get there???  Seriously, every station in the entire game is located within 400 ly of Sol which is a tiny fraction of the explorable space.\n\nThe only thing you can do beyond that is explore... fly around.  Sure you can spend hours hauling your miner out to some cool undiscovered system, and if your lucky you can fill your cargo hold with precious metals, cool right?  Not cool, because now you have to spend hours hauling your miner back to a system with a station in order to sell that cargo.  Spending hours (real life time) doing a hundred jumps to make one cargo run is the opposite of fun in my opinioin.\n\nI can't help but feel disappointed and frustrated by having an entire galaxy at my fingertips yet essentially being restricted a very limited region of space in which to fully play the game.  Sure, it's understandable for deep space to be initially empty, but the lack of any mechanism which can alter that state over time is the single reason this game will never get anywhere remotely near the hundreds of hours I logged in X2 and X3.\n\nHow can I be vested in a game of such epic scope and possibility if I can't build my own empire?  My only goals are to have a collection of ships and a large bank account?  Sorry, that's not enough for me.  If that's enough for you then please do support the developer and buy it because as I said at the start it really is a cool game.\n\nAnd yes, I know the game is still in development, but the last I heard the devs had ruled out the inclusion of things like player owned stations.  Until something is done which adds life to 99% of the traversable galaxy this game will remain not worth the money despite its incredible potential - and I bought it on sale for $19.99\n\nBTW, there are many very simple implementations of player bases or other interesting mechanics which would address this problem.  For example, giving each player the ability to purchase (at great expense) a single simple space dock, and be able to relocate that space dock as needed (also at great expense) to act as a forward operating base would completely open up the galaxy.  This would allow all the activities occuring in the core systems to now extend out into the reaches of deep space while at the same time prevent the spamming of abandoned player stations that would surely occur if you let everyone create multiple bases or create them at minimal cost.\n","February 15","false","24.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Lets talk about the good points first.  It does, more than any other game I have played, provide an experience that feels as much like flying a spaceship as is possible in a game.  This is in part due to the large number of solar systems, astronomical features in space, but mainly due to the essential joystick control and the cockpit view.  It does in parts have amazing visuals too, getting in close to stars and seeing solar flares erupt off the surface is amazing, as is the detail on the stations as you dock / undock.  Also, the sound effects are very impressive and create a good sense of character in the game.\n\nNow for the negatives.  This is an MMO, but it is so empty.  This is partly due to relatively low player base, but is mainly down to the fact that the game provides no social structure whatsoever (no ability to form guilds or corporations etc).  I am not even sure you can have multiple chat channels with real people.  Also, the "overview" which shows you what is around in space is non-existant, so even if there were 100 players around you, you would have no idea.  This is definitely an MMO because it sounds better when marketing, no effort has been put in to this at all.  It is shocking and insulting.\n\nDespite making a massive game, the actual gameplay is tiny.  You can be a hauler in various guises (trader, smuggler) but this just involves moving stuff from one place to another.  You can be an explorer but this is extremely boring too, and you just end up flying about the galaxy hoping to find an interesting collection of pixels (ie, in the form of a black hole).  You can also do combat, which I did not do too much of so cannot really comment on its level of "fun".\n\nSome of the gameplay mechanics are ridiculously over complicated (fuel scooping, fire groups, targetting, overview; I'm looking at you).  And while there is some tutorials as to how to do combat and docking, I did not see any that explained fuel scooping for example.\n\nThe combat I did try was absurd, I get aggressed flying about (by what I first thought was content-generating players, but actually turned out to be NPCs) and once the aggressor is behind you (which they always start out being) there is no way to defeat them, even in an equivalent ship.  However I gather from others that being the aggressor is fun in this game, so I guess its all about that.  Finger twitching, and not strategy so the opposite of the rest of the game.# really.\n\nPlayers cannot manufacture, or even own anything.  If you fit an item to your ship and decide you want to change it for a cargo hold (for example) in order to run this smuggling mission, there is no way to put the item in your cargo hold to put it back on at the next station.  But the next station may not have the item for you to re-buy.  Crazy.  The trade market is not players selling things (as we cannot own, we cannot sell), its the game setting prices making it very undynamic.  There are only 15 ships, not that it matters really as you cannot see outside of them so who cares what you fly really.\n\nAs a sci-fi fan, space based anything, and the old Elite when I was a kid, I cannot help think this is a great idea, poorly realised.  Nothing except for the graphics / sound seem to have updated since the very first Elite, despite games, gamers and the whole world having evolved and now expect a lot more content.","August 17, 2015","false","90.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

DLC is "extra content" that is just that: extra. Maybe DLC some custom ships, or even better; build your own starport. Yes, thats right, pick your system and get constructing. You manage your markets, you set up missions for stock you need to produce your weapons, ships ecetra... skys the limit on this one. But something that pretty much takes the base game and improves the actual gameplay experiance shouldn't be DLC.

If you ignore my advice and try this game, you will spend essentially all of your 'play' time crossing the vastness of space. This space is accurately depicted as empty and devoid of interest. You will learn to detest manually decelarating out of hyperspace travel--a lengthy, boring process. You will curse the number of pointless waypoints in even the simplest mission, as each waypoint involves a manually-intensive decelaration that destroys ten minutes if done well or deposits you  years of travel--literally--from your waypoint if you are inattentive. Never mind that any technology that could produce space travel would surely produce technology to automate it. If you must throw away your limited lifespan travelling from one part of empty space to another, at least do so in a game that is less annoying, like Eve. In Eve, at least you don't have to waste ten minutes at every waypoint. I do not recommend Eve, it's a ridiculous waste of time due to the space travel. But this game is 100 times worse than Eve.

There happened to be a space station that was the destination of a random courier mission I picked up...apparently this system had some noteriety to STAY AWAY because of the prohibitive in-game travel time.\n\nanywho, I found there was really not a whole lot of fun going on...I've played many action space shooters, some with more balance towards action vs simulation, and vice versa...this one seems to have the mechanics nailed down, but jeez, there just isnt really much to do.\n\nIn the first 24 hours doing what I think the game intendes the player to do in that time span (find your way, start upgrading your ships/parts, do some missions, explore a little bit), I think I encountered maybe 5 engagements with AI ships...no engagements with other player ships.\n\n"Exploration" has a big feeling to it, but IT...IS...BORING!!  seriously, you pick a destination, you jump to the system...you get within a certain range then throttle back, then you go to your inner system desitnation which can take really log or really short depending on the inner system desitnation proximity to your entry point...hold your scanner out like you're going pee, once your done you move on.  No aliens, no pirates, scanning gives you some system/planet data that you can sell at the next station...zippy :|\n\nSo I figured I'd try mining some materials, cuz that was said to be in the game....and man, was it ever BORING!! like sheesh i have to spend 2 hours grinding to get a meager amount of materials, which are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to haul in so it's like banging your head against a drum and expecting to get smarter\n\nAnd that's it really...having access to the planets themselves to land and check things out would be a great add...oh, but for the priveledge of what seems to be a logical feature for this kind of game...i gotta shell out another 70 bucks...yeah, no.\n\nThe game is beautiful to look at, almost majestic.  UI is delicous, everything is smooth looking, sounding, and feeling.  Definitely get yourself a flight stick if you want to play this game with any efficiency.\n\nAll that said, I wont recommend this game until it comes way down in price, and includes their distastefully expensive DLC, which seems to be where the fun is at.  Right now, you're paying for a gorgeous tech demo filled with a whole lot of nothing.","December 27, 2015","false","24.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

My opinion (and it is just an opinion) is if you like jumping right in to the action, this game is not for you.  For me the unnecessarily steep learning curve and grind-mission = credit design is a bit of a snooze fest.  When you first start out, your ship is terrible and cannot compete with the ships of players who don't have jobs, and who've been able to dedicate the ridiculous amount of time it takes to earn credits and buy better ships.  They kill noobs (like me) quick and the game is not fun enough to bother getting past noob status.  I found it not immersive enough to hook me with a "romantic lone space explorer vibe" either.  Not nearly as disappointing as Eve Online, but not worth the space on my HD either.  I wish I could find a space sim that did not punish players with poor controls, boring grind-missions, and other people.  Wow, I just read that and suddenly feel very anti-social.  I guess avoiding others is what drew me to a space sim in the first place!  And yes, I've tried playing solo and the other two problems are still there - poor controls and boring grind-missions.

While there's a lot of merit, this game suffers from the unecessarily uneventful travel times to do ... anything really. The combat is fun, nd the game certainly nails immersion but ultimately lacks content especially for its original price tag. Sure, there are a ton of systems, but they don't really offer much. The lack of diversity of anomalies left me feeling like I paid for a demo.\n\nAnother problem was that since the activities were kinda dull, the fairly long grind required to get better ships is excruciating. It's possible that by the time you've afforded your dream ship, you've grown tired of the activities you wanted to use it for anyway.\n\nI did enjoy the game for a while ( though requiring music to get me through traveling around eventually as it got dull fast ) and it might be a great game to pick up if you want a reasonably immersive game to pretty much live in for a while. That said if you're not willing to spend a LOT of your spare time just traveling around on your way to more eventful activities Id advise you just skip this game. If your gaming time is very limited, it's probably going to prove too time consuming if you like a wide variety.","January 24","false","40.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aarkthedragon/recommended/359320/","aarkthedragon","AarkTheDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aarkthedragon/","104 products in account","Elite has a lot of flaws. There's a lot of grinding, a lot of emptiness, a lot of just staring at your screen not doing anything while you fly to your destination, the in-game tutorials are lacking, major content updates thus far are months apart and add a lot of width but not a lot of depth to the game, and over time it can become quite expensive, controls are less-than intuitive until you make binding changes, griefers are a known issue in Open Play since it's all unrestricted PvP, social aspects in-game are lacking, and to top it all of it punishes mistakes pretty harshly.\n\nElite is not a game for everybody and has a pretty specific niche appeal. To be honest you either love it, or you hate it. There isn't a lot of in-between with Elite, and unfortunately words in a Steam review can not accurately explain the complexity and subtleties of this game, so you'd really need to go out and look up gameplay videos or streams and just watch the game be played.\n\nAll that said, I love Elite to death. It's unique, it's massive, it's engaging, and I can spend hours just flying around taking in the gorgeous sights. It's relaxing, and yet can be extremely intense at times. The simulation of the galaxy is highly accurate and in fact I have made numerous time-lapse videos showing off planets orbiting each other, the rotation of a planet from its surface, the burning gasses swirling around a brown dwarf, and much more. There's a lot of subtle things added in to Elite that you don't even realize unless you're looking for them, and that leaves a lot of things to be discovered. One of my favorite things is that it makes you feel insignificant: you aren't the star of the show, you're just an average joe the 34th century trying to make a living, and the world and stories go on with or without you.\n\nThe player-made groups are also a major part of Elite. There's no integrated grouping or "guild" system, so players are forced to seek out groups on their own, and when they do the results are fantastic. You get groups like the Fuel Rats who dedicate themselves to assisting players who have run out of fuel by travelling to them and giving them enough to get to safety. Numerous player-run activities like the Distant Worlds expeditions that see dozens of players all travelling across the galaxy together, or the Buckyball Racing Club which sets up races for players to win prizes in, or the newer Demolition Derbies that are being organized where players land on planets and drive their SRV's around in a crater like bumper cars. And then you have all the fan-made things like Radio Sidewinder, which plays sci-fi music and general popular songs while adding in custom advertisements for various products, ships, services, groups, and other things in Elite.\n\nNaturally I should also mention that Elite isn't done being updated yet either. Once per year a paid expansion will come out that will add more content to the game. Horizons (Season 2) has seen landing on airless planets, and will see a character creator, craft/loot, multi-person crews, ship-launched fighters, and more. Eventually we will be able to land on inhabited earth-like worlds with full scale cities and populated by NPC's, as well as be able to get out of our ships and engage in FPS combat on foot. The scope of Elite is enormous.\n\nElite is just as much a community as it is a game, and while I wish everybody could find as much enjoyment out of it as I have, like I said it just isn't for everybody. If you need fast-paced action, with easy to learn controls and mechanics, and loads of depth in your game, then look somewhere else, because you won't find that here.\n\nI'd highly recommend reading my 5-star (at time of writing this review) guide to picking up Elite if you aren't sure:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462723534\n\nFly safe, Commanders  o7","February 11","true","900.4"," 44 of 78 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","44","78","2","4"

The space is huge but extremely empty, you can explore new systems with worlds and stars that will all look the exact same as you've already seen and devs charge you 60 bucks to look at rocks from closer, which somehow feels even emptier than space.\nMissions are just as empty, they all consist of bringing that to that and maybe blow up a couple ships, and the great majority if not all of them will be blocked to you in the beginning leaving the bounty hunting grinding as your only real choice to proceed in the game.\nPvP combat is actually pretty fun but even in the CQC mode it's still extremely based on grinding all day to get better equipment and use it outmanuver your opponent, and in the main game you will be lucky if you get to blow up a ship that isn't an NPC with a bounty.\nPlayer interaction is also minimal, you can't even trade with other players. Game actually encourages you to play solo mode as you will be able to keep all the bounties for yourself, or carry around your cargo with only having to worry about the odd pirate NPC tryng to derail you and make you lose a couple seconds from the great Anaconda quest.\nThe ship HUD is amazing, that coupled with all the pretty lights you see at space stations is the real reason why this game became somewhat popular but it's definitely not worth the price, thank god I only wasted 12 euros","December 16, 2015","false","34.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TastyChance/recommended/359320/","TastyChance","Chance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TastyChance/","167 products in account","Where do I start? I've been playing Elite Dangerous since around May of 2015 and have invested around 490 hours into the game (there is an ingame counter considering it wasn't always on steam). I truly love the game but as time goes on I'm very rapidly falling out of love with it for two reasons really.\n\nThe first reason is the developers. Frontier has made something so incredible with Elite Dangerous and just how amazing the game is but when you look at what they've accomplished from the time the game was "released" back in December of 2014, you'll see why I am hesitant to recommend this game. From Alpha to release the game was stuffed with content updates but when release came around, the real updates stopped. Sure they put out regular "updates" now but what you don't realize is that a lot of these updates are simply re-skins of the same tasks that need to be done over and over again until you get your next ship. Many people (including myself) enjoy the game immensely because we can make our own path but at the end of the day there are so many paths to make because of how unbalanced the game really is. Certain careers are much more profitable than others which leads to a massive buildup of player population doing one thing. When that happens, they try to nerf that thing but end up making it worse and once they do fix it the next big thing pops up and the cycle continues. Anyways, I could go on for days about random things that bug me about Elite but I'll sum it up:\n\ntl;dr: Elite's devs don't fix any of the major broken ♥♥♥♥ and just keep adding more grinding to the game that already has too much of it.\n\nThe second reason that I've fallen out of love with Elite is the community. At first glance, they seem like a ton of nice guys that love to help each other out but if you spend a little bit of time on the forums you'll quickly find out that isn't how it is at all. There are two major groups within the community. We have the "carebears" or "forum dads" group which is filled with PvE-centric players that have a combined amount of self entitlement whose mass could give a neutron star a run for its money. On the other hand, we have PvP centric players or the "griefers" that enjoy killing others which are the minority of players. Carebears hate griefers because they enjoy killing other people and often whine to Frontier to try and make it harder to kill people. You'll often see insane suggestions on the forums such as "when one player kills another the player that killed the other needs to have his save reset". These suggestions are often the result of being killed in Open mode in a shieldless ship. That brings me to my next point. There are three modes within Elite Dangerous. There is Open mode in which you will meet all sorts of people that could be friendly or out to murder you, private groups where you can play with your friends or a bunch of carebears, and solo mode which allows you to play solely with NPCs. What ends up happening is players that have no desire to PvP play in open mode and when a player goes to kill them, they combat log by ending the process or pulling their ethernet cable out. Whilst this is openly called an exploit by Frontier, no one is banned for it or punished and it happens daily. Another form of combat logging is opening the menu, waiting for a 15 second timer, and logging to the main menu. This method would be impossible if Frontier had the slightest clue how to listen to their players and made the timer reset everytime a player is attacked but well they just aren't that bright. In addition to combat loggers, the game is also plagued by cheaters. Given that Elite runs on a p2p connection with no anti-cheat, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that you run into cheaters. However, you probably wouldn't expect that once again, Frontier doesn't do anything to punish them. The most a hacker has been punished was a 3 day ban after a repeated offense and bragging about it. However, month long and permanent bans have been given out for "harrassment" when some players entered a private group that didn't like pvp and killed some of those players. Frontier's clear bias towards the pve community has created a large divide between the two and in turn a toxic environment on the forums. The moderators on the forums censor anyone that doesn't agree with them and their decisions are often overturned because they were straight up wrong. Bug reports are often ignored for extended periods of time and although the support team is incredibly kind, they are extremely limited in how they can help you which is a shame as they are the only good people at Frontier.\n\nI'm bored of writing this damn review but I just want people to know that if you get this game it will be fun for a little bit but don't get too involved in the community and don't expect much from the devs or you will be disappointed. The game is being driven into the ground by poor development choices and the community is being run by people that believe in a safe space for online gaming. If that's your cup of tea, you're probably too stupid to understand this anyways.\n\nSide note: Silk's ego is bigger than the combined amount of features that Frontier has promised that have never come. That's HUGEEEEE","May 10","false","460.7"," 142 of 264 people (54%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","54","142","264","12","15"

The universe in which it takes place, its scope, its character, are all quite engaging.  Aside from a handful of glitches, it's a beautiful game on even my modest hardware.  I just can't shake the feeling of tedium and lack of immersion.  There are huge expanses of time which could be occupied researching some sort of whispered lore or negotiating dealings with various seedy personalities en route to the distant reaches of a rogue starsystem-- instead, there are a few shreds of mythology to grasp at and some disemobdied names vaguely attached to political strongpersons who we're instructed to care about, with the occasional loose-cannon-with-a-price-on-his-head thrown in for good measure.  There's no real weight to the universe, despite its size-- There's really nothing unique about any of the locations, and once you've mined/bounty-hunted/interdicted/scanned/cargo-scooped, you soon feel as if you've done it all.  It leaves you feeling lonely, and not in a frontier sort of way.  I'm not saying it's a bad game, but most of it takes place in your imagination when that doesn't need or seemingly want to be the case.  The Horizons expansion seems promising, but the fact that it's essentially a new game purchase seems to render the original Elite: Dangerous obsolete without an obvious reason why other than YOUSHOULDPAYFORTHISOTHERTHING.","December 16, 2015","false","54.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I paid $59.99 when this game launched with a bunch of different promises (when I say launched, I mean when the BETA was available) . Turns out, some of the promises were cut from the final game (Due to funding issues, which at the time was understandable) and is now being resold in an expansion, which is also $59.99 (although a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ discount for owners of the game).\n\nFun part: The expansion comes with the base game, thus new players get the entire package for $59.99 whereas older players are essentially paying around $120 ($105 with the ♥♥♥♥ discount). That's a pretty ♥♥♥♥ed business practice when it comes to customer loyalty. Not to mention the expansion isn't coming with everything right away, rather, it's an over priced season pass with content that should have been in the original game.\n\nNow, I'm not mad about them selling the expansion with content that was supposed to be in the base game since Frontier saw some financial issues. However, with the growing popularity of the game, the price point is utter ♥♥♥♥. ESPECIALLY since it ♥♥♥♥s over older players. We have to pay $60 for the same game again, with some added features, new players get an invisible discount since they didn't purchase the base game.\n\nPeople defending this are saying MMOs do the same thing. You're right, but even then most good MMOs don't charge full game price for their expansion, and if they did, the content is immediate and very extensive (whereas Horizons is neither), doesn't ♥♥♥♥ over current players and favor new ones (which Horizons does). Not to mention when I purchased the game (only late last year) the game was advertised as both singleplayer and multiplayer, not full on MMO focus nonsense.\n\n\nHonestly the game isn't bad, if a bit bland in a lot of parts (would suggest getting it on sale if you MUST own it) but you're better off getting Horizons for the same price with the full game, which I was not warned would be a thing.\n\n♥♥♥♥ Frontier\nThe game is okay, otherwise.","December 16, 2015","false","48.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Like scouting mining sites for mineral deposits and making money off that.  Or invading territory as a Merc.  But it's just driving around and looking at rocks.  Then someone told me I'd have to pay $50.00  for the expansion.  Not 10, not 20, not 40, but $50.  But if I hadn't bought it at release it would be $50 and include the expansion.

Why would spacecraft have to handle like aircraft???\nWhen I've gone into play this game this blew my mind, sure I've played pleanty of space sims and flight sims but in a frictionless (well I'll avoid going into physics too much) environment why would a space craft have the same directional limitations as aircraft? When piloting a ship this means that you have to constantly pitch and roll, this works for aircraft due to being designed for atmospheric flight and having to generate lift, but in space you dont need to worry about lift...\n\nI cant see any reason why the YAW is so gimped. I do think it would enhance the players ability to pilot these ships if they put more power into the ships YAW (turning on the Y-axis for those in the uk).\n\nFor this reason alone I'm really bugged by the ships controles, and I find it hard to get comfortable with just about any set up... which I'm really sad about because for me thats a major thing, and I really really looked foreward to giving this game a go... that asside I think for missioning, it would be nice to have an autopilot option... this is not sensible later on in the game unless you'd like to run into situations without any idea of what to expect, but early on it would really help orrient the new players to the game... far more than what the tutorials do.\n\npeople may dissagree with me and I accept that, there are some people who wont think about the issues of barely being able have blanced thrust on all 6 degrees of freedom and people who wont think about a new players experience. but for me I do think that these are issues that will cause me not to play even as good as it looks... if there ever look at sorting this out I will happily change my mind because everything else looks awesome!  I love customisable ships and I love the idea of open space. Even if they brought in just one ship that covers some of these points that would make a difference in my oppinion... but seriously... resistance on YAW??? what are the lateral thrusters compensating for that the vetral and dorsal thrusters arent?","December 17, 2015","false","11.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I don't even remember that weekend...\n\nTL/WR2: I NEVER preorder anything. But I preordered the expansion for this...\n\nIt's a space game about space ships blowing up other space ships. If you think it looks cool, and you don't mind spending a little bit of time researching a few things on how to play, get it. It appears more complex at first than it really is, once you've got a couple of hours in (and have learned how to do everything you need to) you'll love it.\n\nSome people say there's nothing to do, I say they have no imagination. It's a sandbox, you won't have your hand held while you follow a set story. You make your own story, in a fantastic looking universe, with lots of stuff to trade/shoot/blow up/steal/mine/attack/support/fight...\n\nEDIT: FYI: I bought the game on 23rd September 2015... 13 days ago at the time of writing this... Call it two weeks... 2 weeks, 63 hours... That's more time than I've spent working. I've not been sleeping much... I haven't even played any other games recently, just this. The only reason I'm writing this edit to my review now, is because I can't play the game right now... The servers are offline while they upgrade to the latest update...\n\nEDIT 2: Steam doesn't actually show all the hours I've played. Due to a Steam beta bug (mouse cursor getting stuck in menus), I've been forced to play the game through it's own launcher without using Steam for the last couple of weeks... So you can probably add another 50 or 60 hours ontop of what ever steam is showing.\n\nThe steam bug is fixed now, but I keep forgetting to launch it through steam and have been using the keyboard shortcut I created instead...\n\nEDIT 3: It's the 15th of December. The Horizons expansion has just been released.\n\nI preordered it, so will be playing later tonight and will update my review accordingly in the next few days.

If you're a normal person with a job and responsibility you won't have time for this game.  There's just not enough gratification for small bursts of play.\nDog fighting is fun but its not a reliable way to make money. Mostly the game just turns into space trucker SIM 2015.  Buy cargo - travel for 20 minutes- deliver cargo - buy more cargo - fly 20 minutes- deliver cargo.  Rinse and repeat.   Traveling is supposed to be part of the fun.  You travel and random anomolies pop up.  This concept really drew me to the game.  The problem is I'm usually traveling to deliver some valuable cargo and these anomolies either lead to combat, in which case I may die and lose my cargo, or they lead to debris you can pick up in which case I can't because my cargo bay is already full.  The game has a lot of neat things. It's very exciting the first time you warp, its very exciting the first time you barely escape a fight with your life, its very exciting the first time you dock your ship, so on and so on, BUT its not exciting the Millionth time you do it.\nLastly, I have to mention the price of this game.  $60 is simply too much for this game.  This is a tripple A game price tag and I don't feel like I got tripple A quality game.  The most obvious example of this is the fact that when you view the ingame tutorials, it actually minimizes the game and takes you to youtube.   Aside from destroying any immersion you may be feeling, its just down right cheap.  To make matters worse, when you grit your teeth and watch the videos, you quickly realize that all of these videos are catered to players with joy sticks.  I found myself abandoning those videos and just looking for player made one instead.\nThe game also just feels so lonely.  Lots of NPCs floating around and I see players too, but we never interact, except for calling each other names at the space ports while we wait in line to park.( I'm not making that up. Once I was nearly out of fuel and two jack asses were taking up the only landing pads and refusing to move while a line of us were waiting.)\nIn the end the game might make some improvements and be worthy of its insane price tag, but until then the price needs to come down to about $30 dollars.  If you want a space sandbox with a great atmosphere and you have LOTS of time to kill or if you're just a hardcore space sim enthusiast this might be the game for you, everyone else however, stay away!","April 12, 2015","false","13.0"," 87 of 160 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","87","160","3","2"

Not great. Not terrible. The most apt description of Elite: dangerous is that it is a mile wide and an inch deep. This is spot on.\n\nThe game is still to this day -- nearly a year after launch, full of minor annoyances that can occasionaly make it a pain in the neck to have fun with.\n\nPreviously, I had a system that was running an Nvidia GPU, but now that I have switched over to a radeon it has become unplayable due to a bug that has been apparently known for months wherein my framerates drop to below 5 in "supercruise". Since this is the main form of navigation in the game, it is difficult to do anything when the framerate is this low. I have been told that this is a problem stemming from the gpu drivers and is not the fault of Frontier Developments. Either way, it is a major problem.\n\nOverall: 5/10\nWith the brand new and just as shallow expansion that cost a rather large sum I must say that the game itself could be improved and, most of all, the developer could take another look at how to develop and market expansions. This is not to say that I've had no fun at all in Elite: Dangerous, the immersion really suits sim-heads and the like if you have a HOTAS and Track-IR.\n\nAddendum: It has been made apparent that the horizons "expansion" is now labled as a season pass. For considerably less money than when it was only a DLC. Nice business models these companies have today. The people who have some faith get dicked, and the people that wait are rewarded with far cheaper pricing. I had faith in FDev, but it's gone, along with all my faith in any kickstarter programs. AVOID like the plague.

Im fine with charging for DLC, but onlywhen its a reasionable price and isnt stand alone from your origional install.

With beautiful visuals and equally fitting sound design.\n\nI have to say though, if you have a friend who has this game, ask them if you can try it out first. In the event that it isn't your thing, its difficult to get to grips with the gameplay, jump into the utterly huge setting, get a taste of what is out there and earn enough money to advance your ship and equipment far enough to enjoy the game fully in under 2 hours. (i.e the time it takes for the chance of a refund to be lost). This game requires you to sink a lot of time and patience into it to get the full enjoyment out of it, and believe me, you WILL lose your ship and you WILL lose a lot of money at times. But the game is fair and forgiving when it comes to post-destruction and you will make the money back.\nIt is definitely worth the full price you pay, but if you can pick it up in a sale, then all the better.\n\nSure it can seem quite empty, but it is a space sim, and to be honest - space is pretty damn empty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/candytripn/recommended/359320/","candytripn","Candytripn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/candytripn/","145 products in account","I had really high hopes for this game. To me it seemed like an evolution of the almighty Freelancer. I was hoping for a larger, more indepth version of the Discovery Freelancer community, but sadly, thats not what you get. Sure.. what the game does well, it does very well. The feel of emptiness in space, the amazing graphics, the incredible ammount fo controls   that are greatly enhanced with voice control along with a hots and rudder system.\n\nSadly though, the game is empty... really really empty. Ok, I know.. space is empty, but thats not what I mean. I mean feature wise. We have millions upon millions of stars and systems to explore. Sounds great, until you realize the exploring simple means flying into a system, pushing a button, looking at the map, and if there's one of a handful of planet types, you fly to them and push another button, if not, you zip off to the system. Once there, yep.. push your button, then move on. After a bit, its really nothing but the same think over and over.. A very slow and slick looking "clicker" game.\n\nI decided to fly back and give trading and piracy a try. Back in discovery Freelancer. Wow, heavy rp, massive interaction and narrow excapes made even playing a boring space truker exciting. Here, not so much. Trading consists of simply click item, launch, point towards a dot and click button, point to another dot, click button, land and click item. thats it. After awhile, with no interaction from others and only mild nagging if anything from npcs, I felt like I was playinga  really slick and slow "clicker" game.\n\nOk, so combat must be fun. We'll, yeah.. it is, at first. The same way that fighting only npcs in a fighter, fps or moba is. You hone your skills, you get to where you're ready, then you head off to... um, more npcs. Good luck finding anyone. this place is huge. Sure you can scour the forums, find groups and hope to get somewhere where you get some interaction, but whats the point of playing 90% of an online game, offline!\n\n\nThen lastly, comes the announcement. Hey, this empty ♥♥♥ unfinished game is about to get better. Great news! New features, new combat, planetary landings... all for the low low price of another $60! plus more to come for only another low low price of $60! WTF!?! I get that massive expansions deserve some compensation, ala World of Warcraft, but minor content patches need to be just that, patches! I got this game under tthe impression that new content would be added, not charged for, and certainly not at the price of a AAA game, when the original feels completely unfinished!\n\nI have never felt so ripped off with a game before. Yes, I have over 200 hours in... did I get my money's worth? No.. I don't think so. Spending 150 of those hours just slowly clicking away while watching netflix in hopes that I might explore something new or exciting is not worthwhile gameplay, and I imagine many many of those hours where simply falling asleep. Fully exploring a large binary system can take over an hour.. and 55 minutes of that is simply going afk while you're pointing in a straight line. Only 5 minutes is spent actually doing anything, and 4 of those is just simplying pointing at a dot when you're close enough. One minute us used for holding down your scanner and checking the map. Some gameplay.\n\nMaybe if its on heavy discount..  (as of this its $14.84, but even that seems too much considering you need another $60 to access another half of the game that should've been included) you could pick it up, but honestly.. unless you're looking for a fancy interactive screen saver to glance at once in a while while you watch netflix, dont bother.","November 26, 2015","false","210.6"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","1"

Confused yet? Well this 'season' of expansions, Horizons, contains the base game. So if you bought this game, too bad, sucks for you because you're spending a lot more money than people who have only just become interested. Also,  at the time of writing, that's all Horizons contains. So they're making existing players pay a lot of money for the game they already own + one feature and an unspecified list of promised features. I don't think I'll be buying that without a major price reduction. There is a slight, emphasis on slight, loyalty bonus. This is not good enough. Next year it will be the same thing. A new expansion off the back of one semi-complete feature, a promise of good things to come and then an exploitation of the fanbase as they try and shift more units of the game.","December 30, 2015","false","38.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

You'll spend the majority of your time visiting websites to find out whats expected of you.\n\nYou'll also constantly be given missions (particularly assasinations) that are WAY beyond your capabilities, requring you to fight multiple enemies in substantially more powerful ships, and requiring equipment that you simply don't have (such as frameshift interdictors).\n\nAnd of course, player characters will destroy newbies without provocation, one-hit-killing them with vastly superior firepower - although this is an issue with any game that allows general PvP, so it isn't a criticism of the game itself (although it would be nice to see people discouraged from picking on noobs).\n\nIf you're willing to spend the time researching the details of every possible mission type online before you play, then this will be less of an issue. If you plan on only trading, that also would be fine. But there is a distinct lack of in-game tutorials on performing some of the most interesting mission types, which brings the game down significantly for time-poor players who don't have the opportunity to work it out over multiple failed missions.\n\nIf it wasn't for the completely unsupported learning curve, this review would be quite positive. If this is addressed in the future, I'd immediately switch my vote.","January 16","false","60.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graefawks/recommended/359320/","graefawks","Grae Fawks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graefawks/","243 products in account","I'm conflicted on how I feel about Elite Dangerous as a whole. At first I thought I had found the perfect game, especially given my love of the genre. You can appriciate the amount of time and effort that had gone in to making it within your first 5 minutes of playtime, great visuals and not to mention the overabundance of great sounds that emanate from your cockpit in any given situation, truely they are fantastic. The feeling I had when I dropped out of hypercruise for the first time and saw a star zoom in to view in front of me, witnessing light getting distorted around a black hole, even observing our Solar System after working my way up for a Sol Permit... there was a lot that amazed me to begin with.\n\nI did everything I could to get my credits up, (about 3-4 ways to earn cash, so a MASSIVE grind) and finally had enough to buy an Anaconda. After this, the game kind of trailed off. No matter, I'll wait for season 2 as it's going to add plane... wait, season 2 isn't included? Oh, in this DLC culture we have accepted, I'm suppose... wait HOW MUCH? If only I could replicate the joy and excitement I got from my first 10 hours of gameplay, I probably would still be playing this on a daily basis. Instead I feel ripped off that I need to pay Frontier £40-50 every yearly release (season) until the final (there are 10 planned!) to get the complete game.\n\nThe first Season that I own is empty and desolute after the first few hours and you would have seen/done mostly everything the game has to offer. I stuck with it however (130 hours) on the hope that the updates would add more to the game, and to grind my way to the biggest ship which was a goal I had set from the start. I'm betting the second season (Horizons) will be the same this time next year. It just seems to be shady business to me, to offer only 1/10 of the game each year and expecting the consumer to pay the full cost of the game each time.\n\nIf they had charged circa £10 for Horizons as an add on, and the same price for each subsequent season, yes I would of paid this gladly and continued my support even though I feel the game is sparce and empty at the moment. Frontier however, have decided to re-release the entire game each year with the DLC built in for the standard £40-50, while continuing to offer the old defunct season on the store to maximise their profits. I calculate that to be near enough £500 for the entire game, which is riduculous.\n\nRather than writing an entire review which mirrors all of the negative ones below, I'll just say this. Frontier have picked the wrong business model, and Star Citizen will be my prefered Space game from now on. This is unfortunate as Elite had a lot of promise and has a fantastic framework to build on, but I can see it being cancelled long before they get to Season 10 if they carry on as they are. Planetary landings? Perhaps they should have made sure there was more to do than just land and ride around on a SRV for 5 minutes before getting bored - especially for an extra £40. You only have to look at the sales for Horizons and compare them to Elite Dangerous to see I'm not the only one who feels this way.","January 26","false","140.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Its gorgeous, its space, its our galaxy. Idealy this game could help make every nerds dream come true. Admittedly i havent put too much time into this game but thats only because the play sessions require too much of my time... and another glaring issue that ill get to in a minute.\n\nSadly i cannot recommend this game. I paid full price for the original game with the understanding that content would steadily stream and continue to enhance the gameplay. Little did anybody know that their 'Alpha' was the finished game and all subsequent content would be bundled into cute little "Rover" packages and we'd be charged another 60 dollar premium to get it. Following that clever idea they decided it would be cool to let new players buy the expansion for 60 bucks and also get the content that i had to pay 60 to get. Explain to me how i shouldnt feel cheated out of my money?\n\nAnd finally for me, the cherry on top was a mission i accepted the other night. There was no indication that the mission could potentially chain off into other missions. There was no marker stating that the mission was for Horizons only. The game gleefully dispatched a mission that once completed turned into a mission that requires content from Horizions to be played.. only, i dont have Horizons.\n\nThe game is now uninstalled. Out of genuine disgust with the development team i implore you to spend your money on something else.\n\nIf you simply cannot resist, i suggest you wait until every expansion has been made then you can pay 60 bucks to get it all. However by then it still may just be an empty shell of a beautiful game.","January 27","false","46.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vgn/recommended/359320/","vgn","Knowledge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vgn/","427 products in account","If you haven't bought the game, I'll fill you in on why I've given it a thumbs down even after playing it for hundreds of hours.\n\n1.  When you start off the game, there is no explanation about what you are to do.  You don't uncover this.  There is no mission briefing.  You don't customize your ship and then join some alliance battle against the evil tyrinoids.  You are just able to go to a bulletin board and are presented with the following options...\n\nA.  Take these items to this starbase/planet base.  I'll give you some money.\nB.   Take this secret message to this starbase/planet base.  Don't get scanned.  I'll give you some money.\nC.  Go kill this guy in this sector.  I'll give you some money.\nD.  Go find me an item.  I'll give you some money.\nE.  (Rarely) Go destroy something for me.\n\nChoose an option and off you go.  The game's physics are good, and the game engine is decent.  You have a lot of variety in the way you can control your ship.  Move vertical as well as horizontal, employ yaw, and zoom forward and backward.  It's like most any space flight sim, except (And this is important) that here you will turn incredibly slow.  "But hey man, this is space, shouldn't you be able to fire your thrusters and quickly spin on your axis to point the opposite direction?" Nope.  Not here...  By DESIGN you turn really slow.  You CAN rotate and then pitch up or down to speed it up slightly, but it's still very slow and annoying; especially in combat.  We might as well be flying bi-planes in WWI, because that's the flight model.  Even when you have flight-assist turned off, your ship still slows down after you use boost.  Why?  While you can do a bunch of fancy things, like use your vertical rockets, yaw/pitch, and turbo boost to move things along, it's all purposely cumbersome to make up for the developer's inability to construct a combat system that would be (A) Fun (B) In Space.\n\n2.  When you decide on where you want to go (Via a couple decent vector maps that are easy to understand and use), and you leave the starbase you are at, you will point your ship at a dot in space, maximum thrust, and when you leave mass lock (Usually ten seconds) you can then engage your frameshift (warp) drive.\n\nUnfortunately, you do not just warp to the system you are pointed at.  Instead, you have to jump to each star-system along the way.  For instance, to take the 2 boxes of tea to the starbase in Rygel 3, you'll need to make 8 jumps.\n\nEach time you stop at a jump, inexplicably you appear on a direct course towards a star.  So if you don't immediately steer out of the way, you'll crash out of warp, and start cooking.  Every single time.  EVERY TIME.  Eight jumps, eight stars you have to steer away from.  Zzz...\n\nSo, each time you are in a system, you have to fly away from the star so you don't overheat, and then can warm up your frameshift drive for another jump.  This whole exercise takes about 30 seconds.  Eight stops + 30 seconds.  4 minutes.  Remember that...  We're at 4 minutes.\n\nNow, each time you reach a star, one of two events take place.\n\n1.  Someone will radio you a message that says, "Finally, I found you, follow me, I have important information for you."\n2.  Someone will radio you a message that says,  "There you are, I've been waiting for you, all that tasty cargo."\n\nApparently pirates in space are waiting around to rob you of two boxes of tea.  These messages are not varied much, and happen all the time.  Every star you run across, you get one or the other, or both, or (If you've accepted a lot of missions) a whole bunch of them that say the same thing from different people.\n\nIf you follow the first guy, he basically exits warp, and invites you to stop and talk to him.  You fly for about 5 minutes to his location.  (9 minutes total now)  When you get to him, he just tells you that he'll give you some cash to take the Tea to a different station. Why did he ask you to follow him?  He could have just sent you the message when he sent you the greeting.  Dumb.  So you wasted five minutes.  You then blow another 30 seconds engaging the frameshift drive.  9.5 minutes.\n\nNow, at the second planet, you get to play the Interdiction game. Effectively, a tunnel has formed in front of you. It is moving all over the screen, and your job is to follow it with your reticle, so that it times out, and you escape.  Otherwise, you can power down, or be forced, and enter space with a pirate who wants you to dump your cargo or die.\n\nIn most situations, either your frame shift drive will be cooling down for a few minutes while this guy attacks you with everything he has, or you'll be mass interrupted, which slows your frame shift drive warmup down.  So you fight.\n\n3.  Combat...  This is pretty much what you'd expect.  You have beam weapons, missiles, frag cannons, mines, and a host of counter measures.  Imagine playing a First Person Shooter.  Imagine if the enemy was always behind you, shooting you in the back, but instead of being able to turn around and shoot back, you turn so slowly that the enemy is easily able to run behind you and shoot you in the back more.  So only after doing a few cartwheels, and a barrelroll can you get the guy in your sites to fire at him a couple times before he's behind you again.  Eventually it breaks down into whoever has the best countermeasures and shields, and has less to do with any kind of flight skill.  If you are underpowered in your armaments (Which is the case early on) you'll run into guys you can't even penetrate their shields.  And they'll destroy you.  So you'll start back at the last starbase you were at, and likely go into debt paying for your new ship.\n\nCombat can last a long time because it takes forever to line up your enemy.  Figure ten to twenty minutes per fight unless you get blown apart early on or the enemy is really weak.  Let's say 5.5 minutes average.  You've now blown 15 minutes of your life, to start the game over.\n\nAlso, ammunition costs money.  Let's say you defeat the enemy and you earn $18,000 for the kill bounty.  (Not every kill gives you a reward.)  Each torpedo in your torpedo launcher (Which can carry an amazing 2 torpedos in ammo total) is $15,000.  So to restock two of them, the maximum you can carry.  $30,000.  Great...    Also, some weapons are totally worthless.  I won't get into that.\n\n4.  You arrive at the sector where your starbase is.  It's a dot on the map.  You might fly to it in about 3-5 minutes.  But there are plenty of starbases far away, that you'll point your frameshift drive at it, and fly in a straight line for 20 minutes to 1.5 hours.  That's right.  You can watch an entire 90 minute movie before you get there.  Fun!\n\n5.  You finally dock, and they give you some cash.  Your selection of new missions can be found above in section 1.  Same missions.  You will repeat the above over and over again.  Over and over and over again...\n\n6.   Horizons gives you a rover that you can drive around on a planet surface.  There is nothing there.   Literally.  But you can drive around.  Sometimes you can pick up rocks that you can't sell, but you can waste even more time turning them into something to give you a small edge in combat once.  There is supposed to be more stuff coming out, I guess.\n\nSo you might ask, why then did you play this game so much?  I fell for all the praise this game has gotten, over finding black-holes (Boring black space in front of you, not even the lens effect going on), landing at star bases with their own factions and events (Same five models used over and over again.) and combat being great.  It's not.\n\nIt's just not fun.  It could be.  But right now, it isn't.","February 8","false","243.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","8"

If there is 100 people working for frontier 90 of them are working with marketing, 1 is counting the cash 1 is hell i dont now what there doing they are not doing anything.\nI have a news for you marketing genius , start praying for star citizen not launching because if they do you will be all out of jobs so start sending your resume to the used car dealer shops and EA games you can only milk the cow for a limited time, start listening to the players if you want a future im taking my money elsewhere and i recomend you to do the same.\n","December 18, 2015","false","472.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

But it isn't what i signed up for, really. It's plagued with a lot of little problems and design flaws that add up to make a frustrating experience. flying through space feels like playing red light green light as you are constantly having to veer away from suns, and braking for your destinations always seems to be futile. i'm always having to flee for my life for stupid little piddly stuff that doesn't make sense, like accidentally shooting someone from the wrong faction, or not entering a station correctly resulting in DEATH. i feel like the game has a long way to go, and a lot of different ways to grow, and instead of developing the game in a logical way, we get a stapled on planetary landing update that we have to pay for.\n\nseriously i understand people want planetary landings, but let's be honest, who cares? being able to land on a planet isn't going to make the game feel deeper, nor make the game better, it's just going to add planets i can land on. it just doesn't make sense to me. add more mechanics, update annoying stuff, make the netcode work better, half the time i get disconnected from my friends... but no, instead we get planetary landings.\n\nall of that AND i have to pay for updates. PLUS they bring out updates for xbox one FIRST it seems, and if you are on the mailing list, you get to hear about all the cool new stuff xbox players are getting a month in advance. i feel like this game does everything it can to make you feel stupid for buying it. bought it to late? oh well, i guess you'll be paying for future updates. bought it too early? welp looks like the game is $20 for new players too bad so sad. and if you just want to buy the game? if you just want to buy the game normally like all games are bought, it's like 200 or so dollars. ♥♥♥♥ right off. this isn't star citizen and if it was i wouldn't buy it.\n\ni understand it was said before that updates would cost extra, but i don't think this game makes much effort advertising the fact that what you are buying is *temporary*. you are paying for a certain amount of content, and then after that, you are paying more if you want more content, which would be fine, if the game felt finished.\n\non an unrelated note, if current players feel i have been unfair, and want to send me a message, please direct your message directly into the trashbin. i don't care. if you like the game, cool, but you aren't going to convince me that i shouldn't feel cheated. i WILL be deleting offensive comments.","December 21, 2015","false","74.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

They were going to add in planetary landings, crafting, multi-crew ships, ect. with Horizons. But Frontier decided to screw over their existing playerbase and charge them an addition $45 for Horizons. (And thats with the "loyalty discount" that they already get) FD essentially made their existing players have to pay extra for some features in a game they had already bought. And new players would only have to pay $60 for Elite Dangerous AND Horizons. This game could get a thumbs up from me, but with incompetent developers like Frontier who want to suck in money and don't care about their players, I have to give it a thumbs down.

Likely, the only way you'd encounter anything aside from painstakingly, manually flying from system to system trading with little threat of pirates or bounty hunters (especially since the option of "solo mode" is always available to players with large bounties or wishing to farm gold the easy way) is if you dedicate hours of gold farming that makes WoW look like half-minute hero.\n\nThis game is a pretty face, and that's all it is, really. The breathtaking cockpits (I won't compliment how space looks since it gets very old, very fast, as planets, stations and stars look static) only serve to distract you from the fact that this is an ocean with the depth of a puddle.\n\nLet me explain in detail.\n\nThe cockpit would be extremely immersive, combat would be nice and satisfying, smuggling and trading under the noose of pirates and bounty hunters also has the potential to make this game an excellent sci-fi, open-world thriller. But they are only pinches of sand in the empty sandbox that is Elite: Dangerous.\n\nTo explain, let's start with the main objective of this game: growing huge amounts of gold. There are a great many ways to do this, in theory, but in practice there are only a handful.\n\n1. The main way of making cash, trading and accepting trading bulletins. This is the only thing you can really do effectively in your starter ship, the sidewinder. You can't fight or explore. You farm gold over huge periods of time by manually plotting courses, locking onto systems, jumping twice, traveling for ten minutes to the nearest station, then doing the celebrated docking/landing procedure for the ten millionth time.\n\nTo go on a brief tangent, docking and landing is celebrated for being difficult and exciting. However, it is the most boring thing in the game. It is routine and consumes huge amounts of time via waiting to park, finding your parking spot, landing, shuttling down, and reverse. Doing it the tenth time makes it lose its immersiveness.\n\nAnyway, that entire procedure of a simple trip to a neighboring system takes about 20 minutes. There are MANY, many systems. This game does a good job of showing space in all its vastness and completeness. There are likely tens of thousands of very simple and similar stars. And to get anywhere, you need to repeat this 20 minute process (mercifully, if you do not need fuel you are not required to go to a docking bay and can jump to the next system), every single time. And to spice things up, pirates and bounty hunters are either non-existant or a non-threat. The only way that they can successfully interdict you and kill you before you can jump is if they are A) in a ship they have grinded hundreds of hours to get, like the Anaconda, and you are in a much smaller ship, or B) you try to fight them and take too long getting steamrolled that you forget to safely jump away. As a sidewinder with mildly upgraded shields I was able to brawl and take a beating from a much larger heavy fighter, then jump away with 3% hull. I should have died for many reasons, including the fact that I brawled him for a length of time instead of jumping and that my ship was slow and defenseless, but I didn't. It is hard to die in Elite:Dangerous unless you go around picking fights.\n\n2. Picking fights is unprofitable. Repairs, reloads, refuels, et cetera cost lots of gold. It is hard to farm gold as a pirate or bounty hunter because often their cargo or bounties are small and insignificant. Also, clever players who hate fun (most) will simply go into solo mode if they have high bounties or high-risk illegal tender so they can safely traverse space until they reach their destination or get to safety. Most people kill for the satisfaction of actually doing something fun: combat. This game disapproves of fun. Fun will give you no gold. You cannot have fun unless you do your part for the motherland and spend 100+ hours farming with static trade routes that never change, with a cockpit that you never, ever leave in the entire duration of the game, so you can get big boy ships required to be able to kill an enemy in time, which also cost loads of gold to repair and rearm. You will go bankrupt swiftly by having fun.\n\n3. Exploration. I'll make this brief. Everything is boring. Black holes are boring, they don't do anything interesting. Watch a video of someone doing cartwheels around the galactic core's black hole for reference. Planets are extra boring as they share models. Stars are usually just different colors of the rainbow. You make money visiting these places which take many, many hours getting to and mapping. Not much is automatic. You are the machine.\n\nThis game is boring don't buy it\n\n","June 22, 2015","false","8.0"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nenacu/recommended/359320/","Nenacu","nenacu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nenacu/","62 products in account","Let me start off this review by telling you something flat out. This is NOT a game for those that absolutely must have a plot where you are the central character. You will not find that here. You are incredibly tiny and completely incidental in the grand scheme of things. Then again, you are one pilot in a galactic sandbox. What more can you expect?\n\nWhat you will find here is interstellar travel and exploration, space pirates, bounties to hunt, mining to be done, and cargo to haul for profit. You start off with a very basic ship and what you do from then on is entirely up to you. If you like the idea of cruising through space, seeing the majesty and wonder that is space while living out your freelance space commander fantasy, this is a worthy purchase.\n\nOne thing that this game does not do is hold your hand. It is highly recommended that you go through each and every one of the training tutorials to get accustomed to the controls and to wet your feet with space travel. The best rule to remember? There is no up or down in space. It will help you to learn to be able to think of movement in three dimensions without the constraint of gravity. Progression can, at times, be a bit slow when you can't find a well paying mission within the scope of what you want to do, but there will usually be at least something to push you to another system for the cost of a refuel. Fuel is another important thing to always keep in mind. You CAN get yourself stranded in space if you are not careful about the course you plot or if you forget to spend the pittance to top your engines off at each port you dock in. Space pirates are far from lazy and will occasionally just pull you out of FTL travel for kicks, giggles, and target practice regardless of what your reputation in the system is.\n\nAll that said, these challenges are enjoyable to me. In an age of gaming where one is often railroaded through tutorials and plot in a game that can top up at 40hrs, I find it refreshing that I can spend just as much time being space UPS to buy that next ship that will give me a bigger cargo hold. My eventual goal? To make a pilgrimage to the galactic center and then to sol. After that? I'll see about making sol my home system and collect all the ships. Hours upon hours of content before me.\n\nI do not lie when I say that I can sink the majority of a day into this game without even noticing the passing of time. My personal favorite way to play is in a private session with my friends and wingmates. There is an in game comm system linked to any mic you use that will connect you to wingmates, your party members, so there is no need for an additional chat client unless you'd rather use something else. However, just as there are many ways to make a living in space, there are just as many ways to play the game. Open mode will put you in the galaxy with everybody else. Solo mode puts you in by yourself, but fear not. There are NPC ships everywhere should you decide to become a bounty hunter or a pirate yourself. They are not dumb in a dogfight either. Create a group with your friends, and you can play in a solo style with them specifically.\n\nSo, If what I have said here interests you in the game, I highly suggest picking it up. If you are the kind of person that gets enjoyment out of following the plot of a game, this is likely not for you.","April 27, 2015","true","845.3"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

I clocked in a bit over 60 hours on it, which for a man my age with a full time job, kids, wife and other responsibilities, that's a big chunk of investment. It was everything I wanted it to be in a space sim... well... it wasn't yet, but it was going to be! I believed the hype. I bought in early and waited for my just desserts. Nope. All those cool features they said they would have in the game have been repackaged into an entirely new $60 game called Elite Dangerous Horizons. Keep in mind. The two games are functionally identical. The only difference is one has planetary landings and the other does not. Keep in mind also, the one that does not (this one) was promised to have it to the early backers of the kickstarter and not revealed as a completely separate game buy for more than the initial purchase. Screw you Frontier. You took my money and my time, both of which I hold of value.","December 16, 2015","false","71.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

The rest of the game is purely a waste of time if you're trying to progress. Of course you'll have to get past the incredibly difficult learning curve of what is the button configuration screen, and you'll literally spend hours of your time configuring your keybinds. Once you've accomplished this, you'll literally jump to the next star system and find a ringed planet to kill random NPCs or players for bounty rewards. Welcome to the grind of buying better and better ships until... well, you grind more bounties until you have so many credits you quit, ultimately realizing that you beat the game long long ago - when you finished configuring your keybinds.\n\nBounties are the most lucrative way of obtaining currency in the game, with credits being the primary facilitator of progression. Yes there are other ways, but you'll get 1/10th the reward. If you want to slave away in a game and accomplish nothing, guess what, there is a less monotonous way - working at mc donalds.\n\nTo the developer - congratulations on playing your consumers by releasing an unfinished game - and then releasing an expansion for full retail price that would otherwise provide a much more immersive experience.

Something is crazy with the launcher authentication. If you've bought an E:D "season pass" direct through Frontier Developments, and are running the Steam version of the game (and haven't bought Horizons on Steam), then Elite: Dangerous only loads the base game. UNLESS you run EDlauncher.exe as Administrator, in which case it will THEN load the E:D Horizons launcher. Seems like Frontier Developments can't decide whether they'd really appreciate it if you paid twice for Horizons or not. I'm sure some small percentage of people who've already bought season passes directly from Frontier Developments will pay for this again through Steam, and I suppose that is just bad luck for them, caveat emptor, etc.\n\nOf course, I'd like to review the actual game itself, but because I own an AMD R9-295X2 graphics card, I can't play for more than ~5 minutes before Elite: Dangerous (and/or Horizons) crashes my entire system into the ground so bad it requires a hard reset.\n\nExcellent job, Frontier Developments! On top of things as usual! Now shut up, use my money, and fix these problems so the game is playable again already! It's only been sometime over _four_months_ since the update to 1.4.1 absolutely shattered performance across the board for all AMD users, so gosh, why would anyone be anxious about things as they stand now?\n\nThe core idea for Elite: Dangerous is brilliant! I just WISH I was able to play the game I've paid a season pass for, with decent performance, without it crashing all the time. The absolute bottom line is that I simply can't recommend this game to anyone I want to remain friends with - until Frontier Developments gets over these technical difficulties. :( If Frontier Developments fix these problems; this review will defintely change too.","December 17, 2015","false","148.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zemdan/recommended/359320/","zemdan","Zemdan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zemdan/","275 products in account","I'll start by saying that my steam hours played aren't accurate. I've been playing since beta and probably have around 200 hours play time and I’ve experienced everything the game has to offer.\n\nYou're probably thinking, how can you not recommend a game if you managed to spend 200+ hours on it. Well, I kept playing in the hopes that the endgame would make it worth it, spoilers: There is no endgame. I really regret spending this much time on the game, as I wasn't having fun and I really wish I could get those hours back.\n\nI also need to say that this review is talking primarily about solo play, as that is the mode I mainly play. I was pretty annoyed when frontier turned around a month before release and said they weren't going to include a proper single player mode in the game, but oh well, can't be changed now.\n\nNow about the game and my problems with it.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that you can see everything this game has to offer in about 10 hours, after that you are just repeating your actions. The main activities in this game include: combat, trading, exploring and mining.\n\nCombat\nThe combat in this game is a lot of fun when you first start it. You can make money through combat via bounty hunting or going to combat zones, but the only proper way of making a decent amount of money through combat is via bounty hunting at Resource Extraction Sites. Now I need to add here how silly this is. The name Resource Extraction Site would imply that it is a place primarily for mining. Think again. Its only use in the game is for bounty hunting, which involves waiting for endless waves of pirates to spawn and die by your hand rewarding you with a sum of money depending on the class and rank of the ship. The design here is just stupid. You can drop out anywhere in a planetary ring and mine free of pirates, so why would you ever go to a RES to mine. It's really counter intuitive.\n\nAll combat actually involves is aiming the nose of your ship at a target and holding down the trigger until they're dead. There's no complexity or challenge to it and it gets old quite quickly. This is not helped by the limited choice of weapons. There are currently only two types of weapon in the game: Kinetic (multicannon, single-shot cannon, missiles, mines and railguns) and Energy weapons (pulse, beam, and burst lasers and plasma accelerators). Now when it comes down to weapon choice, there's really only one type of weapon worth using and that’s the laser weapons, as they deal a steady amount of damage and don't use ammo. Missiles and mines are completely useless and are never used, as you can only carry a miniscule amount of ammo and would end up returning to a station to reload every 5 minutes. But the weapon you use really doesn't matter, there's no difference between any of them, they all get the job done at a similar rate. Some actual weapon diversity would be nice, but currently all the weapons are pretty dull, offer no spectacular visuals and they all perform about the same (apart from missiles and mines).\n\nTrading\nTrading is the best way of making money in the game and IMO, it's really poorly implemented. It is incredibly boring and involves: Start at station, buy goods, jump to other system, dock at station, sell goods, repeat. There is no variance in that process, you carry on doing that until you have enough money. There is also no way of finding a good trade route in game. The only way to do this is via third party tools. A trade computer would be nice, but currently there is no indication of the price of goods in neighbouring systems, so you must rely on third party tools which in my opinion is unacceptable.\n\nExploring\nI think I had the most fun in this game while exploring. This is mainly due to my interest in space, so seeing all the different astronomical bodies was pretty cool. But all exploring really comes down to is: jump to system, perform a system scan, see if there’s anything good, if there is scan, otherwise jump to next system. The process of scanning is just point the nose of your ship at a small white dot until it says scan complete, it is not fun or interactive in any way. This process gets very repetitive, very quickly and the payout per hour is really bad, probably one of the worst paying professions in the game time wise.\n\nMining\nMining has changed, but I still find it incredibly boring and I find myself questioning some design decisions. Like why in the year 3300 am I launching huge 1 ton drones which are made to do their work and then explode. Why not just have a drone module which launches, refuels and reuses drones. Currently you have to fill up your cargo hold with drones that are doomed to explode. This seems so wasteful to me. This also applies to scanning the metal content of asteroids, launch a drone at it, get results and then the drone blows up. Why not just give us a scanner. We have light spectroscopy and x-ray scanning in 2015, we can already scan the metal content of things, I can't believe that this technology hasn't advanced in over a thousand years and we're forced to rely on suicide drones to do our work.\n\nAnyway, mining involves pointing nose at an asteroid, shooting mining lasers at rock, launching suicide drones to pick up rocks for 5 minutes and then explode. It takes quite a while to make a reasonable amount of money and is pretty boring.\n\n\nThose are the main ways of making money and my problems with them, I do however have other reasons why I do not recommend this game.\n\nOne of these is missions. They are incredibly tedious and pay out pennies in comparison to other professions. The only use of missions in the game is to rank up with a meaningless faction which grants no benefits other than access to certain ships.\n\nThis brings me on to my next point, the ships. All of the ships in the game are the same essentially. Bigger ships just let you hold more weapons and/or cargo. You can achieve everything there is to do in the game in one of the cheapest 4 ships. The largest ship currently is the Anaconda at around 140m in length. The size has no bearing however, as all of the ships fly in the same way and act as fighters, pointing the nose of the ship at an enemy and shooting. It would make more sense to me if the larger ships behaved fundamentally different and made the switch to more broadside centric combat.\n\nIt would be nice to see some unique ships specific to certain professions as well. I'll try and think of some examples, maybe a big hulking mining ship which uses reusable mining drones and can extract more resources from rocks. Or an exploration ship which maybe rather than having a cockpit per say, has the pilot sat in the heart of the ship watching a screen with a projection of what’s going on outside, to eliminate the danger of a canopy breach. There's no imagination with the current ships.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is customization. Currently it’s non-existent unless you pay real money. I play this as a solo game, I expect to be able to customize how my dashboard or ship looks. It would be unacceptable if you had to pay Bethesda real money to change the clothes you wear in skyrim, so why should I pay to change how my ship looks. I understand Frontier have to make money some way, but why is every single customization option a micro transaction. I want to change my ships appearance with in game funds.\n\nThat about concludes by problems with the game. I would love to talk more, but the word limit is harsh. It really is a mile wide and an inch deep though. I've played horizons and it changes nothing IMO, it only makes the game another mile wider and no deeper.\n\nThis game has so much potential, and it really pains me to see it so mediocre, I’m hoping by highlighting the problems it can be improved.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text. I hope it was helpful :)","December 14, 2015","false","30.5"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

This one made me step up and say something.\n\nGame looks great. Graphics wise that is. That is pretty much the pros about this title.....the graphics. Most players will get to space trucking for a few hours, get attacked by a pirate, flee or fight the pirate until space police arrive, then deliver space cargo, get paid space monies. I dont know why, but ED feels like those extremely dry vampire or ganster text only games we used to play on facebook. Now we have graphics that show you getting from point A to point B. The game lacks any real excitment or better content than space trucking. The game claims that players affect the galaxy economy, but when in the game, you dont feel like you have affected any economy output whatsoever.\n\nOH BOY. Lets not forget Horizons.........the game that Frontier wanted you to buy for 59.99. Where you get to break atmostphere and land on a rock planet and.... and ...and ....play ATV dunebuggy simulator? This game was all hype and very dispointing. Full disclosure tho: I do not have Horizons. I can only repeat the vomit I have seen on youtube videos. Like any game purchase, you should check this game out on youtube as well (the base game ED i mean). Try to avoid trailers and get some videos from actual players.\n\nYes, I have almost 100 hours playing this game, but most of it was all in hope. HOPE that the game had some sort of end in mind. Maybe even a slight story? There was nothing of the sort in those hours. I tried looking for better content in the missions, which are broken btw. Yeah BROKEN!!!!!! (I hope someone from Frontier reads that. FUDGING BROKEN). Example: Many have posted this one before. You accecpt a mission to find a person in a certain system. You go to system only to find out that he is not where the mission said he'd be. Here is the catch; you only have 20 minutes to find him, and it takes 2-3 mintues to travel to different areas in that system. Time runs out before you find him. I think I have found said person 0/6 times I have tried anyway.\n\nConclusion. Dont buy this game if you are looking for depth and something that grabs you from the screen to keep you playing like most other games. If you are hoping for that, and buy this game anyway, then you'll be like the rest of us who bought it sucking on a poop flavored lolly pop. I told my friends that after I had over 100 hours I would tell them yay or nay to buy this title. Unfortunetly I forgot and failed to warn them. (another reason why I feel like I need to write this) In direct result of my failure, 2-3 of my friends now have bought this title and probably hate me for not warning them. I can't recommend this game to anyone. Unless Frontier pulls their heads out of their butts, and gives the game REAL content FOR WHAT WE ALREADY PAID FOR, only then will I change my review. Other than that, I will never EVER pay money again to a frontier game. Unless they do change their business practices and give players what they already paid for.","February 16","false","86.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

The ships look as though they were designed by 5 year olds first learning shapes. Here is a square. Put guns on it and we can call it a ship. Here is a triangle, put guns on it and lets call it a ship.\n\nMeeting people is near impossible. Even in the starting areas chat is dead.

It's the only way that travel within a system can be done, and it takes far too long to get anywhere. You will spend the vast majority of your game time in supercruise mode, either flying in a straight line in empty space to get to your destination, or flying as slowly as possible while trying to get events to spawn in front of you. I have a good deal of fun when I'm not in supercruise mode, but the game forces you to spend a lot of time doing nothing, and waiting for something to happen.\n\nTo make supercruise worse, the game requires you to slow down to almost "not moving at all" speeds in order to drop out of supercruise mode and into an event or a normal-flying space. If you don't slow down while you approach "whatever it is that you're trying to do", you'll fly right past it and have to turn around, slow down, and try again. So it takes you eight minutes of flying in a straight line (with nothing happening while you're doing this) to get to where you want to go, and then you have slow down to a crawl while you approach your target. You then wait for a minute or two (every single time you do this) until you're close enough to enter the event/instance. Traveling in this game is--to be completely honest--the worst possible of way of traveling that I have ever encountered.\n\nSpace is empty. There is nothing interesting in supercruise mode, outside of the background scene of that system. You'll see a lot of black, empty space. You won't be dodging explosions, or asteroids, or space stations, or dead ships while you're supercruising. You will literally spend your time flying in a straight line, doing nothing, while waiting for a number on the screen to count down to 1. When you realize that it took an entire second for "15,000" to become "14,999", and another full second for "14,999" to become "14,998", you'll want to kill yourself. And this is how the game handles travel.\n\nEvents spawn randomly in front of you while you're supercruising. They show up as a target on your screen, with a name attached to it (such as "Weak Signal", "Strong Signal", "Salvagable Wreck", and so on). You slow down, crawl up to it, and then drop out of supercruise mode in order to enter the instanced event and see what it is. If you were flying at the slowest possible speed, you can enter the event instantly. If you were flying fast, though, it'll take a minute or two of "crawling up to it" before you can enter it. Because events are handled in this way, it aids in making space seem empty and uninteresting. You will never, ever encounter something cool while flying in supercruise mode--which, again, will eat up most of your time.\n\nEven though a system might have a billion inhabitants, you'll have no idea where they are. There may only be a single, small space station in this system, with only two or three ships flying in supercruise mode, and maybe a single ship at the station. The developers make it seem like you own the only ship in all of existance.\n\nThe game has its strong points as well, but I don't think they make up for just how horribly dull and off-putting the majority of your game time is spent.","October 22, 2015","false","271.9"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

I'll start off by saying don't buy this game but I'll state that I liked it. The problem I have is more with the company and their marketing greed strategy than it is with the game. First off if you buy Horizons expansion you get this game for free. If you bought this game in the first year and supported them, you have to pay full price for the expansion as well (60$). I feel kind of ripped off by them. First off they were using our money to make an expansion they were going to charge us for and not adding any content to this game. It looks great, it flys great but they never added anything. It'd be like playing a single player game with no levels, content, and a few training bots flying around to shoot. It feels like they never finished this game and just put it out there to reep in money, and that's exactly what they're doing with Horizons now. Tricking people into buying that and then using that money to create some other game instead of making something out of this empty shell of a game. If you like practing landing in a beautiful space station all day, this is your game. if you want a reason to play a game look elsewhere. This thing is hollow and get's old fast.

I have an older machine and it runs smooth as ice even though I don't "meet requirements".  The graphics are clean and traveling the VAST universe is mind boggling...at first.  Then you quickly realize that there is almost nothing to do.  That being said, I still enjoyed myself for a while and appreciate that there is a "Solo Mode" for avoiding griefers and player piracy.  Flying feels great and the learning curve is fun and interesting if you don't mind researching with a little bit of google.\nI got VERY excited when Fronteir announced Horizons and the ability to land on planets and roam around in a little planet rover. My excitement quickly burned away as if It had hit the atmosphere of a planet too quickly when I learned that completely new players would get both the original & the expansion for $60.  I had paid $60 originally for the game and now they are asking me to pay an additional $45 for Horizons?  Putting me over $100 for the full game that I have to pony up while new players have to shell out almost half that.  I can understand Frontier needing to cover development costs and such and I would be happy to pay $10-15 upgrade cost to get Horizons but thier current pricing feels like I am being punished for buying their game earlier than others.  This is extremely questionable business practice. Therefor: Thumbs Down.   There is too little content  for a full-price game and very dissapointing getting dinged another $45 for the ability to land/drive on atmo-less planets.\n\nAlso, a note on your ships in game:  There are only a handful of ships and the ship design is BORING for 90% of them and only OK for the remaining.  You have one wedge-shaped ship to start with, then upgrade to a slightly different shaped wedge that is a little bit bigger.  After grinding away at repetetive missions/bounties you might upgrade to another, slightly larger, wedge shaped ship with nooks and angles!    But never fear,  you will notice when you land on stations there is a paintshop.  At least you can give your space-wedge a fancy paint job, right? You will be enraged to learn to get ANY paint job for a ship you have to shell out $5 to Frontier for a pack of 5 colors for ONE model of ship.  Otherwise you will have stock coloring on your ship for all time.  $60 for a full game with 1/3 the gameplay features of a AAA title?  $100+ if I bought the original Elite: Dangerous and want to upgrade to Horizons?   And you're going to ding me $5 per paint job per boring ship?!  Is it too much to ask for two or three different paint designs by default or to find/buy them ingame?   These guys are greedy.\n\n\nEdit: Wurds.","January 30","false","149.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/recommended/359320/","saltydaveiv","david / BNET: OceansAbove#1601","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/","338 products in account","This is going to be a very long and detailed review with all the positives and a lot negatives (yes, there are many, even if the verdict is RECOMMENDED), I try to organize it and will put a TLDR on the end of it for those of you who aren't interested in short novels. I had a long review that became really outdated with the recent changes, alas I give you a new one.\n\nElite: Dangerous, isn't only a game. It's a dream of David Braben who basicly invented the genre with the original Elite decades ago and made it's sequel totally alone. Roughly 20+ years later here we are with today's technological possibilities, and we have Elite: Dangerous. But why should you care about this, as a customer?\n\nDevelopmentED while is not marked as an early access title, it basicly is and is not. It is a complete, polished and very enjoyable game that however, is getting vastly expanded over time through yearly season passes. These deliver content partially exclusive to the specific season's owners, such as Horizons allows us to land on planets and do missions etc. there in a ground vehicle, but each patch also includes new content and general, often huge changes to the entire game, such as mission, reputation systems, more outfitting options etc. for free. Yearly season passes sure sound scary, and I won't lie it is an investment, but I'm telling you abot 99,9% of my playtime is spent with content aviable for everyone with the base game, so don't be discouraged to give it shot if you are looking for the best spaceship simulator even at full price. The current full price is half of what it used to be, and it was worth it even back then!\n\nAudiovisual ExperienceCombined with the complex, yet easy to handle and very enjoyable ship controls (see this later), the audiovisual experience, the feeling of being really there in your own spaceship is the biggest strenght of Elite. Elite players are propably so used to it some would disagree, but for You who don't own it yet, it's the first thing you'll experience and it is a massive, professional and over the top quality thing in this aspect. The holographic interface's every centimeter is filled up with actual important and useful information, the ship AI always keeps you informed, and when you try to look around it's just breathtaking how detailed everything is while you know, everything has it's own use, it's not "fake cool looking bunch of buttons you can't use". Graphically it is incredible, not only when you are looking at your ship from the inside, but even more so when you look out the windshield (ok there is no wind in space, move on). Elite's sandbox is our Milky Way galaxy with it's own ~400 billion (400,000,000,000) star systems, each with their own planets, stations and views. Most of the galaxy is uninhabited, but even the civilization bubble offers you enough places to visit and play in for a lifetime, and while it is proceduarally generated (known stars etc. are accurate tho'!) it doesn't suffer from quality issues at all. The feeling of force, physics, the bending and cracking metal, it's basicly flawless with a relatively friendly hardware requirement.\n\nGameplayThis is where things can get problematic. No matter how nice something looks and feels, if the gameplay isn't right, it's toast, right? Well... Elite has a complex issue here. It offers a tremendous quantity of activities that include waging war, being a mercenary, a loyal soldier of whoever you choose, exploring, trading, being a lowlife pirate or ruthless assassin, a miner or with Horizons planetary base infiltrator where you can siege a fortress with the combined ground and air forces of you and your friends. It sounds good, it's not even and either/or choice, you can do it all, you never commit yourself permanently to anything and the gameplay supports all activities with it's own mechanisms to always deliver the professional simulator feeling, first and foremost knowing and managing your ship (later about this).\n\nBut. Elite is a sandbox, and it's not trying to be anything else. You won't find a singleplayer campign here, you aren't the special one saving the galaxy, you are one among others, and your story is what you make up for yourself. You absolutely have to have a goal in mind: a specific ship, being a high ranking officer or a faction, playing a fantasy role. Elite won't give you any goal at all, you must make your own goals and come up with new ones when you achieve it or you'll hate the game. Trust me on this, I swiched between the love/hate feeling more often than any of your ex-es.\n\nThe game's core element is your ship. It's a rather complex beast as you'll discover, and gets even more complicated as you progress to the bigger ones, but worry not - it's an easy to understand, hard to master thing. You have to consider relative weight when you buy a new shield generator, weight also reduces jump range, power consumption and distribution, fuel, creating a hierarchy system of modules to effectively bring out much more from your power generator than you should be able, then learn the flying characteristics of your ship, and so on and so on. The professionalism feeling is most definitly there and it is actually most of the gameplay, not some additional fancy layer. It is overwhelming, but easy to learn and a fantastic experience to master if you are into these kind of things, because you can actually fail. Just like regarding goals, Elite isn't holding your hand at all in real gameplay, though it offers a lot separated training instances and videos.\n\nThe future and today of EliteThis is the big thing about Elite. As I said, this is a dream coming true for David Braben, and as is, it's a high concept game. It is expanded and polished continously with new or remade (for the better or rarely worse), and it's playerbase sometimes act like some religious extremeists when Elite is criticized, while the other half is propably in the hate part of the love/hate cycle and say they are wrong. Both groups are right, and wrong. Buying the core game is a great purchase for everyone interested, but the season passes (we have one, Horizons so far) are investments. I can honestly say I'm upset because it's launching content wasn't something I was interested in and the next bunch of big updates came 6 months later while the pricing model changed twice, getting cheaper and cheaper while I essentially got nothing out of my early adaptation. Should this concern you today? Absolutely not, just keep in mind when future season passes become aviable, yearly. Elite, is great today, even with all it's problems you won't see until you are about 100 hours in already. It is getting even better with time, but this time is a very, very, very long waiting for new stuffs between patches.\n\nElite today is better than it was ever before, but I have to be honest I dropped this game many more times than my balance drunk. Yet here I am putting a huge RECOMMENDD pledge on it, and that has a reason. Because it's that good, only it can become a really repetitive grind if your goal requires big jump in your bank and that can really break your motivation. It is really recommended to pull in a friend with your purchase, exploring everything together is possibly even better than mastering Elite yourself, though solo is a walkable path.  However the galaxy is more alive with faces and voices everywhere, the developers continually (not like patches, actually continually from the end of one starts another instantly) making community goals and evolve the story of the galactic superpowers through politics, ideals, and inevitable conflicts.\n\nIf you are looking for a deep, professional, easy to pick up, hard but enjoyable journey to master spaceship simulator with a huge variety of gameplay activities and open world multiplayer options, 25€ is defintly worth it for Elite Dangerous.\n\nTLDR IN COMMENT BECAUSE OF CHARACTER LIMIT!","June 4","true","275.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","16","26","2","2"

Frontier's latest financials are out at https://www.frontier.co.uk/docs/files/Interims.pdf and, despite an uptick in sales, the company has yet to commit in writing to finishing all 10 planned seasons. What's more, they've cranked up dev work on another title. If you came here hoping to support an "indie" developer and the one game he's been pitching to you, know that you're probably supporting something else that stands excellent chance of draining time and resources away from the completion of THIS game.)\n\n\nPROS: It's pretty and it's about spaceships; Probably the most welcoming environment in online gaming for griefers.\n\nCONS: "Desert Bus" was less of a grind; Hard limit of 32 per instance makes the game less "alive" than Counterstrike; "Prom queen" game (pretty, expensive, shallow as a dried-up puddle); Vast majority of promo film is artist concept and not in-game footage; episodic pricing model that has all the charm of a reverse Ponzi; Developer has no prior experience developing an online game for PC or XBox and it shows; One save slot only for PC version (first MMO I have ever seen with such a limit); possibly the worst gameplay decisions made since Superman 64; Probably the most welcoming environment in online gaming for griefers; Members of the community who are ardent supporters are probably the most Stockholmed I have ever seen in almost 20 years of online gaming.\n\n* * *\n\nI'm only going to expound on the last portion since the rest has been covered capably - the community surrounding this game sucks. They're the single-worst feature of a game brimming with cons, and the single-largest obstacle to proper development. I've played Neverwinter, EvE Online, World of Warcraft... none of their fanboys are anywhere near as asinine or so quick to blame the game's shortcomings on anyone who recognizes any. (For evidence of such, one need not look any further than some of the positive reviews - you know, the ones that gripe about the negative reviews? You've seen 'em.)\n\nI'd only recommend this game if A) you're interested in griefing/countergriefing (hopefully more the former since the two largest groups in Open Play - The Code and East India Company - are dedicated to the concept) and B) if the base game is $5. I don't recommend the DLC at all, unless you're interested in shelling out that much cash to trade a ship for a buggy.\n\nTrust me, I've driven the buggy. It's cool for about 10 minutes. If you're looking for a space sim with trading, fighting, exploration and building that has a fair price, true Newtonian flight (Elite lacks that too) and no pricing gotchas on down the road, check out Evochron Legacy instead.\n\nUnless you just HAVE to bang the prom queen. Then by all means, buy three copies.\n\n(For those who question my time ingame: http://i.imgur.com/y2OYzvP.png )","February 9","false","3.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","17","28","3","12"

We both lost.  10/10 would midair (or midspace?) collision again.\n\nIn all seriousness though this game is strangely addicting.  That collision took place during my first dogfight aside from the training missions and I was about 15 hours of playtime in.  I spent the first 2 hours on the training missions and watching you tube videos about how to play.  So thats 13 hours of me just jumping from system to system exploring and doing trade missions, and I want more.  That's not to say you have to play that way, you can bust out of that first spaceport guns blazing at the first ship you see.\n\nIt's a sandbox game in the truest meaning of the word.  So if the lack of any kind of plot turns you off you and your lack of imagination are wanted elsewhere.\n\nThe controls make it easy to fly (with a joystick).  Although flight is unrealistic in this game as you don't have to counter thrust to overcome intertia (edit: recently learned you simply have to turn off flight assist).  That might be a good thing though as it could cause the game to be far more difficult to play and turn off any casual gamers who might otherwise enjoy it.","April 4, 2015","true","24.9"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","18","30","2","2"

I admit, I had some very negitive first impressions, but I decided to stick with it and keep my mouth shut until I had a better handle on what exactly Elite Dangerious had to offer. Now at 88 hours, with a nice ship, im still dissapointed.\n\nSo lets be fair about this,\n\nPros: Such a pretty game, eyecandy everywhere you look.\nDogfighting is engaging and fun.\nThe ability to customize pretty much every part of your ship is good, a little flat compaired to some games, but adds a tiny bit of much needed depth.\n\nCons: Game mechanics are sickeningly bad, and poorly thought out. Bounty system is rediculious, tedious, and painful. Basically a fury generator.\nAlmost no automation of any kind, expect to fly everywhere, no autopilot.\nFactions are flat, similar, and lack depth.\nGalaxy in general lacks depth.\nMultiplayer seems more like single player co-op than an MMO.\nCant share money or trade with other players(short of ejecting things into space for them to pick up).\nIn order to 'protect the immersion' you wont get any numbers you can really use to make sense of what the systems, weapons and items really do.\nBounty hunting is the only way to make money early on, and the bad mechanics will come back to haunt you. Some fool will fly infront of your lasers, and you will get fined and hunted by the law for it. If you dont pay attention to the red blips attacking you, you will accidentally murder the fool in question, and you will be an outlaw for about a week, a realtime week.\nNPC ships dont follow the same rules as PC ships.\nSo much of the games content is recycled over and over, which makes the game seem flat despite the massive gameworld. One day in, you will have seen all there is to see.\nGame is run by devs who have the audacity to charge for content that should have come with the core game, and stand-alone it. You cant even paint your ship without shelling out $10, that would be acceptable in a F2P model, not acceptable in a paid for game.\n\nHonestly, this game is the worst, most tedious parts of Frontier Elite, none of the good bits, and just very pretty. ONLY improvment over that old, old old FE2 is tracking turrets, really, only thing.\n\nA nice dream and a nice vision, ruined by greed, narrow thinking, lack of content and Devs who have straight out said they dont care about what you, the player, wants. This game is a puddle an inch and a half deep, and 100,000 light years wide. Unless you have endless money, time, and paitence, and a burning love for space sandbox games, I would not buy this game.\n\n4/10 at best, and thats just for the eyecandy.\n\nPS at 200+ hours;\nGame patched to make it more grind, less action.

I don't know if the tutorials are out of date or just incorrect, but at times following the instructions simply does not achieve the result they intend, or any result at all for that matter, and you find yourself having to ESC out of the tutorial or be stuck there indefinatly.\nWhile there is a large manual available from the launcher, it is not immediatly apparent, nor does it flow well as it feels very disjointed and cobbled together.  It is more effective purely as a reference manual for somewhere to go look up something specific when you need it, rather than ' read this and you'll know how to play'.\nNone of the usual 'this is how you work the interface' information is provided in a user friendly manner.\nYou will need to go to youtube and watch numerous videos, all the while being bombarded by advertising for Big Boobed Russian Women, a new ISP, local liquor shops, or, laughably, compeditive games such as EVE (I personally found this the most embarassing for the devs)\nEven the presenter of these videos says 'press the key bound to landing gear' or whatever the function is that he is discussing.  If a player is advanced enough to have already changed the key-bindings, he is probably advanced enough to not need to watch these videos, or at least to know what key he changed it to.  The majority of the viewers have no idea what the default key is and expect the presenter to tell them.  Instead the viewer must return to the game and go searching to find the bindings section and write out all the keys, then go back to continue the video, then back to the game to try what they were just shown.  As I said, very disjointed and unprofessional.\nAll this leaves the casual gamer rather lost, and likly to walk away rather than slogging it out, and doing the hard yards.\nIn my opinion, a game should not be HARD or require such effort just to get started, to succeed and become an ace, yes, but not just to be able to leave the space-station and re-dock.  If I want hours of research just to get the basics, or hours of frustration when things don't function as they say, I would just go back to work, I already get plenty of frustration there, that's not what a GAME is about for me.\nMost, more successful games, provide extensive in-game tutorials/quests/missions to walk you through the basics, which you can of course skip if that is not for you.  These quests/missions give you a feel for the game, so by the time you get into the meat of the game, you are THERE, not just sitting front of your computer pushing buttons.  I acknowledge there are plenty of people that don't like a full introduction and think it a waste of time, but I'm not saying the tutorials should be mandatory.  Most games default to the tutorials, and give the player the option to skip them if they choose.  This has almost become the defacto standard in the industry.\nSo while many games cater for BOTH player types, ELITE seems to specifically, either deliberatly or by poor design, target the later, those who don't want to do a tutorial.\nThe forums are full of new players complaining about the lack of tutorials, who are invariably set upon by existing players who attack them, with the usual 'it wasn't hard for me' or resort to pre-school standard name calling such as 'what a sook' or 'crybaby should run home to momma'.\nWhat these people are missing, and the devs too, is that not everyone is the same, and while some players enjoy the struggle, others have a different deffinition of enjoyment.  Unfortunatly only the devotees seem to be catered for here, which is a real shame as the game has huge potential, great visuals, deep story line, etc, but a large portion of the market is being put off by the lack of accessibility.","January 13","false","4.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As for the combat quest where you go kill some target good luck finding your target you will likely spend hours searching for one target and you will consistently run into much more dangerous pirates(groups) while you are searching. Also there are no alternate views just the cockpit view which makes landing and combat somewhat annoying. After a while(a week or two) the quest no longer feel rewarding.

Let me first stress never to buy a non finished game. Wether you see games as an art form or a way to pass some time, one should be able to enjoy a game for what it is. As a long time player of games like privateer, freelancer or the more arcade style wing commanders i was hoping for an fun experience. Multiplayer space trade fun with friends.\n\nWhat i got was an unfinished beta some rough edges and bugs that sucks the fun straight out of you’re chest. Flying around for a couple of hours not able to see or find you’re friend sucks.\nDropping out of a multiplayer game and have to restart the whole thing again sucks even harder.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat unforgiving and has a rather steep learning curve. Some will like the challenge and some will be put of by the notion. Fact remains it’s a game not ready for a release and will need quite some polishing. As it stands now it’s defiantly not worth a dime.\n","January 25","false","145.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I bought in to it while it was still BETA. It's honestly awesome how much space there is to fly in. Being able to say I was flying around actual stars that exist was a bragging point for me.\n\nI started out trading, which was extremely boring, but I needed to. I had to get a decent ship. Then I figured out that hunting people at stars and mining areas was more fun and profitable.\n\nThen I realized that's all there really is to do. Either you sit around scanning everyone, waiting for a fight. Or you run cargo. You can also do the missions, which are similar to cargo runs, just lack the freedom of choice of destination.\n\nThe initial shine and warmth of this game wears off fairly quickly. The fact that you're flying around actual space locations becomes meaningless, and you're left with the repetative mission system, boring trade routes, and (most exciting part) dogfights with AI that have trouble landing their shots.\n\nIt's an impressive space simulator. It's a boring game. The future of it, by the way, is locked away as DLC, and even that is lacking.","January 25","false","10.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I admit, I had some very negitive first impressions, but I decided to stick with it and keep my mouth shut until I had a better handle on what exactly Elite Dangerious had to offer. Now at 88 hours, with a nice ship, im still dissapointed.\n\nSo lets be fair about this,\n\nPros: Such a pretty game, eyecandy everywhere you look.\nDogfighting is engaging and fun.\nThe ability to customize pretty much every part of your ship is good, a little flat compaired to some games, but adds a tiny bit of much needed depth.\n\nCons: Game mechanics are sickeningly bad, and poorly thought out. Bounty system is rediculious, tedious, and painful. Basically a fury generator.\nAlmost no automation of any kind, expect to fly everywhere, no autopilot.\nFactions are flat, similar, and lack depth.\nGalaxy in general lacks depth.\nMultiplayer seems more like single player co-op than an MMO.\nCant share money or trade with other players(short of ejecting things into space for them to pick up).\nIn order to 'protect the immersion' you wont get any numbers you can really use to make sense of what the systems, weapons and items really do.\nBounty hunting is the only way to make money early on, and the bad mechanics will come back to haunt you. Some fool will fly infront of your lasers, and you will get fined and hunted by the law for it. If you dont pay attention to the red blips attacking you, you will accidentally murder the fool in question, and you will be an outlaw for about a week, a realtime week.\nNPC ships dont follow the same rules as PC ships.\nSo much of the games content is recycled over and over, which makes the game seem flat despite the massive gameworld. One day in, you will have seen all there is to see.\nGame is run by devs who have the audacity to charge for content that should have come with the core game, and stand-alone it. You cant even paint your ship without shelling out $10, that would be acceptable in a F2P model, not acceptable in a paid for game.\n\nHonestly, this game is the worst, most tedious parts of Frontier Elite, none of the good bits, and just very pretty. ONLY improvment over that old, old old FE2 is tracking turrets, really, only thing.\n\nA nice dream and a nice vision, ruined by greed, narrow thinking, lack of content and Devs who have straight out said they dont care about what you, the player, wants. This game is a puddle an inch and a half deep, and 100,000 light years wide. Unless you have endless money, time, and paitence, and a burning love for space sandbox games, I would not buy this game.\n\n4/10 at best, and thats just for the eyecandy.\n\nPS at 200+ hours;\nGame patched to make it more grind, less action. Im just done.","January 22","false","254.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game is pretty fun for a casual gamer, a very very fun for the hardcore gamer.\n\nb] The Good![/b\n\nThis game is extremely fresh and has a lot of new gameplay mechanics that have been added to the elite series. Combat is really fun and enjoyable and if you're just buying the game for the combat you're probably looking at around 30 to 40 hours of continous gameplay however if you're looking into trading and doing the quest and missions then you're looking at 200+ hours and exploration, combat, upgrading, wishing you had more money, doing assassination mission, dying, dying again, exploring, trying to trade, failing at trading, and so on and so forth. This game is expansive, the galaxy is in a 1:1 ratio and takes several hours to get end to end. There are alot of updates as well (Most recent being the power play) The only problem is that it's addicting...\n\nb] The Medicore[/b\n\nWhile I will wholeheartedly recommened this game, there are some not-so-good features and while I expected some of these thing to be fixed, some of them are just gameplay mechanics that it seems the devs have overlooked.\n\nMy first complaint with the game is the quest/mission system and how certain mission aren't as fluid as others, the transport missions are great if you need some quick cash especially if you go further away from your strating system but the risk doesn't justify the reward, I did 5 Transport mission, all paid around 50,000 CREDITs and I got scanned once, ONCE! and once I got scanned the only thing that happen was a 2137 CREDITs fine, I understand this but it feels cheap money, I really wish I was interdicted once and pulled out of FSD and some pirate just tried to steal my cargo JUST so I could feel like I earnt my 50K, it really feels weird and sort of empty however I do belive this is something that will get added later as it seems the devs are going to try and add more detail in.\n\nMy second complant is with the assassination mission, unlike the previous Elite games you aren't given a time your target will leave a certain station nor are you given a certain place your target maybe or even when the will arrive in another system all your given is one thing and one thing only, which system it will be in. This is really annoying for me as I found my self looking around at any signal source and wasn't even told that the only place to find them was at Unidentified Signal Sources' which the game does not tell you. Again I feel that this is a depth issue and not a game breaking problem, however it is close, I really am waiting for them to add the ability to stalk my enemy and find the right chnace for me to kill them, I also really want the ablity for Federal Security Vessels to come and find me and kill me because I was trying to kill someone. Devs if you're reading this, this needs to be added, stat.\n\nMy Final complant is the lack of detail in the mission/quest screen. I picked up a mission to find trade data for someone and wasn't even told what type of signal I was looking for, this lead to my first hour being me trying to find something and LITTERALY dropping out every chance I get to have a lot around. I didn't get it in the end and this was a problem for me.\n\nb] The Bad![/b\n\nThis is where I would explain to you the arguments against this game, but I can't find any,  the graphics are pretty, the OST is amazing, the SFX and shaders are super, everything feels like it's fitting in place....as long as you have a HOTAS and you are not playing with a mouse and keyboard. I started playing this game with a mouse and keyboard, I played my first 80 minutes of the game with them, then I ran and dug out my entry level thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS that I bought back in '08 (Still make and sell them) I then change my settings and wow! this is so much better. Yes this game is worse WITH a mouse and keyboard and feels VERY clunky with one, please do your self a favour and get the same one I used during this time (Upgrade to the Siatek x55 WAY more expensive) you'll be doing yyourslef a favour.\n\n\nh1] Conclusions[/h1]\n\nThis game is amazing, from the graphics to trading it is simply put mindblowing, it is however let down by lack of detail in mission and the requiement of a HOTAS, however minor these are problems that need adressing BEFORE it's perfect. This game is ONE HUDNRED PERCENT worth the 50 EUROs (40 GBP) that I put down for it and it's probably worth more.\n-74/100\n- LULZ R34CT10N\nA Happy Customer","July 28, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

What a dull, blunt, rusty spearhead they have created.\n\nI have it set to VR High, with supersampling set to 2.0, and it's one of the uglist games on the Vive. Apparently it looks leaps and bounds better on the Rift. Just goes to show what a waste of money this game way. Haven't hated a game I want to love this much in my entire life.\n\nUPDATE 2 - The moderators are now making stuff up. Deleted my comment in which I asked the devs why they weren't deleting the comment from the poster insulting people. So here's my post to the op in response.\n\n"Ok op. You ask, is it worth it after the new content. My answer is that unless you enjoy games that take a lot of time to achieve anything, then probably not.\n\nThe game has its following, for sure. A lot of people love the game.\n\nPersonally, I don't because of the grind. I've barely scratched the game after hundreds of hours.\n\nSome may think that's a good thing. "Wow! That must mean it's a massive game!" Well... yes... it is. Physically massive. I once did a trade run that resulted in 40 minutes of flying uneventfully in a straight line. Wasn't attacked... wasn't even approached.\n\nThis new content gives you more items and interactions, but by all accounts, it doesn't change the parts of the game that I don't find fun.\n\nPeople that are fans of the game will always love the extra content. However, if you're not a fan of the base game, it's highly unlikely you'll enjoy its dlc's."\n\nGo ahead devs... try to delete that!\n\nUPDATE 1 - Just to say some of the below is no longer the case. They changed the game to a dlc rather than a new game. I applaud the devs for that.\n\nWhat I don't agree with now, however, is the censorship on the forums. Someone asked if the game was worth buying after the latest dlc. The majority of comments were saying "no". Then, a fan of the game came along and started insulting the OP.\n\nThe op replied that if these comments are what players of this game were like, he wouldn't bother. I then posted, suggesting the op to ask for a refund if he wasn't happy, and shared that I wasn't happy with my purchase.\n\nA dev then appeared, deleted mine and the op's posts. Their reason? Apparently, we were personally attacking people.\n\nCensorship is a joke on the forum. Pay attention to the reviews, not the heavily moderated and filtered conversations. There's a reason this game is scoring so poorly.\n\nThe game brags that it has billions of star systems. It's just a shame there's so little to do in it.\n\nMy advice. Don't buy the game, not yet at least. It may be better in a few years time, but then, other better games will be released.\n\n--------------\n\nOriginal review\n\nRip off! I supported the developers very early on. My reward for spending my £40? I get to play a broken, boring, shallow game for a year, providing bug reports, feedback, etc.\n\nDo I get the new expansion included? Nope!\n\nAlong comes a brand new customer today with their £40 in hand. They've waited a year, not played the game in a broken state, and not had to put up with such a lack of content. They haven't beta-tested, nor have they had to endure regular crashes.\n\nDo they get the new expansion included? Of course they do!!!\n\nNot only that, but they get all the other previous content as well! So their £40 goes a lot further than mine!\n\nIt was US that were helping you early on in development! I've never known a company to do this, and it's not a surprise that your reviews are demonstrating that now.\n\nNo chance I'm going to give you another £40 just so I can land my ship.\n\nI'll wait 10 years and pick the game up for £10 with the next 4 expansion packs included... maybe.","January 26","false","2.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Wonderfully immersive cockpits and ship behaviour, realistically-feeling travelling system and docking.\nBeautiful graphics and perfect optimalisation. Actually it runs better on ULTRA than on LOW graphics, from some unknown reasons (not complaining here!).\n\nUnfortunately the game feels very empty and tedious. There are 400 billions of star systems, but I'll tell you that there ain't a single unique one.\nThe gameplay is a never-ending grind, you grind money to get enough money to buy the next ship, so you can grind more.\n\nOnce I bought the cobra, I stopped playing because I realised that I'll have to grind through that (largely unfinished, you need to use community tools to find deals) trading, planet scanning, criminal shooting.\nYou're completly free to do what you wish - of course, if you actually manage to find something interesting to do.\n\nPowerplay is a nice idea, but it's very badly implemented.\nWarzones are a stream of constantly spawning red/green ships that fight, the winner is faction with more kills at the end of week. While protection is just spamming of fetch & deliver quests.\n\nAlso, I tried to kill players numerious times. Spent hours flying around war systems - they always logoff or run away by spamming boost. Not cool. Managed to kill one player so far - he has my respect, for engaging in a fair combat and then getting murdered.\n\nMost of the game, actually, feels like massively wasted potential, even though there's definitely a lot of effort put in this game.\n\n\n\nDespite all of this, I still recommend this game. It's a great space simulator (not so much of a game/entertainment though), with immersive ship behaviour and beautiful cockpits that may make you busy for a very long time. It's relaxing and you feel like a little fish in (empty) space, and it's something completly different and new on the market.\n\n\n\nThe game keeps evolving through patches, so lot of this may change, and I definitely believe that it will.\nI will try to play every update they release, and update this review (if I forgot - shout out and annoy me with it).\n\n\n\nUPDATE: This game becomes so much better when you free yourself of the grind. I recently purchased a Clipper which was a ship that I was dreaming of for months. I equipped it just how I wanted it and still got a bucket of credits left. I don't need to grind anymore because money is pointless to me now, and I just do my random business, things that I feel like doing.

Well, if you do nothing but grind for something in the game then yes, but why keep doing it once you get bored?\nThe beauty of this game is just move on to doing something else, and there always is a something else. The devs are working hard to keep updating content so if you fall out of favour with something, leave it a month and go try another aspect of the game and once you get back it will have changed into something new and different, or at least improved.\n\nIs it worth your money?

Now for a space this was as good as it got on steam however since the beginning this game seems to nickle and dime you only short of literally buying currency.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Looks nice\n\n- complex immersive controls\n\n- is an mmo\n\nAnd thats about it. The game is pretty damn large however most of the time it feels empty since other players hardly serve any purpose asside from tagging along with you for hardly any reason since they didn't really create a trading system for player to player transactions. So most will ignore you just trying to grind for more ships. This game has customisation however ALL cosmetic changes are in actual money. Some people maybe ok with this but lets remember the in a game where most people are likely to ignore you the ships really all you have. It's cheap as hell for the devs to not even allow some basic paint jobs to be bought with in game currency. All AI have pretty much the same tactics so learn to kill one you caneasily kill them all. Along with that the quest system is pretty terrible with find ♥♥♥♥ almost impossibe to find without aimlessly picking up specific signals. Honestly before the horizon dlc players could expect expect some real game changing updates but not it seems like the devs are just going to try to squeeze the players for more money EVEN THOUGH THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME WAS $50","December 25, 2015","false","228.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Some people say there is not much left to do in the game and they are wrong. This is a universe of opportunities and gangster activity or organized power play - anything here is possible and you feel so small without having a crazy story line where the player is a mega hero. You know, like other games make the player feel, right? none of this here. Ships are highly configurable and have a lot character. There IS some room for improvement but devs have been adding more content so do not hesitate and BUY. By the way, this is my first flight simulator that I actually trully enjoyed. You will either love or hate it - however if you do love it, you will have thousands of hours worth of fun. OF course, if you are a broke kid with no money, do not ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about the price.

The visual aspects of the game are fantastic. It's very pretty. The controls are great and they feel as if they'd be pretty authentic if I were piloting a real ship (I'm using a Saitek x52 HOTAS). Combat is nice, flying is nice, visuals are nice. Sure.\n\nHere's the problem, there really isn't anything else. It feels empty. Trading is terrible, contracts are worthless, the game feels realy lonely. If I could give it sort of a mixed review symbol, I'd rather use that, but because I spent so much time in it, I decided to give it a thumbs up; just be cautious before purchasing because you might find yourself pretty bored if you don't create content for yourself because there isn't enough content given to you.","June 5, 2015","true","102.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It isn't for people who have to be force-fed content... now, on to the review!!!\n\nI play with friends and meet people in game all the time. It's a good game, but DOES need a bit of polish. If FD starts delivering on things like planetary landing, and fps walk-around stuff, then I'll definitely never put this game down.\n\nI already think that if you know how to entertain yourself and don't rely on a developer that spoon-feeds every single bit of potential that a game has to your baby mouth, then you'll enjoy Elite just fine... as for people who cry about having to ACTUALLY SEE OTHER PLAYERS... well... Elite has Solo and Private Group modes as well.\n\nThe flight/weapon physics in the game are awesome. If you are a bad pilot, even the simplest of encounters can turn deadly. If you are a good pilot, however... well, that's another thing entirely.\n\nThe Power Play is also a GREAT way to meet other players and come together to play Elite in a true multiplayer fashion. Facebook, Reddit, you name it, there are communities of people who ALL want to play the same Power Play pledge that you made... so there's always something to do.\n\nMaking money can be a bit of a grind as of now in E:D. However... I personally don't mind being mostly poor. It tends to fuel a drive when I fly to, you know, not die at the hands of other players.\n\nAnyway... short story long, don't let poorly written, angry "I shouldn't have bought a game that I thought would baby me and let me win all the time" reviews stop you from at least ASKING people who've put some hours in what they really think. Cheers, and maybe I'll see you in game ;)\n\nIn Service to Lady Aisling Duval,\n-CMDR Cole [Razor] Connor, Aisling's Angels","June 8, 2015","true","902.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

But it also isn't a great or even good game. I would say it's mediocre at best. The problem I have is the grind for rank. It's terrible. There is really only two things to do for any kind of decent money. That's either trade or bounty hunt. While bounty hunting is really a lot of fun. How many times can you pew-pew a space ship down before that also gets boring.\n\nTrading is okay...I guess. It allows you to make a decent amount of money in not so short of a time. It's just jumping from one system to the next.\n\nMining is horrible. It's slow, it's boring, it doesn't make that great of money. It isn't bad if you have other things to do, like catchup on a TV show on Netflix or watch the latest YouTube videos. Otherwise don't expect to be engaged by mining.\n\nThe game needs more content.

From WarHead on the Amiga to Independence War; to FSX; to Lockheed Martin Prepar3D; to any of the DCS sims.\n\nSo what makes ED boring?  It's the travel time. Regardless of whether you decide to be a pirate; trader; explorer; bounty hunter or anything else for that matter, the game requires you to travel to in-system star bases which can take up to 10 minutes of staring at blackness.  It's a bit ridiculous when you consider that a jump to a nearby star can be done in seconds!\n\nNow before you go saying "But wait, it's a simulator" I'd remind you that the "simulator" aspects of this game are quite crude compared to say FSX; P3D or DCS A-10C.  These latter sims also require you to perform lengthy travelling but at least in these sims there is something to do specifically in the form of detailed and complex navigation systems; systems that are no where present in ED.  I don't see any nav beacons; waypoints; flight planners; let alone an autopilot.   There's little or no systems monitors; engine startup procedures; engine status; damage control; emergency procedures (particularly considering you get to fly some big ships).\n\nIn all the other sims I mentioned, I can be monitoring all of these systems to pass the time.  So what does ED offer? Some lame arcade-y "interdiction" mechanism that would be better served on a Nintendo system.\n\nED is a sim yes; but compared to FSX; P3D or DCS it's still an arcade game; a boring one at that.\n\nOh and the decision to put new content such as NEW HORIZONS into what is essentially a paid yearly subscription in MMO form is the nail in the coffin for this featureless simulation.","January 14","false","1.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

At first I was in love. I had finally found an open world space exploration game with no rules and a giant universe (preceding no man's sky which I have been dying to play since its announcement) but after only about 15 hours the game lost its touch for me. The exploration aspect is great, although one can only jump from system to system so many times only to see the same exact stars, planets and spaceports over and over. You will lock onto a target and spend up to twenty minutes at full speed approaching it, only to inevitably overshoot your target and spend another 5-10 minutes trying to finally disengage. and then another 5 minutes once out of hyperdrive to finally reach your destination. once your 30 minute trek to a target is complete, you will try to pick up missions that you will also inevitably wait around for and end up realizing that your target is not going to show after countless time is spent searching random signals. You will be excited to upgrade your ship once until you realize that the next ship will cost 3 million credits. Like I said, I loved this game at first and was blown away by the sounds, and just overall realism and freedom in which you had in this vast world, but it became very repetitive and dull very quickly. I really wanted to keep playing but I don't have 1000 hours to waste and get nowhere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seruo/recommended/359320/","Seruo","ImaGe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seruo/","194 products in account","TLDR:\nIf your a  super hardcore space simulation fan then my review is a waste of your time, I'm talking to everyone else that falls into my "generael gamer bucket."\n\nThoughts:\n\nThis game is not meant to be played by casual gamers. It's not meant to be played by even what I would consider your middle of the road gamers. It's meant for the hard core space simulation crowd, I can respect that. I've been fan of the X-3 series for years, (well, except for their latest disaster). But come on, hard on purpose? There is just no reason for it.\n\nThis game is not meant to jump in and play. It's fundementally designed to discourage this time of game play. Hours must be spent understanding aspects of the game before they can be used. Hours must be spent repeating the same manual boring tasks over and over again. Almost no player engagement. It's like playing a game that isn't really designed to be played. It would be hiliarious if it wasn't so sad.\n\nI get so frustrated by simulation games that fall into the fallacy of thinking they must be difficult. "It's a space game! It's got to be hard to do simple things because, you know space!"\n\n-The player has to manually dock every time! "Because space!"\n-The player can't find missions at even starting space stations! "Because space!"\n-The player can't jump to hyperframe because he doesn't meet one of five creteria!" "Because space!"\n-The player has to time his drop out of FTL or he'll blow past his target and spin around in circles like a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to find it. "Because space!"\n\nWait a minute, I have a space craft that can plot a jump route across hundreds of systems and travel faster then light. But it can't drop me out of FTL when I get to the system I want at the right speed and distance? I think you should have let the guy building the navigation program have a couple of extra days so he could add a "stop here" subroutine. Like adding brakes to a car, it seems like a fundemental function you make sure you have before you roll it out. Otherwise you'd just have your averages joes running stop lights, driving off bridges or running over the family dog. It's a simple jump in my opinion from running over the family dog to flying inverted and backwards into a sun. No brakes, are you serious?!?!\n\nAlso, playing with a friend of mind was almost impossible. Most of the time we didn't even show up in the same instances. After a couple of searches we both switched to open game play and still only were in each other's instances a few times. Frustrating and again time wasting.\n\nThe game is visually beautiful. Love and detail went into the design of the cockpits, stations and systems. I can see that love and attention to detail. I only wish that kind of attention was put into the game play and the mechanics, it's a game after all it's mean to be fun, to be enjoyed!\n\nWhat do I think?\n\nTedious, boring and needlessly complicated. But above all a general waste of time.\n\nIf your a super hardcore space simulation this game may be for you. I can see the appeal and I can appreciate what they were trying to go for.\n\nEveryone else? Pass this one up and play Space Engineers or Starmade or something else, ANYTING ELSE. So many great space games that are actually fun to play and engage the player.\n\n","November 29, 2015","false","5.9"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","0"

As an additional kick in the balls, anyone who has NOT bought the game so far is going to be able to get all the content and the original game for $60. But if you've already bought the game, it costs you $105 total. And Frontier is wording it like you are somehow getting a DEAL for already having the game. That's not a loyalty discount, that's called screwing over the people who are already supporting you. What Frontier Developments is basically saying is, don't buy the game. Don't support us. Wait for the expansion to come out, and rely on the idiots to support us so that we can develop it for you, and get it for free.

Open world with a more or less endless galaxy, infinite possibilities, do whatever you like, be whoever you like. Sounds amazing. I was watching youtube videos of different reviews and it looked amazing. When I found the game at 75% discount, I finally purchased it and looked forward to trying it out.\n\nStarted out in the sidewinder, and had good fun figuring out my very own keyboard setup and learning the basics. Initially I thought space looked amazing.\n\nUnfortunately my view of this game cooled off pretty fast.\n\nSome positive reviews point out how this game does a fine job in making you feel small and insignificant. That's true. No choice you make will really impact the game in any significant way. It's completely stripped of any story or characters worth mentioning. There is a story there, but it's just as boring as real life politics, and I quickly stopped caring about it. The fact that I cannot really affect the story in any way is interresting, but not too exciting. Feels like voting in real life. Voting is important, so I do it, but it's not like my vote really shifts real life politics. It's the same in ED, you can align with a faction, but it doesn't really matter. Other than that there are no characters you learn to love and care for.\n\nIn the start, my combat skills wasn't too good, so I more or less gave up and started trading in order to afford better equipment. A tedious few hours of grinding later, I bought a hauler. I had a few minutes of enjoyment flying a new ship with a new nice feel and new sounds. Then I continued flying empty space from station to station grinding more cash. After a while I gave up. It's just too boring, even with the occational interdiction where pirates were trying to steal my cargo.\n\nI switched to doing missions. It didn't pay as well as trading, but at least it was different. At first. The missions I was able to do were more or less the same as trading. Sometimes it's actually exactly the same as when trading, but you simply use a different menu for adding the cargo to your ship and complete the mission. I tried some other missions, but combat was mostly too hard, and it seems the only other mission I could do was getting a canister of some cargo floating in space somewhere, and delivering it at a station. I decided to stick with trading until I could afford a viper and start doing some combat missions.\n\nI finally got the viper, stopped trading, and switched to bounty hunting and doing combat missions. Fun for a few hours, but in a while it got just as tedious as trading. Fly around looking for some action. Scan ships, and take them out. It's fun learning an effective way of defeating the enemy, but once you learn it, it's all just the same. Wanted some more action and went for a combat mission where I got to take out an anaconda, the most impressive ship in the whole game. Unfortunately it was all the same as taking on any other ship, just took quite a while longer before it finally blew up. I got some help taking it down, but other than that... all the same.\nI stopped doing combat missions and switched to exploring.\n\nExploring is more or less simply about jumping to a new system. Scan some stars, ice planets, rocky planets, earth like planets, and jump to a new system. Fill up with fuel, sell exploration data, scan, jump, sell, fuel, scan jump... Everything looks the same. Planets are the same, stars are the same. Every few hours I find something interesting or get sucked up in a huge firefight that makes the game a bit more interesting, but other than that. This too is just too tedious, but for some reason I just keep doing it, the game is very addictive. I decided to stop spending all my hard earned cash on new equipment for my viper and continue grinding in order to buy an asp. I'm now at 1.5M credits and start to wonder. What then?\n\nIn the initial youtube videos I watched, people kept talking about this being a game in development. We would get planetary landings... I started investigating when that would happen. Found out that you actually have to buy the Horizons expantion in order to get it, it will not be added to the original game. Now horizons is finally here. Is that worth buying? Well, looking at some more videos, it seems that this part of the game is about.... Landing, and driving aimlessly across the serface of the same, impressively large, but still impressively boring planets. There is simply just nothing interesting enough to see. And the price is five times what I paid for the base game. Well, at least I get a discount for already having bought the first one. I guess I'll pass and wait for star citizen or no mans sky.\n\nBottom line is:\nThe game is really empty and pointless. Giving you a feeling of insignificance really is no excuse. Not when you get the feeling from the game simply being empty and pointless. Everything is the same. Exploring space, stations, missions and combat. If you can get the game at 75% off, as I did, then maybe it's worth trying out as it will give you a few hours or days of fun before you realize how dull it is. At full price? Definitely not. I miss freelancer, wing commander, and all the other good old space games. I'll rather wait for star citizen and no mans sky and see if they have something more to offer.","December 16, 2015","false","679.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Do you have a joystick?  If the answer is no, you will want to avoid buying this game.  It's a combat flight simulation (IN SPACE!!) at its core, and frankly it's just not that enjoyable without a joystick in my opinion.... who knows, maybe I'm a purest.\n\nAt any rate, that has nothing to do with this review, more of an FYI as I haven't seen too many reviews point that out.  I do have a joystick and I happen to love a good combat flight sim, but for whatever reason, I just cannot fall in love with Elite: Dangerous.  I've put about 20+ hours into the game and while that's not sufficient to cover to entire depth of the game, it is more than enough time to acclimate myself with the game play and all the different "career tracks" you can take throughout it.\n\nWhat I like.\n\nI have to say, I'm a big fan of the way the ship controls are setup in this game.  I obviously customized my contoller to my liking, but the combat flight portion of the game is great.  You have to learn how to properly dock at stations, dog fight, fly in and out of faster than light travel, deal with gravitational pull, heat management, etc.  I love that in a solar system, you may have to fly for minutes to travese it from one side to the other.  Space is big and this game really brings that perpective into the forefront.  I love it, frankly I can't say enough good things about traversing the increadibly huge galaxy in the ship. Massive kudos for the realism in this category.\n\nWhat I hate.\n\nIt's a grind.  You grind for EVERYTHING.\n\nWant to explore? You'll spend hours charting new systems, discovering new planets, etc. You go to sell all your hard collected cartography data and you may get upwards of $10k - $30k per system, but you spent HOURS on it.  Not really a great payout.\n\nWant to trade?  Buy some cheap stuff at your current station and sell it high somewhere else, but since you can't carry more than 200 items in the larger ships (and not even 20 in the starter ships), there's no real way to make a lot of money when items are only providing $100 - $300 in profit.\n\nWant to fight?  Spend an hour tracking down bounties, maybe get into 1 - 3 dogfights an hour, and claim maybe $30k - $100k per hour.\n\nWant to do some missions?  Any mission that is not illicit in nature isn't worth the time spent on it.  Pick the wrong mission and you find that it's a multi-part mission (which you weren't aware of) that requires special equipment or maybe even a DLC you don't own.  I literally spent 45 minutes playing a mission I was unable to complete because I don't own the Horizons DLC.  Why is that even available?!?\n\n$100k an hour; that's not too bad you say.  This sounds like good money until you realize ships are expensive, outfitting them even more so to an egregious degre.  It's an ever constant cycle.  You buy a bigger ship, you grind some more to outfit it properly.  What next?  Grind for more money and a bigger ship.  Grind it out more for better equipment.  Rinse and repeat.  At some point I'm told you affect the galaxy, align yourself with factions, etc, but you're going to spend hundreds of hours just getting a ship you like assembled before you even dive into this stuff.\n\nThere's no payout without putting in a significant amount of time; no real sense of accomplishment as you progress because you end up doing the exact same thing over and over and over and over.\n\nMaybe this is fun for some people, but to me it's just monotony.  I loved flying, I loved exploring, I hated the grind to make any progression.  Maybe I'll come back after some more DLC is released with diferent content, but for now I can't say it was money well spent.","December 17, 2015","false","23.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Maybe in a few seasons it might grow to a game worth putting some time into, but my instinct is that empty planets, then empty moons will be added to this empty lifeless galaxy, the missions will continue the same variations and social interaction will be non-existant.","December 18, 2015","false","12.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You'll be jumping from job to job because their all boring, (I've tried bounty hunting, mining, trading, and exploring and they all feel one inch deep and 1000 miles wide, and in this case that 1000 miles is literal distance you have to travel) then you'll eventually give up and quit the game like most players before you. This game is the most mind numbing grind I've played in a long long time. The multiplayer is boring in the base game, yet very hard to play right in Horizons, and planetary landing with a friend a near impossible to cordinate. On top of that, expansions are going to total at least $250 on top of the $60 for the game, making this a $310 game just to have a complete version, and you're sure as hell going to buy them because the base game feels so empty. Overall, I would recommend waiting for at least a few seasons of expansions to come out befor even considering buying this game. If it's in this state when No Mans Sky and Star Citizen release, it has no hope of competing.","December 21, 2015","false","430.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wayfrae/recommended/359320/","wayfrae","Frae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wayfrae/","132 products in account","I seriously loved this game at first. I still love it. It is just not everything it can be. I still play it from time to time to get my space sim fix but overall this is a lackluster game. It has a lot of promising content but the devs want you to shell out $60 USD every year for $10 worth of content.\n\n+First Person Flying Through Space (Aww yisss!)\n+Great Space Trucking Simulator\n+Active Developer Community Moderators (It is nice to see people from Frontier on Reddit)\n+You can join a wing with your friend and fly through space together. (More on this in the negative section)\n\n-Difficult learning curve for new players using a keyboard and mouse. It took me quite a long time to get my keybinds to where it was comfortable to fly with a keyboard.\n-Many game breaking bugs are put off until the next major patch forcing you to just deal with them for months. (I am looking at you "Lost Connection to Transaction Server" mining bug.)\n-Exploring the black is boring. Since all the systems are procedurally generated they start to look and feel the exact same. There are no cool space anomalies to witness like stars colliding or a black hole and a star colliding. Everything starts to look the same.\n-The Power Play content seemed cool at first but it was quickly apparent that the different factions barely change game play at all. It is too easy to overlook to be considered a major feature of the game.\n-While you can join a wing to play with a friend you can really only dog fight together or run trade routes together. There aren't any missions to do with friends. For being an MMO this game has almost no focus on the social aspect of the game, it really feels like an after thought.\n-Game feels more like a single player game than a multiplayer game.\n\nI really want to recommend this game, but right now I just can't. I want to try Horizons also, but I just can't bring myself to pay another $60 and be disappointed again. I have played for 60+ hours so far, so I did get good value but at this point the game is so repetitive that I find myself not wanting to play at all.","December 21, 2015","false","95.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foofieee/recommended/359320/","foofieee","Foofie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foofieee/","40 products in account","This game is really quite good, and there is a lot to it. The game's flight mechanics are simple enough that they can be easily grasped and intuitively controlled faster than with most flight games. Entering this game, you should expect a learning curve, and for part of the fun being exploring all the things you can do as you learn. If you're expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the game, you're going to blunder around for an hour, rage quit, and then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off. This game is a sandbox. Be prepared to find your own way. Lets get to the game itself:\n\nThe general point of the game is to reach "Elite" rank. You can do this via combat, trading, or exploration. Lets talk about each of these three types of play in turn:\n\nCombat: Excellent part of this game. There are a diverse range of weapons, each which function differently and place different strains on your ship's loadout. You want to use Plasma Accelerators? Well, those have major power drain, so you need your ship to have a large power plant. Bigger shield? More power. Shield cell banks? More power. Planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyable, and ongoing experience throughout the game. As far as combat goes, you can approach it as a bounty hunter, going out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice... Or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilots, breaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market. Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game. If nothing else, you'll get a solid 20-30 hours out of combat progression.\n\nTrading: This part is a bit more up in the air to a lot of people. Some people don't like the repetitious nature of trading in the game, but it really depends on what you look for. Trading involves going to different stations, recording what they have in high demand, and what they have in high supply, and linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demand, and which demand what the first station has in high supply. In other words, basic supply/demand economics, you trade the goods between stations. This can be a bit dull, other than when pirates are after you, but it really depends what you want. This is the Euro-Truck Simulator part of the game. If you want something relaxing, flying between stations while listening to a podcast, audiobook, or watching a TV show, trading is for you.\n\nExploration: The galaxy is big. Bigger than I think most of us have a grasp of. Many of us know "Well, the galaxy is obviously massive", but there's a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all. Sol, that is the solar system earth is found in, is a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center. It takes around 20-30 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in non-stop jumping from star to star. To travel all around the galaxy, you're talking months worth of time devoted to exploring. And that doesn't even count the time it takes to scan each system, and go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money. Why would anyone want to do this? Well, have you ever flown up to a black hole, and seen the light distort around it in an eerie, terrorizing sense of dread? Have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape? Have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole? These are the types of things you see when you explore, and for many, the feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile. If you're the first one to explore something, your name is also tagged to it forever. The civilized area of space only takes about 500 LY around Sol, with the rest up to being explored.\n\nPeripherals: The game works very well with a mouse and keyboard, with a XBox 360 controller, and with most joysticks (HOTAS or otherwise). There are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controller, as well as most market joysticks. So you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while you're learning.\n\nAlways Online Note: You have a multiplayer option in which you're around other players. Players will try to pirate you, others will bounty hunt for you, etc. You can set up wings, groups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights. Or, if you want to be a recluse, you can play Solo and avoid other players, and just play with NPCs. Or maybe you just want to play with your friend, you can set up a Private Group. All of these require a constant internet connection, but it is for a reason. Anytime you do something in the game, it shapes the political and economic landscape. If you buy resonating separators from Cemiess, you reduce the amount of supply in Cemiess, which makes the price go up. When this happens, the game pings the global server, and changes the value for everyone else in their own servers. So although you are away from other players, what you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyone.\n\nGalactic Political Landscape: There are 3 major factions in the game: the Alliance, Federation, and Empire. Additionally, there are Independent factions bound to specific star systems. Each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems. Lets say you look at a system like Lugh which was ruled by the Federation. Within Lugh, there are many "parties" that are in government, running for political control. The Federation party is in control. But if players start to do missions against the party in control, if they start to kill police, pirate traders, do things to disrupt the peace in that system, it spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system. They start to demand change. A civil war can break out between the faction in power, and the faction that is not in power, and they fight. Players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bonds, and help shape the outcome of the war. Depending on which side wins, the system may flip. In Lugh, the system did flip. Players turned out early on in mass numbers to test this, trying to flip Lugh from the Federation into an independent star system under the Crimson party. This was accomplished, and Lugh is currently an independent star system as the Federation backed down. Anytime you do a mission, it pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party. So even if you play solo, you can impact global politics.\n\nWhat this game does not do is give you a set path. You'll load up the game, you'll have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the game, and then you'll be dropped into a dock in star system LHS 3447. You wont get a quest prompt, the game wont say "Hey, go here and do this!". You'll be docked at a space station, and it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do. You need to find your own way. You'll blunder around and advance on your own terms.\n\nWhen you start out, you should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work. But the exploration, the learning of how things work is a lot of the fun. This is an open world space game, and the way you experience it is something you'll dictate for yourself.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. The combat is really damn fun, there are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience. Trading and Exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooks, or watching TV shows.","September 22, 2015","true","137.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You start off with a small craft that cant do a lot but after a few jobs you then can start to build yourself a half decent craft. over time you will get bigger ships and better cash to spend upgrading them there are many ways to get credits  you can do cargo runs or be evil and get a bounty on your head as a pirate going around killing all in your way. The best way to play this is on a flight stick the game has so much depth in it youll be amazed at what the game holds as you play more into it. and now there is a add on coming so that you can land on planets get in your buggy and drive around or come in to orbit and see what goods you can take, i love this game and have put a lot of time in to this there is so much more i could tell you about this game but then i would spoil it for you.

It's worth the money I've spent on it. It takes me away to a realm that I will likely not see in my lifetime, nor my children's lifetime. I took into account all of the dangers that lie in space. I took into acount the massive amount of time it would take to get the ship that I wanted. But I think I took too long playing it without a solid party system, waiting for yet another title that wasn't "complete" yet.\n\nTread lightly with this title. It's worth every penny, but I don't know if it holds the longevity that I would have liked to see initially. The Power/Politics system didn't inspire me to do anything except take a long trip out of Federation space to reach my chosen faction. I found no reason to support my faction other than the potential at grind rewards. Grind rewards aren't bad but I felt with all of that space out there, I'd rather become an explorer, bounty hunter, trader, and ship connoisseur.\n\n8/10 See you space cowboy...\n\n***After the addition of Horizons***\n\nThe planetary exploration is very smooth and delivers on everything the developers promised. There are even missions that correspond with surface deliveries. However I would appreciate more land vehicles and the ability to customize them. I will say, it is an amazing experience driving around on the surface after spending so long in outer space.\n\nGet it while it's on SALE! Especially if you already own the base game. It completes the experience.","September 21, 2015","true","48.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The game looks and sounds great and the initial flying around to explore a little is exciting. But then you actually want to start playing and request a mission...\n\nWhy do I call it vague? All I have done in my time in this game is hop from system to sytem looking for a mission to do, only to get something ridiculous about "Find target X in the Y system". It's this lack of information that lead me to fail mission after mission simply because I don't know what they are asking me to do.\n\nIs target X hanging around the star? Is he at a station?

It puts you in with a very brief, to-the-point tutorial system, and after that, you're on your own! Dropped in the middle of some starbase in an obscure, unfamiliar, GIGANTIC! INCOMPREHENSIBLY HUGE galaxy(I've heard there are over 400 billion separate, identifiable objects in the map...Not confirmed info by the way!)\n\nThe game is pretty much....Well...The storyline of the game is that for you, there is no storyline...You're about to create it! You are given a free ship, and the lowest of the low armaments and utilities, and you're set against the entire galaxy with nothing but your cunning...Aaaand hopefully more than a little bit of pre-gaming research!\nOnce you even figure out how the darned controls work, your next order of business is deciding what you're going to be...A trader? A smuggler? A pirate? A mercenary? There are many more things you can do than that, but I'm just not aware of them yet(Allegedly).\nNext up it's pretty much exactly like EVE Online; you jump from star system to star system with your Hyper Drive, go do what you arrived at the spot to do, and then hop skotch from system to system back to where ever you're going, etc. etc.\nSounds pretty simple right? Trust me, it's not. From intercepting pirates, to the crushing, almost inescapable gravitational pull of stars and black holes(If you get too close!), there are all manners of things to look out for...Even the damnably easy sounding task of docking at a flipping space station! GAWD! Could they have made it any more difficult!?!?!?\n\nBe that as it may...If you like space ship games, and more importantly, if you like a challenge, then I couldn't recommend this game more. It's great fun, and you really get that sense of achievement, even from something seemingly simplistic like doing a mission! Everything in this game is automatically set to Very Hard difficulty, and if you can't handle the complexity, then I suggest going with something easy, like Star Trek Online or something.\n\nAnd the graphics? Well considering I have a GeForce GTX 980 Ti, then I'm probably not the go-to person for those with lesser hardware in comparrison, so honestly, I have absolutely no idea how well this game works at lowest settings.\nBut for the high tier hardware users, you're in for a treat. This game is absolutely stunningly beautiful, and every detail is taken into consideration. If your thing is eyecandy, then you're gonna LOVE this, even just sitting in the cockpit(A ♥♥♥♥ PIT!? WHERE! TOSS ME IN PLZ!!!) is a thrill ride for those enjoying big fancy graphics!\n\nSeriously, if you enjoy video games about space travel/combat/exploration, and if you enjoy your games being natively difficult, and making every accomplishment you make, a considerably important one, then I highly, highly suggest you get this title!\nBut if you prefer your games to be simplistic, easy, and generally casual, then I don't think you should give this one a go.","September 15, 2015","true","37.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","2"

If you're expecting the game to tell you how to play beyond basic tutorials or what to do to experience the game, you're going to blunder around for an hour, rage quit, and then feel the game lacks content and you were ripped off. This game is a sandbox. Be prepared to find your own way. Lets get to the game itself:\n\nThe general point of the game is to reach "Elite" rank. You can do this via combat, trading, or exploration. Lets talk about each of these three types of play in turn:\n\nCombat: Excellent part of this game. There are a diverse range of weapons, each which function differently and place different strains on your ship's loadout. You want to use Plasma Accelerators? Well, those have major power drain, so you need your ship to have a large power plant. Bigger shield? More power. Shield cell banks? More power. Planning out your ship for combat is a really enjoyable, and ongoing experience throughout the game. As far as combat goes, you can approach it as a bounty hunter, going out and hunting down people who have committed crimes to collect the bounty associated with bringing justice... Or you can be a pirate and accrue a bounty on your head by tracking down other pilots, breaking their shields and forcing their goods to be released for you to steal and sell on the black market. Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable part of the game. If nothing else, you'll get a solid 20-30 hours out of combat progression.\n\nTrading: This part is a bit more up in the air to a lot of people. Some people don't like the repetitious nature of trading in the game, but it really depends on what you look for. Trading involves going to different stations, recording what they have in high demand, and what they have in high supply, and linking that up with other stations which can supply the high demand, and which demand what the first station has in high supply. In other words, basic supply/demand economics, you trade the goods between stations. This can be a bit dull, other than when pirates are after you, but it really depends what you want. This is the Euro-Truck Simulator part of the game. If you want something relaxing, flying between stations while listening to a podcast, audiobook, or watching a TV show, trading is for you.\n\nExploration: The galaxy is big. Bigger than I think most of us have a grasp of. Many of us know "Well, the galaxy is obviously massive", but there's a difference between that and truly realizing the sheer size of it all. Sol, that is the solar system earth is found in, is a bit closer to the edge of the galaxy than the center. It takes around 20-30 hours to reach the center of the galaxy in non-stop jumping from star to star. To travel all around the galaxy, you're talking months worth of time devoted to exploring. And that doesn't even count the time it takes to scan each system, and go around scanning planets to create data you can sell for money. Why would anyone want to do this? Well, have you ever flown up to a black hole, and seen the light distort around it in an eerie, terrorizing sense of dread? Have you ever seen a planet that due to gravitational force has been compressed into an oblong shape? Have you ever seen a supermassive red giant star revolving around a black hole? These are the types of things you see when you explore, and for many, the feeling of exploring and seeing these things is worthwhile. If you're the first one to explore something, your name is also tagged to it forever. The civilized area of space only takes about 500 LY around Sol, with the rest up to being explored.\n\nPeripherals: The game works very well with a mouse and keyboard, with a XBox 360 controller, and with most joysticks (HOTAS or otherwise). There are default bindings built into the game for the 360 controller, as well as most market joysticks. So you wont have to worry about rebinding all that much while you're learning.\n\nAlways Online Note: You have a multiplayer option in which you're around other players. Players will try to pirate you, others will bounty hunt for you, etc. You can set up wings, groups of up to 4 pilots to do grouping fights. Or, if you want to be a recluse, you can play Solo and avoid other players, and just play with NPCs. Or maybe you just want to play with your friend, you can set up a Private Group. All of these require a constant internet connection, but it is for a reason. Anytime you do something in the game, it shapes the political and economic landscape. If you buy resonating separators from Cemiess, you reduce the amount of supply in Cemiess, which makes the price go up. When this happens, the game pings the global server, and changes the value for everyone else in their own servers. So although you are away from other players, what you do still impacts the galactic economy for everyone.\n\nGalactic Political Landscape: There are 3 major factions in the game: the Alliance, Federation, and Empire. Additionally, there are Independent factions bound to specific star systems. Each of these has control or lacks control over some stars systems. Lets say you look at a system like Lugh which was ruled by the Federation. Within Lugh, there are many "parties" that are in government, running for political control. The Federation party is in control. But if players start to do missions against the party in control, if they start to kill police, pirate traders, do things to disrupt the peace in that system, it spurs on civil unrest in the population of the system. They start to demand change. A civil war can break out between the faction in power, and the faction that is not in power, and they fight. Players can get involved in assisting in these wars to earn combat bonds, and help shape the outcome of the war. Depending on which side wins, the system may flip. In Lugh, the system did flip. Players turned out early on in mass numbers to test this, trying to flip Lugh from the Federation into an independent star system under the Crimson party. This was accomplished, and Lugh is currently an independent star system as the Federation backed down. Anytime you do a mission, it pings the global server to say what the current influence levels are of the party. So even if you play solo, you can impact global politics.\n\nWhat this game does not do is give you a set path. You'll load up the game, you'll have some tutorials to teach you the basic maneuvers and travel of the game, and then you'll be dropped into a dock in star system LHS 3447. You wont get a quest prompt, the game wont say "Hey, go here and do this!". You'll be docked at a space station, and it will be up to you to find out what it is you want to do. You need to find your own way. You'll blunder around and advance on your own terms.\n\nWhen you start out, you should be prepared to blunder around for a little bit as you explore and learn more about the galaxy and how things work. But the exploration, the learning of how things work is a lot of the fun. This is an open world space game, and the way you experience it is something you'll dictate for yourself.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. The combat is really damn fun, there are a lot of different weapons and ships that make for a truly enjoyable experience. Trading and Exploration offer great ways to still progress in the game while listening to audiobooks, or watching TV shows.","September 22, 2015","true","137.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You start off with a small craft that cant do a lot but after a few jobs you then can start to build yourself a half decent craft. over time you will get bigger ships and better cash to spend upgrading them there are many ways to get credits  you can do cargo runs or be evil and get a bounty on your head as a pirate going around killing all in your way. The best way to play this is on a flight stick the game has so much depth in it youll be amazed at what the game holds as you play more into it. and now there is a add on coming so that you can land on planets get in your buggy and drive around or come in to orbit and see what goods you can take, i love this game and have put a lot of time in to this there is so much more i could tell you about this game but then i would spoil it for you.

It's worth the money I've spent on it. It takes me away to a realm that I will likely not see in my lifetime, nor my children's lifetime. I took into account all of the dangers that lie in space. I took into acount the massive amount of time it would take to get the ship that I wanted. But I think I took too long playing it without a solid party system, waiting for yet another title that wasn't "complete" yet.\n\nTread lightly with this title. It's worth every penny, but I don't know if it holds the longevity that I would have liked to see initially. The Power/Politics system didn't inspire me to do anything except take a long trip out of Federation space to reach my chosen faction. I found no reason to support my faction other than the potential at grind rewards. Grind rewards aren't bad but I felt with all of that space out there, I'd rather become an explorer, bounty hunter, trader, and ship connoisseur.\n\n8/10 See you space cowboy...\n\n***After the addition of Horizons***\n\nThe planetary exploration is very smooth and delivers on everything the developers promised. There are even missions that correspond with surface deliveries. However I would appreciate more land vehicles and the ability to customize them. I will say, it is an amazing experience driving around on the surface after spending so long in outer space.\n\nGet it while it's on SALE! Especially if you already own the base game. It completes the experience.","September 21, 2015","true","48.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It certainly has its moments; dogfighting through asteroid fields, getting rich after finally finishing a trade route. However, once you've played a couple hours of the game you've essentially seen everything it has to offer. Sure, there's bigger ships, there's better weapons; you could spend a few hours travelling to see a black hole; but most of the game will be spent mindlessly drifting from system to system, occasionally stopping in at a station for refueling, hoping that your next trade or bounty will finally give you enough to afford that next ship. The game is huge in scope (you have an entire galaxy open to you) but most of that galaxy is empty. The game's world is vast, but once you scrape the surface, you'll realize that it's equally shallow. As you travel around, you'll begin to realize that you're really just seeing the same things again; the same stars, the same planets, the same stations, the same NPCs... if you're inclined to spend hours travelling between systems, there's a few unique sights, but it really doesn't justify the tedium of getting there. Frontier has created a gigantic, intimidating universe, but it's completely empty.\n\nSpeaking of Frontier, ♥♥♥♥ those guys. I know every other reviewer has already mentioned this horse ♥♥♥♥, but I can't help but rant a bit.\n\nI paid seventy dollars for this game in early access. People who paid sixty or  seventy dollars (as opposed to the game's current price of thirty) had to pay significantly more than new players, not to mention full price for the game's mediocre DLC. And speaking of the DLC, what in the unholy ♥♥♥♥??? Context: Players who buy the DLC before buying the game, will get both the DLC and the original game for $60. Players who already own the game and buy the DLC, pay $120, or more. This is ridiculous. This is the kind of cash-grabbing ♥♥♥♥ that even EA wouldn't dare to pull. Yeah, I said it. Frontier is worse than EA.\n\nI can't deny that I've enjoyed my time spent playing the game itself, but that's not nearly enough to justify this idiocy. Please don't validate Frontier's ♥♥♥♥-headed payment model by giving them your hard-earned money.","December 30, 2015","false","4.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It is just not everything it can be. I still play it from time to time to get my space sim fix but overall this is a lackluster game. It has a lot of promising content but the devs want you to shell out $60 USD every year for $10 worth of content.\n\n+First Person Flying Through Space (Aww yisss!)\n+Great Space Trucking Simulator\n+Active Developer Community Moderators (It is nice to see people from Frontier on Reddit)\n+You can join a wing with your friend and fly through space together. (More on this in the negative section)\n\n-Difficult learning curve for new players using a keyboard and mouse. It took me quite a long time to get my keybinds to where it was comfortable to fly with a keyboard.\n-Many game breaking bugs are put off until the next major patch forcing you to just deal with them for months. (I am looking at you "Lost Connection to Transaction Server" mining bug.)\n-Exploring the black is boring. Since all the systems are procedurally generated they start to look and feel the exact same. There are no cool space anomalies to witness like stars colliding or a black hole and a star colliding. Everything starts to look the same.\n-The Power Play content seemed cool at first but it was quickly apparent that the different factions barely change game play at all. It is too easy to overlook to be considered a major feature of the game.\n-While you can join a wing to play with a friend you can really only dog fight together or run trade routes together. There aren't any missions to do with friends. For being an MMO this game has almost no focus on the social aspect of the game, it really feels like an after thought.\n-Game feels more like a single player game than a multiplayer game.\n\nI really want to recommend this game, but right now I just can't. I want to try Horizons also, but I just can't bring myself to pay another $60 and be disappointed again. I have played for 60+ hours so far, so I did get good value but at this point the game is so repetitive that I find myself not wanting to play at all.","December 21, 2015","false","95.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It has a steep learning curve even after the tutorials.  However, it was time well invested and I got a few ship upgrades.  Elite Dangerous: Horizons landed, called "season 2" and this latest update was £30 with the 25% discount.  I can't justify recommending this pricing approach if every "season" will cost the same again as the base game.  I thought I could stick with the basic game but the quest lines have changed, where I don't have access to planetary content.  This might not be an issue for players planning to stay solo and not participate in the multi-player universe.  The upside for new players is that buying Elite Dangerous: Horizons includes all the content, at least until "season 3" is released.  So I have jettisoned my save game and called time on virtual space exploration.\n\nEdit: The Steam store page for Elite Dangerous still says very little about it being superseded by Elite Dangerous: Horizons.

Simply put, if at any point you were a fan of games like Freelancer, Descent, EVE, or of course the old Elite titles... this is the game for you.\n\nPro's :\n\n- open world with not-quite MMO level multiplayer interaction.  The effects of players in single-player, private-group and open-world all have the same impact on the universe.  The same will be true of the upcoming XBOXONE version of the game.\n- a wide variety of things to interest players, from trading to bounty hunting, missions and pve 'ratting' to mining and even exploring a galaxy that consists of OVER 400 BILLION STARS!\n- Comprehensive controls that can be used by the most novice player, and refined to the desired complexity that a long-term flight sim / space sim player would want.  It's viable to play the game with a KB/Mouse just as it is with a controller or a joystick or HOTAS.\n\nCons ;\n\n- Learning curve is a little steep if you go it alone.  Finding a community of other players to help you learn will make the transition smoother and faster.\n- Along with that, there's no real in-game 'community' or guild mechanism, meaning all player groups really only exist at the metagame level and are harder for players to find and join.\n- Frontier is notoriously opaque in regards to the math, mechanisms, algorithms, and reasoning behind how many aspects of the game work.  While this allows them some lattitude in deciding to make changes without causing public uproar, it also differs from the way that most developers and players operate in this day and age, where transparency and trust go hand in hand between the userbase and developers.\n- This is not really a con, but can be for some right now.  The game is not really complete, nor will it really ever be.  This means that a lot of things you would expect to see in a highly polished game (guild system for instance) do not exist, but as the developer is committed to growing, building, and expanding the game long term -- I'd say that's fine.\n\nAll in all I *highly* recommend this game to anyone who will listen.  I have already dropped more than 2-300 hours into it (as of the time of this post ~100hrs on Steam, plus a couple hundred hours prior to the game keys for steam being provided).  A lot of that time has been spent on my own flying around the galaxy exploring and getting my name attached to the 'first found by Lukano!' stamp on celestial systems and points of interest.  I have also seen super massive black holes at the center of the galaxy, and lived to talk about it.","June 17, 2015","true","310.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

I've enjoyed it so much I ordered a joystick and throttle just to add more dimension to it.  Graphics are pleasing, sound effects are what you would expect.  You get the female computer voice that makes you want to have a conversation with while jumping through multiple systems.  A cool effect is when your cockpit blows out everyhting gets muffled and silent.  Controls are a little rough when using mouse and keyboard but still playable.  There isn't a ton of content if you compare this sandbox to say GTA but really what game does.    It's a game that YOU the player needs to make the story.  You can take on bounties or be the hunted.  You can spend time just travelling and exploring, scanning objects to collect credits.  Future expansions will provide more exploration involving landing on planets.  The learning curve is set pretty high, however, if you go in knowing you will take the time to learn the controls and different aspects then you will be an Ace in no time.  If you come into the game thinking you will master it in a hour you will be mad and more than likely post complaints on the forums.

These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. It's five-year mission: to explore . . . *Warning: Interdiction Detected! Pirates proceed to gangbang the ship into oblivion.\n\nWelcome to Elite: Dangerous. The do whatever you want simulator. The game throws you into the cold, vast void known as space, where its up to you to choose your destiny. Do you want to be a space cop, and dole out justice to all those evil pirates, or innocent pilots that accidently sat afk to long somewhere, orrrr do you want to be a heartless murderer who hunts truckers and other like for money, well you can do either! You can also be a said space trucker and listen to music while you fly through space, researching trade routes and profitable merchandise on your long journies. Great for those who want to take it slow and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. You can also be a miner, which, I can't honestly say much about, because who has time to shoot space rocks with lasers when I can shoot OTHER PEOPLE with lasers.\n\nTheres lots to do and see in this game, and you can move at your own pace. Money can be made fairly freely through either trading or killing, and it doesn't take too long to upgrade ot a larger ship. The games great fun, and the sense of scale is there, especially when you duel it out in a massive space battle a few days distance away from a planet.\n\nThe sound is also incredible, from the ratling of your autocannons peppering enemy ships, to the missiles and lasers that tear and cut through hulls respectfully. The music is also fairly calming as well, and even a bit funny at times, such as when you're presented with The Blue Danube Waltz  as you autodock into a station.\n\nThe visuals are likewise, just as good, when you're tearing through space near the speed of light. You'll be thrown into what appears to be wormwholes, seeing a dull, entrancing tornado of light enshroud your journey to another system. You'll pass by colossal, eye catching explosions of light as your emerge near stars. And the first time you dock into a massive space station, and get tucked away into your own very little hangar, you'll get a sense of protection and a profound calmness thats hard to explain. They all tie together to make the game feel like you're actually in space, and not just coasting through the air with a black sphere around you that has some stars painted on.\n\nCombat is fairly detailed as it is simple. You can outfit yourself with a variety of weapons ranging from lasers, autocannons, missles, torpedoes, and the like. You can aim center mass and try to blast your targets away, or, you can surgically strike at key internals of their ship, such as their powerplant, thrusters, cockpit, etc. I can tell you I never get tired of seeing my autocannons create ripples of light that dance around the enemies hull as I waltz around them. It's truely a sight to behold, as is the specteral beams of light wisking around the enemies shields as I fire my lasers.\n\nThere are a few issues in the game, primarily with the AI misbehaving. Enemy ships are way too easy to kill, even for a beginner, and they often make very poor decisions elsewhere, such as when docking at a station(They slam into walls and get caught in various places). In general, they just have poor pathing, You can also accidently "tap" an ally in combat with friendly fire, and cause all allied ships in the instance to want you dead. It may seem like an annoyance to accidently hit a teamate, but considering that high conflict instances can have A LOT of ships flying round, its a lot easier than you'd think.\n\nWhile not wide spread, the issues with this game are fairly degrading to the experience(considering the vast amount of AI ships you will encounter compared to player) and hold it back from being a much better title. However, the game is being updated over time, so that should hopefully change in the future.\n\nThough trailers are a bit misleading in terms of what the gameplay is actually like(combat for the most part), Elite: Dangerous is still a thing to behold. I would suggest watching videos of gameplay to be sure you actually enjoy the pace.\n\nBut in general, If you like space simulators, and being given free reign on what you want to do, then this game is for you.\n\nGameplay: 8\nVisuals: 8.5\nAudio: 8.0\nAI: 6.5\nOverall Score:  7.75/10","April 7, 2015","true","107.9"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","23","40","5","2"

Pay for it you own it.\n-Slower paced, long term gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Missions can be repetitive (but there is an update coming!)\n-DLC Prices (personally I think it is worth it, but I know some people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I bought the lifetime pass since there are 10 years worth of expansions planned, and I see great potential in the expansions)\n-The ship you start in sucks (Explained later. Yes I know that is how it is supposed to be).\n-Flight is supposedly unrealistic (I'm not a physics expert, but I like it).\n\nThe visuals in this game are absolutely stunning! There are so many things to go see including black holes and stars orbiting stars and all sorts of planets (which we can't land on yet but eventually!). Speaking of landing on planets, some people are mad that Horizons is only letting players land on planets and moons with no atmosphere, but eventually we will be able to land on ALL planets (well I guess you can't land on Gas Giants, but you can fly in them I guess). Frontier is just spacing out the releases of landable planets into the expansions which makes sense to me because it probably takes a ton of work to make all the planet surfaces for different kinds, but I digress.\n\nThere are some issues with the game. A lot of people complain that the missions are boring and repetitive. I completely agree. The missions do get repetitive; however, there is an update coming to the game that is going to completely change the mission system, so don't let that discourage you. From what I've heard, you won't need to buy Horizons for the mission update.\n\nThis brings me to the next topic, the expansions. A lot of people have been complaining about the price of the DLC, and I can see where there are coming from. My response to that is you don't have to pay a subscription fee for the game. Other games such as EVE Online require you to pay monthly, but with Elite: Dangerous it is just a one time fee. I feel that the money someone would put into a subscription game vs. the pay and play forever is pretty much equal. If that still doesn't satisfy those people, then they could have gotten the lifetime pass since there are 10 years of expansions planned for the game. If each expansion is $60 it would've payed for itself after 3 expansions.\n\nAnother thing that people complain about is the combat taking forever; however many of those people only have an hour or maybe two hours posted which more than likely means one thing. They are still in the starter sidewinder. Of course combat is going to take forever in the sidewinder!!!!! It is the starter piece of ♥♥♥♥ ship that is meant to be garbage! It cant really do ♥♥♥♥! There is also a chance that maybe those people actually got to the Eagle or Viper but probably didn't upgrade it which is another reason combat would've taken forever because they weapon they give as stock weapons is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but that is the point. You have to work and upgrade your ship. Personally, I fly a maxed out Vulture for combat, and I can fry ships in a minute or two. Much faster than these outrageous claims of 20 minutes to kill one ship.\n\nPeople also complain about the turn speeds, and while I don't know much about physics I must say that I can't really complain about the turn speed. All I really feel you have to do is set Flight Assist to a hot key and toggle it off while you turn and then back on. If you are in a smaller ship you'll turn pretty damn fast that way. Of course the bigger ships like the Anaconda and Python might  take a little longer to turn but the Anaconda is 152.4 meters long (almost 1.5 football fields) and the Python is 87.9 meters which is smaller but still huge! Ships that big probably will take a long ♥♥♥ time to turn. I will admit that the YAW is pretty horrendous though.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is the "boring" factor. A lot of people are saying that this game is boring, but it is just slow paced. This isn't your fly around a shoot em' up get to the top quick game. It is definitely long term style of gameplay that requires patience and dedication. If that doesn't sound like your kind of game then just don't even bother. There are people that enjoy a slower pace and there are people who need action constantly. If you think that latter is you, go play CoD or something. If you're the former, I hope to see you flying around sometime!\n\n-CMDR MAJESTICshark","September 22, 2015","true","105.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

It's impossible to deny that it still does that, but... space brings with it an inherent flaw.\nNothing.\nSo much nothing.\nI'm not a great pilot, that much is obvious to anyone who's ever flown with or against me, but I have to say the combat in the game is nowhere close to how it's represented. Maybe that's me, but ships turn at quite a slow rate, even the more 'maneouvrable' ships like the Eagle, and while combat is interesting in its own way, it's not as fast-paced as many would have you believe.\nIt's also interesting in a similar way to Euro Truck simulator (although I do hate to equate these games) in that a lot of money can - and most likely will - be made from hauling, illicitly or otherwise; that choice is yours. And perhaps that's why I love this game, the choice. You can go anywhere in the galaxy, and don't let sci-fis like Mass Effect fool you, the galaxy is bigger than you could possibly imagine. There's so much travelling to be done, it's unparalelled. But, even with FTL travel (which is done really well, but I'll get to that)... space is a whole lot of nothing. The first thing I noticed when I brought this game was that it's small for such a big title, only 5-6GB. It took me a while to realise that this is because most of it is empty. Space doesn't really need assets to fill it, even if there is the occasional conflict zone or Signal Source you can drop in on.\nLuckily though whilst the speed/distace capabilities of the game and your ship are realistic, the ability to travel faster than light is present and believe me, that's a good thing. The realism of the vastness of even just one solar system hits home when you realise that without powering up FTL, it would take you well over a year to make a dent in the progress of even the least significant of journeys. So you're given two levels of FTL, two 'tiers' as it were; Supercruise and Frameshift. Supercruise handles speeds between 0.1C (C being the speed of light for those who don't know) up to maybe 100C on long journeys. Frameshifting then is the next step up, and where Supercruise is intended for travel between two stations in a single system, Frameshifting is for travel between two systems. There's no set number on the speed, but your dial flicks about and usually hangs around the 10,000C mark. You don't have control of your ship when you're Frameshifting, but it gets you where you want to be.\nThat's travel down. The next thing to talk about is probably combat. I touched on it earlier, but I never gave it the credit it does deserve. Like I said, it is interesting in its own way, although it's a little slower than people might expect going in. My recommendation within this recommendation? Get gimballed weapons asap. Anyway, tracking targets, scanning and fighting are fun and there's a lot of skill involved, since the most skilled of fighters can take out the heavier ships since even if it's noticeably scaled down, it's still relative.\nProgress can also be slow, but for a game which is part-MMO that's to be expected. Building influence with a system party can take a long while (especially if you're a smuggler) takes time and trust, but pays off in the long run. But not being able to put in 50 hours or so and be at the endgame is what makes putting the time in worth it.\nSpeaking of building influence and puttign time in, there's plenty to do to pay the bills. Combat is the most obvious (although seldom the most lucrative right off the bat), with Hauling a close second. But there's also mining, exploration (since you can come back from hundred of light years away and sell the exploration data for hefty sums) and Powerplay.\nPowerplay is the ongoing war between the Alliance, the Empire, and the Federation. I won't say there's protagonists and antagonists, since... well, there isn't - each faction stands for itself and is neither 'good' nor 'bad' (but join the Alliance anyway) and the player can make any choice they want to support whoever they want. Powerplay is almost like the next tier up from standard play, carrying important documents to systems in need of expansion or fortification, or even just plain shooting down the enemy.\nThat's pretty much all I have to say about Elite: Dangerous. I do recommend it, but make sure you know what you're buying first.\nOh, and make sure you know a good radio station or a good wingman. Those cockpits can get so lonely.","September 25, 2015","true","213.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

The game isn't very friendly for new players, it's difficult to get into, you will find buggs, the tutorials aren't very good and the game doesn't tell you what to do once you're realeased into the world. It's a slower paced game, somewhat grindy and traveling in space is a big part of it.\n\nWith that said, this game is amazing. I can't even wrap my head around the size of this world, it's litterally mind blowing. If you have any sort of interest in space, if you own a HOTAS, or simply just a joystick you owe yourself to buy this game, sit down and invest the time it takes to learn and understand it. It works great with mouse and keyboard, but for the sake of immersion, a joystick is WAY better. The game isn't for everyone, but if you invest some time on youtube to find out what there is to do in this world, I'm almost certain that you will get your moneys worth of fun with this game. Sure, the task might get somewhat repetative over time, but it's a damn good game nonetheless\n\nHostile as it might be to new players I still can't do anything other than recommend it, amazing game.","November 29, 2015","true","123.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Only get it on sale.\n\nLong version:\n\nI recommend this game, but with caution, and only when the game is on sale. Why is that, you may ask? Well, it's because in it's current state it is a bit of a mess, and the dev's seem more intent on adding new content than fixing what's already there.\n\nI'll give some examples, which also act as 'cons' for the game.\n\nThe missions are broken, no doubt about it; You're tasked with hunting a pirate in another system, so you head over there, only to find they are nowhere to be seen, or you have to smuggle goods into another station, but the exact millisecond you drop out of supercruise you get scanned, or if you make it past that the station security will ram & scan you.\n\nThat brings us to the next topic of broken A.I.: You want to go and bounty hunt, only to find that the enemies will sometimes stop in place and just spin, allowing you to shoot them without a fight. Or the aforementioned problem of ram & scan, where a station NPC will just throttle into you while scanning you, and then YOU get charged for reckless flying.\n\nThe devs don't seem to be doing much about it, and are working on essentially pointless features for the expansion. So you go onto a rock to shoot some rocks or maybe a floaty thing, and you've seen all the expansion has to offer. And then, instead of making it so there's a point to going down, they decide, "Hey, let's add faces to the game and some shiny things to craft!"\n\nAnd those issues just scratch the surface; There's no real point to Horizons, the instancing is broken... the list goes on.\n\nSo why am I still giving this a thumbs up? Because between all the problems with the game, you'll still have more than your moneys worth for $20. Just do what you want to do; Shoot some things as a freelance bounty hunter, or haul some goods to a station in need, or maybe mining is your thing? Just don't do missions for now and you'll have a blast. Sure, you may argue that you shouldn't have to avoid missions, and you're right. FDev really needs to do something about it. But you can still have fun without them, which is what I've been doing and I've been having loads of fun.\n\nNow the important question: Do I think that Frontier is going to fix the game? I think the answer is yes. They may not be the best at communicating with the community, but they aren't stupid. Sooner or later they are going to realize what they're doing wrong, and they will fix it. I believe it's just a matter of time until we have the best space sim out there. If you don't agree, that's fine; just come check back in a few months. Maybe you're right maybe I am. But if I am right, and I hope I am, then Frontier will deliver on making this game what it has the potential to be: Amazing.","February 6","true","225.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

This was exciting and I spent another 4-5 hours making money (very boring going back and forth back and forth though) When I got up to 20K I thought there has to be a better way to get up to 52000 to buy the ship with the bigger cargo bay so I can double up my profits... besides that i don't want to grind going back and forth between these two systems to make money the whole game. I found a mission that paid out 100,000 to do 3 deliveries but, it didn't tell me where to find the items just where to deliver them and gave me 4 hours to do it. I have to google everything and I spent a good (5-6) hours getting that done and trying to do another 100,000 run but it was a 35 jump with fuel stops every 4 or so jumps and at 16 I got bored and ditched it and headed back to familiar territory... Now I'm just bored with it there's not really much to keep it exciting unless you're a criminal constantly having to watch your back while you grind the back and forth of making 400 this way and 800 that way...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashslayer/recommended/359320/","ashslayer","Ashslayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashslayer/","218 products in account","I'm editing my review to make a much shorter, more easily digested review. I will leave the original below the dotted line.\n\nThe pros:\nIt's really fun\nI managed to squeeze wel over 1000 hours of gameplay out of it to this day and I am still playing\nThe gameplay is superbly designed and the grinding does not feel like typical grinding\nThe sound effects are amazing. Just superb 10/10 each ship sounds different\nEach ship and starport look very nice. The graphics are indeed beyond pretty good.\n\nThe cons:\nThe game completely lacked immersion until Horizons came out, and I am not buying Horizons, so it still lacks it for me and could lack immersion even with Horizons. This is due to the lack of impact I have within the world and how everything I do just translates to me being given credits. No matter what I do, I'm always paid in credits and never get some kind of other reward, or an option to do something else with my ores/stolen goods/bought goods.\n\nIn open play you may find a lot of hostile players who blow you up for no reason. I have however not experienced this, but I have seen dozens complain about it.\n\nThere is a lack of player on player interaction unless you go out of your way. In other words we lack guilds, corporations, etc. All we got are forums to communicate, wings to form and private groups to manage. It helps, but it's not enough for easy, large scale moments.\n\nNothing encourages you to play in open play, which makes it too easy to pick solo, which can feel lonely and at the same time put you off from going online later. It depends on the induvidual.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI have no idea how to really review this game. It is both geat, but at the same time manages to disappoint me in some aspects.\n\nWhen I first started playing I had all this awe and a feeling of wonder. I saw a guy in trouble, being killed by a pirate. From his dialogue I felt deeply in need of rescuing him. From his words of gratitude I expected him to either join my crew, or even let me take over his ship, but no. The game had none of that. The awe disappeared and settled for a more realistic view within 2 weeks.\n\nThere are a lot of features that were promised before the game came out, that didn't make it into the game, and still have not entered the game to this date. A few are:\n\nBeing able to hijack a ship, to take it for yourself.\nHave multi passenger ship, aka have you and 2 friends control a ship together.\nHaving the ability to walk around stations as well as your ship.\n\nThose are 3 features I was really excited about. Hopefully they are gonna come soon, because the game has been out for a year, and I still don't see them anywhere in sight, while Frontier has made DLC.\n\n\nOverall the game breaks down to 5 aspects, and you can play either as you like:\n\nExploring. Buy a ship, fit it for exploration and have it be self-sustained for long travels. Explore 100,000 light years at once if you want to, and return to a station to claim your reward for your exploration data.\n\nThis is however pretty samy all the way through, and not that interesting. It's kind of like fishing. Some people love it, some like it, and others despise it.\n\n\nPirating. I've chosen not to do pirating, but this requires you to fit a ship for combat, and blow ships up to steal their cargo. Or you can disable their systems, and force them to drop their cargo, and then steal that. You also buy/sell stuff from the black market in some cases.\n\n\nTrading. Ah, this I enjoy. It's similar to exploring in the aspect of flying around and seeing a lot of pretty systems, but I find it to be the 3rd most fun thing in Elite. It's very enjoyable and gives a steady profit, while being fairly low risk.\n\n\nMission running. Now this I like. Missions are varied, and go from being combat oriented, to being emergency missions that require you to get medical supplies or food for a station. My 2nd favorite activity.\n\n\nBounty Hunting. Now this is the juiciest part of this game for me. I love combat, and the combat system in this game feels good. The mechanics and everything is well polished and feels great. I keep coming back to this game 2-4 weeks at a time 3-6 times a year to immerse myself just because of the combat system. Bounty hunting works by going into mining belts, or following signal sources, and then blowing up anyone who is a wanted criminal. It's simple, elegant and fun.\n\n\nSo overall, Elite is a repetitive game, but it manages to stay fun due to how well the game is made overall.\n\n\nNow to some cons of the game:\n\nThere are not nearly enough ships. I felt like going from a sidewinder to a cobra was a big deal, and going to an ASP also felt really big. Then from an ASP to a Python it didn't feel as great, but it still felt really good. However, that's not a lot of ships. I could get an Anaconda, but I never wanted one, and I really don't feel like it would swoo me after my old Python, and current Imperial Clipper.\n\nI want more choice and options. For combat, I pretty much have one single path of ships to choose from, unless I rank up in the federation or empire.\n\n\nThen we have the weapons. Now overall I think the weapons are pretty great and each type feels unique, but I have to go over the issues that weapons have.\n\nThe really good ones, suffer from a lack of ammo in some cases. Especially my favorite weapon against hull, namely missiles. I freaking love missiles, but they are limited to class 2? why? god why??? and also the ammo capacity is barely enough for 1 anaconda. What's up with that? Multicannons of the same class are way weaker, but have enough amoo for 3, maybe 4 anacondas. I just don't see why missiles have to be so gimped in damage as well as ammo, but mostly in ammo.\n\n\nI also feel like cannons have a bit too low ammo, but nowhere near as bad as missiles.\n\n\nThe biggest gripe to me is however not related to ammo, or damage or heat. It's related to weapon variety/classes.\n\nI want class 3 multicannons and class 3 missiles, but they don't exist. Also the best multicannon is rank F? Are you kidding me? Where is the upgraded version? I'm really glad I use large hardpoints for thermal weapons, but when facing a large ship, class 2 weapons are nerfed against their hull, making the battle take long unless I really get in there.\n\n\nSome other weapons that are great against hull have class 3. For example a plasma accelerator, or a fragment cannon. I'd just like a bit more weapon variety, as well as better versions.\n\nI mean, I've used the exact same setup on my cobra, ASP, Python AND Clipper. I would have expected to use at least something else by now, but I have not. After 500 more hours of gameplay, I'm still using the same god damn thing as I did 500 hours ago. I'm either forced to change to use something that I don't like, or I have to gimp myself by using the only weapons that I do like. Either choice is not optimal, but I have no choice but to stick with my original setup of the best near stable lasers + gimbailed multicannons.\n\nI absolutely recomend this game if you are interested. You may be doing the same thing over and over a lot, but it does not feel grindy.\n\n\nI don't really know how to rate this game on a 1-10 scale like I do with other games, but if time spent enjoying a game counts towards it being good, then Elite definitely has an 8/10 or better. I do somehow feel that due to a bit of laziness on the developer's side that a 6/10 might be fair too.\n\nSo as far as my rating goes, I'll give Elite: Dangerous a 7.5/10. It has promise, but it has got to show it to deserve an 8/10 or 9/10, which I feel is the highest I will ever be able to rate this game.","September 21, 2015","true","361.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","2"

Not the community they've been pretty good but the lack of real tutorials or explanation of concepts is just awful. I bet about 80% of the people who play this just bail on it after they cant figure out how to even move their ♥♥♥♥ left and right correctly. They depserately need one single training scenario where they use the default keys for mouse and keyboard and explain what they do.\n\nThe framework of the game is simple:\n\n- Smuggle\n- Trade\n- Pirate\n- Explore\n- Mine\n- Warrior\n- A little of them all\n\nThese are your 'classes' and they are detrmined by your ship (once you can afford it). For example if you want to be a big money trader you need to have a large cargo hold so you better work on getting a ship for that - but most of the ships with large cargo holds are very expensive or can't fight back so you basically end up just getting a hauler in the start and lugging goods all over jumping from star system to star system boring yourself to tears. Every once in a while you'll get interdicted which mean someone rips you out of superdrive (which is your cruising speed in a system map) and tries to fight you to steal your cargo. These little battles are usually pretty annoying. I've had a few times where I had fun but its usually when the ship pilot is so stupid he runs in to me and blows himself up.\n\nMining is absolutely pointless. You make so little money its a wonder anyone would ever do it.\n\nPirating is kind of fun for a bit but then gets very repetitive and you realize that you're a griefer.\n\nSmuggling is kind of exciting the first few times you do it then it gets boring and repetitive - the quests are basically identical. It reminds of WoW quests... the location changes but the quest remain the same.\n\nThe Galactic Powers are pretty cool and the trade good selection is cool. The ships are appealing and the space ports look amazing. However the rest of the game is so.... bleh.\n\nAfter the initial wonder period of about 10 hours you'll get bored pretty fast. We found the multiplayer aspects of the game (cooperative) really crappy. I mean you can't even share updates on a quest you all have to talk to a person to continue, etc. Why? One example are those really terrible quests where you need to wait for x number of minutes for someone to show up and go 'hey bud, deliver the weed to grassland ok?'\n\nI want to like this game so badly because the concept is so cool but damn is it boring and redious. I like trading but sometimes even with a good FSD (the thing that makes you travel really far and fast) jumps can be in the 20-30 range... I mean its like 30-45 minutes of staring at black space and white dots flying by.... its soooo boring.\n\nTrading is the ONLY really good way to make consistent money. Everything else is a huge waste of time. Especially mining. At least fighting in conflict zones is kind of fun and makes some decent money assuming you dont get blown up by a master level anaconda or something.\n\nSpeaking of combat, also not too bad but sometimes the AI is too good - like when they constantly boost when you've got them in sight. Ends up being 15 minutes of rapid turning. (yes Im not super great at combat yet but Im okay)\n\nI'd give this game a C+. It really needs to get more exciting... more varied weapons, more variation in quests, useful professions, better reputation and galactic powers system, etc. So much potential that just sits there wasted. As of now its a barebones grind fest for money and standing.\n\nAnd the developers did a nice job they really did so don't think Im calling the game terrible because I'm not - it's just so mediocre in the fun department because there just sin't enough meat on the bones yet. My friends and I have a hard time enjoying it together and that's when you know a game is not doing something right.\n","February 27","false","67.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Besides the limited variety in things to do, even if you try to be a miner, it will take WAY too many hours to just barely make enough credits to do something with. And last thing is there is not really much ship diversity or AI diversity. You cant really do much with ships outside of their roles so customizability is low and there are very few actual ships in the game. So overall the gameplay is fun but it runs very short when you cant really just do what you want to do to make your money.

It's a gorgeous game. The planets and suns look fantastic, the effects are also very well done, and to top it off it runs quite well on my system. (GTX 750 Ti - Intel i5 46770k)\n2. HUGE map. Lots to see and explore.\n\nCons:\n1. Ship progression is very linear. There's no point in flying in any other ship than the best one for your class, you really don't have a lot of choice.\n2. Empty. With the lack of a hub world (Like Jita in EVE) it's very hard to plant your roots anywhere, and meet other players. There isn't a guild/corportation system either so even if you find a group it's hard to stay together. The wing system is horribly implimented and pointless, a friend and I tried to travel together but it was so damn confusing we decided "I'll just meet you there". Would it have been so hard to just impliment a 'follow autopilot' kinda thing? Also with the fact that most people are grinding out ships in single player there's just absolutely no player interaction besides getting shot at. This was a long section...\n3. The physics are all off. I feel like I'm playing War Thunder in space, but in less maneuverable planes. Most of the ships I've played feel sluggish and turn slowly, there's a pointless hard limit on speed. You're in space, there isn't an atmosphere to slow you down! Please...\n4. The mission system is just plain boring. Very repedetive.\n\nTL;DR It's a blonde bimbo of a game, gorgeous but there isn't much going on inside.\n\nP.S.

This game, just like the galaxy it is molded after, is beautifly crafted by mostly vast empty space. It's an interesting concept having the entire galaxy to explore, but in pratice it just doesn't work. There just isn't enough content "at this time" to justfy purchasing.\n\nMy biggest grip with this game is the amount of traveling it makes you do. Jumping into a star system and them spending 15 minutes aproaching a station at super cruise speed becuase you have to take the time to slow down, docking at stations gets old and repetative and while there is an auto dock module, if you flying a combat ship or smugler then you can't afford to waste the slot. Add on to the travel time the rediculous amount of times you'll get interdicted by the AI, and most of the time it doesnt even make sense, Why would a low tier viper indertict a fully kitted Vulture? Its like stoping your car on the train tracks and expecting the train to stop. I'm not exagerating when I say I get interdicted by the AI at least once every 10 minutes.\n\nCombat in this Game is very repetative and boring, burn the ememy shields, target the power core, take out their power core, rinse, repeat. If you make the mistake of shooting a civilian or federal ship on accident in the hectic combat zones then you get screwed over by the unforgiving AI who will imediatly turn on you.\n\nTrading is VERY boring, if the game had auto pilot it would still be boring, but it would be an acceptable grind. Trading in this game forces you to do the very boring, very tedious, very meaninless task of speeding up and slowing you ship down to approach stations. The longest station approach I've had in this game was 35 minutes. Yes that's 35 minutes of literally nothing but watching my speed and ETA. Also the game doesnt have good trading tool, you have to use a third party app in you internet browser to find good trade routes. If you're going to be a trader, don't forget to bring a book.\n\nExploration sucks, there's nothing special out there, nothing worth exploring, you have the whole galaxy and 99.99% of is  empty nothingness. There are no rare or fasinating things to find like magnatars or supernovas or gamma ray bursters, or pulsars. Once you've seen about ten star systems you've pretty much seen them all. But there are black holes, so thats kinda cool... I guess...\n\nThe only profession that I have had any semblence of "fun" is illegal smuggling. Smuggling is high risk high reward, smuggling a cargo hold of slaves 450 light years with pirates and feds after you the whole time can get pretty intense. I once lost an entire load into a star becauase a pirate interdicted me the second I droped out of my jump and the overheat to my ship caused my cargo hold to malfuntion and vent all my slaves one by one into the sun.\n\nTL;DR: beautiful game, boring gameplay,  not enough content","April 1","false","55.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Its made NPC's difficult for seasoned pilots.  Random encounters would spell trouble for new pilots.  NPC's interdict and attack for no reason.  Some are interdicting and attempting to steal cargo from a ship that doesn't even have cargo holds?  Did 2.1 go through any sort of testing process before it was carelessly tossed out the door?  The engineers update seems tacked on and unnessessary.  It almost makes the game pay-to-win as people without the expansion will miss out on upgraded components.\n\nThere are a number of different activities you can do, such as bounty hunting (make sure you have plenty of lube), trading, smuggling (though that was nerfed into the ground as well), mining and exploration.\n\nExploration seems thew most active segment community.\n\nEVERYTHING is a major grind, which sucks a lot of the fun from the game.","June 4","false","376.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Unfortunately the good news ends there.\n\nPros\n------\nFlight control is great\nCompatability with  numerous HOTAS and flight sticks\nOculous rift\nImmersion\nSound design\nArt\nShip Designs\netc.\nJust overall the base game is great and i thoroughly enjoyed getting into dogfights.\n\n\nThe bad news however is that the DEV team has no clue what they're doing.\n\nCons\n-------\nP2P NETWORKING: This means there are 0 server checks for their code. Simple hacking like memory editing your shield to be unbreakable is easily achievable. Anything you can think of is pretty much a hack in this game. Infinite ammo, infinite power for modules, etc etc. Combat logging is a huge issue with this networking structure as well. If anyone is flying around a multimillion credit ship and is a risk of losing it they can just ALT+F4 the process and they are immediately removed from space. Visually their ship will hang there for a few moments but you wont be able to damage them any further and then it will shortly disappear. They can then log into solo mode and fly to the nearest station and repair with no issues. The sad part is that the DEVs condone this behavior and say that it isnt a cheat.\n\n\nSOLO/OPEN MODE: Open mode is where you can pilot through the Elite universe and are able to interact with other Commanders (players). This is of course the most fun mode due to random instances other people can create. For traders it would be the risk of running into other players roleplaying as Pirates and for Pirates it would be other players hunting them roleplaying as Bounty Hunters. Unfortunately not only does instancing as i stated above ruin the possibilities of having player interaction the balance between SOLO play and OPEN play do too.\nThere is 0 incentive for any trader to trade in open because there is no buff to gains made while trading in open. So typically the best way to make money is to trade in SOLO mode while binging on netflix and then when you want to pvp you bring a fully decked out 200 million+ credit  combat ship to open and have your way till insurance makes you poor again and then do it all over.  The DEVs also have stated that this will not be changed and they have no plans to everr change it. Go ahead, google it. This ultimately means trading is the one true profession in this game because thanks to SOLO it can't be stopped. Which means PIRACY goes out the window as a lucrative position due to the rarity of targets.\nAnd due to that bounty hunting is only viable in resource sites where there is npc pirates. BTW thats broken too. as in you have to reset it multiple times to get the instance you want. SORRY!\n\nI also feel i should mention that everything anyone does in SOLO affects powerplay in OPEN. So the PVE only playergroup MOBIUS who has thousands of members could potentially outpush every other group because they only play solo. They cant be stopped. Brilliant faction gameplay 1/10.\n\n\nCONTENT: There is a serious lack of content. out of all the hours ive played i never gave a damn about the progressing background story. I never felt interested in the POWERPLAY update. The weapons that were for tier 3 or so of your powerplay rank were never tested in the beta for powerplay and thanks to that they were released as trash. the way some factions weapons operate also make 0 sense for that faction. Why do pirates get a weapon for shield stripping thats only effective if you're literally kissing the enemy ship? But the police faction get a weapon perfect for piracy. a hit to a module will shut that module down for a few seconds at range.\npowerplay was paraded around as a huge content update but it turned the incredibly grindy nature of Elite into even more of a grind. You either mine for credits, trade for credits or res farm for credits. i could actually go far enough to call this space farming simulator. Only difference is that this has pewpew.\n\noh and by the way they did everything they could to discourage you from taking part in powerplay. once you join a faction get ready to evade interdictions as often as 5 times in one minute. The spike in NPC hostility is INSANE once you join a faction. Its almost not even worth it. Even in your factions home system you will be interdicted religously by enemy faction NPCs that just roam around and chill there. IT MAKES NO SENSE.\nYour faction HQ will also not even be aligned with the type of heirarchy that your faction parades around as.\nOne of the FEDERATION factions home system is claimed as INDEPENDENT..... what!?\n\nCQC: This isnt even out yet but there was a QA for the DEVs that they released on their forums that was incredibly discouraging.\nThere was a lot of speculation that CQC (because its a dedicated pvp arena) would be released without p2p networking and there would be dedicated servers.\n\nBIG FAT NOPE! They're gonna hold fast to their p2p structure and release a broken pvp arena mode. Hackers welcome.\n\n\n\nTRAILERS: Holy ♥♥♥♥. They are the most misleading videos. The game is literally nothing like any of their trailers. fighting around stations wont happen. There's a zone enveloping every station that penalizes you if you shoot near it and if you manage to hit the station you're just dead, Station guns will just annhiliate you.\nthe WINGS video. Things never go down like that. You got valuable cargo and 3 guys staring down that hauler? Well see when more people show up, as soon as the first shot is fired the most effective way to stop them is to, well, gib that cargo hauler. In an actual hold up once those wingmates fired that hauler would just get lit up, No fancy manuevers in that fat ship.\n\nSo for my final statement ill just say the games fun, but not $60 worth of fun. Get it on sale. Perferably 50% off or more.","August 10, 2015","false","717.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Once you get a HOTAS or at least a Flight Stick, it will make things much easier. Playing this game without a flight stick is like playing a FPS without a mouse.\nThe best thing about this game is that it's a sandbox... the size of our galaxy. Seriously.\nSome of the celestial bodies are beautiful to behold.\n\nOverall score 9/10 - I paid full price and got my money’s worth.\n\nWhat could have made this game perfect:\nOther professions besides combat, like exploration, trade, and mining can get tedious and boring. Don’t get me wrong, these professions are here for the people who don’t want to combat and put their ship at risk. It’s the slow and steady way to earn your way in the game… but sometimes it’s too slow.\n\nWhat makes this game awesome:\nThe ship selection and almost endless ship customization and upgrades really add to the game. Where this game really shines is Flying and Combat/bounty hunting. Combat is top notch and can get extremely complex. You can take down enemies with sheer force, and you can even take down enemies stronger than you with your skill. There is so much to do during combat, it doesn’t get boring.\nGraphics and sound are also top notch.
