Yet after I finished it for a while, I found myself thinking back to it. A lot of people say the story is too simple, but given time to think, the very simplicity and openness of the story to be what makes it so great. There are a lot of good stories but conciseness is a virtue. The choices in this story may just say something meaningful about life.\n\nThe first time I read it, I also thought the story was too simple and all too familiar myself. A lot of Chinese student videos and soap operas like to visit the theme of the street vending dreamer. The "bad endings" are not fleshed out. The "good ending" might not make sense at first.\n\nBut alas. I am quite the fan of these art student type stories. I like to ponder them. First, I found it amusing that the artist inserted himself into the story. Then I felt the same struggles that he must feel being an artist trying to make an impact in this world. We dream a dream so different from life. And yet life is like a dream.\n\nI had a dream about this story. This story is like life: the life of the artist, the lives of us, choices we make, our endings in our own stories, the stories of our dreams and of our lives.\n\n\n*****Spoilers below*****\n\nThe choices. Yes you either make the right choice, or you are forced to go back and then make the right choice. But these choices are they not the choices we face every day? These choices in our lives that sometimes we don't feel like we want to choose what society tells us to pick. Sure I sleep in one day, or I can not help someone out one day, but what is the path that we chart in our lives that will lead to our dreams? To be able to make the right choice when it matters, is it not best to make the right choice whether it matters or not?\n\nThe "good ending" is random. Maybe. Is life not random? Do our dreams really make so much sense? To bring together a dream and daily life, something magic has to happen. It's randomness of life that allow for dreams. The randomness of dreams that let us live. That is the ending that I found.\n\nA story worth revisiting when I wake up again.","January 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 122 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","122","139","15","7"

It is short and it will take only 20 minutes of your time and it arguably has cute graphics/music.\n\nEvery choice you make can result in either a continuation of the story or in a bad ending; however the "right" decisions are pretty obvious.\n\nThe story isn't very interesting and even more so, some elements are fitted in to advertise the developer company. And the ending is very abrupt. As usual with this kind of games, there are some grammar mistakes here and there or some awkward translations.\n\nAlso, don't expect any nudity :)\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","February 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","94","66","70","16","3"

I do not know the exact number.\nSecondly i stand on a neutral ground for this visual novel. Meaning yes i do recommend it but to a certain extent. (Go to the bottom for reason of standing on a neutral ground)\nThirdly this is a FREE visual novel, hence being very short is not a issue here because it will take you around 5 - 15 minutes to read finish.\n\nThe storyFollow Vinty's life of chasing her dreams of being a famous in the world of calligraphy meanwhile dealing with pressure as things have not go in the direction she intended it to be.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual Elements - The chibi art style used is really cute and the backround art feels average but it is alright.\nAudio elements - The music is alright very lighthearted and cute, it really goes well with the chibi art.\n\nReason for standing on a neutral ground is because the choices you make in this visual novel is being taken at face value and the events that take place happens to quickly. It is very realistic which is a good thing but there is no "build up" to the events.\nThen again it is a free visual novel and the developer have to fork out their own money to make this visual novel and it is created by a very small team, so we should appreciate the work the developer have put into.\n\nTo sum upI would recommend this visual novel to people who want something sweet and short.","September 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","48","57","2","0"

Vinty dreams that one day, she will be famous and everyone would admire her. However, snapping back to reality, she is just a normal person who's self-confidence is pretty much shattered.\n\nThroughout the novel, you will also have to make decisions when you encounter an event. There is a right or wrong answer so you might want to save your game before you make a decision (just to make life easier). Without Within is good for a nice read and it also shows that not everyone is exactly kind to anyone's passion. There will be nice people and there will be mean people.\n\nIn the end, the story was rather short, which was a bit of a disappointment, but it is still a good read that might take you less than 20 minutes.\n\nI heard the developer will "expand" on Without Within so I have my hopes high for this visual novel.","March 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","35","38","4","2"

The protagonist is an aspiring, struggling calligrapher who has to make ends meet working a crappy job so she can pay for her crappy apartment so she can try to find success as a calligrapher. However, she realizes that she had been so focused on success that she lost sight of her passion for her art. Calligraphy, and the story itself, is obviously a metaphor for what this game developer has gone through, but I thought it was well written with nice artwork and an appropriate sense of self deprecation. Plus, I laughed out loud at the ending. It was truly hilarious in the context of the story.\n\nVery well done, free to play title, and one I definitely recommend trying out.

I'll be honest by saying that I only tried this VN on a whim.\n\nThe story is about a young woman named Vinty who is trying to establish herself as a proclaimed calligrapher.\n\nPros:\n\n-Story: As you read through, you personally will be able to relate to her sorrow, her anger, general misfortunes, and happiness if you've been in the same shoes as her. You can really feel the emotion and soul that the writer put into creating this story; I'll safely say that Vinty is a representation of the writer themself. Due to risk of spoilers I won't tread futher.\n-Visuals: The visuals are colorful and cheerful throughout the VN, putting a light mood even on moments that would normally not be happy. Good for the story that this VN is.\n\nCons:\n\n-Choices: Well, it can be, or it can be a Pro depending on how you view it. In the VN, you have to make choices and the choices are either correct or game over. Getting game over screens were an interuption on the immersion experience (to me), but as a general rule of thumb you just gotta be the well-natured person that Vinty is and you'll do fine.\n-Abrupt Ending: The other being that when I was approaching the ending, I was laughing with abandon at what was going on in the story, and then it ended. Just like that. But I hear a sequel is in the making so that more than makes up for it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe feels I have for this VN are the same that Vinty had for her video game (P.S. it was a good feeling). If you read this VN you'll know what I mean, and you will likely have the same feels. And yeah, this review took longer to write than it took to read this VN, but for 10 minutes of your time, why not peel your eyes away from those trashy celebrity shows and give this free gem a go?","March 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","13","19","3","7"

Yeeaaahhh... world's greatest calligrapher...\n\nOK. Sure. Why not?\n\nYou'll follow her and her innermost thoughts over a couple of days as she tries to sell her works, hold down an unfulfilling job and deal with her crotchety, old landlady to boot. Oh, and depending on the choice you make, also prevent a small boy from being bummed to death. I like the way the game gives you choices at a handful of points throughout, making the right one will eventually deliver you to the final, good ending, while making the wrong choice will result in something bad happening and end the game. It adds a little something extra to what could easily be a very linear experience, being a visual novel. Or at least that's what I've found with what's admittedly so far been a very brief flirtation with the genre. Though games like this make me want to try more.\n\nThe art style is kinda minimal but still pleasing, and the character design beyond adorable (I especially love her eyes which appear to be two thick lines made of brush strokes. A really nice touch to the character). Vinty could probably have come across as a little entitled or maybe even a tad petulant were she not so lovable, thanks in no small part to the clever and astute writing. I guess these games largely live or die based on the quality of the writing (at least if it's not relying on drawings of boobs and weird squealing audio, as this one isn't), and this game most definitely blossoms from it. It's self-aware and referential without beating the player/reader over the head with it, and is funny and interesting enough to keep them engaged 'til the end, which will only be about 15 or 20 minutes, even seeing all the endings.\n\nSo if you have some time to spare and want to have a brief, pleasant read of something cute and whimsical, then it's well worth giving this freebie a shot. Even though it's only the story of a small time chaligrapher, you brush off this stroke of inkredible genius at your own peril.","December 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

But then I remembered all the doujin novels I read over the past few months and decided to give this game a chance.\n\nI got the best ending on my first try. Even after getting all the bad endings, the game took me only twenty minutes to beat. Unlike all the other doujin visual novels I've played, nothing was unlocked after I beat it, which was quite disheartening.\n\nStill, I like the art, and the music is okay. But the best part about this game was the message. It's a message that I feel applies to the whole concept of doujin novels as a whole: It's never about the presentation or story length, it's about having the passion and heart to get a message across. And that is why I recommend this novel, because I did not like doujin novels for their production values or story length. I liked them because they had a charm to them that most triple-A titles lack.\n\nWay to go, InvertMouse.","February 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game draws easy parallels between pursuing caligraphy and pursuing creating visual novels (or art in general), with small self-depreciating observations that feel unneeded in a game that rewards being optimistic.\n\nSomewhat reminiscent of Sakevisual's "Ripples" but only in its inevitable path to the positive. In the end it comes across more like a semi-random string of quick events tied together by an obvious message. It feels like the few chances it has to state the message are dilluted by hints of jealousy or perhaps awkward phrasing.","January 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Made by small team of developers, yet it still has humour, wishes, expectations and all emotions, which are present in our lives. Lets see in detail this short lovely game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Cute animations\n+ Good story design\n- Short time\n- Fullscreen is clunky\n\nAnimations and story was perfect. There were choices, I think my most favourite part was playing the Sunflower War (that joke was hilarious, I like, when authors are able to make fun of themselves).\n\nOnly negatives were a little short time and fullscreen resolution is not optimized well. But this negatives are just a small scratch on a perfect facade of the game.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Vinty\n+ Good actions are rewarded\n\nI think everyone of us is a bit similar to Vinty. We desire for success, fame and respect, but we have to fight our everyday struggles. I like, that when I gave a chance to good action, I got rewarded. Thanks!\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Decent\n\nBy the visual side, game has no faults. Enjoyable, childish shoujo style. Suits this title well.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Limited, yet fine\n\nThere are only few tracks, but they complete and enhance the atmosphere. Good work, even better, than some big studios.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWithout Within is a humble title, that deserves its score. Made by a small team, perfect idea from Invetmouse, other members did well too! Do you want to live one day as an artist or calligrapher? Well, here is your chance.\n\nStrongly recommended.","January 21","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Visual Novels and RPGs usually require commitment and the lack of achievements usually leads to a lack of incentive on my end.  Of course, after hearing it's short, I decided to boot it up.  This ended up being a repeat of the Port of Call experience to prove me wrong.  HOORAY!!!!  :D\n\nThis is a short game with multiple endings.  Choose the right path and the story continues, choose the wrong path and the story ends immediately and hillariously (well, all save for 1 or 2).  The comedy's rich and the protagonist is enjoyable and relatable.  To be honest, I kinda' see myself in her.  She kinda' makes me want to get back into drawing and writing again...did Vinty teach me a valuable lesson?  Hmm....\n\nIf time is a concern, the main story is about 15-20 minutes long (about half of a 30 minute cartoon).  If you're a slow reader, it may take you up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe musical score is fitting and pleasant to listen to, the artwork is like a breath of fresh air, and the story is a welcome sight.  I smiled and had a warm feeling inside after reading this short story.  My hat's off to you, Invertmouse.  Bravo!!!\n\n\nFrom a critical standpoint, I'm thinking of where some flaws lie....I'm tempted to find some sort of flaws or room for improvement.  Where are the flaws?  WHERE ARE THE FLAWS?!  Maybe a lack of a gallery...or maybe achievements?  Wait...it's fine without achievements!!!   ....Arrrrrgh!  I want to 9/10.   Nnnngh.... Oh forget it!!!  This jewel deserves the full praise!!!!!!\n\n10/10  A short experience you're missing out on if you haven't looked into this hidden gem yet!!!","April 22","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It features soft, well-drawn artwork, a great soundtrack, and a lovable main character that leaves you wanting more. Despite the minimal playtime, I found Without Without thoroughly enjoyable and encourage any visual novel lover to give it a chance.\n....\nThe story follows Vinty, a down-on-her-luck girl trying to become a calligraphy artist. During her journey she’s met nothing but adversity and the story is just a segment of her life as she attempts to conquer her own feelings of hopelessness.\n.....\nThe main menu was the first bit of brilliance that I ran into. The artwork is adorable, the opening theme is soothing, and the interface is very simple and easy to use.  Within only a few seconds of loading the game the novel had grabbed my attention and positioned itself as “not your average indie VN” in my head. The only issue I found with the menu and interface was the stark contrast of the button click soundbyte and calm background music. It was too sharp and loud; a softer sound effect would have fit much better.\n....\nAs I loaded into the game the soundtrack grabbed my attention for a second time, leading me nicely into some simple, yet cute, artwork and starting off the story in a rather amusing fashion. Throughout the entire novel, the soundtrack never disappoints and always fits the mood of each scene perfectly.\n....\nThe soundtrack wasn’t the only thing that made the atmosphere of Without Within, however. The art style was soft, simple, and cute and really lent itself to the story in a way that most generic visual novels don’t often do. When you combine art with music, the result is a wonderful atmosphere that does a great job amplifying the simplicity of the story.\n.....\nSpeaking of the story, the only word I can really use to describe this one is charming. It has a few funny moments, a sad moment here and there, and some great bits that really dig their way into your brain and just make you feel good. I found myself involuntarily smiling many times throughout my first playthrough, connecting with the main character and her melancholy life on a personal level.\n.....\nInvertMouse really outdid themselves on Without Within, and despite my negative predisposition going into the story, I couldn’t help but love every bit of it. The simple artwork, fitting soundtrack, and heartwarming plot all came together to create a beautiful work of art. I highly encourage anyone who enjoys Visual Novels to give Without Within a chance, because it’s not your average indie novel.\n.....\nYou can view more of my reviews on my blog at rowancross.wordpress.com.","February 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Just try every option.\n\nSo I tried the other options after successfully finishing the game.\n\nThe "bad endings" felt a little rushed to me, and the real ending unfinished. But not less enjoyable because of it.\n\nIn fact the game has some good points of "working-class/everyday/easy-to-understand" philosophy. "Simple thoughts, nothing really new or that profound" you could say about it, but are the simplest, most quotidian things the ones we pay less attention to, the ones we forget with ease. Quoting some lines from the game, "I had forgotten the last time I found joy in [whatever you love doing]. (...) All I obsessed over was how much, or rather how little, people paid attention to my efforts." I ask to you, fellow reader, Have you ever forgot about the purpose on doing what you love to do?\n\nNo need to answer me in a comment, just answer yourself.\n\nAs a response to the negative reviews I've read, I quote something from the game again, "I had every intention of tossing this game aside. I kept demanding excitement without offering an ounce of passion in return. If I played my part, I might be able to discover so much more."\n\nIt's short? Yes.\nIt feels incomplete? It does.\nBut it delivers a simple yet charming story, and the dev announces here that more of Vinty's adventures are planned for the future, along with some kind apologies about the game's length.\n\nI almost forgot commenting, the soundtrack is cute, and it goes very well with the rest of the game.\n\nI also found myself related to Vinty when she buys the game just because how the shop's employee was gazing at her lol.\n\nI hope this review has been useful.\n\nFor the dev team, thanks for making this nice and lovely VN.","January 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(I know you'll read this eventually since you seem to be following fan feedback very closely from what I've seen :D)\n\nSo I saw this game on the Steam front page and I figured "Well hey! It's a free game and judging from the reviews it doesn't take that long to complete!" So I installed and played it.\n\nIs it absolutely amazing? Eh I wouldn't say so. Did I feel that it was worth my time? 100% so and maybe even more than that!\n\nWhen I walked away from Without Within I felt not the amount of immense triumph and satisfaction that I get from the best games ever made but instead a small warm feeling at the pit of my heart.\n\nI am currently a Master's student in Taiwan (So yes I speak Chinese :D) who is pursuing a degree in digital software, and gaming in general so I have felt more or less the experiences a creative person goes through. It is not uncommon to lose sight that you do what you do simply because you love it. It's unfortunate but it happens.\n\nAfter playing Without Within though I experienced a nice slice of a relatable experience through Vinty's short little journey. Despite the fact that being supported is every artist's dream one should not forget the reason that you started off: Because you love it. Vinty lost her way for a moment and I'm happy to see that she found it back.\n\nWhen you love what you do it will show in your work and that will be what gives it its soul.\n\nIf I want to be a bit critical I would say that the biggest current problem may be in the pacing of the story. The story tends to jump around an awful lot and scenes don't seem to pan out properly before they go on into the next one. Also many of the endings seem to cause the game to end very abruptly which just leaves me sitting there baffled at what had just transpired. It's seemingly a small problem but one that bogs down the experience from being a much better one. It can be easy to lose sight of pacing as an author of a work so lots and lots of beta testing will definitely help one stamp out errors such as these in the final release!\n\nEven with that being said though I liked the 10 minutes that I spent with this game. So...thank you InvertMouse. Thank you for this short and relatable experience. I wish you the very best of luck in your future endeavors! :D\n\nI will be sure to tell my friends about this game and tell them to go check it out for a nice little 10 minutes!\n\nAnd for all my fellow gamers who happen to be reading this....the game is free!

I generally don't care that much for visual novels as there aren't a lot that are well written and presented. This pulled me in with the kawaii look of it, but definantely not by the just barely 22 second long trailer. However it still made me stick around for the story when I became pulled into wanting to find out what happens to the female protagonist, Vinti.\n\nYou start with one of the cliche' dream sequences and a very conceited main character, her 'fans' and her security guard only to be rattled awake by another cliche' of a cranky old landlord and brought back to the reality of the situation. Struggling aspiring artist, trying to make a living out of what she is passionate about.\n\nBeing quite creative myself, I can understand the struggles of an aspiring artist, it's critics everywhere and not very much praise, if any. I also found myself relating to her in the sense of the difficult hardships you face with trying to keep a roof over your head and food on the table, so I really enjoyed the direction of this, and it kept me playing right through. I felt for Vinti in quite a few cases, and other times I found myself wanting to swat her ego down to size. It really is an immersive story with good character development.\n\nIt's pretty quaint for a visual novel, though I personally had a bit of an issue with the interface text overlay/hud  taking away from the art of the game but even that can be easily forgiven as it's only a mild annoyance.\n\nMy gripe does not even lie with the fact the game barely gave me 20 minutes of story, even with reading fairly slowly, afterall it is a free-to-play. My gripe lies with the fact that the story ends so abruptly, with not explination, cliffhanger or typical ending. It just... ends. My last complaint is with the fact the game was only released yesterday and it already has a DLC, now after I finished playing this little number, it left me longing for more, when I turned to buy the DLC that annoyed me just a short while ago, I find it's not even an extra add on to the story that just ended so abruptly. I thought it may of being a cheap way of making people pay for the rest of the story, but that was not even the case. Quite frankly, I would of been happy to pay an extra $2 to $5 dollars for a whole novel, or at least a continuation, as long as it would be more than 5 minutes worth.\n\nAll that aside, it won't take up much of your time to sit through and enjoy this nicely put together story, and I personally would still recommend it.","January 23, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend this, but not because it's -gay voice- ssssuper duper ssscooper cuuute. I recommend this because people really don't realize the fear and stress people have if they want to become a professional artist of any kind. This is essentially what we go through. Even if you aren't kicked to the dirt like poor Vinty, a lack of feedback in general can really hinder you. If you're an artist, this will speak to you directly for sure. For those of you that just don't get art.....maybe this will at least allow you to respect the ones that do. So in short, I guess I'm saying I recommend this because it's a funny little visual novel that speaks to everyone.\n\nOn a separate note, since this review and this visual novel is about art, I'll go ahead and post a link for anyone who's interested in music.

As far as I know, you won't find anything so simple in mostly VNs... But that's not half bad. It's actually pretty good.\n\nUsually, people try to make VNs with long story arcs, with deep messages and stuff. Without Within does the contrary and actually manages to be a nice game.

Short Yet Personable AVN.Genre: Anime Visual Novel\nDeveloped & Published by: InvertMouse\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Free.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nThis game is really short. I finished it in 20mins. When you finish a game that quickly, what is there to really to talk about? Well, other than it being an anime visual novel following a weekend in the life of a creator. No, it's not the most exciting or interesting concept you've ever been presented with. The game was originally created for the fans of the artist's original works and I came in not knowing anything about the creator or her work.\n\nPC Settings\nIncluded settings are basic with windowed/fullscreen mode, text reading speeds & language options. It runs, it doesn't crash and I didn't have any bugs crop up either. But with a game this short, I would certainly hope not. It's not too bad.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIts a day in the life of a struggling creator. I will admit that it does speak to me because I’m in a very similar boat. Is it worth playing? I'm 50/50 on it but as this is free, well, hard to say no. I think it's worth playing if you're a content creator or struggling artist because I think you'll sympathize with what the character is going through. I did take a look at the "bad" endings (I finished the game in one go on the good endings. It's not hard to figure out which choices are "right" and "wrong"). The bad choices were rather humorous if slightly exaggerated.\n\nRead this review and other AVN reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","February 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Short Yet Personable AVN.Genre: Anime Visual Novel\nDeveloped & Published by: InvertMouse\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Free.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nThis game is really short. I finished it in 20mins. When you finish a game that quickly, what is there to really to talk about? Well, other than it being an anime visual novel following a weekend in the life of a creator. No, it's not the most exciting or interesting concept you've ever been presented with. The game was originally created for the fans of the artist's original works and I came in not knowing anything about the creator or her work.\n\nPC Settings\nIncluded settings are basic with windowed/fullscreen mode, text reading speeds & language options. It runs, it doesn't crash and I didn't have any bugs crop up either. But with a game this short, I would certainly hope not. It's not too bad.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIts a day in the life of a struggling creator. I will admit that it does speak to me because I’m in a very similar boat. Is it worth playing? I'm 50/50 on it but as this is free, well, hard to say no. I think it's worth playing if you're a content creator or struggling artist because I think you'll sympathize with what the character is going through. I did take a look at the "bad" endings (I finished the game in one go on the good endings. It's not hard to figure out which choices are "right" and "wrong"). The bad choices were rather humorous if slightly exaggerated.\n\nRead this review and other AVN reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","February 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a mostly lighthearted tale with plenty of comedy throughout. Binary choices appear here and there in which one option will lead to a "bad end" after a few lines while the other will continue the story.\n\nBetween the price (free) and the short length, even if you end up hating Without Within, it's no big loss and is thus easily recommended, especially since I consider it to not be bad at all.","January 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I haven't gotten around to the DLC yet, although I intend to eventually.  While the game is incredibly short, all in all it was enjoyable.\n\nAside from the length, the one thing that bothers me about Without Within is the decision tree.  (Somewhat spoilers) every decision in the game either leads to the next decision (or the good end) or a bad ending.  If you choose "right", the story continues, and if you choose "wrong", the game proceeds to one of the bad endings almost immediately, with no buildup or other choices.  The story branch that takes you to the good ending is rather enjoyable and quite easy to get, but the bad endings are all dreadful - not because they make you feel bad, but because there's simply no story in them, and the game just ends.

Plays like a simplistic "choose your own adventure" book were are prompted to make decisions during key moments in the story. Choose wisely and the narrative continues, but if you select poorly the tale concludes in a heart-wrenching finale.\n\nThe likable protagonist resembles the star of Watamote, both in terms of appearance and her delusions of grandeur. Overall I can highly recommend Without Within. The artwork is cute whilst the script manages to be humorous and motivational for anyone who has hit an impasse in pursuing their dreams. If you enjoy visual novels it is certainly worth a go, especially as it costs nowt and isn't a huge time investment.","January 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Loading this into a visual novel engine was overkill; like many other indie free visual novels I've played, the save and load functions provided by the engine were never utilised. It would've been far better as a story or a short manga composition.\n\nThe story is still funny and charming, nevertheless, with a hint of admiration for memes. I got the good playthrough in one try (maybe because I'm a good person and picked the good option for each decision, lol); trying out the other options showed me that there was only one path to succeed in the game. Not much effort in terms of building a plot. Picking a bad option rewarded you with a few blocks of text and a trademark "BAD END" (thank goodness with no gruesome imagery; 'tis a cheerful and innocent VN).\n\nI recommend it because it's free, is well drawn and is a nice 5-10-minute treat to enjoy in our otherwise rather depressing world. The plot itself ultimately serves only to preach moral values, probably Chinese in origin: Be patient, be pacifist, be optimistic, be good, do not commit prejudice... and ultimately, to always put your heart into your work and remember the reason why you do the things you do; that if it was born out of love, keep that love first and foremost, never to be forgotten.\n\n360/420\nEyecandy\n\n*EDIT* Few things I forgot to mention: There are little loading screens / scene separators that aren't coloured, instead being rather beautiful sketches. Seeing one shows that you're in the right track towards the good end.\n\nThere is also Without Within 2, which is being sold for $5.50. I have not played it, but I am fairly confident that this game is supposed to be an introduction and advertisement for that. If you like this VN and have money to donate to good artists, consider keeping an eye on that.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game clocks in to be around 15 minutes to an hour-ish depending on the choices you make in the game. I happened to choose all the correct choices my first playthrough resulting in a 15 minute completion time, but the game was very well made and very stylized despite its length.\n\nWithout Within's story is very relatable and contains a few morals that anyone can value. The dialogue was funny, cute, and well written with a few choices here and there that can ultimately bring you down a different story path. The soundtrack and sound effects were nicely composed and blended well with the scenes, thus adding more life into the story. The art and animation is, hands down, one of the strongest features of the game. The art is reminiscent of many animes (Lucky Star comes to mind) and the animation helps to liven up the scenes a bit so that they aren't too static.\n\nThe developer has confirmed that they are working on a sequel to Without Within and I am definitely looking forward to learning more of Vinty's story.\n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely recommend Without Within to anyone since it is short and not too heavy on the reading. It provided me with a cute story in 15 or so minutes and I couldn't ask for anything more especially since it was free! Everyone should definitely check it out!","May 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","3"

I loved that cute little flashback scene it has personality to it and was fun to watch the little animation of her appearing.\n\nProblems I had: The visuals quality fluxuates from looking great like the flashback where it hads tons of personality to iffy like the scene with the old lady were it felt plain along with the old lady's razor sharp point hairline. XD (The little anime figurine the girl had was out of place in the scene it is in as well)\n\nI don't really like the main charcater, because at times she acts a little too over the top that it doesn't feel relatable. She calls people peasents in her dreams in the beginning, seeing herself on almost everywhere she goes, and even calling a guy a troll for not liking her calligraphy. (He was not a troll, city people tend to be rude like that regradless who you are, just ask anyone XD)\nIt just too much of her visualizing herself on everything, she even does this on the game she buys too.\nThat aspect of her wanting big for her calligraphy was hammered in too much, that it came off as her being egostical, which I know wasn't its intention.\n\nShes also not a very bright person, she just got paid and spent her RENT MONEY which was LATE already on a video game. (I do not think this plot point is addressed again if I remember correctly that she was 3 days late with rent) Which she then says visuals suck, and then begins to visualize her own artwork on it instead.\n(Dude she likes to imagines herself on everything, I can only imagine her wedding photo one day will just have her face pasted on both sides XD)\n\nThe biggest problem with the game was it was so very short, the ending don't take long to skim through bad ending or not. My play time was me going through it all and that was only 35 minutes.\n\n\nIts free so it is ok, I spent money on the DLC, and the visuals and all that are not improved in those ethier. I am sorry for ranting so long, but this has problems that if it gets a sequel needs to be addressed, so it can be the great game I know it can be","July 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

However since it is free, why not give it a try?\n\nI will start with the cons of the game. There is no proper resolution menu (the protagonist actually makes a joke about resolutions within the story) and it is too short, with the novel ending a little too abruptly.\n\nHowever, i really liked this visual novel. Every scene has great detail and the colours were great. As a result, i found myself to be pretty invested in the main character, to the extent of being really tempted to buy the extra edition in order to see more of the main character.\n\nIf you have 10 to 20 minutes to spare, go ahead and give it a try.","January 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although the choices do not branch out to alternate story lines, it is quite easy to follow the correct story line to the conclusion.\n\nThat said, the games story has a LOT of fuel for your average psychology student to look at.  The game seems to be a metaphor for the developers themselves.   The developers are (or is, I should say) Venti, who has chosen a field that isn't really one that has a lot of opportunity for fame and fortune, yet perseveres anyways because they are passionate about their work.  This game is an attempt to show people that their struggle as a game maker has meaning, at least to them.  To get this message out, they've made this game free.\n\nI hope you enjoy (or enjoyed) it too.","January 24, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every scene has great detail and the colours were great.

The developers are (or is, I should say) Venti, who has chosen a field that isn't really one that has a lot of opportunity for fame and fortune, yet perseveres anyways because they are passionate about their work.

Loading this into a visual novel engine was overkill; like many other indie free visual novels I've played, the save and load functions provided by the engine were never utilised. It would've been far better as a story or a short manga composition.\n\nThe story is still funny and charming, nevertheless, with a hint of admiration for memes. I got the good playthrough in one try (maybe because I'm a good person and picked the good option for each decision, lol); trying out the other options showed me that there was only one path to succeed in the game. Not much effort in terms of building a plot. Picking a bad option rewarded you with a few blocks of text and a trademark "BAD END" (thank goodness with no gruesome imagery; 'tis a cheerful and innocent VN).\n\nI recommend it because it's free, is well drawn and is a nice 5-10-minute treat to enjoy in our otherwise rather depressing world. The plot itself ultimately serves only to preach moral values, probably Chinese in origin: Be patient, be pacifist, be optimistic, be good, do not commit prejudice... and ultimately, to always put your heart into your work and remember the reason why you do the things you do; that if it was born out of love, keep that love first and foremost, never to be forgotten.\n\n360/420\nEyecandy\n\n*EDIT* Few things I forgot to mention: There are little loading screens / scene separators that aren't coloured, instead being rather beautiful sketches. Seeing one shows that you're in the right track towards the good end.\n\nThere is also Without Within 2, which is being sold for $5.50. I have not played it, but I am fairly confident that this game is supposed to be an introduction and advertisement for that. If you like this VN and have money to donate to good artists, consider keeping an eye on that.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I loved that cute little flashback scene it has personality to it and was fun to watch the little animation of her appearing.\n\nProblems I had: The visuals quality fluxuates from looking great like the flashback where it hads tons of personality to iffy like the scene with the old lady were it felt plain along with the old lady's razor sharp point hairline. XD (The little anime figurine the girl had was out of place in the scene it is in as well)\n\nI don't really like the main charcater, because at times she acts a little too over the top that it doesn't feel relatable. She calls people peasents in her dreams in the beginning, seeing herself on almost everywhere she goes, and even calling a guy a troll for not liking her calligraphy. (He was not a troll, city people tend to be rude like that regradless who you are, just ask anyone XD)\nIt just too much of her visualizing herself on everything, she even does this on the game she buys too.\nThat aspect of her wanting big for her calligraphy was hammered in too much, that it came off as her being egostical, which I know wasn't its intention.\n\nShes also not a very bright person, she just got paid and spent her RENT MONEY which was LATE already on a video game. (I do not think this plot point is addressed again if I remember correctly that she was 3 days late with rent) Which she then says visuals suck, and then begins to visualize her own artwork on it instead.\n(Dude she likes to imagines herself on everything, I can only imagine her wedding photo one day will just have her face pasted on both sides XD)\n\nThe biggest problem with the game was it was so very short, the ending don't take long to skim through bad ending or not. My play time was me going through it all and that was only 35 minutes.\n\n\nIts free so it is ok, I spent money on the DLC, and the visuals and all that are not improved in those ethier. I am sorry for ranting so long, but this has problems that if it gets a sequel needs to be addressed, so it can be the great game I know it can be","July 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

The story follows an aspiring calligraphist as she dreams of a lucky break that will put her on the path to becoming a legend in the calligraphy world. The problem is that EVERYONE tells her she sucks. Seriously. Every single person. So very soon it becomes clear that you are playing a delusional character who is following an unattainable dream. What's the point? After a few playthroughs, when she questions whether she should persevere, I wanted to shake her through the monitor and scream, "No! Quit already! This is utterly hopeless. Give up! Go do something else with your life!"\n\nVariety: Not much. Pretty linear. Your choices include things like "get out of bed or do not get out of bed" and "get angry or do not get angry". I might have missed something, but every choice I made ended in her varying degrees of failure or embarrassment.\n\nOverall review: 2/10. The two points are because the art is kind of cute, and the delusions of the main character are pretty amusing, until you realize she's wasting your time, hers and that of everyone else around her, and there is no option to making her quit her dream and get a job to actually pay her rent on time. But no ... let's keep sitting along the street and showcasing her terrible calligraphy and subjecting herself to public ridicule. Even if there's one rich person who is willing to pay for her work, there's no way she would ever be accepted by the general populace as being even competent, so what's the point?\n\nFinal thoughts: It disturbs me that so many people have given this such positive reviews that a paid sequel was released. The only way I would change this vote to a recommendation is if I found out this game had been developed by a frustrated parent that wanted to find another way to communicate to their deadbeat kid to get an effin' job.","November 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","2"

I understand the development team is small, but it took me maybe 10 minutes to finish the route that didn't go to a "Bad end" and I was convinced the game had glitched out and ended everything early. I took 7 more minutes to read through the results of other choices, but they all end the game in about 10 lines if you choose them. Heck, one of the bad ends is almost exactly like the true end.\n\nI'm fine with games made by small teams, but seriously, reuse some art assets and give me more to go on than 15 minutes or so of game that ends in some sort of bad end every single time. Also, it's fine to give the girl a fantasy, but could we have at least a tiny indication that she realizes her fantasy of being an INSANELY famous calligrapher is a little bit overblown? As it stands, I ended up thinking her relationship with reality was a bit...tenuous.","October 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However this will exploar why she became a love of calligraphy and the hopes and dreams that may still be possible.\n\nRecommended for those that enjoy V.N.'s. However this will be short so unless people are into this kind of stuff it's best to keep doing what that was fun.","August 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's pretty much "bad endings: the game". That said, it's a free intro to what I assume is a forthcoming full game.","August 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was about to rate this game negatively, as I had finally got the good ending very last, after getting every possible bad ending, but the good ending was everything I had hoped it would be. It sends a powerful message to creative people about staying positive in the face of adversity, and pursuing your dream for the loev of the craft, not the glamor of fame and fortune, another issue I faced when trying to pursue my own dream. I also loved Vinty's personality. I laughed out loud several times while playing. My favorite part of the game was the end of the good ending. I wish I had come across this game a lot sooner.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only takes a few minutes to beat/lose. Actually managed to cheer me up after I had been feeling a bit down. It's mostly story driven and theres only a few choices to make in the game but if you have some time to kill and want to lighten the mood a bit this is great.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm_l1r1Gcko","November 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
