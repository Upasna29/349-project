AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIts either check fest or raise the AI and they fold. Always re-raise them, they always fold most of the time and that is how i win easily. If you are chip leader always re-raise for the total of their chips = Ai folds. For the dev if I am chip leader and put all in 300 chips when the Ai only has 55 chips than I should not loose the game. I should only lose 55 chips. That is how pokers works. Anyways not much of a poker game or sexy game. Only 4 pictures.

AI was utter garbage and made the game extremely tedious. If you have even a mildly good hand and raise the minimum, they all fold. And vice versa, if they have an extremely good hand, they just keep checking half the time. But at least there were pretty anime girls to look forward to right? Nah, a few characters with one pose and no animations, and 4 extremely average looking pictures.\n\nIf you want pretty anime girls, go somewhere else.

You can win just about any hand with the two pair this game gives you. (Insert more inuendo here).\n\nWe were provided a review copy of this one, thinking I might get to show my poker prowess was my first mistake. I quickly realized that the AI is less interested in poker than showing me some huge glorious round anime eyes. They draw the eyes so well. Apparently these lusty busty ladies cannot see over their back pain causing chests to their cards, possibly explaining the horrible play involved.\n\nIf you are looking for a poker game, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a game with some anime drawings of superhuman breast models and a few trading cards, have at it. Cannot firmly suggest this one. It's just a bit of a limp game.

This time, they bring a much more familiar game to the table: Poker! The joy of understanding this game quickly faded after playing a few rounds against the AI though. Pot commitment is the biggest thing it completely lacks in my opinion, which results in some very unrealistic and derpy moves.\n\nIf you ask me if I would prefer playing poker against sweaty men or pretty girls I would choose the latter, but when the AI can't even get the core of the game right there's pretty much no reason to play it. Unfortunately the game devs aren't known to add major changes to their games after release (example: not adding a proper tutorial to the Mahjong games which the majority of players asked for), so I'm afraid that this game will also end up not being played after extracting the Steam cards from it. However, if the AI does improve in the future then I will change this to a thumbs up review.\n\nCurrent verdict: Stick with the sweaty men.

The A.I. is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and they just fold everyhand and won't shut the ♥♥♥♥ and talk nonstop.\n\nIn Short, don't buy this game it's terrible, almost reaching brickforce levels of bad.

Really, that's it. Think DOAX poker, with the eventual motionless picture of a hottie celebrating her victory when she wins. Very nice hotties, let it be said. Too bad nothing more risqué, though.\n\nI bought the game on sales for $1,50. That's a fair price for what I was delivered, and on that basis, I can recommend it. Do not pay more! Otherwise you'll regret your decision.\n\nIt's that kind of game where you turn down its music, put up your own tunes, and chill out emulating your own casino with pretty girls by your side while you sweep the board.\n\nBTW, the people nagging about the difficulty obviously didn't make it past the first half of the girls. You'll have to stop and analyze for a few seconds. Nothing too fancy, but as I said, a nice distraction to chill out and feel like a boss.","May 1","true","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

So why might the maker of  CASUAL game make an exploit in the betting system of a game like poker? Because some poor slob just wants to play a game of poker with Nao (see profile picture). This is what you are meant to do to have fun in this game: 1) You might get a flush because you were dealt two spades therefore you bet 4 chips; 2) Two more spades "flop" down and you bet another four chips; 3) A diamond is dealt next and you "check" versus betting again; 4) A heart is dealt last, but you stay in the game because you have the Ace of Spades and you are hoping you can take the hand with the high card.  The AI for betting is not great, but you'll learn the game of poker if you play the "Pretty Girls" version.
