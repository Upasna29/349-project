The game includes a basic character editor that allows you to customize the look of your character as well assigning stats.  The game includes basic stats, 2 extra traits, and a race/class that assigns extra bonuses like starting items and shop discounts.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, intuitive and fun.  It consists of moving, jumping, double jumping, attacking, and using items.  I had a lot of fun just jumping around, exploring, and attacking everything. While it’s simple to control, Magicite is still a challenge.  Death is permanent, so when you die, you start over again.  All of the biomes were neat to look at and felt unique.  The monsters of each biome all moved differently and didn’t feel repetitive.\n\nThe crafting system, resource collection, and item options are easy and work well but I felt it was a little too similar to other games in the genre.  In future releases I hope the developers differentiate themselves more in this category.\n\nAside from crafting and fighting, the player earns gold which can buy new items and experience which leads to level ups and new skills.\n\nIf you like a challenging scroller and can get past some similarities to other games, Magicite is really fun and I enjoyed my time with it.","February 11, 2014","true","10.0"," 444 of 501 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","444","501","0","6"

Seriously! Just remember these couple of tips that WILL save your ♥♥♥. I know they have mine.\n\n1.) Don't pick fights you can't win, especially when you just started in District one. Farm the mobs that don't fight back and proceed to the next area.\n2.) Get a Wooden Pick Axe and Sword as fast as possible. Then, get a bow as fast as possible. (You have to kill Spiders in the Forest District, or you have to get lucky with the cuttable grass on the ground to get the cowebs.)\n3.) Sometimes you just have to abandon that ore/chest that is surrounded by monsters. :/\n4.) Once you get a bow, proceed to ♥♥♥♥ everything. You will win most fights if you stay at a range.","February 11, 2014","true","32.6"," 228 of 259 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","228","259","0","8"

Some items could stand to sell for more, specially potions and crafted items. (Everything seems to sell for the same or about the same price)\n- Map randomization is bland, all maps have the same boring, horizontal design with different colors/backgrounds/trees. Could use more vertical variance along with different stage shaping.\n- Inventory management sucks since your inventory always feels one row too short, specially when opening treasure\n- Crafting system is clunky, time-consuming, and could use improvements (can't combine 2 sticks on the same square, this is made worse by the poor inventory space) Recipes for the more advanced items would also help.\n- Need to unlock ANY sort of customization, could add colors to characters?\n- Netplay is laggy for the player not hosting if your distance isn't short\n- Can revive teammate indefinitely in netplay with 1hp as long as one of you is alive\n\nI really want to like this game but it feels like an early access at the moment. Hopefully newer patches will make the game more fun and polished, but as it is right now it doesn't feel worth a full price.\n\nEdit: I have been unbanned after a discussion with the developer, take that as you will!","January 1, 2015","false","4.6"," 648 of 824 people (79%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","79","648","824","57","69"

Unlike most platformers this game isn't a rush and hack'n'slash. You have to craft your own weapons, potions and food in order to survive which sounds simple but can get challenging quickly.\nPlaying with more than one person we quickly found out if we didn't share our resources we would die within minutes. Also, the friendly-fire meant instead of just spamming the attack button we actually had to watch what we were doing/who we were attacking.\nThe crafting list already has a fair few items on it, I am sure you can find the list somewhere but I rather enjoyed guessing what would work with what, which gave the game a nice survival feel.\nThe game is hard though. If you're playing with others you will need a way to communicate, and being in Early Access in-game chat isn't implemented yet.\nAnd because this game is still Early Access there ARE bugs, but none that are gamebreaking (that I have encountered), it is fully playable, and enjoyable.\n\nSo far, I can't find much to fault about this game at all. The developer has been consistent with his work on the game but has also been consistent with his updates on Kickstarter too (19 since November 19th) which for me is always a good sign for games in Early Access.\nFor £6.99 you can't go wrong with a game this fun.","February 11, 2014","true","7.4"," 177 of 205 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","177","205","0","1"

As of the time of this writing, the game is still in Early Access, but there is a seemingly endless land for you to (attempt) to fight through as far as you possibly can, all the while gathering raw materials and crafting them (simple 1 & 1 combinations; think Resident Evil) into tools, weapons, armor, potions and more.\n\nThis is a roguelike, so if you get frustrated by dying a lot (and you will) and losing all of your progress in the blink of an eye (which will happen), this game may not be for you. Those who do enjoy roguelikes need no further explanation :) When starting, you create your character and have many unlockable hats, races and their variants to choose from. Don't worry, the hats actually do give your character unique abilities :P On top of this, the game also makes use of a "trait system" that gives each player two randomized traits (which you can re-roll) that do things like raise ATK, but lower DEF, cut down trees faster, brew stronger potions, increase DEX, etc.\n\nIf you make it to the end of an area, you will see 3 doors of varying color (which indicate the area type), each taking you to the next area's village where you can sell treasure, buy weapons, smelt ores, refine pelts and hides into leather for armor, and generally terrorize the locals and their chickens. Once you're geared up, you'll leave the village and repeat the process of trying to get to the end once again, only with harder enemies ;)\n\nEnough about the baseline details though...let's talk about actual gameplay! Generally speaking, you have the movement skills of a friggin' ninja; you can dash side to side, double jump, and even dash midair (several times if you have the stamina)! Mastering movement is one of the first keys to survival in Magicite; if you can't be hit, then you can't be killed (as easily). Other than your ninja-like abilities, every 5th level (I believe is the increment...don't quote me) you can choose a new skill from 3 paths to unlock and use to further aide in your adventure. These can be anything from a giant sword that shoots underneath you and propels you into the air (allowing for a triple jump, or even a quadruple jump if you have a special item), a fireball that you can shoot arrows at to make flaming arrows, berserker rage, to a protective aura that reduces all damage taken for everyone in your party.\n\nAt risk of spoiling more potential fun and shenanigans in figuring the various aspects of the game out just by playing (like me and my friends did), I'm going to end here. Pick up the game! Seriously, this is one of the most fun Early Access games out there, you will not be disappointed!","June 11, 2014","true","30.3"," 105 of 112 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","105","112","0","0"

The concepts are simple, and, once you figure them out, you can easily transition between roles with ease. The design is cutesy, simple, and implements the roguelike feel without that hatred of dying a cheap death. Very rarely have I had a feeling that I wasn't in control of my character and died to a cheap trick.\n\nNegative:\n\nThe game gives off the feeling of an indie title. While this can be a good feeling, when you've gone through and played several times, you can feel that there is nothing new to offer you, aside from a new playthrough with a different set of hurdles.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe game is good, but I will say it is not for everyone. If you like Terraria, Minecraft, and enjoy a good roguelike game, Magicite is a game you'll definitely be happy you paid $10 for.","November 7, 2014","true","102.5"," 106 of 118 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","106","118","8","2"

At least, I think it's the scourge. With various difficulties depending on how you play; the game challenges your ability to jump, double jump, aim, and not break things when the wasps come for you.\n\nYou can decide which starting "class" you would like to be, giving you various bonuses depending on your play style. Your stats can be adjusted with equipment, so changing up what you are doing as you are playing is entirely possible. Start out with hopes of being a wizard but find out you aren't up to snuff? Collect DEX gear and start shooting things. Find your aim is a bit off? Ditch the leather and go full out ATK for sword on fluffy, on claws, on blue glowing orbs of death fun.\n\nFor an even greater challenge, bring a friend. Mobs get harder and dying just gets more fun! Bring a whole lot of patience. You'll need it.\n\nThe game is fun and has significant replay-ability, especially if you like to collect all items available. I hope they eventually add-in trading cards or achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MichaelWilson/recommended/268750/","MichaelWilson","Michael Wilson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MichaelWilson/","667 products in account","Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Early Access Build 0.7.2. [2014/02/13]\nPlease understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Early Access Build 0.7.2 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development.\n\nIntroductionRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization or procedural generator and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving. With Magicite this concept is taken to its very sadistic core.\n\nSide-scrolling games are normally progressed by moving on the screen to the right or left to reach the end of the stage or meet some type of goal. Goals like ‘saving a princess’ from the big bad, but she happens to be in another castle. These games normally follow some type of gimmick, like the stage progresses on its own, timed, forcing you to advance.\n\nAlso with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.\n\nPlease note, this is /not/ a sandbox construction game due to just having crafting, you currently do not 'build' anything. If that is what your looking for, you are truely in the wrong castle.\n\nThis will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.\n\nConcept / FeaturesThis is a 2D Side scrolling Rouge-like with item crafting.\n\nRight now the game has currency which is dropped when monsters are killed along with experience points. Currency can be used to buy random items from towns, which are in between levels.\n\nYou create a character and can keep re-rolling stats with two perks before starting, after that you thrust into generated levels with death. Personally I kept generating until I has a perk which allows me to open chests without keys and kept raiding the dungeon stage due to high chest generation.\n\nIt has crafting related to inventory management; making weapons, armor and items. Beyond that this is not a sandbox and you do not build anything. Towns appear in between levels. If you stay on a level to long, well you’re going meet death.\n\nThe interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down, however it can be somewhat frustrating at the start due to it just throws the player into the mix without hints.\n\nMany functions are not implemented currently, like a crafting recipe log. However I’m sure they soon will be.\n\nWhen you reach level five, ten and 15 you are able to pick a level up spell/benefit which is accessed by using 1, 2 and 3 respectively from the keyboard.\n\nIn order to make armors you are going to need to collect ore and smelt it while in a town. You will need three of the same ingots to make the armor.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, however you must watch what you do and share resources otherwise, being doomed to fail comes to mind.\n\nAtmosphereQuick and to the point, much is not needed beyond the objective.\n\nThe art is decent and fits. The music is a mixed bag, the tracks are rather decent however I found myself wanted something more fasted paced. For some odd reason I pictured more of a old style arcade type feel for music, something like those action based games like funky fighter.\n\nStabilityThere are in game bugs related to items and crafting.\n\nOverall the game had very slight hangs, they where not consistent, not a major problem. It also /did not/ crash on older machines I tested with. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was decent and was not a complete resource hog allowing me to multitask by pausing with ESC.\n\nI also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run.\n\nWhile I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments.\n\nMultiplayer was decent, there is much talk about friendly fire, currently this feature feels like it hits home, and with the fact that this game is sadistic. While I do not think that Magicite should 'force' players to have to deal spacing of teammates and friendly fire, I feel that it should be and on and off switch for the host. While friendly damage is on there should be higher rewards or benefits beyond being up to the challenge.\n\nConclusionIf you like Rogue-like games, I would currently recommend this. If you do not like Rogue-likes I would not recommend this, since this game is truly sadistic at its core. If you happen to be the supreme overlord of your minions, *ahem* friends and are willing to subjugate them to wallow in punishment and death, the more the merrier.\n\nGameplay suggestions:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/268750/discussions/0/540733523379927400/\n\nEdit History2015/12/09: Formating.","February 13, 2014","true","9.9"," 112 of 132 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","112","132","0","4"

There's 20 stages in each run and between each run there's a mini-hub town that serves as a resting point. Prior to each run you create a character by picking a race, items and pets once unlocked.\n\nEach stage has 1 passive animal and about 2-3 enemy types, which gets quite repetitive very quickly.\n\nMy main issues with the game are:\n\n- No save method in between runs, once you start you are locked in and games usually take me 45-55 minutes to complete. You have to commit to this game, as quitting halfway through will result in nothing.\n\n- Characters, hats, and pets (each with their own distinct bonuses) are randomly unlocked (ie. 20% to unlock a new character once game is complete).  This forces multiple artificial playthroughs in the hopes of an unlock, and since you're playing with the same characters with limited choices on similar levels versus the same enemies, it's not fun\n\n- Combat is quite bland, there's 4 or so weapon types (1 handed swords, two handed swords, staffs, and a bow) and any differences are purely cosmetic/stat wise. You choose 3 magic skills when leveling up and most of them are not fun or useful.\n\n- The game handles healing in an odd way, forcing the player to eat food every couple of minutes for a 50% chance to heal 1 HP point or take a rare and hard to find healing potion (for 2 HP or 5 HP if you farm two potions). Most enemies will do about 4-8 damage per hit.\n\n- There is basic item crafting, yet the crafting menu is atrocious and with a severely limited storage space you'll find yourself running out of room quite quickly\n\n- The game has a weird love affair with random number generators- upon leveling you MAY or MAY NOT gain any stat points and again - not a fun game design choice.\n\nOverall, the game is limited by it's love for RNG and poor game design choices. There's very little depth to the game and an artificial barrier of difficulty as you hope to get a lucky roll when leveling or unlocking new items. Nothing carries over between saves or playthroughs, aside from characters/hats/pets which may or may never unlock after multiple hours.\n\nWould not recommend unless it was wicked on sale.","August 2, 2015","false","14.9"," 214 of 324 people (66%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","66","214","324","16","11"

It's not what it should be nor is it what it wants to be, yet.\n\nThis is a rogue-lite in its lightest form, providing hardly any differentiation between runs. The differences will be in the traits you obtain at levels 5/10/15, the items you get from chests (which are varied in usefulness, but are mostly similar and few) and of course mob drops/mob spawns. The layouts for each district follow a very strict pattern, involving massive sections next to each other as opposed to the standard 1x1 platform-style stage randomization. Each non-town district would blend into each other if it weren't for the differing biomes, which serve as alternate mob spawn pools for easier access to certain resources often at the cost of an increased difficulty.\n\nTowns in this game currently serve very little purpose outside of a few obvious fantasy tropes. You have the Blacksmith, the Tailor and the Leatherworker, the latter two having static and unchanging names. You also have two shopkeepers which offer normally pointless and randomized items from the shop pool. Tools and weapons being sold are typically out of your price range when you'd need them, and entirely skippable once you have the gold for them. There are sometimes potions on sale, as well as herbs and hilts for treeless runs (I'll mention it later) but other than those the item pool for the shops aren't fantastic. Finally, there's the Hoarder that allows you to sell your items, which you'd think would be absolutely useful... But the sell price for each and every item you'll get ranges from 1-3 gold depending on said item. Weapons don't offer large sell prices, nor do armors. The Hoarder is a very cheap man.\n\nThe main issue with shops (again) is that they're normally pointless as far as tools and weapons go. With enough experience and proper door selection, you'll almost ALWAYS find the resources you need to make shops irrelevant. Heck, normally the only thing I'm missing at the end of each run are rings (which fight against a rather large and annoying chest drop pool) and rarely one piece of armor. I can go ahead and find a friend to wear a miner's cap to completely resolve the ore deficiency we may have.\n\nFinally, Altars sometimes also spawn in towns, and are the only non-constant you'll find outside of giant chickens and normal chickens. (They're not worth talking about, food and potion drops if you're curious.) Altars are currently money sinks for the runs that offer their bounties long before the shops care to stock them, which is normally what happens as stated before. Altars cost 500 gold, which is a steep price for what they offer: A chance at a minimal stat buff, debuff or nothing at all. Rarely you'll earn a return to full health which is by far the best result most of the time, but the game is very stingy with both the spawn rate and good results of the Altars. By the time you have the money to trigger an Altar, you may not even find one... And sometimes they'll spawn when there's clearly no way you could have the money already without chopping every tree down. Normally, it's not worth the min-maxing.\n\n... Min-maxing... Forgot about that. This game's mechanics are often lacking fluidity. Min-maxing is something that seems to be discouraged, due to the Scourge Invasion mechanic (a mechanic Spelunky players will find familiar, but irrelevant) and the rewards often not being worth the effort. Most of your min-maxing is for gold, from chopping tons of trees to continuing to break open each ironite ore deposit even when ironite is otherwise out of uses. Your reward for gold farming is, again, Altars and the occasional shop item before you have the chance to forge it.\n\nForging is relatively self-explanatory, but crafting can be a little tricky. Crafting is done via shift-clicking two items like an awkward Bejeweled puzzle. It's an easy mechanic, the issue is just the recipes at times. A lot of the early crafting recipes build off of each other, which provides cohesion and ease of access to tools and weapons. Some of the later items are either wiki bait, or "Oh, I didn't know that existed!" items. It can get awkward, but with enough thought it's not too bad. There's not too many crafting recipes to memorize, so once you have the main ones you're set.\n\nCombat is simple. Grab a weapon, attack. If you want to use an item, hold it in your hands and right-click. Every item can be left-clicked with to hit enemies melee-style, and that's based off of your ATK stat. Staves and Bows can be right-clicked with to cast spells/shoot arrows, which are based on MAG and DEX respectively. Typically, people break down their runs to three classes. (it's often necessary with the lack of inventory space if you're somewhat new to the game still) With the speed of some mobs, and the fact that a lot of mobs in the game fly, melee is at a huge disadvantage. Ranged players will be able to aim their shots from afar, without aggroing enemies and easily taking out a majority of the mobs they'll see. The downside to Ranged play is that walls can often prevent shots, and by the time you get past the wall they'll have seen you. With the addition of the Fire Bow, you won't be having any issues with damage should you find it. Resources for arrows are normally quite plentiful as well.\n\nMages are strong. Too strong. Fireball shoots horizontally, moving forward seemingly infinitely and even passing through walls. While this is a powerful weapon, there is the downside of accidentally killing enemies and having their xp despawn if you're not careful... But honestly that's the only con to it, which is absurd. Bolt is pretty much the god staff, allowing you to shoot directly both above and below you. With jumps, timing and practice, this is normally the superior option. There's also a strange bug that makes each shot hit the target enemy once for each player in the run, which Fireball is unable to do. Frostshard is more of a melee supplement, offering additional damage that's halved from your current maximum mana. Mages are normally a distance away from their enemies, so it normally provides little to no benefit... If it costed one mana like the other two staves, it might be worth the effort of even using. Summon Zombie is also an option if you find it or use the Scourgeling race, but against flying enemies it's worthless.\n\nSpeaking of races, each race has it's own specialties. However, some are clearly superior to others. Typically you'll want to unlock the best races early on to put yourself at ease. Some races such as the Qualogg provide utility instead of immediate additional power.\n\nUnlockables for character creation include the aforementioned races, the hats and also companions. Like races, there are a few certain hats and companions which are obvious choices once unlocked over the other ones, which is unfortunate. Each unlockable set has at least one thing that's insanely challenging, but most are either freebies or based on RNG which is really unfortunate.\n\nThe game is simple. Once you know what you're doing, it's as easy as going through the motions. You'll get all the items you need to beat the final boss, and you'll always win even if you're not a seasoned veteran. The skill cap is so low I feel like I'm in a hobbit hole.\n\nIf you want a game to play with friends when you're bored and you don't have better options, this is a nice game to pick up. (just be weary of multiplayer issues such as de-syncing) If you want a fully featured game with proper balancing and potential for failure even after learning it's mechanics and practice, you'll want to wait on your purchase of this game. I still recommend it, just don't expect wonders in it's current state... I'm sure with time the balance issues will be ironed out and the game will have more to accomplish and do.\n\nSean Young, if you're reading this I do hope you can find some ways to take care of these issues.","January 13, 2015","true","175.4"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","48","61","4","0"

I absolutely love it! 9/10\n\nMore Details:\n\n+\nNice artstyle & lighting.\nSuper cool and fitting music.\nNot too easy.\nMany different weapons (Swords, Zweihanders, Great Axes, etc.) There's even a Sword made out of Jelly!\nUnique crafting system. Never seen that before.\nCool and fun way to progress: Either you farm yourself up to diamonite or you may be lucky and you can purchase a  diamonite pickaxe at the town. (Collecting and selling a lot of wood is a great way to farm gold. But it recently got nerfed. But in my opinion it's still worth it!)\nChallenging enemies with a pretty good AI.\nYou can unlock hats, companions, races and different variants for them (haircuts). Hats are really useful. I strongly recommend the Miner Cap.\nThere are a lot of skills available. For example "Potion Brewer". With this skill, you have a 50% chance of crafting a big potion instead of a small potion.\nMany randomly generated dungeons. After each dungeon, you will visit a town where you can smelt ores, sell some items and make yourself some armor.\nYou can play as a mage, a ranger or a warrior. Of course you can combine those if you want.\n\n-\nCrafting: It's really hard to figure out every recipe on your own. Maybe a recipe book for all the basic stuff would be a good thing to implement.\nInventory: Your inventory gets full way too fast. Maybe adding a way to craft backpacks would be nice.\nItems disappear after a couple of seconds.\n\nThat's all I can complain about. So to sum it up, I think this game is super addictive and fun. In my opinion, the game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. After 4.5hrs of total play time I almost(!) beat the game 2 times now. I died at the last boss.

Random stat gains and % effect items are exceedingly, almost excessively balanced - it's very rare to find yourself too low on any one stat, or for an item to fail to activate within the desired margin of error. This is not a flaw in and of itself, but coupled with the repetitive level generation, playing through Magicite quickly becomes a stale experience. The crafting system is quite shallow, and biomes contain virtually-identical enemies varying only in stats and artistic style. The races, abilities, hats, and companions all add some replayability, but since there are only three viable playstyle archetypes, these diminish in relevance, as advanced strategic combinations are not possible.\n\nMagicite has the depth and simplicity of a mobile game, but with the time commitment of a much more robust game.

Although you begin your journey with just a generic playable character armed with an axe and a few random items, after harvesting enough wood, stone and precious metal to craft more advanced tools and weaponry to better slay a variety of enemies, you will quickly unlock more playable characters, pets and hats with different traits, and you will be inclined to try the whole journey again. The game is fun and plays well as it is, and the new contents/improvements constantly being added definitely makes it a value-buy in the long run.\n\nGameplay:\nYou will move, dash, jump and double-jump to get you across from the entrance on the left to an exit located to the  right, stopping briefly to chop down trees for wood, mine some stones/ores and to harvest herbs and mushrooms. You will encounter slimes, boars, skeletons, spiders and many other type of enemies, and you may choose to engage them with well-timed slashes of your item in hand (i.e not necessarily a proper weapon), snipe with your bow and arrow or simply introduce them to one or all three types of elemental magic attacks should you desire. Gain experience to level up for better stats and special skills to aid you in slaying the final boss at the end, but with permanent death, it is likely that it will take you more than a couple of tries with one of many unlockable characters before you succeed. Get friends to play together and it will be even more enjoyable, depending on who survives better.\n\nAesthetics:\nNumerous examples have shown that pixel-art graphics can be part of a successful product, and Magicite have no problems being one such product. The colour palettes used varies according to the biomes, but are generally colourful and goes well with the background tunes of the respective biomes.\n\nFinal word:\nHighly recommended for the gameplay as a platformer, as well as replay value for the almost constant streams of new contents from the developer.","November 14, 2014","true","33.5"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","23","29","6","2"

(I do like games that aren't straight up easy most of the time)\nNot to mention this game is rogue-like, which gives it unlimited run-throughs.\nUnlockables will keep you stuck to this game, playing it over and over for that one hat.\nWhat I dislike about this game, is down below this line.\nThe kinda steep learning curve can really get to casual players.\nYour friends may be douches. Maybe.\nSome of the traits you can get are straight up useless, I mean... Who REALLY needs a 50% chance to not lose durability when mining or chopping trees.\nThe "weird" multiplayer scaling for damage on the enemy's part is, weird. (I beleive the damage dealt to you is upped by 50% per player. EX: 150% for two players.\nUnlockables, as mentioned before may also be rather frustrating for players who just want to try something new, but can't simply get anything new.\nAfter playing for awhile alone, (time varies depending if you want to go for all the hats alone and such other things) this game simply gets boring. Multiplayer aspects make this game a much better experience, but having it as a sort of "requirement" for it to be fun isn't a good thing. Also, along the lines of multiplayer, I've never experienced extreme amounts of lag playing with others, but I have experienced some lag, which really took to the game play. I mean, boars who can teleport and\nother things along that line really aren't good. Really.","November 27, 2014","true","63.4"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","21","30","6","0"

I know that I started playing thinking "Am I going to enjoy this?", but I played for a bit and realised that this game is great - especially with a friend or two to play with.\n\nThe crafting is, meh, but I couldn't care less about that. It's a crafting system. They weren't exactly going to add a 3x3 grid and clutter the screen up aswell as making it similar to a certain other game. I've seen a lot of reviews that just talk about the crafting system, but that's just imbecilic: it's not the main point of the game.\n\nMagicite is replayable, over, and over, and over again. It's like Binding of Isaac, but with more pixel-ey graphics, which are infact a lot more pleasant to look at. The graphic type makes it look very inviting as it's simple and makes it seem like the game is simple; which it is, run around, collect stuff, craft, kill stuff, advance in levels, gain skills etc. Aswell as this, the different types of biomes are well thought-out as you can encounter many different monsters, and you can choose which of the 3 random biomes you want to enter, some appearing more than others.\n\nPersonally, singleplayer in this game is as much fun as multiplayer. In multiplayer, you've got your friends and all and you can have a laugh, but what's great is that the monsters scale depending on how many people are playing. I realised this when I kept on dieing in multiplayer, but can play almots outstandingly in singleplayer.\n\nAlso, the game gives you different types of races, which have different benefits and starting items, and it also gives you hats and companions, both giving you different benefits and both have different ways you can obtain them. One of the hats, the "Robin Hood Hat" as I like to call it, has a 20% unlock chance when you've shot 100 or more arrows in a single playthrough. That gives you the chance to try and complete that challenge, all be it a very easy challenge. However there are some other challenges which are even harder!\n\nThe Overworld Helm is unlocked by completing the game and not being hit once. Not once! The Djinn race is unlocked by completing the game and only killing 1 enemy.\n\nAs you can see, some challenges are hard, some are easy, which is good as you can start completing these challenges as you get better at the game.\n\nOverall I really recommend Magicite as you will have a lot of fun playing it and it has a lot of replayability. The price that they're asking for is worth it.","October 10, 2014","true","16.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","0"

With really good killing potential in his skills.\nBackup: can be mage or archer(very strong classes, but in early game no equipment to be useful)\nin early they would be the ones crafting and mining/gathering\nthere are lots of passive skills that lets you gather more materials or lets you craft better potions etc.\nthese skills can make your early game easy as heck.\nsadly these passives are given randomly at character select which is really weird in multi and solo mode :\\nArcher: long range guy can kill mini bosses etc without taking a hit. needs arrows(lots)\nMage: i havent had the chance to play this class because gathering resources to craft wands is very difficult(i always try to kill mobs that are in my way so thats a bad combi)\nbut i did manage to get a wand once and this guy works almost like an archer but needs no ammo(only mana that regenerates fak yeah?!)\npretty hard to utilise wouldnt try to do it solo\n\nLong post and i has no potato. :[\nVery good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060561012/recommended/268750/","76561198060561012","-[FF]- Lady Jan Itor","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060561012/","80 products in account","After about 2 hours with the game, I was seriously debating whether I would recommend this game or not because despite what I dislike about it and the times when I would get frustrated and rage quit it, It's hard for me to deny that I did indeed have some fun with it once I really got a rhythm going.\n\nI do have some issues with this game that can kill it for first time players like it almost did with me. I simply can't ignore them.\n\nIssue 1: Lack of instructions\nBesides the 'tip' on your inventory screen, the game doesn't really tell you much about what will create what. Wood + Wood = Wood plank. Wood plank + Stick = Sword hilt. Wood Plank + Wood Plank = Wooden Blade. Wooden Blade + Sword Hilt = Sword. Do you see how many steps it takes to get to a sword? The same things won't make a axe or a pick either. You have to add two sticks together to make an axe hilt. Three sticks to make a pick hilt too. The game tells you nothing of the sort so it's mostly guess work. Minecraft is the same but it's easier to guess in that game than it is in this one. (3 wood across and 2 sticks down looks like a pick before it even makes it for example). I don't want to have to keep minimising the game just to look at a crafting page. An optional tutorial in the main menu wouldn't hurt anyone.\n\nIssue 2: The spawns\n9 times out of 10, I will spawn right in front of a bunch of items like they're guarding the trees I need to make a sword so I end up having to fight them with my lone little axe. Several times I spawned in front of two boars so they just charged me down and killed me right away. This issue isn't too big but it can be annoying when it leads to quick deaths before you're even able to put up a good fight.\n\nIssue 3: The..randomness.\nHear me out with this one. I understand that the game is about randomly generated dungeons. This I have no problems with. I'm all off every playthrough taking me through a different layout and different enemies. The thing I have a problem with is something that actually happened during my playthrough right before this review as well as (about) my fifth attempt at the game. I was in the 5th district and very low on health. (Guess I suck at the game :P) I had a herb in my inventory which, when combined with another herb, would make a healing potion. Where do you get another herb? In tuffles of grass around the area. Seems simple to just avoid enemies until I find another grass pile, right? Wrong. I encountered several grass piles but they can't paying out in mushrooms (Two of them make a mana potion) or spider webs of all things. I kept trying and trying but it would not give me a herb nor would anything else give me a herb. Even the shop before the area didn't have any potions. I was managing to kill the jumping spiders even when backed into a corner when all of a sudden, some big bug boss monster thing that took up a big chunk of the screen flew in and killed me immediately. The same thing happened during my fifth try at the game. I was standing still and trying to craft some stuff when a floating head came down and dealt 9999 damage to my 8 hp guy. Dead. It's like if Mom suddenly started attacking you in one of the thing rooms of Binding of Isaac. It's just ridiculous.\n\nIssue 4: The cursor camera.\nSo while you play this game, your mouse cursor is turned into a cross hair symbol and it controls which direction you're looking as well as moving the camera. If you move it to the edge of the screen, the screen will move in that direction so as to kinda let you see what's ahead before you go over there. I like it. It comes in handy for seeing future enemies and if you've missed any materials. But where I feel the issue leaves is that it does both of those things. So if you fling the cursor to one side quickly because you just noticed an enemy is coming, the screen will move away so you can't see anything. It'll be very quick too so it gets disorienting and by the time you have it back on you and the enemy, you've needlessly lost hp or died. A simple option to be able to tweak its speed would fix this quite easily.\n\nIssue 5: The inventory.\nRemember when I told you at the first issue how to make a sword? Well that as well as all crafting has to be done inside your own inventory screen. So you have to work around all the other objects you're carrying and when you don't have two squares open (To put a lone wood plank into both in order to create a Wood blade for example) then you're going to have to drop some stuff then pick it back up when you're done. It's not that big of a deal at first but when you're doing it every time you stop to craft, it can be. A sub box next to your inventory could solve this pretty easily. Like a big grid right next to your inventory since your quick selection boxs, armor, extra pieces and inventory take up about 15% of the sreen.\n\nAnd those are my issues with the game after about 2 hours of play. Other than that, the art style of the game is very appealing to look at. The music can be nice to listen to. It's pretty fun to fight the enemies (when super op boss monsters don't float down out of nowhere to instant kill you)\n\nIf you've played Minecraft or Terraria then don't bother getting this game. It's basically the same thin as both of those except when you eat, you leave a poop on the spot where you ate. If you feel that's worth £7 (or whatever it is your currency) then go for it.\n\nIn the end, I have to say I do not recommend it to people that aren't interested in this type of game or the issues I mentioned seem like they would get to you. It's an alright little game but doesn't stand out enough to warrant the payment.","May 5, 2015","false","2.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's addicting to play, and very difficult to master.  However, in a lot of ways I feel it falls flat--to the point where I really just wish it was NOT a rogue-like.  The crafting system is positively atrocious.  Combining one item with another in a sequence in order to make something.  It could easily be overcomplicated and become very tedious when starting new runs.\n\nThe monsters themselves are also an issue.  Some monsters are fun and challenging and rewarding to defeat, whilst others are just ridiculously annoying.  I can't stand going around a corner only to be killed by something I couldn't even see to begin with!\n\nThe camera system can be a very useful thing, as it allows you to easily pan the screen (to a degree).  Though it doesn't seem to get disabled when the window isn't active, so if you quickly alt tab to do something don't expect to be able to see something coming at you since your screen will likely be far away from your actual character.\n\nI want to like this game--and more than anything I want to recommend it--but it's just far to frustrating right now and this isn't mitigated enough by playing with friends for it to matter.  I really hope the developer just trashes the current crafting implementation and reworks it entirely, as it's just not fun or intuitive.  Especially at that price.  There are just other games that would appeal more for the same amount, or cheaper.  I'm interested to see where the developer takes this, but I just cannot recommend it as is.\n\nNote that this is currently only a review of the Early Access (I believe 0.7), so obviously these are subject to change.

I know it is an early access, but there are a TON of bugs right now. I hope most of them get fixed soon! but the ONE thing that I really don't like about this game at all, it that in multiplayer you can hit your friends. That is highly annoying. Can you please make an option to where you turn friendly attack off? That would be awesome. Also make it so you can sell items. I saw in the alpha that there was a total level? like that showed progress and unlocked stuff after you die? Why is that not in this one? That looked really cool aswell. I like to see a sign of progress. But other than that great great game. TOTALLY worth the ten dollars. Don't let the terraria like graphics fool you. Don't get me wrong I LOVE terraria (520 hours clocked in on it), but if you just look at the game and say jeez another terraria rip off without playing it you are completly ignorant because this game is really NOTHING like terraria. It is more RPGish which is always what I wanted from terraria. This game in it's complete state may even be better than terraria, which me saying that means a LOT, because Terraria is for sure one of the best games I have ever played, and now so is this. My main point here is please give an option to friendly attack online, that would make Magicite game sooooooo much better to me. Thank you Sean for this great game! Hope you update it fast and frequently!!! Cause this game could be HUGE. With hard work and listening to the community, I'm sure you can pull it off:) I really want to see this game go far. Take off friendly attack from online and that sells this game as the best game ever for me. Thank you for making this game, Magicite is truly amazing Sean, keep updating it, good luck!","February 11, 2014","true","35.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

If you have heard that this game is a clone of Terraria then make sure that whoever said that to you has actually played the game, yes the art style and concepts are similar but the gameplay and a whole load of other things a very different. I've played a decent amount of the game and have fallen in love with it. i would say one of my top 5 favourite games now. be careful when playing though, its VERY ADDICTIVE. I ended up pulling an all-nighter without realising just because i was playing this. I would recommend this game to anyone, just maybe one or two games at a time...","September 26, 2015","true","41.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

I disagree; it's got pixelated graphics, and you can mine ores. Oh yeah, you can also kill monsters with magic, melee weapons, or bows. The similarities end there.\nMagicite is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer/rougelike/permadeath game, and it's incredibly fun. You can spend ages working on your character, only to see him (or her) brutally murdered, never to be seen again. You can get killed by a pirate penguin, over and over and over again until you figure out how to dodge. You can also get the game-breaking ghost pet and jump across the roof of every stage and never take damage. I'd recommend it. 9/10.\nTl;dr It's not a Terraria clone, it has permadeath and is 2D, buy it.","October 27, 2014","true","65.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","9","13","4","0"

As well as the simplicity of the crafting of items. The bad things about this game are that the beginning mobs are to powerful. You may need to nerf them a little or make a world generator that starts you off in a happier style biome with few aggresive mobs but plentiful peaceful mobs such as pigs or chickens.\n\nSuggestions: You may want to give the player a crafters guide because it took me a about 20 min. to figure how to make wooden planks. This crafting guide should only include basic recipes such as tools and essentials.\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game but it needs some work...","February 22, 2014","true","39.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealM_/recommended/268750/","TheRealM_","RealM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealM_/","49 products in account","My experience with Magicite\n\nImagine Terraria and Spelunky. Two great games. And then combine them.\nSo what comes out? Another great game!\n\nMagicite is a rogue like survival game with RPG Elements, where you farm minerals and materials,and try to craft better weapons and gear once you are in a town. (There's always a level --> town --> level --> town --> etc.). Really important is Inventory management, since you only have limited space and you still need space to craft materials together. So if you just harvest everything you will soon run out of inventory space. This can be annoying for beginners,since they don't know what materials exactly are important,but it's also a strength of the game: It is really fun to just combine different things with Shift - Click and experiment to see what comes out! (If you don't like experimenting there's always the Wiki to help you out!)\n\nOnce you understand the depth of the game you will notice that you can specialize yourself on one "class":\n- A Warrior (High ATK,DEF stats and melee weapons)\n- A Ranger (High DEX stat and a Bow with different types of Arrows)\n- A Mage (High MAG stat and 3 different Magic Weapons as it is right now)\n\nIt is really fun to farm ores and materials to craft better gear for your character,\nbecause every new item you craft has a noticeable impact on your character (wheter it is damage or HP or DEF).\n\nAnother strength of Magicite is the "unlock system": Once your run ended (by death or by beating the game), you get the chance to unlock certain characters or hats. Different characters have different starting conditions,which can influence your run and different hats give you different bonuses.\nKeep in mind: Most unlockables only have a chance to get unlocked so even though you reached certain goals, the unlockables are not guaranteed. This can be sometimes frustrating,if you have a 50 minute run (definetely a possilble time) and you die because of stupidity and unlock nothing new.\n\nWhat kinda weakens the whole experience,is that Magicite doesn't really seem finished.\nThere is a final boss and the current version is over 1.0 but it seems like there could be way more.\nBecause once you actually understand the whole crafting mechanism,it seems really simple.\n(Important to point out here is,that the game is still being worked on and new content WILL come in future updates)\n\nThere are some points that I didn't really talked about, so I will list a summary of all Pro's and Con's:\n\n\nTL;DR Summary\n\nPro's\n\n- Super Mega Awesome Soundtrack (seriously this is important to mention,it creates a perfect atmosphere)\n- Lovely Pixeldesign / Graphic\n- Feel your character becoming stronger,so every Level Up and new Item feels like progress\n- Acquire 3 individual Skill out of 3 different "Skill - Pools" at level 5, 10 and 15\n- It's fun experimenting with different strategies to see what works best for you\n- Challenging bosses and an epic final boss\n- Constant Time pressure that creates tension (Some might argue that this is a Con,I personally like it)\n- It's really fun to play overall, once you understand how the game works\n- Multiplayer seems really fun (Gotta admit I have not yet played Multiplayer... None of my friends own this game)\n- Randomly generated Levels --> Every run feels new and different (forgot to mention this earlier...)\n\n\nCon's\n\n- Beginners might get frustrated,since this game is certainly hard and not self - explanatory. (Experiment or go to the Wiki)\n- You might get frustrated if you have a long run and because of bad luck you unlock nothing new...\n-  EDIT: In this part,it used to say that playing as an archer seems to be the only viable option. Now that I played the game even more,the mage class started to appeal more and more to me. So playing as an archer is definetely NOT the only way to complete this game. (even if it might make your life easier). However, I still dislike the warrior,since he is put in the most danger when dealing damage,since he is melee based. This might be only my opinion though.\n-  Seriously THIS is a Spoiler!!! ---------- The Final Boss lacks a death animation. I know this doesn't sounds like a that bad Con but the whole battle is really intense and you are so nervous and then the boss is just like *plopp* and he is dead. It's kinda unstatisfying...\n\n\nIn the end I can safely say, despite having a few weaknesses, the game is overall a really good and fun experience and I strongly recommend it.\n\nP.S.: This is my first Review. I hope it is helpful. Sorry for any grammatical errors, english is not my first language.","June 26, 2014","true","71.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Reasons are below:\n\n(If you want a quick summary, read the bold text at the bottom.)\n\nMediocre gameplay.\nThe crafting system is decent at best, and leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that you have no idea how to get what you want to get until you experiment for 2 hours or just give up and search the answer online is NOT what I call a good learning curve.\n\nThe combat is okay, but nothing to be amazed at. Melee is timing so that you hit stuff and don't get hit. Ranged is... too easy. Have a bunch of arrows, shoot them at enemies until they flop over. Which leads to the next point:\n\n\nBad balance.\nThe game doesn't even seem to be trying to give players viable options. There is no multiclassing here, unless you want to end up super weak compared to pure characters. And even then there is only one good choice. It's a pain in the butt to regenerate any health in the game, and magic doesn't recharge fast enough to be useful. The result? Archery is the most OP  path to choose. As soon as you get a bow and enough arrows (which doesn't take that long) you can steamroll pretty much the whole game without getting hit once.\n\n\nLack of content.\nMagicite attracts with its glowy effects, cool-looking dungeons and spells, etc... but in the end there just isn't that much in it. Enemies have like 2 attack patterns - charging straight at you or shooting projectiles. The few that attack sort of differently appear rarely, and even then they're not really a challenge as long as you use OP archery. Melee weapons and tools progress in straight tiers, and there are only two types of melee weapon that you can craft. Magic? There are three staves and they're rather boring. Ranged weaponry? There is literally just a bow. That's it. It doesn't even upgrade.\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n- Gameplay gets dull quickly.\n- Crafting is annoying to learn and serves as artificial difficulty.\n- Game balance is broken.\n- Most enemies have no real variety apart from shooting more projectiles or being larger.\n- I've seen more content in free flash games.\n\nIf you must get it, don't get it at full price.","August 9, 2014","false","5.3"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

Now the dev started working on another game and Magicite feels completely abandoned. Even though he says that once Rougelands gets released, he will come back to working on Magicite, I find it hard to believe. This game has a lot of bugs that havent been fixed for months. It used to be updated at least once or twice per month, now there hasn't been an update for quite a long time. All in all, this game feels broken at its current state.

However, the game quickly becomes monotonous. There are unlockable "classes" and equipment that can vary playstyles  slightly, but in general the game is short, lacks variety between runs, and gets boring fast.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game shines. It breaks up the monotony, allows you to specialize for a certain role in a team setting, and offers fun experiences with friends. The problem is that the multiplayer in this game is extremely buggy.  Extremely  buggy. There is an ungodly amount of lag (even in a LAN), graphical glitches (your teammate may appear to be in one location on your screen, but is actually somewhere completely different) and game-breaking crashes/black screens. After several (at least 20+) multipler attempts, both on LAN and over the internet, me and my teammates were still unable to complete even one successful run. Every single time the town hub area in between levels would glitch out and completely break the game at some point, preventing progression and forcing a restart.\n\nThis game is not worth an outrageous $10, but itsn't trash. I was able to get a couple of hours of enjoyment out of it at least, but the the rest was just multiplayer frustration. If you want it, get it on sale (I think I picked it up for about $2.50). There is nothing in this game would give you a reason to buy it immediately.","December 14, 2015","false","8.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The crafting here is not much of a selling point.\n\nThe game does quite a lot well. The graphics in the game are nice and colorful. The enviroments are lovely. I like the array of enemies. The game also offers a good varity of options for customzing your character to suit your playstyle. It also randomly drops underserved loot into your lap, which is always a treat. I don't really dig the combat, but it's alrght. The game has a huge ammount of replay value. The biomes are randomly generated which means that the layout and the enemies will be different every time. The game also has lots of items, races and cosmetic options to unlock.\n\nI really want to like this game more than I do. It's not a bad game, but some things were implemented really poorly.\n\nThe hunger system doesn't seem to have any point. The reason it exists in turnbased roguelikes is to keep you from exploring the entire floor and getting all the loot/hp. It's supposed to make you decide if you'd rather continue or stick around and hope you find something useful. Here? It's a minor annoyance. I've never once died of hunger. Being able to get a good supply of food is dead easy. All food does is provide an alternate way to get HP back.\n\nI don't like that I had to read guides to find out what the stats did. The traits are explained, but for some reason the stats aren't.\n\nSpeaking of annoying things, the invisble timer. It  isn't a blight on the game, I just don't like timers and want to warn others who might feel the same way. You only have a limited ammount of time to make it to the end of the level before big scary demons come to eat your face. Normally I found that it doesn't get in the way, but when it does, I feel really cheated.\n\nI also find the inventory and crafting system to be awful for this type of game. In roguelikes you have limited inventory so that you can't stockpile cosumables for much harder levels. In this type of game though, it doesn't make sense.\n\nThe inventory size feels way too small for a game with a crafting system. It doesn't need to let me hold every single item in the game, but more space is needed. You also need to have at least one slot empty if you want to do any sort of crafting while out in the field. I could even tolerate this stuff, if it provided a easy way to destroy items to clear up space for the stuff I actually want. Instead you have to drop them on the ground where they will follow you like a sad puppy before giving up. This makes crafting kind of time consuming, which could but THE SCOURGE HAS INVADED!

Stock up on Herbs, because you eventually might stop seeing them later when you really need them.\n2. If you're playing multiplayer, decide who should carry what items, it will save you both inventory space (also COMMUNICATE)\n3.

I didn't believe that an Early Access game can\nbe so good. And why is it so good? I'm here to tell you.\nIt's simple. You will understand how everything works very soon and after that, you just keep improving\nyourself more and more until you finally beat the game!\n\nNow of course, it may be boring for people who don't like repetitive things because trust me, this game is\nhard and you will need to play it from the beginning many times. But it's worth reaching the high levels.\n\n9/10. This game has so much potential and it's already very good and addictive! Easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nI really recommend it to you.

Extended play DOES get boring, as all the stages go from left to right. I would love some scailing and falling levels, as well. Not scrolling.\n\nBut, none the less, this game IS fun. Even more so if you have friends of yours playing with you. But dont expect to win the game easily. It is HARD. At times. The levels are called "Districts" Which I find nice, instead of "Level one" Level two" The skills are nice, as well. Levitate's Hover Box tip- "Makes your friends jealous" xD Wolf's Hover Box tip- "Spawns a wolf that kills ♥♥♥♥."\n\nThe hats do bring a nice touch of reward, as well. (If you think your the best Magicite player, I DARE YOU to reach district fifteen with The Scourge Hat. For those who dont know,  It DRAINS your health as you play. )\n\nI cant give this game a full reivew, as its not finished yet. I will when the game finishes, but, in it's current state, I reccomend it. Buy it.","April 29, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

So why play Magicite?\n\n1) The plot is strong enough to compete with Cave Story.\n2) The gameplay is just as smooth as Spelunky.\n3) In years past, Terraria was recognized as the only game where your character swung his sword over his head. Well, guess how your character attacks in this game. :D\n\nHaven't played multiplayer yet, but the single-player mode is more than enough to keep you going. Games can last for 10 seconds or 2 hours, depending on skill and luck.\n\nI'm a very plot-dependent player; if the storyline is dumb, I probably won't get into the action. For a platformer, the Magicite plotline has been exceedingly well written. There's not a lot of volume to the Magicite story or setting, but unlike many video games (where the gamer IQ must be equal to a preschooler) Magicite encourages the player to learn through play.\n\nThe Pokemon and Zelda series both hurt my pride with their blunt storytelling: "Talk to Miko. He'll give you what you need." Usually it turned out that Miko was schizophrenic and a non-stop history buff. Sorry, one moment.\n\n::wipes vomit off face:: Yeah, Magicite won't do that to you. All in all, this game is a true work of art.","February 21, 2014","true","75.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You start with choosing a class to play with (only 1 class available at the first, the rest need to be unlocked). Each class have different stats and starting item. As your character spawn in randomly generated level, you start to collect some item to craft gear,food (did i mention you must eat to keep your character alive? Don't Starve!),weapon,etc. There's some different obstacles/enemies on your level based on it's biome. Each enemy has different attack method.\n\nAs you kill enough enemies, you gain level. At level 5,10 and 15 you have to choose a skill. There's three kind of skill tree you can choose : Mage, Warrior, Ranger. Each has different function and please note that you can only choose the skill tree, the skill itself is randomly given. As you complete the first level, you can pick 1 of 3 door to enter, it's color tell which biome you'll spawn at the next. Before you spawn at the next level, you visit a town to craft clothes,weapon,buy item, etc. As the game continue, you'll find harder enemies and obstacles that make you sure, this game isn't easy at all.\n\n+ Nice gameplay\n+ Unique crafting system ( if you don't read the wiki :p )\n+ Tons of unlockables\n+ Different enemies with different method to kill\n+ Multiplayer ( Haven't try myself though )\n+ More to come\n\n- Small inventory slot sometimes make manage your item difficult\n- Some sort of bug (maybe?) as you shoot your arrow, if you pick up the used arrow at the ground, the arrow will be at your inventory instead of your bow arrow slot.

Magicite has a unique style of gameplay, where you can get different traits/rolls to start with. Not only that, but there are custom generated worlds. But to top it off, I believe my favorite part in this game is the different variety of weapons and tools. I was quite down because you couldn't save your progress, but you could then unlock items to start with, which somewhat made it alot better. This is a pretty unique game, and I definetly recommend it, but some requirements are suggested:\n\n-Be good at default platformer\n\n-Have "OK" expirience with a mix of Bullet Hell and Crafting Games.\n\n-Have fun!\n\nThis game can be quite rage-inducing, but it can be really fun once you get used to it. :D\n\n","January 18","true","46.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzaladan/recommended/268750/","dzaladan","DZAladan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzaladan/","129 products in account","This game caught my attention immediately due to the graphics: it looked very colourful and full of lights. Since this kind of graphics always catches my attention, I started watching some gameplays until I started playing myself.\n\nWhat I found was a very cool mix between a roguelike, a platformer and a survival. And VERY hard.\n\n> PROS\nGraphically, the game looks very nice: a pixelated style mixed with very shiny colors. Quite appealing to the eyes according me.\n\nThe crafting system is very simplified (click two items to combine them) but for a game like this I think that it's just perfect.\n\nThe combat system does not accept "LEEROY JENKINS" people: attack enemies recklessly will 90% sure end with your own death. Being careful is the key and good players who learn this will be prized.\n\n> NEUTRAL and VARIABLE\nSince this game is still in development, there are some things missing, like a main menu music, some sounds effects and also some little bugs. But the game is fully playable.\n\nThe crafting itself can be a little nuisance for newbies. First of all, there is no in-game instruction for how to craft certain items, like a sword (which you need to fight enemies). If from a side, part of the fun is discover how to make it, on the other side can appear a little annoying, especially because items don't last forever and you'll have to try all possible combinations to discover how to make a sword, an axe or a pick, unless you have a guide.\nBut on a positive side, since crafting is very simplified, it's easy to memorize them.\n\nThe controls also are an headscratcher, but this depends by the person. Surely who never played Minecraft will learn quickly how to play this, but in my case sometimes happens that I try to open the inventory with "E" (which is a dash to the right) instead of "R", making me run into traps by accident. Plus, moving a pointer (used to attack, especially with arrows) using the mouse can be a little disorienting: it works on first person games like Minecraft but for this, which controls the camera and can even go over the character view, can give some problems. Especially when you have to attack an enemy and you have to move the mouse from a side to another. Sometimes I forget to do this because I mostly press buttons. But this is subjective and other people can be perfectly OK. Plus, I think that those controls give this game its difficulty.\n\n> CONS\nSo far, the only true con I found in this game is this: the lack of a save feature.\nDid you just made a great run but now you are tired, you want to close the game and rest a little?\nWell, too bad: if you do, you lose everything. You have two choices only: die or finish the game. I hope that a save feature will be implemented in the future.\n\n> VERDICT\nThis game is HARD. You must learn to master the controls and all the various mechanics before you can even go over the first district. But once you learn, I can guarantee it will be a fun experience.\nI personally like a lot roguelikes because of their high repleyability and this is no exception, thanks to the various unlockable things (classes, hats, companions and so on) which can make each run different.\nThe game has still some features to be implemented so probably there are more and more updates on the way. I will update this review accordingly.\n\n> VOTE\n7 / 10","July 1, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The deaths are permanent, yet each time you go through this onslaught of cultural fabulousness, you earn rewards through different tasks such as new playable characters unlocked by doing things such as killing X amount of monsters, or obtaining a rare item, that will stay with you forever.","August 4, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Currently it is still in an alpha/beta kind of stage but so far the game has run very smoothly minus the one or two crashes with the game but I do not take it to heart as Magicite is still playable.\n\nIt has little to no bugs when playing the game and it well worth the time playing, in the beginning it is an absolute rage- inducer when you have no idea in how to play the game or to dodge damage. Given time it becomes very fun and a great challenge, the character is customisable with different races, different hats, companions and varieties of a race.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzaladan/recommended/268750/","dzaladan","DZAladan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzaladan/","129 products in account","This game caught my attention immediately due to the graphics: it looked very colourful and full of lights. Since this kind of graphics always catches my attention, I started watching some gameplays until I started playing myself.\n\nWhat I found was a very cool mix between a roguelike, a platformer and a survival. And VERY hard.\n\n> PROS\nGraphically, the game looks very nice: a pixelated style mixed with very shiny colors. Quite appealing to the eyes according me.\n\nThe crafting system is very simplified (click two items to combine them) but for a game like this I think that it's just perfect.\n\nThe combat system does not accept "LEEROY JENKINS" people: attack enemies recklessly will 90% sure end with your own death. Being careful is the key and good players who learn this will be prized.\n\n> NEUTRAL and VARIABLE\nSince this game is still in development, there are some things missing, like a main menu music, some sounds effects and also some little bugs. But the game is fully playable.\n\nThe crafting itself can be a little nuisance for newbies. First of all, there is no in-game instruction for how to craft certain items, like a sword (which you need to fight enemies). If from a side, part of the fun is discover how to make it, on the other side can appear a little annoying, especially because items don't last forever and you'll have to try all possible combinations to discover how to make a sword, an axe or a pick, unless you have a guide.\nBut on a positive side, since crafting is very simplified, it's easy to memorize them.\n\nThe controls also are an headscratcher, but this depends by the person. Surely who never played Minecraft will learn quickly how to play this, but in my case sometimes happens that I try to open the inventory with "E" (which is a dash to the right) instead of "R", making me run into traps by accident. Plus, moving a pointer (used to attack, especially with arrows) using the mouse can be a little disorienting: it works on first person games like Minecraft but for this, which controls the camera and can even go over the character view, can give some problems. Especially when you have to attack an enemy and you have to move the mouse from a side to another. Sometimes I forget to do this because I mostly press buttons. But this is subjective and other people can be perfectly OK. Plus, I think that those controls give this game its difficulty.\n\n> CONS\nSo far, the only true con I found in this game is this: the lack of a save feature.\nDid you just made a great run but now you are tired, you want to close the game and rest a little?\nWell, too bad: if you do, you lose everything. You have two choices only: die or finish the game. I hope that a save feature will be implemented in the future.\n\n> VERDICT\nThis game is HARD. You must learn to master the controls and all the various mechanics before you can even go over the first district. But once you learn, I can guarantee it will be a fun experience.\nI personally like a lot roguelikes because of their high repleyability and this is no exception, thanks to the various unlockable things (classes, hats, companions and so on) which can make each run different.\nThe game has still some features to be implemented so probably there are more and more updates on the way. I will update this review accordingly.\n\n> VOTE\n7 / 10","July 1, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Judging by the screenshots and seemingly simplistic idea behind the game, I figured it was just another indie rogue lite with nothing new to offer. Boy was I wrong. When I did finally decide to give in and buy Magicite while it was half off, I began playing the game to see what all the fuss was about. After about an hour or so of me becoming more and more heavily addicted to this wonderful creation of a videogame, I proceded to purchase another copy for a friend of mine so we could experience the glory of Magicite as a cooperative experience. I could go on and tell you of the heart pounding, exciting, and intense emotions that were involved; but I won't. Instead I will politely ask you to throw your money at your computer screen and spend hours upon hours dying over and over AND over again.\n\nI rate this game 10/10 for giving me one of, if not THE most enjoyable cooperative experiences of my life.","November 29, 2014","true","66.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's level-based, which are free-roaming side scrolling levels taking place in different biomes. There is no building, which I appreciate in this game, but there is crafting to make weapons and equipment. The game doesn't pause durring crafting so you better be in a safe place, and don't take your time cause the scourge will take your ♥♥♥ out.\n\nThis game could really use some gamepad support. I mean... *Ahem*, nudge and wink to the devs... GAMEPAD SUPPORT would make this game really rad.\nMaybe it's me, but the HITBOXES could use some tweaking. I can't tell you how many times my sword has gone right through an enemy, especially bees and fairies, and ended in my untimely death.\nAlso, one time I got super far, had great gear, but a large flying creature hit me and I got stuck in a wall. So, there's are still some bugs to work out!\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this game, it's fun and the right amount of challending.

You will die in this game. A lot. But you can unlock different characters and equipment which provide different bonuses for your next adventure. It's level-based, which are free-roaming side scrolling levels taking place in different biomes. There is no building, which I appreciate in this game, but there is crafting to make weapons and equipment. The game doesn't pause durring crafting so you better be in a safe place, and don't take your time cause the scourge will take your ♥♥♥ out.\n\nThis game could really use some gamepad support. I mean... *Ahem*, nudge and wink to the devs... GAMEPAD SUPPORT would make this game really rad.\nMaybe it's me, but the HITBOXES could use some tweaking. I can't tell you how many times my sword has gone right through an enemy, especially bees and fairies, and ended in my untimely death.\nAlso, one time I got super far, had great gear, but a large flying creature hit me and I got stuck in a wall. So, there's are still some bugs to work out!\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this game, it's fun and the right amount of challending. I'd give it a 7.5/10, but would go higher with gamepad support and fine-tuned hitboxes.","June 12, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another game riding the voxxel-pixel craze.  Since it's early access I pray they fix the bugs.  You'll notice minor things like weird hit boxes in solo but the DIY co-op multiplayer is so buggy it's far from playable, characters blink around and I experienced what others have dubbed the black screen glitch.  I liked the fact you could rez downed comrades especially.  The difficulty level is balanced, but the random generated levels can be unpassable at times.\n\nGraphics are only ok sadly, but I expected as much.  They seemed to do the same ol' pixel art despite the gui engine seemigly of hi potential.\n\nChances are if you like Risk of Rain or voxxel side scrollers you'll want to pick this up.  I couldn't get any of the Key binding to work, which is important to a lot of people especially dasabled gamers which I am.  Def not for everybody as is, but its potential is huge.\n\n..also it looks simular but is truly nothing like terraria or it's many clones either.  Thanks dev's!

It would seem as though that the trend for games is the 8-bit style of character design; some indie games specifically.\nWith the game "Magicite" however, despite this design it does not disappoint. There is a continuous effervescent glow throughout the background and the enemies with which you fight. The music itself is rather fitting with the rest of the world which is both relaxing and has the potential of becoming sort of hypnotic if you happen to not be paying close-enough attention to what you're doing [ADHD for the lose]. The characters themselves which you get to play are both adorable and are formidable foes against the various monsters you hack and slash with; but it is not a hack-and-slash game as it is with the Diablo series...\nThe down-sides:\nThere aren't really any "levels" per-se; you are sort of plopped into the world. If you're a first time gamer or just simply a novice as I am; there's not really a tutorial, there aren't any sort of difficulty ranges you can work with [beginner, normal, hard, die-inside-it's-so-difficult]; there's just you being thrown into the world.\nWhile yes, that does make you feel like you need to fight for your life and gives your character a sense of purpose [based upon the back-story that the creator has made rather clear and very cool]. If you're going up against a boar (boars are ♥♥♥-holes in this game if you're a beginner) like any natural boar you're going to get charged at; and the gaming gods help you if you don't know which button the "jump" is.\nI did notice, took note and did my best to follow through with the [while very sincerely appreciated] guide to what you're supposed to do; it would have been nice to have some sort of walk-through within the game itself. The gaming guide is pretty long and the writer did in fact take the time to even put a disclaimer that basically says: "Your eyes are going to be ♥♥♥♥♥ with ALL THE WORDS. FOR DAYS." Which was smart of the writer to put on. Pixel Cheese is their name? Not sure, but no snark at all when I say: I am genuinely grateful for the time you took to write out this review. But what about some pictures for more of a better reference? While that does sound very immature; it also helps those who are more visually inclined and can help the gamer apply what you took the time to write in exchange for better game experience. Plus for the sake of efficiency the visual reference or perhaps a video you can insert into the tutorial would be beneficial as opposed to reading through all the words, and then finding the right video on Youtube of a "let's play" to see which situation said video is on can help you with precisely what you need. Texting a friend is always an option if that friend has played it before - however you do run the risk of getting your balls busted for it. Or in my case my ovaries busted.\nThe controls are kind of finicky when you fight monsters. The "WAD-etc" controls are a bit to get used to; but the seasoned PC gamer will have no trouble. As for the n00bs such as myself... Trust me as you read this; it will take some getting used to, but you will get the hang of it.\nDespite the minor pain-in-the-♥♥♥ details I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10 in its simplicity, its music, the adorable-looking green monsters that you get to bash with a wooden ax, and over-all despite the 8-bit design it's rather polished. Color me impressed.\nAs Captain Hook would say, "Good form, Peter Pan!"\n\n","June 17, 2014","true","58.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterS42/recommended/268750/","MisterS42","MisterS42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterS42/","467 products in account","Type of Game:\n\nPDL (Procedural Death Labyrinth) with a focus on crafting\n\nVersion Played:\n\nPC version through Steam\n\nMagicite Build 0.7.5\n\nSimilar Games:\n\nSpelunky, Terraria, Rogue Legacy, and to a lesser degree Risk of Rain\n\nThe Good:\n\n- The overall sense of wonder and exploration as the player progresses in the game keeps it exciting and engaging\n- The crafting system is deep and relatively intuitive, which helps with the overall feeling of discovery that the game continually conveys\n- Experience point generation leads to leveling up the player’s skills in different manners that can complement a player’s style of gameplay\n- Current skill trees are strength, intelligence, and dexterity\n- Procedurally generated biomes that feature random enemies, resources, and loot drops\n- Weapon and tool crafting has the potential to attach bonuses to the stats, which can greatly improve a player’s chance of survival\n- Character creation has different benefits with each character that the player unlocks through game progression\n- The game is quite difficult, but as is the manner of this genre, it adds to the sense of accomplishment when the player beats a previous record or level\n- Multiplayer is a blast and can really encourage proper teamwork and planning due to the difficulty level of the game in general\n- The developer(s?) Sean Young is constantly responding to feedback within the steam forums and also implements many of the ideas brought up by the community\n- Updates and patches to the game are common and consistent, which keeps the experience fresh and exciting\n- Hats!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- As expected there a quite a number of bugs in this version, which mostly reside in the user interface\n- As explained above, many bugs are known and are being addressed in future releases\n- While multiplayer is a blast, the process to start a network game with others is not very intuitive and may leave some non-techie gamers fustrated\n- When first starting out with the game, the crafting system and difficulty can seem overwhelming and may scare off players that don’t bother to hang with it. This could be remedied with a comprehensive in-game tutorial that explains the basics of the early gameplay.\n- Having a timer for each level can be a bummer as this is a crafting-heavy experience. Since crafting doesn’t have a craft-book or interfaced crafting system, early players will be spending a lot of time Alt-Tabbing between the game and the wiki figuring out what resources build different items. That time will cost them dearly as the “scourge” will inevitably destroy them before they reach the end of the level.\n-A streamlined crafting method would potentially address the feeling of a “cheap kill” and encourage the player to move swiftly through each level to avoid the scourge\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nSure. The game is pixelated and does not contain excessive gore. There are blood sprites, but again the retro look diminishes their effect.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nThe version I played did not have a final boss, so the levels repeated endless or appeared to do so. I did, however, spend a lot of time playing the game with friends and found the experience very enjoyable!\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\nMagicite will appeal to any gamer who enjoys a challenge. The sense of exploration and achievement really encourages that feeling of wanting to play one more game when your last one ends. As a fan of the PDL genre, I highly recommend our readers pick this one up.\n\nA Quick Look At Those Games You Might Play:\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com/","April 18, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Another game riding the voxxel-pixel craze.  Since it's early access I pray they fix the bugs.  You'll notice minor things like weird hit boxes in solo but the DIY co-op multiplayer is so buggy it's far from playable, characters blink around and I experienced what others have dubbed the black screen glitch.  I liked the fact you could rez downed comrades especially.  The difficulty level is balanced, but the random generated levels can be unpassable at times.\n\nGraphics are only ok sadly, but I expected as much.  They seemed to do the same ol' pixel art despite the gui engine seemigly of hi potential.\n\nChances are if you like Risk of Rain or voxxel side scrollers you'll want to pick this up.  I couldn't get any of the Key binding to work, which is important to a lot of people especially dasabled gamers which I am.  Def not for everybody as is, but its potential is huge.\n\n..also it looks simular but is truly nothing like terraria or it's many clones either.  Thanks dev's!

When people say it's like Terraria, They are right, and wrong. For instance, this is more of a adventure sidescroller, while Terraria is Huge and once you get everything, you have to wait for more updates, and that is boring, while you will be playing magicite constantly because you have so much to unlock, by the time you get all the items to unlock, there will be more updates, because it took you A LONG time to get them all. There are some serious challenges in this game, limited ores, limited health, you have to deal with food, you want to get this epic hat but it's so hard to get. I haven't even done multiplayer yet, but multiplayer means 2 things, less stuff for you because your friend needs stuff, and you can't just have everything, it would be unfair! Also, from videos, you have to revive your friend (if im correct there is a timer to heal your partner). The fact that it costs 10 dollars is kind of sad, but I guess the creator has a point because you will definitaly be playing this game often. Don't forget about the bosses, they get pretty hard (The final boss in this game is a wall, and it comes for you and you have to kill it, sort of like Terraria). Unfortunatly there is a time limit, unlike Terraria, to get out of the level, or else you will get killed by the games main enemy. The crafting does take some time to get used to.\n\nIf you love rouge-like games, you should buy this one, same with rpg\n\nI rate this game 8/10 hot dogs, and it still has even more potential!","June 30, 2014","true","102.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It would seem as though that the trend for games is the 8-bit style of character design; some indie games specifically.\nWith the game "Magicite" however, despite this design it does not disappoint. There is a continuous effervescent glow throughout the background and the enemies with which you fight. The music itself is rather fitting with the rest of the world which is both relaxing and has the potential of becoming sort of hypnotic if you happen to not be paying close-enough attention to what you're doing [ADHD for the lose]. The characters themselves which you get to play are both adorable and are formidable foes against the various monsters you hack and slash with; but it is not a hack-and-slash game as it is with the Diablo series...\nThe down-sides:\nThere aren't really any "levels" per-se; you are sort of plopped into the world. If you're a first time gamer or just simply a novice as I am; there's not really a tutorial, there aren't any sort of difficulty ranges you can work with [beginner, normal, hard, die-inside-it's-so-difficult]; there's just you being thrown into the world.\nWhile yes, that does make you feel like you need to fight for your life and gives your character a sense of purpose [based upon the back-story that the creator has made rather clear and very cool]. If you're going up against a boar (boars are ♥♥♥-holes in this game if you're a beginner) like any natural boar you're going to get charged at; and the gaming gods help you if you don't know which button the "jump" is.\nI did notice, took note and did my best to follow through with the [while very sincerely appreciated] guide to what you're supposed to do; it would have been nice to have some sort of walk-through within the game itself. The gaming guide is pretty long and the writer did in fact take the time to even put a disclaimer that basically says: "Your eyes are going to be ♥♥♥♥♥ with ALL THE WORDS. FOR DAYS." Which was smart of the writer to put on. Pixel Cheese is their name? Not sure, but no snark at all when I say: I am genuinely grateful for the time you took to write out this review. But what about some pictures for more of a better reference? While that does sound very immature; it also helps those who are more visually inclined and can help the gamer apply what you took the time to write in exchange for better game experience. Plus for the sake of efficiency the visual reference or perhaps a video you can insert into the tutorial would be beneficial as opposed to reading through all the words, and then finding the right video on Youtube of a "let's play" to see which situation said video is on can help you with precisely what you need. Texting a friend is always an option if that friend has played it before - however you do run the risk of getting your balls busted for it. Or in my case my ovaries busted.\nThe controls are kind of finicky when you fight monsters. The "WAD-etc" controls are a bit to get used to; but the seasoned PC gamer will have no trouble. As for the n00bs such as myself... Trust me as you read this; it will take some getting used to, but you will get the hang of it.\nDespite the minor pain-in-the-♥♥♥ details I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10 in its simplicity, its music, the adorable-looking green monsters that you get to bash with a wooden ax, and over-all despite the 8-bit design it's rather polished. Color me impressed.\nAs Captain Hook would say, "Good form, Peter Pan!"\n\n","June 17, 2014","true","58.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played many rogue-like games (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Legend of Dungeon) but none of them have had multiplayer capabilities. Magicite's feature that divides this game from other rogue-like games is crafting, a very likeable feature. Graphics are nice and they resemble Terraria graphics. Combat takes a bit to get used to (For me at least) but very fluid. The bug i've found through out my very short play-time was the HP Bug everytime you start a new character, use always start with 1 less health then your full health value. Either way I think Magicite is a very good rogue-like game because its different from regular perma-death games. (Levels and Crafting) If your looking for a rogue-like game that is different then other rogue-like games then you will love this game.

This game is not forgiving, if you died (or your whole party is) you have to play again from the beginning but I think that's the fun part is.

It is very hard at first, but once you get off yo' bootox and head to the wiki page: http://magicitedia.com/wiki/Crafting , you can learn the recipes, which end up helping you A LOT! Otherwise you will need to learn them yourself, which may be possible, but with the different kinds of handles like axe handles pickaxe handles and sword handles and all that, it gets confusing. ALSO, when you first spawn, sometimes you get off on a bad start, and end up dying almost immediatly, however, each time you spawn, the place is randomized, frm the biomes to the monsters. So dont give up. Also also, the animations in this game ar truly great, when you swing what seems like a giant axe, your character pauses just a teeny bit in the middle of the swing, asthough hes trying to gain enough straingth to pick the rest up and slice his enemy, whatch this entire gif as an example : https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/243/702/83b2a11cad2d66ab3acea405cc18b491_large.gif?1382858664\n\nThank you for reading, if you want more gifs or more info, visit the kickstarter page, here : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/magicite-a-multiplayer-rpg-platformer","February 11, 2014","true","18.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972357771/recommended/268750/","76561197972357771","Z Question","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972357771/","314 products in account","I started playing Magicite about exactly when it hit version 1.0.  Since then, every update has only improved an already amazing game.  A brutal roguelike, this game punishes you for every mistake in combat, but gives you the tools to dodge, attack from a distance, and obtain a larger health pool, so that (most of the time) you can only blame yourself.  This isn't to say you can't get an overwhelming amount of bad luck.  Facing down two tyrannox, a bee, and a couple boars while dodging spiked blocks can (and likely will) happen to you right off the bat at some point, but most of the time, you get a fair chance to prepare or avoid such things.\n\nThe crafting in Magicite is simple, minimal, essential, and for the most part, intuitive.  Once you understand that you can only combine two items, experimentation will likely result in figuring out how to make fires, cook food, make basic tools, and basic potions.  Very few things in the game are not obvious from basic crafting practice (drums and enhancing a certain rare sword).  Overall, it encourages enough item collection to enhance your character without feeling like a terrible grind.  The longest you ever have to grind is for enough sticks for arrows if you want to be an archer, but you'll need two easily obtained stacks at most.\n\nAs for your character choices, you can customize a setup for your preference, but you usually have to choose to be a spellcaster, an archer, or a melee fighter.  Currently, melee is the easiest to power up your attack for, but also by far the hardest to play (because you are constantly in danger).  Archer's are the easiest to play, but require the most maintenance (you always need ammo), and spellcasters are somewhere in-between (not always easy to access the items for your basic staves, and a bad run of it with skills can make going out-of-mana a true hazard).  However, despite being locked into a less-than-obvious class choice, unlockable races, hats, and companions (companions being one of the most valuable, and most difficult, set of unlockable items) ensure you will have a lot of choices after you start playing through multiple times.\n\nFinally, multi-player.  This game needs work on its multi-player, but it's already fun (if you can set it up).  Currently it only supports LAN games normally, so some external networking effort is required to play over the internet.  In addition, playing with multiple people has a few bugs (that are being worked on) and some imbalances (which are currently not being addressed... yet).  Only the host can see the crystal nodes needed to ease the defeat of the final enemy (and, in fact, the only decent way a melee player can attack it).  Often you won't find enough ore for everyone to upgrade their armor (or melee's weapons), and there is only really enough for one archer's arrows (which is just as well, since they have it easier).  Food also becomes a lot more scarce, because you have multiple people growing hungry, and while the enemies have more hp in a multiplayer game, they do NOT drop more food or become more plentiful.  That all said, playing with a friend can be a very fun and rewarding experience.\n\nAll in all?  Buy this game.  Play this game.  Love this game.","June 29, 2014","true","108.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My wife and I would argue constantly over who had to find a decent game on steam. It's one of those chores NO ONE wants to do! You know, the old "I spent the entire day rearing OUR children, maybe YOU can pitch in a little and find a decent game?" and of course, "You think I have the energy to slave over finding good games? I worked a 12 hour shift just to come home to THIS?!" These are the things that can destroy an entire relationship. It got to the point where our children could sense the tension. The minute I heard our 6-year-old girl in her bedroom, re-enacting our game finding fight with her Barbie dolls, I knew we had to make a change. That's when I found Magicite. Our marriage has never been healthier, AND we've even incorporated it into our lovemaking.

And on top of all that, is The Binding of Isaac style deaths. You may be asking yourself, should I buy this? The answer is... yes! I'll break it down in segments here.\nThe game is a rogue-like that has randomly generated worlds. You go through different systems, a cave system, forest system, each have their difficulties. Some may be easy to you, some may be hard to you. It's all about prefrence. As you get more in depth with the game, you will find unlocks, such as, hats, companions, and races. Most will take a bit of time to get, while some take about a few characters to get. Now stay still Eager McBeaver, you won't be getting all of them when you start, oh no. As there are many things you have to do to even get the characters, as in beat the game. Beating the game is difficult for a multitude of reasons, getting past all of the bosses, making sure the random generation doesn't screw you over, and getting good loot. And another reason is, it has certain things for you to do to unlock them, as in, beating the game without chopping trees, and other things like that. As the times pass, you may end up getting everything.\nThe next thing is, the crafting system! The crafting system has its ups and downs. It has a sort of Minecraft way of crafting, as in, "Let's throw the users in here, I'm sure they'll figure it out!" It may take a couple crafts, and a wiki page to help you get into the game, which is a plus and a minus, as in, trying to find the best combonations you can!\nThe co-op is pretty fun as well, making sure your allies don't die, or making sure they DO die. It's a great place to show off that cool pirate hat you got, or that cool character you think would beat the game in a heartbeat. (but face it it wont ;p)\nThe death system is pretty great, it doesn't just make you go to a boring game over screen, like I said with unlockables, it greets you with four chests you can unlock! (There can be more or less, but it only shows four chests!) You click them to either gain score, or gain specific characters, hats, or companions! It does something different from other games, which gives you a slight hope to die, when you really don't want to, you just want to keep playing and try and get enough to die and hopefully win a cool hat that bumps your stats pretty high!\nThe soundtrack is PHENOMENAL, it will have you singing the songs in your head for weeks!\nThe graphics are also pretty amazing, it gives the feel of Zelda + Terraria!\n\nLets go into the negatives about the game, as in, THE BAD, THE WORSE, AND THE HORRID.\nThe Bad: The crafting system takes a bit of time to get used to, and it takes forever to find the crafting recipes by yourself and not using the wiki. The multiplay can be a bit wonky at times, such as WIFI REVIVING, or stuff like that.\nThe Worse: The random generation has its amazing ups and its very low downs, as in, you could spawn and have a boss spawn right next to you, which has happened. Plenty of times... The randomization of stats brings it down a bit and sometimes takes a few minutes to set up the perfect character.\nThe Horrid: Come on, this game isn't horrid, why are you looking at this part anyways? ;p\n\ntl;dr:\nGraphics: +++\nCrafting: +-\nRandom Generation: -+\nSoundtrack: +++\nStats System: -\nUnlockables: ++\nCo-op: +\nDeath System: +++\n\nFinal Rating: 9.3/10\nFinal Statement: Go buy it, it's an amazing game and deserves more than what it has now!","February 24, 2015","true","36.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","57","8","14","13","1"

Your attacks are very laggy, so getting hit while attacking means waiting for seconds before you can actually attack. Enemies also get i-frames, but they have contact damage during said i-frames.

Sean’s always been a gamer and started developing games for mobile platforms, and after many attempts, came about to develop Magicite.\n\nA ruthless, 2D platformer that had me riddled on stage one. The old saying “Easy to learn, hard to master” was brought to my mind, more than once. So don’t expect to breeze through the first few levels without encountering a few hiccups.\n\nMagicite brings us yet another game that falls under the platformer genre that we all know so well. This little beauty features… a plethora of randomly generated dungeon-esque type areas, a simple yet intuitive crafting system, exploration, co-operative multiplayer, and my favourite feature: permanent death! The game also includes a nifty character customisation screen, in which you’ll have access to change your race, traits & stats. The majority of the customisable items, require certain feat’s to be unlocked, so don’t get to excited just yet.\n\nYet again, the art style of this game was intriguing. It has this warm feeling about it, even when you find yourself traversing the depths of a Tundra biome. From first glance, the art style comes of as fairly basic, but there are countless times when I found something else to admire. Such as the dim particles that float around the screen or the innocence of the wild beasts. Both are minor touches to the game, but at the same time, add to the experience.\n\nAt various points throughout the game I found myself struggling to maintain a clean inventory. Some may think this would add a negative effect to the game. In my opinion, it did the exact opposite. It encourages the need to select which materials are worth keeping and those which are worth crafting. Often times, I would merge two items together with a sense of curiosity. It pays off to explore your options when it comes to crafting in Magicite. I felt a sense of accomplishment every time I discovered a new crafting recipe and it only occurred to me the other day, I’ve barely scratched the surface.\n\nPersonally, I felt Magicite would fit nicely in the trial and error category. I’ve logged around 3-4 hours and in that time, played around 40 different characters. Every time I repeat, I have that little bit of extra knowledge from my last playthrough. Slowly but surely, I venture further and further each time. Of course the game has its ups and downs, but there’s quite a lot planned for the future of this game, so stay tuned and give it whirl! The co-operative game play is worth a try as well!\n\nUPDATE: I was fortunate enough to be reviewing this while an update for Magicite was released which included the infamous Hats!

For the first 5 hours it was like hell, only being able to make it to floor 2 every other run. But once I started putting time into this game it became easy so fast and by the time I had only 30 hours into it I had unlocked every item in the game. But, even though I had all the items it was still fun to play a run with all the OP gear like the overworld helm, floaty slime, and Djinn. Overall I think it has alot of good qualities but the only thing holding it back from being as iconic as the Binding of Isaac is the lack of enough late game content that will keep players playing for a while. Also, if you do get the game, some challenges like "beat the game without chopping trees" or  "beat the game without killing enemies" seem impossible becuase they go against everything you have learned so far, but if you  actually start a game with the intentions of not chopping trees, you'll find that its actually not that hard with a proper load out and game plan.

Yes there are times where you start a game and an enemy is right there, ready to end your run prematurely, but the game is still in early access.\n\nAlso, classes and hat's (essentially perks) have a chance to unlock as you progress deeper into the game and complete certain tasks.

This game is simply amazing.\n\nMagicite has most of all the genres you can find in a game nowadays, and that alone makes it a gem worth digging for.\n\nIt has the elements of a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler rpg with customizable classes, such as being a greatsword swinging wizard or fireball shooting knight. There are endless possibilities to your character and how you go through each run.\n\nIt also has survival elements, as seen with a well done crafting system. You have to make almost all of your gear yourself or find it inside rare little chests. Not to mention the hunger bar looms over you, making you feel like life is even more important. Death is permanent, so you had better make each step count and choose your battles wisely.\n\nNot to mention the great use of the pixelated style. It looks like an old school game, but is fluid enough to stand with the modern day competitors.\n\nThe creator of this game is a genius in my opinion, and I would recommend this to everyone and anyone who's even considered the rpg universe.

In it, you star as a lowly peon (or other unlockible race) as you fight monsters underground in order to make your way to the surface world. There's a lot of craftible weapons, armor, and potions, as well as special abilities and hats with various effects (any TF2 player will know just how important it is to have hats in a game). The various biomes you traverse include grassland, veldt, tundra, lava, cave, and dungeon, and they are all randomly gererated, with their own sets of enemies. This adds a lot of strategy to the game, as no two areas will ever look alike or have the same enemy placement. Resource management will also be a big factor during gameplay.\n\nThe creator, Sean Young, is very dedicated to the game and has put a lot of work into it to make it the game it is today. I got this game a couple months ago [March 2014] back when it was still in ver 0.7.3., and a lot has changed since then. However, the in-game bestiary, quest generation system, and PvP battle arena that were mentioned on the game's kickstarter page have yet to be added, but that may change as time goes on. The game is now on ver 0.8 and just got a lot of new content added.\n\nHonestly, as fun as single player is, the real fun is experiencing this game with a friend. It is a lot of fun to plan out long-term goals and strategies with them and work towards meeting those goals. When your plans go off exactly as you planned and you both display excellent coordination, it's hard not to be excited about it.\n\nOverall, the game just keeps getting better with each update and it is still being worked on, so I would say that there is no reason to not get this game. Whether you play it alone or with a friend, you are bound to enjoy this game and also get extremely frustrated when your charater dies (I forgot to mention until now that this game uses a permadeath system), so if your character dies one you will need to start from the beginning again. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are someone who dislikes permadeath I would not recommend this game to you. For those who stick with it though, you will really enjoy everything this game has to offer.","May 18, 2014","true","93.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I gice it a 9.5 out of 10, I would give it a ten, but there is no questing that I have found so far. I will give it a ten when the game gets questing because I hear they are planning to add questing. The crafting system is difficult to learn, but easy to master. Also currently there is no crafting so if that is an element you are looking for and not just a hack n' slash style rogue-like rpg this is not the game for you. The combat in the game is very difficult unless you have experience with that type of monster from previous battles, so the moral is that you will die again and again and again.

It's amazingly easy to pick up the basics, especially for a Roguelike, and I've used it to introduce a number of people to the genre who would have been otherwise turned off by it. The crafting is simple, nessisary and somewhat complex at the same time because of item combinations, but the combos are easy to learn and can be done straight from the inventory instead of needing to go into town and craft.\n\nThe music is also brilliant, and even the current bugs are more funny than they are annoying.\n\nI know the game is still early, but my friends and I can't get enough, I'm more than happy that I kickstarted it and got eight keys to share.","February 17, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It feels as a roguelike game, difficult, but that ONE thing that killed you could have been avoided. The game feels like a survival journey as much as an RPG, with limited amounts of health potions and gradual biome progression. However, the biomes don't seem to get any harder on their own, with the only increase in area difficulty being that the biomes gradually swap each other out in an attempt to get you to go to the harder zones. The game is about risk versus reward in an aspect, as running into a difficult biome will also grant you access to plenty of treasure chests or high amounts of valuable ores. However, said biomes often end up having enemies hard enough to take out your level 30 character in a mere 4 hits without any health potions to rely on.\nOverall, the game has its ups and downs, but the mix of aspects in the game end up making it worth buying.","July 5, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found a game that was pretty, fluid, simple, and fun.\n\nThe permadeath works - it's not lame. Every death or two gives you more hats, classes, or ideas on how to progress. Instead of being a burden, the permadeath acts as a way for you to clean the slate and do better. It's healthy.\n\nThe game lasted me around 15 hours. I beat the boss multiple times, each taking me around 20 minutes (i think). Eventually you get used to how the enemies work, and the game becomes an exercise in muscle memory. Unlike similar games (like rogue legacy), this muscle memory doesn't get challenged very much. It won't put you into situations where 3-4 enemies with different powers are spewing them all at once, and you have to navigate the world to defeat them. Instead, magicite tests your patience. You have to identify each enemy and be careful with them - because regaining health is difficult. By the end of the game you'll be taking enemies out at range more often than not, because you won't be finding enough potion materials to heal yourself. Only one or two equipment/hat/trait/skill combinations can keep you healed, and even then it's tiresome and slow to heal to full (notably, the ice queen hat, clairvoyance skill, and high MAG).\n\nAfter all this invested time, my big gripe is that melee is just too important. The three different general paths (melee, archer, magic) are fun and play differently, but it always boils down to using your sword. No matter how you build, the sword is the only ifinite source of damage; your magic will run out fast and regen slow, and your arrows compete with armor for crafting materials. So it feels a bit like the magic/archer classes are more work than they're worth. Even with the right skills and playstyle, it doesn't usually feel like they're really worth it.\n\nAfter unlocking most of the items, hats, and races, I think i'm done with it. But at this price, 15 hours of gameplay for $10 was pretty reasonable.","September 27, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a wide variety of races to choose from. Ranging from: Useless pigs to Cyclops Miners.\nYou journey through caves. Some caves are swampy, some are hellish. There are 3 different cave entrances at the exits of each cave you go through. Choose wisely! Some caves are more difficult than others! Small towns are available at the start of every cave. Here, you can buy any supplies you think you'll need along the journey. Or, you could sell some items you won't need to gain a little extra coin.

It is pretty fun at first but I think it might get a little too easy for many people after you have played it for a while.  Also the game does screw you over a lot of the time by spawning you right in the middle of danger.  Overall, I think there is a bit too much collecting and crafting for a rogue like game.  Most rogue likes are very fast paced even in the start of the game which keeps you playing over and over again despite the fact that you've just died.  I wish they would simplify the crafting a bit so that you can do it a bit faster because it gets very rinse and repeat and it's a lot of clicking just to make some items.  Overall though the game is still pretty fun especially the combat and I enjoy the double jump aspect.  7/10","December 29, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice graphic and audio. If you are used to rogue like games; this game is a good addition with loads of re playability with cute graphic to boot.\n\nNot an easy game and you will definitely die quite a few times before finishing the game. Even after that; there are still quite a number of stuffs to unlock. Races, companions, headgear and look variations are some of the stuffs you can unlock. Headgears, races and companions are some of the better to stuffs to unlock as they can potentially change how the game is played.\n\nThis game is quite worth the money and if you are on the fence on whether to get it or not; my advice is to get it. You won't regret it (but first please make sure you are into rogue like games. If you are not familiar with this genre; the game will be frustrating to play).

The monsters are ALL very tricky at the beginning, but after a few hours, you should be able to master them without taking damage.  The level design is very repetitive, although I somewhat like that you can see the entire world, top to bottom, and don't have to explore up and down at all.  Crafting is MEH, there need to be a LOT more items, and more unique ones... you can pretty much make identical, albeit more powerful items depending on the materials used, which isn't interesting at all.  The inventory menu needs to be made larger, and the only way to get gold (which is, at last in the early/mid game, the only way to get decent armor) is to monotonously chop down every tree in every level, since all items have the same $2 selling value, you may as well load up on 99x wood in each inventory slot.\n\nI think this game has potential, but needs to be greatly expanded upon.  I'd recommend it if you've played through other, more polished games like Terraria, Risk of Rain, Don't Starve, but honestly, the quality and depth of all those games eclipses Magicite by so much, it'd be tough to move on from them to a strict downgrade.  That said, I'm looking forward to what the creator has in store for Magicite, there's a lot of room for improvement, and sometimes it's nice to have a "lite" version of Terraria to play.","August 5, 2014","true","230.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sean’s always been a gamer and started developing games for mobile platforms, and after many attempts, came about to develop Magicite.\n\nA ruthless, 2D platformer that had me riddled on stage one. The old saying “Easy to learn, hard to master” was brought to my mind, more than once. So don’t expect to breeze through the first few levels without encountering a few hiccups.\n\nMagicite brings us yet another game that falls under the platformer genre that we all know so well. This little beauty features… a plethora of randomly generated dungeon-esque type areas, a simple yet intuitive crafting system, exploration, co-operative multiplayer, and my favourite feature: permanent death! The game also includes a nifty character customisation screen, in which you’ll have access to change your race, traits & stats. The majority of the customisable items, require certain feat’s to be unlocked, so don’t get to excited just yet.\n\nYet again, the art style of this game was intriguing. It has this warm feeling about it, even when you find yourself traversing the depths of a Tundra biome. From first glance, the art style comes of as fairly basic, but there are countless times when I found something else to admire. Such as the dim particles that float around the screen or the innocence of the wild beasts. Both are minor touches to the game, but at the same time, add to the experience.\n\nAt various points throughout the game I found myself struggling to maintain a clean inventory. Some may think this would add a negative effect to the game. In my opinion, it did the exact opposite. It encourages the need to select which materials are worth keeping and those which are worth crafting. Often times, I would merge two items together with a sense of curiosity. It pays off to explore your options when it comes to crafting in Magicite. I felt a sense of accomplishment every time I discovered a new crafting recipe and it only occurred to me the other day, I’ve barely scratched the surface.\n\nPersonally, I felt Magicite would fit nicely in the trial and error category. I’ve logged around 3-4 hours and in that time, played around 40 different characters. Every time I repeat, I have that little bit of extra knowledge from my last playthrough. Slowly but surely, I venture further and further each time. Of course the game has its ups and downs, but there’s quite a lot planned for the future of this game, so stay tuned and give it whirl! The co-operative game play is worth a try as well!\n\nUPDATE: I was fortunate enough to be reviewing this while an update for Magicite was released which included the infamous Hats! Each one is accompanied by an attribute/skill that will go towards your survival. For example, Bunny ears allow triple jumping.\n\nRegards, Paul (@Halfrailed)\nCheck out more reviews at Halfrailed.com","March 10, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice combat, smooth interface and a simple approach to gameplay that is very refreshing. This game is very fun with a friend or two but certainly has it's flaws. The main flaws revolve around 3 things; balance, crafting, and luck.\n\nThe balance is probably it's worst aspect. Damage and health values are all odd and there is almost no reason to stick to a melee weapon over a ranged bow or magic staffs. Too much risk vs low reward when using melee, even if you are skilled with it. Magic and bow wielders can inflict heavy damage from a distance with little to no risk on taking any damage. You can also hit enemies at a distance without aggroing them so there is literally nothing they will do to stop you. There are many other balance issues but I'll opt not to elaborate on those seeing as this one is my biggest gripe.\n\nThe crafting system is fun but loses it's spark pretty quickly. It doesn't have much depth at all and after a while most of the resources that you gather become obsolete.\n\nLast but not least luck plays too big of a role. Randomized dungeons certain extend replayability but situations where you start off in a district and you're dealing with a big enemy blocking your path should be avoided. Also how lucky you get when gathering things can strongly affect how well you do.\n\nI didn't go too deeply into what's wrong with the game seeing as there is a bit. With that said I still reccomend the game. It's highly addicting and very fliud. There aren't many gameplay glitches and everything moves relatively quickly once you get started. Played with the right people this game is definitely a blast and I look forward to future updates that hopefully address  many of my concerns","July 13, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Multiplayer is a lot harder then single player and it seems to be based off of how many people join. Bioms are very different to each other and have many monsters/bosses. There are a low amount of items but they do have items for different play styles/classes [Mage/Range/DPS]. You'll spend a lot of your time dying but will feel very pleased when you actually start progressing in the game. If your expecting to learn this game fast...... Play on multiplayer....

I gice it a 9.5 out of 10, I would give it a ten, but there is no questing that I have found so far. I will give it a ten when the game gets questing because I hear they are planning to add questing. The crafting system is difficult to learn, but easy to master. Also currently there is no crafting so if that is an element you are looking for and not just a hack n' slash style rogue-like rpg this is not the game for you. The combat in the game is very difficult unless you have experience with that type of monster from previous battles, so the moral is that you will die again and again and again.

Hopped right in with out much knowledge of the game. And let me tell you it was tough. But after you get the hang of things it becomes a unique experience unlike any game that I've played before. It's a rogue-like with RPG and Survival elements and they all come together to provide you with a unique enjoyable experience. This game isn't really comparable to anything else, but if I had to I would say its like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac since you go "floor-to-floor" collecting loot and killing mobs and perma-death. But the combat reminds me of Terraria and Starbound. The game also has a crafting feature unlike any I've seen before.","July 3, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played this game quite a bit since I've purchased it, but it keeps me feeling like I'm a mediocre player. I guess that's the draw to this game. The challenge. Not a lot of games have that aspect anymore, and where Magicite does, it does it in droves.

The game is impossibly hard, like the dark souls series, and is one of the best games i own. Even though this games crafting is simple, i love it. It brings a sense of simplicity with all of the insanely hard. I prefer the greataxes in this game even though it can get you killed which of course means you start over with your starting gear and thats it. You can kinda take 10 skill paths to to take, warrior, ninja/archer, mage, or a combonation of your choice. The gameplay is simple, fun, and challenging and makes you want to avoid combat, but also drawing you toward combat with all of the xp and loot and it also gives you a feeling of acomplishment when you actaully kill a mob. There are lots of unlockables, like races, chracter style variants, hats, and even companions. Even though you will die ALOT, this game is very addicting and has a sense of acomplishment when you finish a level. As a warning to anyone new to this game, This game is almost impossible to beat without friends so, get friends to buy this game and play your heart out (almost literally). This game is also very addicting and i give it as an early access, 8.5/10.\n\n\n\nnow for the less formal review.\n\nyou poop whenever you eat. 12/10!!!!","September 21, 2014","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's insanely fun in both single player and multiplayer. Some of the achievements are incredibly hard given the random nature of the game but honestly, it's some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game to date. No matter how many times I've died, even in the most ridiculous manners imaginable, I still find myself playing this very often.\n\nTo say this game is unforgiving, though, is an understatement. It's more unforgiving than your girlfriend after trying to hotbox her and instead sharting on her leg.. On your anniversary. It's more unforgiving than if you were to, in a fit of insanity, kick the cane out from under an elderly woman in front of disgruntled police officers. On mother's day. This game will violate every notion of 'fairness' that you have ever held in ways that you have never dreamed possible. "Trying for the 'take no damage and beat the game' achievement? Here, have three dragons on the 19th area. At the start. All firing at once. Right before they charge you. Hope that hour of play didn't mean that much to you!"\n\nIt's hard. It's fun.

In this District you face off against the final boss. I have discovered that it is quite difficult to beat, there are just simply too many enemies that spawn. It would be great if you can even out the ammount of enemies, perhaps make different sections of the level. One section could contains several enemies and another section lets the player prepare/heal up and collect shards. Another issue I have is the agro of the mini-spiders within the cave levels, they tend to agro simply when I enter the level.\n\nAlso I do comprehend that this is a bit of a beta-build and believe that once this game is 100% completed it will become a master-piece but until then there are still a couple of bugs that can be fixed.\n\nKeep up the outstanding work!","December 8, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is impossibly hard, like the dark souls series, and is one of the best games i own. Even though this games crafting is simple, i love it. It brings a sense of simplicity with all of the insanely hard. I prefer the greataxes in this game even though it can get you killed which of course means you start over with your starting gear and thats it. You can kinda take 10 skill paths to to take, warrior, ninja/archer, mage, or a combonation of your choice. The gameplay is simple, fun, and challenging and makes you want to avoid combat, but also drawing you toward combat with all of the xp and loot and it also gives you a feeling of acomplishment when you actaully kill a mob. There are lots of unlockables, like races, chracter style variants, hats, and even companions. Even though you will die ALOT, this game is very addicting and has a sense of acomplishment when you finish a level. As a warning to anyone new to this game, This game is almost impossible to beat without friends so, get friends to buy this game and play your heart out (almost literally). This game is also very addicting and i give it as an early access, 8.5/10.\n\n\n\nnow for the less formal review.\n\nyou poop whenever you eat. 12/10!!!!","September 21, 2014","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And then I left it alone...\n\nUNTIL ONE DAY - Yesterday to be exact. I was sitting with my friend, who didn't own Magicite, and it was on sale so he bought it. Two whole hours of multiplayer gaming later, I went home and all I could think about was Magicite. This is going to be my new Terraria.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to, but for the most part they are pretty standard. I do wish there was somewhere in the game where you could see the crafting recipes that you've already figured out, or what you can craft, like in Terraria and Don't Starve. Other than that, the gameplay is an 8/10. Some enemies are hard to fight but you just have to develop a strategy to beating them.

You start off with random items and usually an Axe (As far as I know). Through out your exploarations you encournter cute, colorful, scary and big creatures. All you have is your one life and what ever you have on you at the time. You better choose wisely and preper to die ... Alot.\n\nYou can customise your character and there are some more features to your that you can add but I havent found them yet.

Although there are an ENOMOUS amount of glitches, in multiplayer at least, the gameplay makes up for it. "If you thought the Binding of Isaac was hard, then try this" that is the only way to describe this game with fun online multiplayer as long as one of you can host, not to mention this game is still in beta which gives the devs time to fix these things, and in fact in every update they have had they fix bug after bug. The gameplay itself however is VERY fun with multiple people in the game, even singleplayer has a completly different feel to it. Singleplayer while everyone may "dis" it is a very challenging way to play and can be fun for anyone who, as i said before, likes 2D plateformers in the style of "Bloody Trapland" with RPG and Rougelikeness of "The Binding of Issac".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twed/recommended/268750/","twed","esfavc CSGORumble.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twed/","147 products in account","Magicite is a rogue-like platformer developed by Sean Young. You can play as one of the many in-game races, all with different stats and starting gear. Unlock hats, which give your character certan buffs, race variants, a purely cosmetic customization, and companions, small creatures that follow you around, granting buffs.\n\nI will be breaking down this review into a few sections, as seen below.\n\nGameplay\nMagicite starts you off with nothing but whatever your race starts with. Collect wood, mine minerals, and vanquish enemies along the way to each district's exit. After completing a district, you will be break to a town, kind of like a resting place to smelt minerals, craft, and chill for a bit before starting the next district. There are multiple districts, each with their own monsters and loot.\n\nCraft things out of collected or bought materials, and gradually level up to bcome stronger, but be warned: this game is  HARD . Be ready to die a  LOT , and that's not a bad thing.\n\nMultiplayer\nYes, there is online multiplayer! Up to four players can dive into the underground world of Magicite. While there are bugs, the multiplayer experience is the preferred method of playing this game.\n\nUnlockables\nMagicite offers a healthy helping of unlockable gear, most requiring good play. Unlocking things, even just cosmetic eyes, is extremely satisfying.\n\nConclusion\nMagicite is a game to be played with friends. While you can solo the game, it is much more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game can be replayed many, many times without boring repetitiveness.

Then you'll like this game. Do you not like roguelikes or have never played one? You might still like this game, I dunno.\n\nPros\n- The crafting system is awesome (shift+click two items), particularly because you aren't given any of the recipes - part of the fun lies in experimenting and figuring things out (or if you really want to you could use the wiki)\n- Lots of recipes\n- Different races provide for different playstyles - if your starting items don't include an axe, for example, you have to kill everything to get coins and then buy an axe in the marketplace at the end of each level so that you can get wood and sticks to make handles for more tools. (I think there's actually another way but I don't know what it is)\n- Challenging (I think that's a pro anyway)\n- Procedurally generated everything\n- I can't make any guarantees, but I feel like you don't need to be a roguelike fan to enjoy if, but if you are then you'll definitely enjoy it\n- Co-op up to four players\n- Plenty of unlockables that aren't too easy to unlock\n- Haven't encountered any bugs\nCons\n- No LAN play, so you'll still have to set up port forwarding to play locally\n\nTip: Don't stay still for too long","January 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've managed to unlock everything by this method. Also, the pets and hats really help. The hardest hat unlock is so worth it because it you take 1/2 damage.

Also, when I played I had to guidelines as of what the crafting system consisted of.

And then I left it alone...\n\nUNTIL ONE DAY - Yesterday to be exact. I was sitting with my friend, who didn't own Magicite, and it was on sale so he bought it. Two whole hours of multiplayer gaming later, I went home and all I could think about was Magicite. This is going to be my new Terraria.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to, but for the most part they are pretty standard. I do wish there was somewhere in the game where you could see the crafting recipes that you've already figured out, or what you can craft, like in Terraria and Don't Starve. Other than that, the gameplay is an 8/10. Some enemies are hard to fight but you just have to develop a strategy to beating them.

Got it on sale for myself and now I wished that I had got the 4-pack on discount.\n\nAs a single player it can be very addictive. As a multiplayer co-op game I think the fun would be in coordinating with your friends as well as having the back and forth banter trying to make sure everyone will not die of starvation or from being mauled by a wildboar.\n\nThis game has the charm of classic and old school 2D games but with better graphics. Keep a wiki open on standby for recipes crafting and etc. There's no hand holding here. I wish the developers would make sandbox levels and non-permanent death options available. Oh please, please, please....

Sean’s always been a gamer and started developing games for mobile platforms, and after many attempts, came about to develop Magicite.\n\nA ruthless, 2D platformer that had me riddled on stage one. The old saying “Easy to learn, hard to master” was brought to my mind, more than once. So don’t expect to breeze through the first few levels without encountering a few hiccups.\n\nMagicite brings us yet another game that falls under the platformer genre that we all know so well. This little beauty features… a plethora of randomly generated dungeon-esque type areas, a simple yet intuitive crafting system, exploration, co-operative multiplayer, and my favourite feature: permanent death! The game also includes a nifty character customisation screen, in which you’ll have access to change your race, traits & stats. The majority of the customisable items, require certain feat’s to be unlocked, so don’t get to excited just yet.\n\nYet again, the art style of this game was intriguing. It has this warm feeling about it, even when you find yourself traversing the depths of a Tundra biome. From first glance, the art style comes of as fairly basic, but there are countless times when I found something else to admire. Such as the dim particles that float around the screen or the innocence of the wild beasts. Both are minor touches to the game, but at the same time, add to the experience.\n\nAt various points throughout the game I found myself struggling to maintain a clean inventory. Some may think this would add a negative effect to the game. In my opinion, it did the exact opposite. It encourages the need to select which materials are worth keeping and those which are worth crafting. Often times, I would merge two items together with a sense of curiosity. It pays off to explore your options when it comes to crafting in Magicite. I felt a sense of accomplishment every time I discovered a new crafting recipe and it only occurred to me the other day, I’ve barely scratched the surface.\n\nPersonally, I felt Magicite would fit nicely in the trial and error category. I’ve logged around 3-4 hours and in that time, played around 40 different characters. Every time I repeat, I have that little bit of extra knowledge from my last playthrough. Slowly but surely, I venture further and further each time. Of course the game has its ups and downs, but there’s quite a lot planned for the future of this game, so stay tuned and give it whirl! The co-operative game play is worth a try as well!\n\nUPDATE: I was fortunate enough to be reviewing this while an update for Magicite was released which included the infamous Hats! Each one is accompanied by an attribute/skill that will go towards your survival. For example, Bunny ears allow triple jumping.\n\nRegards, Paul (@Halfrailed)\nCheck out more reviews at Halfrailed.com","March 10, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels as a roguelike game, difficult, but that ONE thing that killed you could have been avoided. The game feels like a survival journey as much as an RPG, with limited amounts of health potions and gradual biome progression. However, the biomes don't seem to get any harder on their own, with the only increase in area difficulty being that the biomes gradually swap each other out in an attempt to get you to go to the harder zones. The game is about risk versus reward in an aspect, as running into a difficult biome will also grant you access to plenty of treasure chests or high amounts of valuable ores. However, said biomes often end up having enemies hard enough to take out your level 30 character in a mere 4 hits without any health potions to rely on.\nOverall, the game has its ups and downs, but the mix of aspects in the game end up making it worth buying.","July 5, 2014","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Crafting is a little out there but  just incase you have a little difficulty crafting you shift click two items to craft them togehter. This Game is very addiciting in the sense that you play one single player round and you get incredibly far, then you die and you unlocked a ton of stuff you never had before, and then you play anothor round, that's why it's so Addicting.

But there was a menu to edit the controlls so I was fine. As for the difficulty, it seems like an easy game at first glance, but I still havent beaten the game despite how easy it looks.\n\nI also like how there are some bosses, and I guess you would say "mini-bosses" like the Tyrannox, because of its low health and meteors hit it's self. Percyl is a pain in the butt to kill cause of its 600 HP. You know what I'm sayin'?\nThen theres the RPG genre. The thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't select your special passive abillities. You have to constantly find the combo that you are looking for, and it's a lot of time being wasted.\n\nEven if there are some negetives, the music is just beautiful. Tundra being my favorite, and the Volcano as my least (opinion wise), it's an awesome soundtrack! Beyond 1.2, I'm hoping for a ton of more bug fixes (such as throwing your items into a void againt a ledge), mobs, items (espeically for magic puposes) and a difficulty setting. Once you get the hang of a game, it gets easy, so I'm hoping for a whole other difficulty that applies parkour and a pit of lava (mostly for volcano), or maybe less mobs and more passive ones (for a easier setting for noobs).\n\nIf I inspired you of some ideas for the new update, your welcome! Oh and if you couldn't understand any of that, I reccomend it for gamers and not casual people, its a rouge-like RPG and all, so have fun playing this game to it's fullest! :D","July 20, 2014","true","98.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes there are times where you start a game and an enemy is right there, ready to end your run prematurely, but the game is still in early access.\n\nAlso, classes and hat's (essentially perks) have a chance to unlock as you progress deeper into the game and complete certain tasks. This brings you back for more, but for me, I found my favorite build and will spend 10 minutes hitting random until everythings the way I want.","June 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is simply amazing.\n\nMagicite has most of all the genres you can find in a game nowadays, and that alone makes it a gem worth digging for.\n\nIt has the elements of a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler rpg with customizable classes, such as being a greatsword swinging wizard or fireball shooting knight. There are endless possibilities to your character and how you go through each run.\n\nIt also has survival elements, as seen with a well done crafting system. You have to make almost all of your gear yourself or find it inside rare little chests. Not to mention the hunger bar looms over you, making you feel like life is even more important. Death is permanent, so you had better make each step count and choose your battles wisely.\n\nNot to mention the great use of the pixelated style. It looks like an old school game, but is fluid enough to stand with the modern day competitors.\n\nThe creator of this game is a genius in my opinion, and I would recommend this to everyone and anyone who's even considered the rpg universe. It is well worth the 10 dollars.","June 17, 2014","true","51.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't run into any bugs or errors yet ether so that's a plus.\nNow about the playing itself it is awesome it is a rouge like platformer similar to Rouge legacy in that it has random spawning floors and has perma death but it's art style is that of almost 8 bit like games which is awesome for those who like to relive the art style it also has character customization such as multiple races, traits, hat's that give there own benefits such as more critical strikes and stat bonuses. It also has skills upon character's leveling up that are broken into 3 groups such as the Warrior, The Mage, and The Ranger. It even throughs in some crafting mechanics as well so if you like these kinds of games this could be a fun game for you.\n\nEdit: I also forgot to add about the creatures they come in many shapes and sizes from being easy to being hard there are also several bosses as well, but I will say that some of the creatures do seem to repeat in each area but that could just be me nitpicking so hope you all have fun and if you get the game hope you have a blast with it.","July 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's amazingly easy to pick up the basics, especially for a Roguelike, and I've used it to introduce a number of people to the genre who would have been otherwise turned off by it. The crafting is simple, nessisary and somewhat complex at the same time because of item combinations, but the combos are easy to learn and can be done straight from the inventory instead of needing to go into town and craft.\n\nThe music is also brilliant, and even the current bugs are more funny than they are annoying.\n\nI know the game is still early, but my friends and I can't get enough, I'm more than happy that I kickstarted it and got eight keys to share.","February 17, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Everything you want in an Early Access Game.\n\nThe people who say this game is too difficult obviously must not have experience with roguelikes and/or 2D platformers.\n\nThis game is not too difficult.  It is challenging, and you have to tread carefully - but it is very much playable and very enjoyable.\n\nThere are a few glitches that can get annoying - like sometimes in a multiplayer game, certain players will just fall through the floor and will have to disconnect (and can't get back in).  That can get annoying - but since it's a roguelike, starting over is hardly the end of the world.\n\nEither way, I bought the 4 pack, have given it to a few of my friends, and we are all having a blast.","February 17, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Usually I'm not a fan of "rouge-likes", but this game is one of the better of the genre; you build up gear at a good pace, your chance of survival increases dramatically all the time, and after you've snowballed into almost an almost unstoppable menace, it doesn't feel too upsetting when it almost inevitably ends in your tragic death nevertheless.\nThe combat and platforming are very smooth, and the delay before each of your swings makes each well-timed hit feel really satisfying. The crafting system is quick, simple, interesting, and rewarding to anyone who manages to get their hands on some good materials.\nThe random stat and ability rolls can get a bit annoying, seeing as there are few enough possible stat combinations that it's usually only a matter of time before you get your ideal stats and decent abilities. But overall, it's still quite satisfying when you end up with a perfect combo of stats and traits right away.\nAlthough beginnings may be rocky (my first few runs lasted literally seconds), a little bit of practice goes a long way towards sustained runs.","February 20, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But there was a menu to edit the controlls so I was fine. As for the difficulty, it seems like an easy game at first glance, but I still havent beaten the game despite how easy it looks.\n\nI also like how there are some bosses, and I guess you would say "mini-bosses" like the Tyrannox, because of its low health and meteors hit it's self. Percyl is a pain in the butt to kill cause of its 600 HP. You know what I'm sayin'?\nThen theres the RPG genre. The thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't select your special passive abillities. You have to constantly find the combo that you are looking for, and it's a lot of time being wasted.\n\nEven if there are some negetives, the music is just beautiful. Tundra being my favorite, and the Volcano as my least (opinion wise), it's an awesome soundtrack! Beyond 1.2, I'm hoping for a ton of more bug fixes (such as throwing your items into a void againt a ledge), mobs, items (espeically for magic puposes) and a difficulty setting. Once you get the hang of a game, it gets easy, so I'm hoping for a whole other difficulty that applies parkour and a pit of lava (mostly for volcano), or maybe less mobs and more passive ones (for a easier setting for noobs).\n\nIf I inspired you of some ideas for the new update, your welcome! Oh and if you couldn't understand any of that, I reccomend it for gamers and not casual people, its a rouge-like RPG and all, so have fun playing this game to it's fullest! :D","July 20, 2014","true","98.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being in early access, I'm excited to see what will become of the game, what will be added, etc. As it stands, the game is already very enjoyable, with no noticeable bugs (at least during my time with the game). The multiplayer is a bit wonky (the creating/joining of servers), but it works and the it's a blast to play with friends.\n\nMy only complaint is the crafting system, which does not tell you how to make anything, but instead, encourages you to discover how everything is made. This is exactly how Terraria and Minecraft work though, so I can't really complain too much about it. However, the crafting in Magicite is done in a weird way. You only need two items in order to craft something, and that is done from the inventory. I ended up mindlessly combining different items to see what would result. I got a few cool things out of that, at least.\n\nI can definetely recommend Magicite, especially if you're looking to play it with friends. Although difficult, Magicite is an excellently crafted rogue-like game (wait, aren't all rogue-likes difficult?).","March 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a basic crafting system so you can get some better tools.\nThis game is right now in early access, for the moment it´s pretty repetitive but when it´s done it´ll be a really good game!\nSean, the developer of the game tries very hard to add new content, the things you can hunt for right now is some cool hats, different characters.\nOverall a good platformer/sandbox/rogue game. 7/10, it would have a 10 if it whasen´t so repetitive, but the game has some really nice and polished pixel graphics, a basic soundtrack for every biome i think.","April 16, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

In it, you star as a lowly peon (or other unlockible race) as you fight monsters underground in order to make your way to the surface world. There's a lot of craftible weapons, armor, and potions, as well as special abilities and hats with various effects (any TF2 player will know just how important it is to have hats in a game). The various biomes you traverse include grassland, veldt, tundra, lava, cave, and dungeon, and they are all randomly gererated, with their own sets of enemies. This adds a lot of strategy to the game, as no two areas will ever look alike or have the same enemy placement. Resource management will also be a big factor during gameplay.\n\nThe creator, Sean Young, is very dedicated to the game and has put a lot of work into it to make it the game it is today. I got this game a couple months ago [March 2014] back when it was still in ver 0.7.3., and a lot has changed since then. However, the in-game bestiary, quest generation system, and PvP battle arena that were mentioned on the game's kickstarter page have yet to be added, but that may change as time goes on. The game is now on ver 0.8 and just got a lot of new content added.\n\nHonestly, as fun as single player is, the real fun is experiencing this game with a friend. It is a lot of fun to plan out long-term goals and strategies with them and work towards meeting those goals. When your plans go off exactly as you planned and you both display excellent coordination, it's hard not to be excited about it.\n\nOverall, the game just keeps getting better with each update and it is still being worked on, so I would say that there is no reason to not get this game. Whether you play it alone or with a friend, you are bound to enjoy this game and also get extremely frustrated when your charater dies (I forgot to mention until now that this game uses a permadeath system), so if your character dies one you will need to start from the beginning again. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are someone who dislikes permadeath I would not recommend this game to you. For those who stick with it though, you will really enjoy everything this game has to offer.","May 18, 2014","true","93.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Herbs are also from slimes, and can be combined make potions which heal HP.\n\nOnly kill slimes and pigs in the early stages. If you have an axe, chop everything. Also mine everything.

The perma death is always enraging so if you are the kind of person that hates restarting every time you die i wouldnt recommend this game, however any races/hats/companions etc you unlock will remain with you forever it is just your character that is deleted upon death. Lots of stuff to craft and many different enemies and things to unlock, there is a ton of content in here for hours of enjoyment and addictiveness. The game itself is pretty linear like an old school super mario, always heading in that right direction platformer, but its not bad, there is a good variety of biomes however you always start in the jungle. If you enjoy 2d Adventure games this is great for you, just be prepared to lose your character and hard work over and over again.

If you like Platformers and Rogue-likes, this game is a must.\n\nPros:\nVery well done controls for mouse+keyboard play.\nBeautiful pixel art graphics.\nAt a sweet spot (for me at least) in difficulty.  Easy enough to pickup, but hard enough to prevent you from walking up to the boss on your first 50 tries (Expect to die a lot).\nCons:\nThere is some re-use in monster behavior and monster types (eg A stronger/faster purple spider in contrast to the regular spider from the first level)\nMonster AI is not particularly sophisticated nor hard to figure out how to counter.\nThe bow mechanics.  The bow can fire outside of the range of most of the early monsters, so you can hit them with your bow before they even know that you're near them, making a lot of bow combat one sided with you firing at non-moving monsters.  Arrows are also not affected by gravity, making it really easy to use (maybe too easy).\nThe hunger bar seems kind of like an afterthought and doesn't affect gameplay all that much.  Food is extremely   abundant in most biomes.\nI like the crafting element, and I like the fact that the game was designed to encourage the player to experiment with resources.  There aren't that many things to craft though, so once you've already learned all the recipies, continuing to do them feels like an unnecessary chore sometimes.\nThat's a lot of cons, but this game is really fun and really addicting and is all-round pretty well designed.  Definitely worth it's list price.","January 21, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a nice curve in difficulty - players learn how to avoid basic enemy movement patterns and adopts strategies for attack in the first few levels. In later levels enemies perform new patterns that the player must adapt to or suffer greater penalties to health than before. I revel in the challenges the game presents, and the way it rewards skillful movement and planning. Each town is a welcomed rest and keeps the action engaging rather than exhausting.\n\nMultiplayer should be an even greater joy, it's great fun coordinating with a friend and reaping the efficiency of two players dividing duties and actively harvesting resources. however multiplayer has always ended in a mess for me and my friend. I'm unsure if it is due to poor connection because the initial levels work without a hitch. Once we'd reach level 10 and on though everything starts to go to hell. Enemies lag out of place, projectiles spawn unattached to a source, flickering phantoms of beasts would hover in place after death. Occasionally the ground wouldn't load and I'd fall into an inky abyss. It's worse that the multiplayer functions at all because it's only after great progress has been made that everything goes wrong. In one round I even lagged a full level behind. My friend would enter a door, and I'd enter the (unplayable)level he'd just been through.\n\nI understand that with a rogue like game you can't just have a player joining part way through, so allowing a disconnected player to reconnect might not be the best solution. But most games with multiplayer I've played will at least give you an indication that the connection is unstable. It'd be nice if the game recognised a poor connection, and stalled or paused players to try and reconnect/ stabilize. I admit I have no idea what is necessary to actually maintain a multiplayer session, but my experiece so far with it has always ended poorly, and that experience is all I can contribute. If the connection issues could be fixed up I'd happily buy copies just to distribute them to friends and spread the joy, but for now I Guess I'll wait til my friend and I can get a better connection :/","May 21","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's sort of like Terraria but not so miney, and open world like. It is an awesome game with a beatiful sound track and is worth the $10. It would be better, if the spawns were different and there were a lot more options, but right now it is still seriously cool. I cant wait for more updates and new features, one of which I hope is a bigger inventory.","June 14, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
