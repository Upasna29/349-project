The movies were also nice especially since that meant I didn't have to curse over the useless GUI. The voice acting and music is quite enjoyable throughout the whole game. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of progress as you make it through the investigations. One of the puzzles is plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with no obvious reasoning, even in walkthroughs. Movement is extremely clunky which is a pain when you need to sneak or solve a timed puzzle. The set of final questions - which are optional - were just guesswork due to the extreme lack of coherency throughout the rest of the game. There is just too little coherency for this game to work as entertainment.","April 16, 2014","false","16.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

The game begins with the death of a wealthy businessman and leaves you to investigate the scene. The game will then take you to multiple connected locations as you attempts to piece together the murder and uncover the assassin and the motive for the murder. The game is set over 5 days of investigations and each day will have you visit a location and search it for clues and solve one or two puzzles with ranging difficulties (some puzzles were quite hard and confusing), at the end of each day you will summarise your findings in a quiz, which for me was probably the hardest part of the game. I found the story to be quite engaging and interesting overall with a good range of characters and locations and was well suited to a Sherlock story.\n\nOverall 'Sherlock Holmes: The Silver Earring' was a good solid adventure game which presented a well written story and some good puzzles, taking around 9 - 10 hours to complete and with a very conclusive ending I would highly recommend it for adventure game enthusiasts.\n\n8.5/10","January 10, 2014","true","15.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

Less puzzle loaded and more clues and plot oriented, the game helps you keep track of the case by reviewing the main topics discovered at the end of each day. Also, the backgrounds are imensely developed, and so are the voice acting and speech of the characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/recommended/11150/","something_random","jimmy jimmyson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/","368 products in account","Can I say this game is good? Perhaps, but with certain conditions.\nFirstly, it's FAR better than "Holmes & the Mystery of the Mummy" and "Holmes & the Hound of Baskerville", in terms of quality, character and logical conclusion.\nSecondly, it does challenge players usings its puzzles and quizzes. Now, challenge is good for these types of games, but sometimes, the answers don't quite make sense. Maybe it's just me being daft? Yeah, probably.\nBut the game isn't particularly long, in terms of quantity of puzzles, but they are certainly sharp enough to be considered adequate.\n\nSo, graphics are better then previous games. But the cut scenes and navigation can still be stuttery.\nLike, whenever you want to talk to people, you have to approach them from a certain angle, and rotate yourself awkwardly.\nAnd if you want to walk somewhere, sometimes layering can be strange, and you walk through chairs and all.\nBut, that's not the point of a puzzle game, I suppose.\n\nNavigation is once again an odd concern. The game must be played in third person. Not only that, you have to click somewhere to make Holmes walk there, and double click to make him run (you can only run when outside or nobody is around). Particularly painful, especially in the forest part of the game.\nBut still, a puzzle in itself perhaps.\n\nAlong with puzzles are the quizzes.\nBasically, at the end of each in-game day, you get quizzed on everything you've collected in the day, from the clues you find, to the dialogue of people you talk to.\nMind you that answers are not exclusively restricted to that day's resources but can actually include information as far back as the first day. This means you'll need to remember what all evidence contains, and link it with any new evidence found. Painful, especially if you can't remember things in pristine detail, like me.\nAt least there's a walkthrough on GameBoomers.\n\nThere are various characters that are involved, some providing more information than others.\nLestrade seems particularly friendly toward Holmes though.\nInterface isn't too bad, seeing as you can read your notes and do a puzzle simultaneously.\nVery useful, and the best part is that the puzzle saves your progress, unlike "Holmes & the Mystery of the Mummy", so you can go and find more clues, come back and finish the fight.\n\nI find that the explanation at the end is quite complicated, and twist-inducing.\nWould've been better if it didn't break my computer every few minutes.\nLike, literally. I'd finish the credits or walk into a room, and I'd just get a black screen. Maybe a hardware fault regarding specs, but it ran fine for most of the game.\nBut otherwise, it was alright for a game of its state.\n\nI'll hand this one a respective 7/10. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.\nIt turns out Frogwares actually changes the character models for Holmes and Watson in the later games, so at least Holmes looks like he's had enough sleep.","December 16, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are almost no puzzles, it's just walking and talking, walking and talking... And that's not how I want to play a puzzle game.\n\nThe Silver Earring would have been nice as a visual novel, if you ignore some technical glitches, but it's below average as a puzzle game.\n\nI could recommend this game only to patient old-school detective story lovers; for everyone else - there are better games in the genre.\n\nFor example, Syberia 1 & 2 go along the same style, but are much better executed.\n\nMy overall rating 5/10.","May 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Now I really do appreciate the voice acting although sometimes a couple characters are too exaggerated.\nThis chapter starts faster than light. Invited to a reception by Sir Bromsby, Sherlock And Dr. Watson directly assist, together with the other guests, to his murder. They both will have to investigate his death assisted by inspector Lestrade as well. I must admit that the plot is quite complicated as well as some puzzles but it wouldn't be a Sherlock Holmes' adventure if they were different.\n\n+++PROs+++ DIALOGUES.  Now this is the serious innovation in the game since in the previous chapter we never find anyone to talk to. Now we get to talk to a lot of people, with different options, something I believe is very important for a point & click adventure, especially a Sherlock Holmes adventure.\nGRAPHIC. Compared to the previous chapter it really is a joy to play this chapter. Mind you, it's not the Cry Engine but still is pleasant to see (compared to the previous chapter)\nINTERFACE. At last the interface is more friendly and rich with more function to analyze items and whatsoever. You have a friendly inventory and a "notebook" which collects all the documents, photos and also transcriptions of each dialogue happened.\nMUSIC. Beautiful classical music always accompanies your investigations, with quiet baroque themes, happy tunes and fast paced tracks...---CONs--- MUSIC. ...Though unfortunately, as in the previous chapter it will repeat the track to death. Too bad because the music is made up of seriously beautiful compositions.\nMOVEMENT. Serlock is slow... SERIOUSLY slow because most times he can only walk (he can run but only in large spaces) and it's not just that: Anytime he needs to crouch to analyze something he needs to reach the right position for it... And he does it veeeeery slowly... Even if he is already in position he turns a little, then turns back then he interacts. Unnecessarily Odd.\nGRAPHIC. The aspect ratio is still 4:3 and the maximum resolution is 1280x920... -.-\nSUBTITLES. The whole game has text during all dialogues and so on but there's nothing during the short cutscenes which is one of the most important moments because something important usually happens or is being said. Too bad.\nINTERFACE. Nothing too bad, The hot zones for interacions sometimes are not where they're supposed to be, or maybe they're too small, or maybe you click them and nothing happens then maybe you click a little away and it works (a hot zone in a hot zone??). Also the menus have that art style very... Articulated that in some context it's hard to understand where to click (Specifically I'm talking about the ESC game menu, where both in options or save games you have to click the earring to get on the previous screen... And the earring is on the center of the menu, looking more like a decoration than a button). Also the notebook menu where you can scroll and read the documents, they're very small and can't be zoomed, not to mention the "lower-upper" page button. That too looked like a notebook decoration because when you go on it with the mouse it doesn't change anything, its colour, the cursor. It's not like it took me ages to figure those things out, but they're simple minor annoyance that should have been taken care of.","March 10","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044380284/recommended/11150/","76561198044380284","ZloPseto","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044380284/","306 products in account","The progress the Franco-Ukrainian studio Frogwares has made between their first game, Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy from 2002 and The Silver Earring, released 2 years later, is astounding. While the first one was a flawed, mostly cheap looking and generic first person adventure game, more abusing than using the Sherlock Holmes theme and character (Wael Amr himself admitted something along those lines in one of the interviews if I remember correctly) - the studio seemed to learn quickly from their mistakes - and the far better budget the predecessor somehow assured is obvious.  This time it's catering as much as possible to the Holmesians and The Silver Earring, and a much more enjoyable, complex experience, if not without its flaws.\n\nGameplay is more or less typical point & click fare. Pixel hunting wasn't entirely eliminated, but is much, much more rare and less annoying than in the original. Inventory juggling is quite minimal and rare. Using items with people is rare and in perhaps all occasions but one, prompted by Sherlock, and using them together in the inventory itself. All the dialogues, clues, hints & papers are kept by the game and integrated in a sort of a "quiz" system, where you answer a series of questions using them as "proof" for the questions you're posed. While not perfectly executed, forced, and, perhaps, slightly clunky, it's an interesting system in any case. The game ensures you have everything you need I guess, by keeping you in one place / room / area until you find everything, which helps progress I guess. The puzzles are adequate, logical except for one with a safe (oh, you'll know which one it is) which requires a strange leap of logic. Though having a random character who just happens to dabble in inventions in the game is as cheesy a premise for introducing them as it gets. In general, it didn't thrill me, it didn't annoy me. OK enough.\n\nWalking is an annoyance, however, moving is jittery in general, and clicking on a hotspot that's supposed to lead you to a place where the perspective changes doesn't guarantee that you'll get there, as Sherlock is prone to random bouts of turning in place indefinitely. Though you won't get stuck because of it. It just makes the one timed event and 2 that require timing more annoying than they should be for some.\n\nThe story & scenario are OK, and while it's not the best & original Sherlock scenario you'll ever see, it's fairly complex, with some good sides, and won't annoy the hell out of you like the first game. The voice acting is more convincing than last time (that's not saying much), though how and why couldn't they find a kid to play a kid, instead of an abysmal attempt by a grownup actor is beyond me - it depends on the character really.\n\nGraphically it's a mixed bag, with character models ranging from pretty detailed (Holmes) to completely off (Watson... whose character isn't executed exactly flawlessly either). Some scenes are more or less nicely or adequately rendered, some feel rushed & unconvincing. Similar with cutscenes, generally unimpressive, but then you run into the "dominoes" one -> effective, very well directed & executed, showing there's quite some potential inside the team. And the outro was at the time, and maybe still is, one of the longest in a game ever (around 20 minutes... seemed shorter to me, but it might as well have been). While there are mild glitches here & there, miles ahead of its predecessor.\n\nMusic? Dvořák, Grieg, Schumann, Tchaikovsky. Need I say more? Well implemented too.\n\nOverall, while, as a point & click adventure game, it will never be among your all time favorites, being a pretty much average adventure game as a whole, it has its good sides and there's no real reason for a p&c buff or a Sherlock fan not to seek it out (preferably in a bundle), so it gets a tentative recommendation... there are worse things to spend an afternoon on.","July 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are old but you get immerse once you get into the rythem. The entire case is really all over the place and only begin to link up at the end of the game.

Overall the game is a bit clunky but I actually had alot of fun.\nThis is definately a point and click adventure game, but definately a true mystery case.

The GUI is a complete pain, especially in portions where Sherlock needs to be moved around with precision, as he requires several second to just turn around, even when trying to avoid guards, and the game world is filled with invisible walls. The fixed third-person perspective also often turns the game into pixel hunt. Besides that, the game also pointlessly makes the player manually select dialogue options, even though all need to be cycled through, and all are recording in the journal, so there's no need to ever revisit them.\n\nMeanwhile, the story does make for an entertaining enough whodunnit, which isn't dampened even by the dismal voice-acting. At the end of each chapter the game makes the player pick the right clues to yield the correct deduction, which is a neat feature, as it prompts the player to pay attention and use their noggin, instead of just clicking on everything and letting Sherlock do the reasoning. For most part, the deductions are sensible, too, though all the contrived puzzles people use to lock their saves and whathaveyou certainly push the limits of believability.","September 8, 2015","false","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a point and click title where you control Sherlock or Watson, hunting down clues to allow you to progress, hunting down evidence and questioning the npc characters. I liked the art style, and the general pacing of the mystery. At the end of each act you are given a little quiz to see if you have understood what Sherlock has discovered based on the evidence found, which I did find a little difficult, but the rest of the game is fine and fun to play.","December 13, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very standard PNC adventure, but here the puzzles make sense and the game politely doesn't let you continue if you've missed something.  Insofar as that goes, it's not unwinnable by design except for a small bug that you'll probably never encounter.\n\nWhile not particularly difficult, the worst bits are the two timed events and those are your only chances to prematurely lose the game. Other than that, it's great fun with some decent voice acting and the plot is full of the expected twists.  As a word of warning, the game does quiz you after each chapter to ensure you're paying attention.","March 12, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pointing and clicking, investigation parts are nice and works pretty well. Some of the clicking is a bit weird, and it can be hard to find the scene transition points, where you need to click to have the camera angle change. Some of the clues too can be a bit tricky to find/see on screen. I was reading all of the material gathered, and even so was unable to get much of any sense of what was going on throughout the case. The case takes place over several days and at the end of each day you face a quiz which turns out is quite hard if you're not able to puzzle it together especially well. There's also one quiz at the very end of the game, where you point a finger directly at each murderer for each murder, and jesus that was tough. Especially as one of the people you accuse are referred to by a different name than the people you can choose between.\n\nThere are a few nice puzzles to the game, and the game let's you know when you've exhausted a location for clues and dialogue options. Though there are two points in the game at which the puzzles go completely idiotic. There's one "stealth" part, that involves precise seemingly pixel perfect positioning of Sherlock, and timing to get him to walk/run and not get spotted by a guard and his dog. The second one is a timing thing where you have to click-run Sherlock through a maze forest to fill a bucket with water to put out a fire before the fire destroys evidence. These parts were pretty stupid/bad. But didn't take me too many retries to get right, I actually got the fire on the second try, but had to practice the route a couple of times before trying the second time. Hehe.\n\nEven so, really enjoyed this. The ending cinematic goes on forever and explains every single thing that happens in the entire story, and in classic Sherlock Holmes fashion you didn't catch on to half the stuff he babbles on about as far as motives and back story.\n\nIt's simplicity itself.","March 15, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have an unusual monitor resolution, the game's hot spots may be improperly synced, making it impossible to interact with things. I was only able to fix this by switching to a different monitor. I've only heard of one other person having this problem, however.\n2. There is a missable clue in the first chapter which breaks the game near the end. The game requires you to pick up all necessary clues before moving on except this glitched one. Consult a guide and save yourself the hours it'll take to start over.\n\nAll in all, Silver Earring has taken a huge step from Mystery of the Mummy. The story, gameplay, controls, and voice acting are all vastly improved. This game marks where the series really began to capture the traditional Sherlock Holmes vibe. Unlike many mystery games where the protagonist seems to be a complete idiot, Holmes is always a step ahead without leaving the player feeling completely lost. The end-of-chapter quizzes really help to keep you up with the story, so you don't find yourself simply clicking around with no idea what's going on.\n\nThough the game is an overall improvement from it's predecessor, it does have its share of problems. The occasional typos and strange subtitles were more funny than annoying to me. The Action/Stealth sections can be a bit difficult as Holmes is not always easy to control, but with a few tries they can be mastered. For the most part, if you are forgiving of the game's age it will be easier to enjoy.","May 17, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games such as Discworld Noir and Under A Killing Moon do it really well and it's kinda sad that so few games in the genre exist. The Silver Earring is another of these games which does not rely upon "use item X with item Y" puzzles but rather on cross-examination, investigation and tying elements together.\n\nIt doesn't do it as well as the above-mentioned examples, however. In most areas the games is quite adequate but never more than that, and in some areas the game is rather poor. Here's a list of PRO's and CON's:\n\nPRO\n- The game keeps track of everything you collect & where you collected it in list-form. Same with dialogs and letters and other evidence. Very tidy and handy\n- the Quiz between chapters is pretty well done and forces you to think for yourself\n- the backdrops are pretty well designed\n- the game has a nice attention to detail in true Sherlock Holmes fashion\n- the murder mystery is actually quite engaging\n\nCON\n- the dialog is very hit & miss - some parts are simply poorly written while others are quite convincing. The voice actors are mostly average at best\n- the characters you meet are not that interesting or simply break immersion by being unbelievable (the drunks outside for example)\n- the interface is a bit of a chore to say the least.\n- sometimes the game will let you "use" an object through dialog and sometimes you got to drag it onto a person - the game is very inconcistent like that. Since you pick up loads of items, this can be very tedious if you get stuck\n- the game heavily relies on linearity - you need to find every single clue before it will continue which can be infuriating. A walkthrough is a must if you want to enjoy the game!\n- the music is not very appropriate a lot of the time and harms the immersion.\n- the Quiz requires every single answer to be correct and in two instances, I found that the question was confusing so I had to cheat.\n- Holmes is even more of a jerk than the books make him out to be - he's plainly rude half the time.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Just about but barely and only with a walkthrough. If you love murder mysteries, this is still a nice game if you can forgive its flaws ... .","October 12, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more recent games have seen an increase in morbidity, verging on horror, which is a no buy stamp for me.\n\nThis game is not your average point and click adventure, as the difficulty does not rely in inventive ways of combining items, but in interpreting the information you gather through discussions, observations, documents, just like Sherlock would. You have to enjoy sifting through lots of dialogue, names, places etc. in order to reach a certain conclusion.\nIf you don't, then it's not the game for you.\nThe animations are well done, even though where are some issues with the movement of the characters, and they add nicely to the overall atmosphere.\n\nAll the answers are logical in the end, you just need to pay attention and consider everything.
