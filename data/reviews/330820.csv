ROM is by no means some kind of ham-fisted "tumblr" "sjw" nightmare. what they're trying to say is: "this game is diverse and asked for my pronouns and that made me uncomfortable."\n\nROM is an obvious love letter to all things cyberpunk, especially blade runner, hideo kojima's underappreciated snatcher, and ghost in the shell. though some unavoidable parallels are drawn between current social issues and those featured in the game, they are hardly ROM's central focus, and the questions it asks are no more offensive than any other cyberpunk work (such as the three i mentioned previously). the writing and characters are consistently entertaining and charming (i love turing so much). the artwork and overall aesthetic is gorgeous, stylish, and detailed. the music is incredibly catchy and groovy and will stick in your head for a while after playing. as far as gameplay goes, if you're a fan of adventure games in the style of snatcher, or maybe even ace attorney, you should enjoy ROM. it can feel a bit linear at times, though i know there are a few different endings that depend on your choices throughout the game, but the linearity never really bothered me.\n\ni don't really have many criticisms. ROM can be pretty wordy at times (conversations occasionally carry on longer than necessary, as well as individual pieces of dialogue) and there are some questionable design choices here and there (such as the out-of-place japanese text on some buildings and billboards, which may be there as a reference to its influences). i think my biggest complaint is that the game's length and pacing discourage replay value, which makes achieving multiple endings kind of a chore.\n\ni thoroughly enjoyed it, however. ROM's gameplay and style may not appeal to everyone, but i highly recommend it if what you've seen/heard so far seems like it's up your alley. it's very well-made and clearly had a ton of work put into it, and without a doubt i consider it one of the best games of 2015.","December 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 224 of 310 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","224","310","4","8"

However, playing it is wading through passive-aggressive, condescending murk and it's not an experience I would recommend to other people.\n\nI feel that the story of this game would be better served by being setting it up as a visual novel with Turing the robot as the explicit protagonist rather than the point-and-click adventures of their bumbling sidekick. You are very much Turing's sidekick. Turing drives the story and it's Turing's journey that the game is ultimately about. Your role is to piously "witness the world’s first sapient robot learning to grow and live," absorb info dumps, serve as a punching bag for constant anger and threats, and to provide comic relief by talking to inanimate objects. I found it tedious.\n\nIf you don't want to play quite so reverently, there are a lot of dialog options where you can be a jerk for no reason, but really that just gives the game ammunition to treat you even more like a total schmuck so I didn't bother.\n\nAlso, prepare for glitchy, poorly explained puzzles that pop up out of nowhere, keep you from saving when they appear, and may not affect the story at all or may downgrade your ending if you mess them up.\n\nIf you want a game that explores meaningful choice, I would recommend Life Is Strange.\nIf you want pixel art and an awesome story with awesome characters, I would recommend Undertale.\nIf you want an interesting experience where you are not the protagonist, I would recommend The Beginner's Guide.\nIf you want a cyberpunk game, I hear that Shadowrun: Dragonfall is pretty good.\nIf you want the most inclusive setting, then and only then I would recommend this game.","October 12, 2015","false","11.8"," 284 of 435 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","284","435","11","15"

This is a game where you meet someone who is TORMENTED by her experience of RACISM, by which I mean she hangs out in a club with people who all like her and she has friends and probably a nice apartment in the San Francisco area (think about how much that would actually cost) and she's upset that some people, who everyone thinks are lunatics, are protesting the company that makes animal-people like her. Like, yes, that is something to be upset about, but it's like comparing a stubbed toe to the ♥♥♥♥ing Stonewall riots.\n\nNeo San Francisco is a GRITTY DYSTOPIA where everything is bright and cheerful and people have nice apartments and everyone is friendly all the time. Everyone is a COOL HACKER who is BEYOND THE LAW and also has a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Even our protagonist, who is specifically said to be massively in debt, has basically no worries or problems besides that. Hell, once he sends in his article, which takes about five minutes of game-time, he's pretty much done caring about his debt! These characters wear the trappings of poverty and hardship, but fundamentally they all live like 20-something hipsters living on their family's money. Here's your great gift, LGBTQ gamers, it's a bunch of quirky characters who deal with life by drinking another artisanal cocktail at their local dance club and then eventually, I guess, solve a mystery. If they can get around to it.\n\nI know that the developers are, indeed, involved in LGBTQ stuff, and that's fine. It's respectable. But they clearly don't know ♥♥♥♥ about actually dealing with any kind of racism, prejudice, or anything else.\n\nStraight Outta Compton as written by a 50-year-old white guy, 0/10.","November 2, 2015","false","2.2"," 657 of 1,069 people (61%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","61","657","1","125","54"

The player character serves only as a dog to be yanked along on a leash by your insufferable robot companion, and gleefully kicked by any of the NPCs who haven't reminded you how superior they are within the last five seconds.  Your constant ally in the game treats you like a petulant child from your first encounter, and relishes every opportunity to express their disappointment in you as a player for daring to explore the dialogue tree or challenge a given idea.  From the outside it may sound funny or like a purposeful stylistic decision, but from a gameplay perspective it's genuinely frustrating.  Even the flavor text you get from examining the objects in the world drips with disdain for the player.\n\nAfter several chapters of having my character dragged through the mud from every possible direction, I didn't want to play anymore.  The premise is somewhat fascinating, but there's nothing within this package that's not extremely derivative.  This game is what happens when a writer is more interested in forcing their ideas down your throat than crafting a compelling, enjoyable narrative.  I strongly suggest avoiding this game and looking for another adventure.","January 7","false","5.1"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","53","73","0","0"

And unfortunately the characters and dialogue really aren't compelling enough to carry the story.\n\nOne of the only puzzles I've encountered so far involved re-routing a taxi through a grid and although I guided it to the correct goal position nothing happened?

You've got your Blade Runners, your Snatchers, your Ghost in the Shells, your Deus Ex-es and so on. It's wearing a lot of inspirations on its sleeve, sometimes a little too on the nose, but that's fine enough on how they executed it in my opinion.\n\nFortunately this game also brings its unique style to the table, the environments all have very brightful and cheery colours just like the characters that inhabit them, all of that makes the game unlike anything else in the whole cyberpunk genre. The whole atmosphere is also greatly supported by the beautiful soundtrack that I definitely recommend giving a listen to.\n\nAs for the story. It brings a lot of themes to the table, but I felt like it didn't spent a sufficient amount on any of them. It didn't gave me time to think about the questions that I felt the story was asking me to ponder about, and they also lacked weight so they felt like they didn't even matter that much. Personally, I was mostly cruising with barely enough interest on how they'd bring it all together. And that's weird since we're talking about a cyberpunk story, I love this genre to bits but this one just doesn't work for me for some reason.\n\nThe pacing is all over the place, I thought it was just bad frankly, because when something impactful happens during the story it's like it doesn't strike hard as much as it should. There's no sense of raising the stakes, there's no tension building up until maybe the very last act. But even then it's a very brief section and then it just... ends.\n\nI honestly thought up until the end that there was going to be some kind of huge ruse, a plotwist that would've changed everything we thought about the story so far, so that then, and only then, the real journey truly began - but no, it just ends and it was just really that predictable and underwhelming as it seemed from the beginning. I don't know, I didn't even had expectations but I was left disappointed anyways.\n\nAnother problem I had was with the main character. The MC is supposedly you, the player, but I felt like in this kind of scenario it just sucks. He's just a passive spectator, a weird sidekick to the more interesting characters the story presents to you. He doesn't do much, really. He's a void that somehow the game expects you to fill. Sometimes the game wants you to partecipate to the events happening on the screen, but I never felt like I was that character the game was pointing at.\n\nIt's weird to say this, but I think I would've felt more immersed and involved in the story if the protagonist had been an actual established character in the game's universe. I really hate making a comparison here, but Snatcher had Gillian Seed as its main character and he was awesome. And it's not like he was really that cool, he was mostly a naive and goofy guy, but that's why I liked him. I warmed up to him throughout the story, I felt more connected to him as a player than what Read Only Memories has got for a main character.\n\nThe gameplay part is fine. They spent a lot of time putting funny descriptions to things you can examine around the environment and I really appreciated that. I love looking at useless things if the game has something funny to say about it everytime. It makes it worth the effort and it adds charm to the game. The puzzles, while cool because they are part of the story, are too simple but I liked how they made them so there's never a game over, so even if you fail one the game just keeps going in a different direction, sometimes changing pieces of dialogues or even entire chunks of the story. That's great and deserves some recognition.\n\nThat being said this game is played mainly for the story, it's a narrative focused adventure game and as such my opinion towards the game is mostly based on how the narrative is presented and executed, and the general quality of it. That's why this is a negative review: the framework of the game is fine and you could do some amazing things with it and the artstyle - paired with the music which I again recommend listening to - is amazing, but it just felt mediocre to me. It's style over substance. There are other games in this genre that are more worthy of your time.","January 6","false","14.6"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","2"

The animations and art style are really the only selling point I can think of, other than that it really is just unfun.\n\nI guess my biggest problem is that the protagonist just isn't likeable; the game opens up with them complaining about writing a review for a set of headphones, and goes into how they're "selling their soul bit by bit." This just screams to me of an obnoxious privledged person. Maybe that's the point, to show how they grow as a character, but it really doesn't do you any favors that this is who you're supposed to connect with, especially when you're at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nBut the game would almost make up for having a poorly written and unlikeable protagonist if the other characters were actually any good. Turing, your robot buddy, is a smug ♥♥♥♥er who can't ♥♥♥♥ing stop talking about how great they are. There's a cat lady who gets super offended at you when you're forced, by the game, to ask if she's a character you're looking for. Then there's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tomcat, a guy who is nostalgic for the pre-Civil War south. You know, the south that had slaves. Yeah. He's not super likeable either, surprisingly!\n\nThen there's the plot. Oh my god the ♥♥♥♥ing plot. Never have so many words been used to say so little. Your friend Hayden is missing and your new robot buddy comes to you for help finding him! Oh boy! Excitement! But its all lost in the sea of words, as Turing just keeps talking and talking and TALKING about ♥♥♥♥ you legit do not care about. Here's another issue I have: maybe don't have a nameless protagonist and just have the main character be Turing? That way you're never being talked at for what feels like hours and being told how much of an idiot chump you are. Oh and we'd also feel some sort of emotional connection to Hayden (he did create Turing after all!) instead of having a protagonist that just goes along with events because they have nothing  better to do with their time.\n\nOh and don't even get me started on the comparisons between the LGBTQ+ community and the weirdo hybrids. Not only does this have the most infantitle understanding of how gene therapy would work (sharks can get cancer you morons!), but the oppression the hybrids claim to experience just feels so false. "We wanna have kids!" they scream, "but this law says we can't!" That law is set in place because hybrids would have literal monstrosity babies that would probably die within a few days, because baby octopus-human-fox hybrids could not survive outside the womb. Not to mention the strain it would take on the mother, both physically and mentally. The only actual case of oppression in the game is of a cat lady having some of her non-gene therapy'd eggs being destroyed by racist doctors, but even then the courts side with her and give her a huge pay out! The system works! That's not oppression!\n\nI guess that's a lot of words to say I think this game is garbage. Its garbage plain and simple. The writing is awful, the characters are awful, and the message is awful. Its awful and I'm glad I got it as a gift so that I didn't give money to the developers. If you want a game with lots of talky stuff that isn't awful, but also wanna support indie devs, there's plenty of other options that don't make you want to remove your eyes with a rusty spoon.

Considering this, I went into playing without any expectations of this and to be honest its presence was not bothersome in the least. Suprisingly enough it is a lot of other creative choices that were made by the studio that ended up demolishing my immersion in the world they have created with what amounted to a narrative sledghammer. In the end I am left very dissapointed because in part I see how much potential the game has and because playing the game like a reasonable person gave me the most boring ending of them all, the one that most people get actually, that is an issue.\n\n### SPOILER WARNING ###\nAlso there is no TL:DR, you are reading a review for an interactive novel, you know what you were getting into.\n\nPros:\n- The art style for the game is rather great, it captures just the right kind of atmosphere in which cyberpunk tends to thrive in my opinion and modernizes a lot of the fashion and form from the era it was concieved in.\n\n- The music is superb and fits the story excellently, none of the tracks feel out of place with the scenes they are used in.\n\n- Having streamed my gameplay for my girlfriend who is also a sci-fi fan this interactive novel sparked some intense and interesting discussion regarding the social and technological aspects of this established world and the impacts of the various cyberpunk media that came before it.\n\n- The characters are rather varied in the story and it is refreshing to interact with most of them.\n\nCons:\n- The number one con is the massive railroading that takes place in this interactive story and given that it is one it is a bit silly to say that. However, it presents several means for solving different situations but their trigger points are entirely non-obvious and once reached lock you into lengthy interactions you can not skip, even by end tasking the game. I don't know about you but I don't feel like acting in a way I do not expect my character to just because I made one wrong choice in a lengthy dialog tree.\n\n- PC culture is strong with this one. I tried to play this ineractive novel as a nice guy just trying to help out a friend who is in trouble and I tried to engage people in coversation as one would, I was quickly shown that I was in fact playing as the antichrist and I should seriously reconsider my life choices. The game painfully trains you how you are supposed to interact with the story if you don't want to come off as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with every word that comes out of your mouth.\n\n- One of the greatest sins I can think of in writing a story is to actually snap your subject out of the world they are in with the way you write. There are several instances of this in the interactive novel such as when a robot breaks into your apartment, mucks about with your personal belongings and data, then outright tells you he is not bound by Isaac Asimov's three laws or any other governing structure that would ensure he does not kill you and your reaction is just to roll with it. The breaking point for me was when Jess told me the kind of neighborhood I was going into to help save my friend was so dangerous that without the proper protection from her I could end up in an organ chop shop, that was when I went "Yup this is a game and I am only playing it because its a game, no sane person would do this." given the fact that I had not been in contact with the lad in distress for years and from later conversations in the story its pretty evident why, he's a major ♥♥♥♥. There is also a point where you tell someone that a person's life is on the line and that you need a piece of tat that they own to trade to a dealer to help them and they outright refuse even when someone who knows them tells them its the truth, this leads into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t segment about sharing and a lesson I was too irritated to learn from the interaction. There are plenty more in the story and its aggrevating to just remember them.\n\n- Another problem I have with this interactive novel is that the authors of it do not have a good enough grasp on the technical and even literary concepts they are trying to convey, it has just enough to keep you interested but for a person knowledgeble and willing to dig deeper you quickly find that it ends at the surface.\n\n- The interactive mechanics of the game are very crude, the puzzles range between too simple and I am just going to rub this on everything until I get a result because I have no idea where to start.\n\n- Also the fact you don't get to play a whole act of the game because you don't sign up for the cyber hippie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fed to you in the end of the game about giving all ROMs their own agency which most of them won't be able to use effectively since they are older models in the words straight out of the game, is a low blow.\n\nIn closing I will not be playing the game over, the developers have clearly shown that they want to tell a pretty hard sci-fi story but they will only let you enjoy it if you leave your brain at the door and I am not down for that.","January 15","false","10.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/330820/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Read Only Memories is beautiful in its willingness to embrace its most earnest parts. Cyberpunk as a genre seems obsessed with the grimy underbelly of technological utopias, social disorder among megacorporation overlords, and the dangers unregulated scientific breakthroughs create for humanity at large. Rarely is it even discussed that maybe there’s room within cyberpunk for more than government induced terror and futuristic narcotics. Where, if I may be so bold, is the cute side of cyberpunk?\n\nIn the not so distant future of Neo-San Francisco, AI assistants (known as ROMs, hint-hint; nudge-nudge) have risen to the forefront of the public consciousness, with Parallax single handedly leading the charge in robotic advancement. Vying for news worthiness is the growing disorder among hybrids (which in this sense are primarily anthropomorphic humans) and the rebel group The Human Revolution, who see this kind of bodily modification as an act against God and humanity. None of this is of pressing importance to you, however, as your only preoccupation as of now is writing up tech reviews for a non-paying blog, hoping their promises of “exposure” pay off (it was at this point that Read Only Memories became far too autobiographical and I had to take a moment to calm down). Everything changes when Turing, the first fully sentient AI, shows up on your doorstep (or more accurately hacks their way inside your apartment).\n\nThanks to the goldmine that was 80’s science fiction, it seems a little too easy to see where this is headed. Uncover the dastardly plot, enlist the help of the cities least wanted, and save the world from a massive corporation that seeks to enslave it. Throw in some futuristic tech and this is cyberpunk 101; easy, effective, and more than a little played out. And this is where Read Only Memories begins to shine. Developer Midboss has taken the essence of cyberpunk as a genre and flipped it inside out, showing the bright and charming side underneath.\n\nRead Only Memories rides the fine line between playful awareness and self-indulgence, letting its humor and love of the 80’s as an aesthetic show through without dissolving into a string of references and in humor. Characters are slyly charismatic and witty, endearing despite their transparent shallowness through strength of writing alone. Read Only Memories might only be surface deep, but it’s an intentional prioritization toward individual conversations over character studies. It isn’t as important who these characters are so much as what they’re saying, an understanding that allows Read Only Memories to mask the simplicity and convenience of its plot by creating memorable encounters which standalone but are no less entertaining because of it.\n\nWords cannot describe how thankful I was to discover how unconcerned Read Only Memories is in wasting your time asking you to solve bizarre item based puzzles. Arbitrary logic-less conundrums are the bane of my adventure game loving existence, but Read Only Memories is far too invested in its dialogue and world building to force you to carry around an abundance of junk which will somehow become useful later on. Even when it seems like the game might be falling into that trap, it immediately flips it back around as a knowing jab at the insanity most adventure games put their players through, despite being almost universally derided for it. Read Only Memories isn’t hands off the way a visual novel is, but it never asked for anything more than for me to care about investigating its world and characters, something I was more than happy to do.\n\nAs curious as I was to get at the heart of the mystery which drove Turing to my apartment, it’s the world of Neo-San Francisco and the quirkiness of its inhabitants that caused me to fall in love with Read Only Memories. The synth heavy soundtrack set the tone for a low-scale technological metropolis, charming in its familiarity while still retaining a suitably futuristic vibe. It’s also a wonderfully queer city, allowing LGBT characters to exist without it needing to be a point of discussion. While overt representation is importance, there is a lovely sense of acceptance in how Read Only Memories doesn’t treat being gay or gender fluid as something that needs to be said; it’s just part of who someone is.\n\nRead Only Memories is less subtle in the clear analogies that can be drawn between its hybrids and the social climate LGBT persons face in modern society. There is a rightful anger in many of the discussions concerning the lack of dignity and humanity afforded hybrids by those who see them as less than human, and these moments are perhaps the most raw and impactful. Read Only Memories isn’t really a game about LGBT rights, but that doesn’t mean it can’t become a platform for discussion, or at the very least a notable example of a game that recognizes LGBT people exist and doesn’t treat them like a buzzword to put on the back of the box.\n\nRead Only Memories begins to fall apart a bit as it comes to an end, when circumstances become so convenient as to defy even the limited restraints of the universe they’re happening within. But even recognizing the contrived nature of much of its plot, Read Only Memories never asks that you take it seriously, and doing so would probably only be to your own detriment. This is a game that is at home discussing the implications of mass artificial life as it is asking you to write a deliciously terrible Christmas song for an up and coming pop star. Read Only Memories is adorable and cheesy and holds itself together with an acute awareness of tone and by subverting a genre it clearly loves to death. It might be fluffy and lack a satisfying payoff, but Read Only Memories tries so hard and has such an enormous amount of heart that I’d sooner embrace it than write it off for such comparatively meaningless qualms.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 2","true","7.6"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","48","80","0","1"

It was a useless script that added nothing of value towards the game.\n\nSo Read Only Memories is a cyberpunk adventure game where a sentient robot named Turing invades your house and pleads for help as its creator went missing. That is all I'm gonna say with the story since it's the big focus of the game.\n\nI really love this game. I consider it one of my favourite indie games now. The story is well written, the characters are all lovable and memorable, the 80s retro artstyle is gorgeous and the music? Well I just bought the soundtrack so take that for what you will.\n\nIt's closer to a visual novel with a point and click adventure overlay more than anything. Its puzzles are not really complicated and the real big focus are on your interactions with people you meet. The discussions with Turing is my favourite, it's both adorable and very intriguing to talk to your little robot friend.\n\nThis game gets a 10/10 for me but even with that I can't reccommend this to everyone. It's just not that type of game. If you hate the terrible logic puzzles in point and click adventure games then I can safely say it has none of that, they cut the fat off that aspect of the genre. If you want a cyberpunk adventure that's light on the gameplay then I can definitely give this a recomendation to you.\n\nIf you're interested then please give it a go. MidBoss have done a wonderful job in creating this world. To me it's one of those games I missed out on during 2015.","March 12","true","16.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Unfortunately, its wonderful character designs and great music are squandered on a sterile plot that does a poor job of rising tension, a totally vacuous and unlikable player character whose motivations are forgotten immediately after being introduced, and ridiculously banal puzzles that feel like an afterthought. Then there's the weirdly unnatural-feeling fixation on identity politics that feels like it's pandering, at least when it isn't totally going off the rails and insulting the player or exploring upsetting, half-baked metaphors...but that last part's been discussed ad infinitum in plenty of reviews already, so I'll focus on the game's flaws as a narrative and adventure game instead.\n\nGreat games take you on a journey and at the end, you feel like you've accomplished something or are at least left with food for thought. At the end of ROM, I felt like I wasn't sure what I had really accomplished or what the point of it all was. Neo-San Fransisco is too bright and cheery of a setting for its own good; moments of the narrative that are supposed to be impactful simply disappear into the background, a problem compounded by how the characters approach everything with just a bit too much levity. To its credit, the game carries a lot of chuckles and is frequently funny, but unfortunately those moments don't do much for the narrative experience. ROM is also heavy on references to genre classics and cool/obscure games (for example, I caught a groaner of a reference to Deadly Premonition within my first five minutes of playing), which isn't inherently bad, but it seems to be used as a substitute for doing anything truly unique itself. Then there's the puzzles, which add nothing of value whatsoever to the experience, as they somehow manage to simultaneously be lacking in challenge, logic and purpose.\n\nThe lack of differentiation continues elsewhere; the design of the shooting segments is a direct rip-off the system in Snatcher, which was not a good gameplay approach in 1994 but was at least understandable for the era. 20 years later, it's baffling. This is similarly a problem with ROM's interface which is clunky and frustrating, and then there's the text that is generally too large for its pixelated design; if you are playing the game on anything larger than a mid-size laptop, you will need to run this game in a window, or the blocky text will give you a nasty headache. Perhaps this is less of an issue for others, but I literally gave up playing this on my desktop after two hours and finished it on my laptop to alleviate this issue, which no other game text has ever presented. There should really be an option to adjust the text size...\n\nI felt really let down by Read Only Memories, and struggle to recommend it. It feels like a pale imitation of Snatcher, the wonderful Konami classic it tries so hard to emulate; meanwhile, Technobabylon is a substantially better modern cyberpunk adventure game that offers a gripping experience without needing to make "cool" references to earn points with the player. I highly recommend you skip this one, and play both of those instead.","January 24","false","6.5"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

A good story that considers your identity? A colorful cast full of cool characters?  Then you're in luck!

This game is full of puzzles, a mystery to solve, a good OST, neat characters with their own stories, and a entire city of Neo-San Francisco in 2064 to explore.\n\nOne of the things that really struck me is the little details that don't just jump out at you, but they make the difference.  If you're someone like me who isn't male or female, they have the option for some common gender neutral options (they/xir/zir) and if those don't suite you, you can input your own!

At the core of this, it's a Visual Novel but it's unique in its own right and I'd recommend checking it out right now, especially with the humble bundle here for the next 2 weeks.\n\nRead Only Memories is a solid game to which I've enjoyed to the fullest extend and plan on getting all the achievements.... one day.  10/10","June 2","true","16.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

Getting the good out of the way, the game really does look good, and while it's going for the retro look that most indie games fail to emulate, it pulls of it pretty well making it look like a very pastel looking Sega Genesis/ Mega Drive game, and an early 90s anime. The soundtrack it's the best part of the game, really uses a great mix of instruments and chiptune very well, utilizing it to atmospheric moments that are appropriate to the locations and moments. If anything, I recommend the soundtrack than the game itself. If you're expecting this game to have a similar level of challenge seen in Snatcher, look elsewhere, this game is pitifully easy with little to no challenge whatsoever. None of the puzzles will ever get you stumped, and I honestly don't even know why they even bother putting in combat in the game. It feels like this game wasn't really made for gamers, and with its usage of LGBTQ characters and themes, it feels real insulting for LGBTQ community, basically saying that they can't handle a good challenge. I know several gay gamers, and they're very good at the games they play, and take them seriously too. Plus, I feel as though this effects the game's story. There's never really any moments of satisfaction because you never really worked for the objective. This doesn't really help when there are moments in the game where you could do something, but some convenience happens, and on what could have been, really doesn't happen. Other than that, the plot is really mediocre. Has a very rushed pace, and none of the concepts and issues the game brings up never feels like we delved into it enough. They're interesting, but very short lived, and could of done what Deus Ex takes its time to discuss about these concepts and issues. The game really lacks good build up, which makes the game feel really empty that way. There aren't really any intense or cool moments, it just feels like, intense moments happen, but with no build up, they lack impact. There are a few entertaining characters, but most of them aren't that interesting, and feels as though they make the characters a part of the LGBTQ spectrum first, and their personalities secondary, making the game feel really shallow because of it. I find the plot mediocre, mostly because of robotic partner Turing. The plot does revolve around Turing, and I think the character is alright, it has enough personality to where you can have empathy with it, but Turing is not enough to really save the shoddy pacing unfortunately, which is why I also don't think the plot isn't necessarily good. Along with its lack of twists, build up, and satisfaction, I can't honestly say the game is honestly good. It's like I experienced a short film with a lot of fascinating things happening, but it all goes too fast, and it just ends. I really don't feel the fifteen dollars is really worth it.  Just get the soundtrack and enjoy some nice tunes.","November 5, 2015","false","7.2"," 53 of 95 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","53","95","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/330820/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Read Only Memories is a game that I can easily recommend, yet not in the "you should totally play it" way and more in the "yeah, it's good" way. It starts great, but ends on a rather "eh" note, which disappoints, yet still doesn't feel like playing the game was a waste or anything.\n\nThe game itself is quite obviously trying to redo the feel a lot of Japanese adventure games in 80-90s had, most notably Hideo Kojima's Snatcher. It drops the annoying part of those games (where you're forced to click all options several times, often without clear indication as to why, to get new interaction options), focuses on narrative, but does contain some puzzles and "action" sequences. Instead of having a properly established main character, however, it goes for "player as a main character" route, where you do have few things about your backstroy established, but you do everything else. Which... actually detracts from the enjoyment of the story a bit. Without a proper main character with a clear personality, like, say, Gillian Seed from Snatcher, a lot of dialogue directed at you is done in a more "dry" informative and not REALLY interesting way, while the game tries to add it more character by using your robotic partner Turing a lot of lines during the dialogue. To the point where he becomes much more of a main character than your character ever does and all attempts at "buddy cop" interactions, like Snatcher did with Gillian and Metal, just don't really work in this game. Probably, partially because of that, game just doesn't feel as interesting and engaging by the end, where events should feel big and important, yet feel like just another thing happening with some predictable twists and a rather boring ending.\n\nIt's also worth noting game's desperate attempts to adress the issues of equality in genders, sexual preferences, races and such. I'm saying "desperate" simply because the way game handles a lot of those questions and its own characters often feels forced and not genuine. To the point where, I think, pretty much all major characters you interact with are bi- or homosexual and often look androgynous. Which could've worked with more characters, actual diversity, better dialogue and fleshed out lore (even through environmental storytelling) but doesn't. It doesn't detract from the game much, but just feels more like a "political correctness school play" than a story at times.\n\nAnother weird thing about the game is that while it's billing itself as a cyberpunk game, the future society it shows isn't actually cyberpunk in it's "proper" sense. There mostly no feeling of actual dystopia of expensive corporations vs low level of life for a lot of citizens and such - most locations you visit are pretty nice, most characters you see easily got gene and cybernetic enhancements and the poorest character in the entire game seems to be the player character, who still can by anything in the game without ever caring about money. And while there are social conflicts and "purity" vs "enhancements" clashes, we're mostly told of them and what we see is very tame and doesn't feel dangerous or important.\n\nSo, in the end, the game just doesn't deliver on all the promise it builds up at the start... yet is still enjoyable enough to play through and like some characters and moments. So - yep, it's good, just not as good as it could've been.","December 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","30","53","0","0"

It is a beautifully done adventure game in the vein of older PC-Engine ones such as Snatcher. The story is well done, the choices you make consequential to the various endings and how people react to you. Most importantly, the cast and setting are well done, and left me wanting more media set in the universe it sets up, as you feel the setting is very well fleshed out, and are left wanting more by the bits you hear of the backstory.\n\nWhile it is probably the least impactful to the actual game experience, lets start with gameplay. The game is displayed in a HUD that pretends to be an in universe computer display. You never see the character you are actually playing, leaving them freely definable (one of the first choices you make after a while is what pronoun you can be called, incluing 'xir'), and moving around consists of switching screens and locations. Interacting with objects is achieved by clicking on them, and choosing to talk/touch/look, or use an item. Notably, you only get an option to use an item if there is some response to it being used, even if it is just text. That alone prevents the rather normal adventure game 'play' issue of 'rub everything on everything to see if it works'. Most play consists of talking to people, investigating surroundings, and the occasional simple puzzle. By simple, I mean its rather logical, without the wierd moon-logic leaps some adventure games take. Your first puzzle is essentially finding a thumb drive, then finding a computer that can read it. There are some more complicated puzzles later on, but nothing that would ever need you to look at a FAQ, and some minor action segments. The game sticks pretty closely to making the game be about the story and characters, not obtuse puzzles.\n\nThe story, setting, and characters are clearly the highlight of the game. The cast is varied more so than any other game I have seen, given the setting is a cyberpunk future with DNA-treatments available. The game deals with discrimination against people with cybernetic implants, or genetic therapies that give them animal features (Whether for medical or personal reasons), along with just a general wide variety of people. The game walks that beautiful fine line that so few do, where others might point out 'Look, we included X in our game, aren't we progressive?!' this just introduces you to the characters, and their oddities are part of them, not akwardly bolted on. Noone in the game, other than the one character who could be called the only villain in the story and a faceless corporation, are truly villified. At its heart, it feels like a true noir story, albeit with a journalist instead of a detective. You wander from community to community, investigating while not being a part of it, a sort-of outsider that can choose to react to the various people how you wish, making friends or enemies of differing groups. The setting is well done as well, in that it doesn't throw information at you akwardly, instead you can look at more things to get some more background, and sometimes little tidbits are just mentioned in passing that make it feel more fleshed out because they aren't focused on unnecessarily.\n\nIn summation, it is a well done adventure game that focuses more on the story than awkward puzzles, and a beautifully diverse and interesting cast makes it well worth a purchase and play through.","December 27, 2015","true","101.0"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

If you're not a huge fan of the modern socjus crowd, you probably won't like this game. It has diverse characters as one of the biggest selling points of the game, and it more or less has folks of many backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities and gender identities. If that turns up your nose, you won't like it. I think, however, that it deserves heaps of praise for doing this. It has managed to put in a large variety of interesting characters with a variety of backgrounds without straying into tokenism or stereotypes (mostly, I'll come back to that).\n\nTL/DR: If you like diamond-in-the-rough well written adventure games, give this one a shot, unless the above applies to you.\n\nGetting that out of the way, the game is generally pretty good, but has lots of room for improvement. I'd like to see the developer come back and do more work, with the lessons this game has taught them, I hope.\n\nSome big gameplay criticisms are: there aren't very many good "talking puzzles" for an adventure game that features a lot of talking. Generally the 'correct' path is very obvious, and there aren't a lot of times where you have to carefully navigate your way through a conversation; this game is very light on the adventure game elements. The solutions, while (mostly) straying away from insane moon logic of older adventure games, overcorrects too far and can be a tad easy.\n\nSome story elements that could use work: while for the most part the dialogue is quite well written, the story relies on contrivances at times. I feel like the writers were worried about tension settling in too long, and so while there's one primary arc that takes up the whole game, each chapter has a number of things that are solved very quickly, and not always in a logical way. Succinctly put, I hope the writer goes back and reads some mystery novels, especially older pulpy ones, if this is the kind of story they're going for. I feel like the difficulty in the puzzles is also reflected in the characters' difficulty in solving the mystery. It could be because of the relatively short length of the game, but I feel like more dead ends, more chances for tension of not being able to solve the mystery would've added a lot to the tension and made the conflict more real. As it stood, I never really felt like the characters were in real danger of not succeeding. I also feel like the story was a tad predictable by about chapter 3 or 4. If you've seen [REDACTED] you'll know exactly what the plot twists are going to be.\n\nFinally, I do have some beefs with some of the characters. I feel like while they did try, and deserve credit for doing so, to make characters of various sexual, ethnic and gender backgrounds, they had a tendency to be a little ham-fisted about telling you about it, and skirted the line very close to stereotype. I feel subtlety would've gone a long way in making this feel more organic and less like the writer's utopian view of the future (a flawed utopia, but still a utopia).\n\nTo conclude, if you've made it this far in the review, try the game. It's definitely worth the asking price (and then some), and I've paid more for games I've enjoyed less. Turing is adorable and amazing, and the characters are generally awesome and memorable. It's flawed, but still really good. I'm as harsh on it as I am because I genuinely like it.","January 31","true","6.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The game has some nice music and a good retro feel to it, but aside from that you'll spend most of the time in endless boring conversations with characters you don't care about trying to find out things you don't mind about either. The gameplay sits rather uncomfortably between a visual novel and a point 'n click adventure with much better options available for both genres. By the beginning of fourth chapter I already lost any interest in the plot and I wish I was playing other better games instead.\n\nOh and I don't give a damn either about the whole SJW thing.

I have felt emotions that were not previously thought to be felt by heterosexuals. That is how I figured out I am gay. Thanks, ROM!\n\n\nEdit: Though, on a serious note. I appreciate Read Only Memories more than I can put into words.\n\nThis game is a treat for the neglected minority.\n\nYou're free to input your own pronouns; imprint on the faceless protagonist as much as you'd like.

In each corner is a minigame or interaction for you to utilize.\n\nSpeaking of drab, I appreciate how colorful this game is! The UI design is suitable and clever. Not only that, but it makes the sprite work stand out that much more. The palette is a fun break from other indie games that refuse to utilize bright colors. Instead of desaturated browns and straining blues, ROM is full of all kinds of palettes.

The writing quality of it is not impressive and the story is not memorable\n\n------LONG VERSION------\n\nI would like to start this review that I'm rating the story for this game @ 5/10. It was very average and the story was not memorable or even having an impact to me. I don't blame the storywriter though since writing a story about a "sentient" AI is hard especially when having to put it in a bigger picture and what ramifications it entails if it really happened.\n\nSecondly, the setting and some background story on what happened in the world was seriously weak. There was a lot of screen space that was wasted, the UI was not nice it's clunky especially if you are saving a lot of times like me. Also the dialogue skipping is annoying, It's not like a visual novel where double clicking will finish the sentence immediately, you're going to click at least 3-5 times just to complete the sentence because there is a minimum time delay before you can double click it. And because of this, I find the lack of autoplay on this game bad.\n\nDespite all that, the game still looks beautiful on its pixel graphics design. I had tons of laugh with their jokes and they even considered 2 kinds of players: One that tries to discover everything, and one that tries to finish as fast as possible. They've done it by not forcing the players to read everything they have written, but given the option for completionist to keep clicking repeatedly an action to see all the jokes. Unfortunately, even with the jokes, the character dialogues was extremely weak.\n\nPuzzles are not that bad as other people have commented, and it's nice to include them so there's a bit of a gameplay and not just reading. There are also 6 different endings on the game so you can repeat the game. There is a saving bug though where you can lose your progress and the slots doesn't work properly. I have experienced 3 save losses in my first playthrough and I'm lucky I only lost at the maxium 15 minutes of save lost since I save a lot.","January 8","false","11.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It was lovely seeing minority groups displayed as actual everyday people and not as stereotypes.\n\nI love the fact that you're free to project yourself onto the main character rather than playing a pre-determined protagonist, as it really helps you immerse yourself in the world and experience the story with more depth and emotion.\n\nYou can really see that a lot of work was put into this game by just looking at the flavour text. Each object has several different pieces of flavour text even before you start combining it with different things. And almost always that flavour text is something that made me smile. Never before have I been so fascinated by inanimate objects in a video game.\n\nThe only negatives I would say are that the story is kinda confusing, with the main plot never really being tied up and leaving many unanswered questions. Also, certain characters only being present for a few lines before vanishing in some way never to be heard from again. There is quite an issue with not having enough time to "bond" with characters before they're ripped away in a scenario you're supposed to find heartbreaking.\n\nRegardless though, I do very much love this game. It has its flaws and bugs, but nothing that breaks the experience. It was clearly made with love and is a delight to play.\n\nAlso this game needs more post game content. The Endless Christmas expansion is great but I would love an extension of even that. Like an app almost.  Different seasons, changing time of day, the ability to do up your apartment a bit. Turing could even store notes for you. That sort of thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrkcheung/recommended/330820/","chrkcheung","chrkchrkchrk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrkcheung/","124 products in account","Read Only Memories is an old-school point-and-click adventure game for the millenial generation. Offering a fresh spin on the classic cyberpunk dectective noir format, the game injects a progressive attitude and a sprinkling of self-aware sci-fi and anime references. You play a down-on-their-luck investigative journalist who is drawn into a missing persons case involving the world's first sapient AI, a ROM named Turing. The more you look into the case, the further you and Turing become entangled in a conspiracy with consequences that could shape the fate of the entire world. The subtext of the story revolves around the subject of identity and personhood, both for machines and genetically modified humans called hybrids, with clear nods to the current political climate surrounding gender and sexuality.\n\nAs a fan of the genre, I found the overall story engrossing and the writing was solid enough, but the structure of the game itself occassionally left me frustrated. There are certain points in the narration where my dialouge choices felt unintutive or pushed me a little too hard in certain directions. There are also only a handful of puzzles (though admittedly, it's a short game) and oftentimes I just felt like I was being shuttled around between exposition-laden plot points rather than actually doing any real investigating or problem solving. And when dialogue options and puzzles with consequences did appear, I typically didn't realize it until after the fact, usually witih negative consequences. The lack of an auto-save (or even quick-save) function really makes these sorts of situations feel punishing, and I found myself trudging ahead with my mistakes rather than go back and replay twenty minutes of dialogue. I'd advise new players to save often to prevent unnecessary headaches.\n\nNext to the writing, art design is probably the second most important aspect of a game like this, and though it feels a little uneven in places, Read Only Memories does a good job of building a cohesive environment for you to explore. Neo San Francisco is full of visually interesting characters and locations, though some feel more fleshed out than others. There's a general lack of polish (the graphics have a DIY quality that brings to mind the loose visual style in Undertale and other indie pixel games), but the pixellated 80s vibe is tastefully implemented and pairs nicely with the emotive noir soundtrack. There are a ton of items and objects to examine, and though very little of the observation you do effects the outcome of the game, I was relieved that everything is easy to find and interact with, with no pixel-hunting or oblique clues hidden out of sight, and plenty of Guybrush Threepwood-esque quips typical of the genre.\n\nI finished Read Only Memories in about 6 hours and missed the "true" ending, but I don't plan on going back and playing through again too soon. As far as I know, the dialogue is unskippable and I don't feel like wading back through the entire story again just to fix the one mistake I made midway through the game. That said, I did enjoy the game despite the clunky dialogue mechanics and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys these sort of throwback point-and-click adventure games. Try to catch it on sale, though, $20 feels a bit steep for such a light experience.\n\nB+","June 5","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But seeing one exists in the bare daylight with diversities and presentations of the LGBTPQ+ makes me feel very warm inside. The story itself isn't all-around favourite of mine but it's interesting enough to keep me running till the end. That said I'm a bit picky with things sometimes, ROM left a lot of open doors and opportunities with its endings but doesn't give us much closure on the characters.\n\nWhile the game gives us time to learn and love the main casts, there are yet too many questions left unanswered, in a way, could help for a sequel to run in. I do hope in the future, the developer will consider including nonbinary characters in relationship and etc. Not just homosexual relationship. Some parts of the game are very predictable, I can see it coming with the antagonist and Hayden's fate. Maybe that's just simply me being cynical the whole time.\n\nNot only the design is cute and catchy, although a bit hard to get into at first. But the pixel art style and the landscape of NEO-SF will eventually find its way into your heart with its bright and poppy theme. It's not outstanding in an artistic sense but it fits the game and its atmosphere. Character design in one way does a good job portraying the character, in another way makes you wonder how does that or this work.\n\nThe music is catchy! Really lovely tunes, some I just can listen to for hours on loops. Most of them are upbeat and funky, and suspenseful when needed. It does well on its ground when the setting. Can't say much for this side of the game because I just enjoy the OST overall. Thus, I recommend getting the Sights and Sounds for the OST. If not, you can always listen to the music in the original game or grab it from bandcamp. It does good works for many uses.\n\nGameplay, it has its up and down, funny and odd moments when you can use a lot of things on another objects, which ends up giving you humorous responses from the game itself. Getting drunk at the bar is also one thing or another, I hope they add more post-drunk scene aha That aside, the interactive mechanic of the game works quite well, nothing too bothersome or hard for you to figure out. Making it fairly straightforward without the dialogue system. The puzzle isn't hard but it works, maybe it takes first-timer once or twice to figure out.\n\nOverall, good game. 8/10 but 9/10 for TOMCAT heh","February 20","true","16.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Soon you find yourself in a mesh of hackers, androids and a corporation hungry for power.\n\nRead Only Memories, a 2015 released Point-and-Click adventure by MidBoss, tells the story of a fortuneless journalist, who helps the worlds first conscious robot on his quest to find his kidnapped creator.\nThe game is a homage to the cyberpunk genre of the 1980's, presenting itself in a Snatcheresque pixel-look, underlined by a catchy chiptune soundtrack. ROM's strengths lie in a diverse, albeit unnecessarily forced diverse, character cast and their atmospheric dialogues. Innocuous puzzles in a Point-and-Click typical manner, fill in the smaller, but not less important, part of the game.\n\nWith a broke freelancer in a run-down apartment, ROM chooses a cyberpunk typical start. Spam-mail in your inbox and a few pokes towards consumer society (e.g. having to pay for listening to more than 30 seconds of a demo tape) seem to support the noir theme, but soon the game takes on lighter tones and shows less grimness than I expected.\nThe protagonists financial situation is never mentioned a second time, no inequality between classes of society or consume abuse is shown and none of the characters met during the course of the game are in any serious trouble.\nYes, there is the questionable movement "Human Revolution", demonstrating against the dehumanization of gene manipulation. But the movement stays peaceful and persists on a single argument (humans should be nothing but humans), making it more of a side note than an important party to the game.\nThe corporation Parallax might have a lot of power and bare evil plans, but none of the power is shown off anywhere. Actually quite the opposite: the hacker Tomcat undermines the Parallax system on a daily basis and the player abuses several security holes throughout the game.\nEven the illegal part of society isn't intimidating at all. Teenagers fake passports in exchange for Anime-posters and the most dangerous weapon encountered is a paralyser gun.\n\nThat said, the light atmosphere, although genre uncharacteristic, fitted ROM pretty well.\nThe different characters are joyous natures and engage in easygoing dialogue.\n\nBut before coming to a conclusion, I want to point out one issue I had playing ROM. As a development team who strongly supports the LGBT community, MidBoss put a lot of emphasise on characters of different sexualities and gender identities. While this definitely contributes to the diversity of the cast, there were some cases where it felt out of place.\nThe character Sympathy for example, who appears in a handful of superficial dialogues, is clearly communicated to be transgender. That's fine with me, but why do I need to know? I exchange a few sentences with her, without really getting to know the character. Sympathy's gender identity doesn't influence the tone of the conversation or my non-existent understanding of her character and could just as well be unmentioned.\nIn situations like these, it felt to me like MidBoss just put in LGBT characters to satisfy a quota, instead of enriching the cast.\n\nDon't get me wrong, ROM does a lot of things right in this regard. Characters like Turing and Tomcat benefit from their unstereotypical personalities. But mindlessly distributing sexualities and gender identities, just for the sake of representing them, is a weak practice of diversity.\n\nTo finally get to a conclusion: Read Only Memories is a well-rounded story driven game. Memorable characters and lighthearted humor compensate for the diluted cyberpunk aspects and make Read Only Memories worth a play.\n\nRead more of my reviews at:\ntheguygaming.com","April 30","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay itself is a fairly simple point and click adventure, but the real heart is in the story being told. Six endings (of which I have seen only two) mean that your decisions do matter and the consequences are far greater than the story would originally imply. The graphics are very retro, but don't let that discourage you even if you aren't into the retro scene as the really important content is delivered by the dialog of a cast of characters that you will actually come to like (or dislike).\n\nRecommended for anyone who likes a good story with a good cast of characters. If there is any downside here, it is that (in keeping with the thematic decisons being made) you do need to save manually and there are points where failing to save could lead to a bit of replay. It only happened to me once, so it isn't a huge negative.","February 14","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm a Tumblr user myself, but not a SJW (I must be the last person who could be considered one in some kind of imaginable), I'm just a Roleplayer that saw a Blog related to this game and catched their interest. That's all.\n\n_\n\nThe first thing that got me into the game was the style it was using, from the designs/music of the scenery and the characters I've saw in the trailer, I'm someone who loves pixel games but also anything related to cyberpunk (not a huge reason behind it, it's probably just an aesthetic), point-and-clicks too, so it was a nice way of introducing me to a title I had no idea about at all (also, Turing, I don't think I'm the only one who bought the game because of them).\nI understand why could the subjects introduced into this game could intimidate/bother a few, I think this happens because the diversity of characters (in both race and sexuality/gender) is still a pretty new thing, also, because of Tumblr's fame out of the website, which, I must admit, is not the best.\n\nStill, even if they weren't that much developed (the game is short so I was expecting it), I really liked getting to know all this characters, even the surprises that came with a few of them (I'll be honest, I didn't expected several characters being in a homosexual relationship, that was a pretty good move, Midboss, it felt real to me). Though Turing was basically an emotional rollercoaster for me, I cried with that freaking character, they were both cute and heart-breaking and it caused pretty brutal emotions on me.\n\nI reccommend this game, but not because of the gameplay or details of that kind, but because I would like to know how could someone else react to it, if they would get sad after something happens, or if they would show happiness after something possitive occurs on the game (besides, this game is pretty obscure and it deserves some time under the spotlight). I really enjoyed playing ROM and I can't wait to taste more about this game (I've still got endings to witness, but I've got a code that involved not being a jerk even on videogames).\n\nI only wanted to talk about my experience with this title so no rating at all, just someone's heart talking.

If something in the later half makes me change my mind, I'll be editing this review to reflect my new perspective.\n\n\n\nSo this game is pretty charming. Its a point-and-clicker, I guess. I use the xbox360 controller, so keep this in mind with this review.\n\nIt has a nice style to it. SImple, nice colours- doesn't go overboard, your eyes are fine and not screaming. Alot of games trying to go for this look tend to make you want to gauge your own eyes out. Not this one.\n\nSide characters are interesting, and recognizable- you won't have an issue confusing them. They aren't over-the-top, but still manage to all be varied in shapes and sizes and colour schemes.\n\nYou can take your time, or not. The game does make you feel some sense of urgency, but you can pace yourself without any punishment, as far as I have played.\n\nIdk. Its fun, and the story does bring interest. The side characters are interesting each in their own right, and the game lets you be as polite or rude as you wish to be with them. Some characters like you instantly, others are snappy and defensive (some with reason, some without) and you can approach things in different ways to get your goals.\n\nPersonally I like offering gross spoilt milk to everyone and everything just to see their reaction. But thats just me.\n\n\n\nI recommend it regardless of the type of gamer you are, its visually nice. Might not be everyones cup of tea, but its good to waste some time, if you aren't really into the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jwang19/recommended/330820/","jwang19","jwang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jwang19/","151 products in account","A well realized cyberpunk story wrapped in a standard point and click adventure game\nRead Only Memories takes place in Neo San Francisco where robots are everywhere and cybernetic and genetic engineering are commonplace. Similar to the San Francisco of today, Neo San Francisco faces a similar crisis where the rich and elite are all in the tech industry. Also similar to current San Francisco is the openness concerning the LGBT characters. In fact in Neo San Francisco, no one bats an eye to see a man dressed as a woman or flinches when a woman says she’s in relations with another woman. Read Only Memories treats its’ LGBT characters with respect, not as running gags or people with lesser qualities unlike many many games that I have played before.\n\nYou play as a cash strapped reporter, writing reviews of just about anything to make ends meet. After writing a review for some sweet GX Ultra Beatz headphones, you go to sleep and wake up to a blue headed robot that has snuck into your home. After some brief dialog you discover that this robot named Turing is the first of its’ kind, capable of rewriting its’ own code. Turing tells you he was created by Hayden, a friend you knew a long time ago. Turing explains that Hayden was kidnapped and he fled to find help. It’s your job to find out what happened to the Hayden and the larger conspiracy surrounding his disappearance.\n\nGameplay wise, Read Only Memories is a standard point and click adventure game. The game doesn’t do anything to differentiate itself other than a few mini-games including one where you have to divert traffic to prevent a cab from escaping and another where you navigate through a maze. I found Read Only Memories easy. Puzzle solving always takes place in the same area and Turing often provides enough hints on what the do so you’re never really lost.\n\nThe game goes for a retro aesthetic dividing the gamespace into 3 sections, a menu/character portrait window on the left, the game window to the right and dialog on the bottom. I don’t have the appreciation or the nostalgia for that specific style. I found the small game window difficult to look at because it resulted in pixelated characters and items. I couldn’t really discern if a character is wearing a helmet, a wig or if it’s actually their hair. I also found it hard to read the text because it is so heavily pixelated. The only redeeming quality to the look is the portrait window, where characters are nicely detailed and displayed a variety of emotions.\n\nThe audio is good not great. The music is nothing too memorable but fits the whole cyberpunk theme. There is also some light voice acting. It’s completely serviceable, but nothing I would describe as amazing like I would for Supergiant Games’ Bastion.\n\nOverall Read Only Memories tells a great well realized cyberpunk story wrapped in a standard point and click adventure game. I can’t recommend this game wholeheartedly, but if you have a soft spot for old school adventure games and/or cyperpunk stories, Read Only Memories is definitely for you.","February 17","true","6.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The setting is Neo San Francisco and the year is 2064, where humans have technologically advanced far enough that they now have access to gene therapy which with the help of doctors and clinics can allow them to modify themselves with other species allowing them to become 'hybrids'. This raises moral and ethical dilemmas in the community, where people have risen against and have started protesting this new technology.\n\nYou start the game as a starving journalist in a 1 room apartment, from there you meet a cute little robot named Turing. Turing was created as a pet project by your best friend whom you've fallen out of touch with over the years. It turns out that Turing is the first sentient robot and he believes his master has been kidnapped because of him.\n\nYou go around investigating for your friend and at the same time are exposed to both sides of the hybrid morality war. You speak with the protesters and learn that they believe that the ramifications of playing God can lead to devastating consequences similar to that of the Atom Bomb which killed millions in seconds. They feel similar to the ideology Brotherhood of Steel from the popular fallout series. They believe that humanity's biggest enemy is humanity itself, lest they are allowed to play with technology that can be abused by individuals in high powers. But as you speak to other humans who have been saved by gene therapy or even just any sort of technological modifications, you wonder how far the protesters would go to stop people from saving themselves.\n\nThe Government has reformed mandates to deal with the rising numbers of hybrids in society. There is a limit to how much of a hybrid you can be, otherwise you are no longer allowed procreate. Therefore you must be more human than whatever species you have spliced your genes with to have normal human rights.\n\nAfter marathoning the entire Star Wars series I can't help but compare the two, with both having AI that are seemingly sentient. One of the most difficult things to do is to create a nonhuman character that doesn't only serve as a progressor to the plot. Especially when it comes to robots who need to have enough 'humanity' in them so that you can empathise with them but not so much so that you ever forget that they are indeed only a robot. Some of my favourite characters in video game history are AIs with unique personalities that serve as companions and not just tools to progress the plot in a deus ex machina type way.\n\nROM has Turing, which is clearly named after the Turing test used on AI to test whether can be classified as human. Turing seems to be on the cusp of this parameter, where he was programmed to learn from his surroundings and not just rely on his original programming to respond to situations. His programming is constantly evolving where the original programming is all but overwritten at this point by his own learning.\n\nThe interface of Read Only Memories stands out compared to most point and click games I've played. It's beautiful, smooth, slick and most of all very intuitive for the genre. Read Only Memories typically has 5-7 highlightable objects per area with huge bright outlines on the items This is to the players benefits as you're never searching for too long and you never feel bogged down by puzzles which can be a problem in quite a few point and click games.\n\nYou can interact with these highlightable objects in multiple ways with no repeating dialogue. You can usually get 3 unique responses for each option before the game's dialogue is exhausted, so if you want to talk to a table 3 times, you can, and it won't be a generic 'you cannot talk to this object'.\n\nOne of the highlights of the games are the SFX and music to go along with this beautifully constructed world, which has been meticulously crafted by DJ Mello known for his hip hop remixes with videogame OSTs. The music never feels overbearing or drowns out the environment the game is trying to convey to you but brings out the characters you're talking to usually each with their own short theme song.\n\nAs a whole I would say Read Only Memories is a unique entry into the Sci Fi genre and is a fine addition with it's vibrant environments and slick interface. It makes the Point and Click genre feel very accessible with animated faces and never bogging you down with tedious puzzles. It just delivers the story which deals with similar themes to the ones we have faced constantly in society only to show us that this too, will pass. But also that humans will always be resistant to change and presents us with the age old question, at what point are we playing God? Does it even matter?","January 28","true","6.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Dystopian futures, androids, body augmentation, VR….man, that’s the stuff of my dreams. Needless to say when Erik recommended Read Only Memories, a game by MidBoss, featuring all of the above and more, I absolutely could not resist dropping the $15 on it and I was not disappointed. Read Only Memories was worth every penny, but it also wasn’t everything that it could have been. It’s wonderful when a movie or game is everything we expect, but in this case, I can’t help but wish it had surprised me more instead of choosing to play it safe. Regardless of this, Read Only Memories is a great game and has a lot to offer.\n\nAudio/Visual\nUpon first booting up the game, you are inundated with gorgeous and nostalgic inducing 16-bit style graphics. This aesthetic may not be for everyone, but for those that like it, it’s well executed and brings a lot of charm to the experience. The low fidelity nature of the visuals can make the interface clunky at times as it’s not always easy to make out what you’re looking at (especially for really small things) but those instances are infrequent and are easily resolved by choosing “look” to get a brief description of the object. All-in-all the visuals are stylish and really bring a lot of personality to the game.\n\nThis nostalgic visual style is complemented with a tight 80’s synth inspired soundtrack by 2 Mello that provides an atmospheric backdrop to the locations and a sense of personality to the characters you meet during your journey. The music rarely feels like a bad fit however at times it is more understated than I would have liked, as the overall vibe is very mellow throughout. One funny note though, I found that some of the tracks would not have sounded out-of-place in a classic Sonic game, if sped up (check out track 16 – Troublemaker to see what I mean). Like the visuals, the soundtrack will likely be enjoyed by most of the intended audience of this game but it might not hit the mark for gamers who’re looking for the next Undertale soundtrack as it lacks the same energy and catchy pop music sensibilities, offering up a more ambient vibe instead. That being said, it makes for great background/work music.\n\n\n\nStory\nRead Only Memories is a visual novel with point & click adventure elements. As such, heavy emphasis is placed on the narrative and the characters. There are the rare puzzles to solve and divergent plot lines but for the most part the game is very linear in nature. Some may take issue with this as it reduces the replayability of it but I think in this case it wasn’t a matter of lazy design but rather to give the developers the most control over the exact experience they wanted you to have. There is a particular set of themes, questions, and decisions that it’s clear MidBoss wanted you to think about and to that end, it is successful. To it’s own detriment though, it makes for story that can (at times) be too predictable...\n\n\nTo read the rest of the review, see: http://www.nerdfit.com/2016/04/15/read-only-memories-review/","April 19","true","16.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The story is pretty compelling, the world is very cool and I wish I could play another game set in it because really my only problem with this game is that it's a bit short. Ultimately I was in it more for the dialogue and story than the actual gameplay, but there's rather a lot of dialogue so that was fine.\n\nWhat I will say in favor of the gameplay was that it wasn't too difficult. The game is good about directing you to the right location -- you're never really expected to read its mind as to where you need to be, and at that point, if you aren't sure what to do, you can just do everything until you get it and it'll only take you a minute.\n\nYou get the sense that this game was written by someone who's very sensitive to LGBT issues, and that's nice. You'll encounter plenty of characters who fit that mold, which I appreciate, and even deal a bit with non-binary pronouns, which while not an issue I'm terribly interested in, was kind of different.","April 9","true","5.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While there's really nothing wrong with it per se, the fact that it was designed by an SJW-type is really, really obvious. I'm not against having minorities or female or gay/trans characters in a game, but when I see a game where every character is one or more of those things (and usually have two or three dialog boxes talking about the fact that they're a minority/female/trans/gay/furry who doesn't want to be judged by "cis-sexists") it really breaks immersion quickly. The writers quite clearly took the Bioware route of approaching minorities (ie; having them announce whatever it is that makes them a minority constantly) instead of taking the Obsidian approach (where characters will only mention these things if you specifically ask them about it and will usually only say it once because they understand that you've gotten the point).\n\nI wound up refunding after about half an hour played because I just couldn't get into it with all of the PC stuff being thrown about. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have noticed or cared about the first real scene in the game being going into a nightclub that is populated entirely by minorities, but then the game has to go announcing stuff and it bugged me so bad that I didn't feel like continuing.","December 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","1"

This game has heart. Reeeaal heart.\n\nThe only criticisms I can see are that the game is just SJW propaganda. Apparently it's wrong to write a couple of LGBT characters for a game, idk. The game doesn't force any political positions on the player, it just exposes them to the fact that there are people in this world who don't follow norms. After spending an hour with the game, you'll just start to accept everybody and move on.\n\nThis game is a great little story-driven adventure along the lines of Phoenix Wright or a traditional point and click. The gameplay isn't what shines here, but it seems to hit the perfect balance between being completely linear and being interactive. The music and art are both great, and the writing will consistently make you laugh. It also has some real emotions, too. Turing is a particularly interesting character, and I found myself really interested to hear whatever he had to say, even if it had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nIt has its fair share of flaws, but it doesn't ever get 'bad.'

The character this game oozes is WONDERFUL. The music, the pixel-art, the writing, the interconnected world, even timing in certain parts of the text scrolling all add to this experience. Every line of dialouge you are able to read helps flesh out the game's world, and helps you to better understand the incredbily realistic and fantastic characters in this world. If you want some good modernist asimov-esque science-fiction reading with characters who aren't played out, here's your cue, go buy this game immediately. The Dialouge is masterfully written and executed, the plot is excellent. Even the music's minimalistic looping tracks and the minimal use of voice acting add to the game's aesthetics.\n\nNow, the morally dubious 'bad guy' characters are all pretty mary-sue (though very useful, realistic and appropriate mary-sues) but if you get over that, and you're not a stickler for use of negative possibility space or outstanding use of leudonarrative mechanics, this game is a fantastic point and click adventure and an absolutely brilliant story.\n\nHowever, if I was to have one gripe with the game, it is the the game's many elements of play. The puzzles and interactive dialouge system. Most of the time game mechanics line up poorly with the story. Hacking does not feel like hacking; It feels like you yourself are running the program rather than writing the program. There are exceptions to this rule, a few of the puzzles are exactly as difficult as they should be and are very satisfying. Most puzzles are not justified by the narrative, when you have a master hacker and suped up AI ROM with you that could accomplish these tasks easily. There are side characters who could feasibly be persuaded into helping you whom you cannot talk to. You cannot decide to join the antagonists, or the Human Revolution, which I imagine several players would love to do. The puzzles are not paced to be more difficult or complex the farther into the game you get, but rather the hardest puzzles are placed near the end instead, with empty space between them filled by much easier ones (although no puzzle is hard enough to require more than 2 tries at it). Failure states exist where none should, and some puzzles exist only as inconviences which can lead to failure states.\n\nThis game is not perfect, in it is fact far from it. But it does have a lot of heart, a number of fantastic ideas for how to make an interactive narrative compelling, and the interactive narrative is despite its built-in limitations, one of the best cyberpunk stories I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, if not THE best. The story, the dialouge, the world and the game's use of meaningful choice and consequence are so good that I am able to, even including every flaw I noticed as a game designer, give it a glowing 8.9/10.\n\nI can't wait for what comes next.","December 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The art is gorgeous, especially the character art. Whether it's the lanky, butch Lexi or our character's tiny round robotic companion, Turing, the characters all have a unique feel to them. Even the background characters were really cool to look at. The music was also lovely, reminiscent of the old school point and click adventures. It hit just enough nostalgia points for me, and I honestly really enjoy most of the scores. I found myself pausing a lot on the menu screen especially, just to listen to the songs.\n\nStorywise, I thought the game was pretty good. The protagonist is a journalist who finds himself being approached by a ROM named Turing who is searching for his creator - and your old friend - Hayden. Sometimes the choices in the game felt a little unrealistic, but the protagonist is a journalist, so them being willing to do things risky and dangerous did make more sense. Generally speaking, however, I enjoyed the story. The characters are really charming, and you care about their struggles. There's a lot of humor, but there's also quite a bit of darkness, and the emotional moments of the story hit hard. One thing I really enjoyed - the game's twists make sense, but they aren't predictable and I found myself frequently second guessing my plot predictions. As someone who hates really obvious plotlines, I really enjoyed this. It was definitely a fun little journey, especially for someone interested in artificial intelligence and cyberpunk detective stories.\n\nAs far as the puzzles, they are mostly clear and logical. There were a few that didn't make sense to me, and some that required digging into the background because the items you needed weren't obvious. Occasionally, I found myself resorting to the age-old strategy of "use every item with everything", but I found that happened less often than using actual logic to solve the problems. In general, there wasn't a whole lot to complain about.\n\nThe one major complaint I had was the heavy handed moralizations the game tried to dole out from time to time. The most obvious of this is with the character Jess, who seems to hate the protagonist no matter what they do, and never really changes. I don't necessarily have a problem with characters disliking the player, but the game gives no reason for this hatred. Jess seems to be there to show the evils of discrimination - she is a genetically modified human 'hybrid' that is supposedly reviled in society...except the game never shows this. The only people who hate hybrids are a group of extremists known as the Human Revolution, who are basically seen as a joke by everyone, no one seems to support their opinions. At any rate - all of this wouldn't irk me so much if Jess was a one time character, but she actually makes many appearances in the game, all of which are about as baffling as the first encounter.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the characters are quite interesting. All of the main characters had something unique about them, both physically and in their personalities. I'm so used to games with anime styles have characters that all look the same, so I was really impressed by this. There is a lot of diversity in the cast and most of it - Jess aside - is done in a way that makes it seem natural. The game also includes some very frank discussions on gender fluidity that I thought were really refreshing. Even though the game can come off as strong sometimes, there are many beautiful moments of subtlety that make the game great.\n\nOverall, I would say ROM is worth playing, if you enjoy point and click adventures and cool stories about robots. For the price of the game, you're getting an excellent little adventure that will keep you occupied for quite some time.","January 16","true","10.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I’d never heard of it before, but boy howdy am I an absolute sucker for pixel games, point-and-clicks, and colorful palette choices. And I have to say if this game doesn’t deserve to be on someone’s GOTY list, then it at the very least deserves an extravagant honorable mention. It’s a really good game!\n\nThis is definitely a story where I know the people involved know their stuff about technology and politics. Its cute art really doesn’t prepare you for its rather darker (but remarkably fleshed out) contents. I won’t get into details, but when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan you will probably be as surprised as I was. Every time. Multiple times. Where it really builds atmosphere is in the soundtrack. It has amazing chiptune and other electronic music featured in the game.\n\nIt also features a varied cast of LGBT characters, and while some Steam reviews might complain, it frankly feels natural considering the setting. (Which, honestly, if you think this game is somehow "overrepresented" then maybe this game isn't for you.) The game asks you not what your gender is, but merely your pronouns (some are available as presents, but you can manually enter whatever you want.) It also has a few pop culture references that anyone can appreciate.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it’s really relaxing, honestly. There’s a few puzzles to solve (that are all easy, even for someone like me who could and has got lost in a Freddi Fish game), 2 mini-games (which are essentially the same), and ONE single combat section which is pretty generous with time (you can actually practice it using an arcade game in the nightclub early on). The game itself is vastly story-focused so honestly its a comfy game that anyone could enjoy. The pixel font might be tough to read for anyone with dyslexia, though.\n\nAll in all I would rate this game a 7.5/10.","January 25","true","7.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Copyright laws infringe on the rights of person hood for genetic hybrids and neo luddites view cybernetics as diluting the purity of humanity. The style of gonzo journalism is directly referenced in the game and is clearly part of the overall narrative. This game isn't going to dance around issues and ask you how you feel about them; the characters have strong well formed opinions informed by their own lives and will candidly let you know about them.\n\nThe game is a fantastic take on the point and click adventure in a style similiar to Snatcher but this game has largely sloughed off any semblance of "pixel hunting" or "rub all of your inventory on a thing until the puzzle is solved." Most of the puzzles occur as part of conversations or as fairly straightforward decisions on how to solve problems. There is still plenty of exploration and you can certainly use your SPOILED MILK on everything to get humorous and entertaining responses but it is hardly necessary.\n\nLots and lots of world building, extremely well written, straight social commentary on current events through the metaphorical lens of this colourful cyberpunk future. If any of this sounded good than you'd probably be into this game.","January 30","true","12.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I also really appreciated the way the game progressively handles subjects of diversity, human rights, privilege, and inclusion. The sci-fi questions about genetic manipulation, cybernetics and artificial intelligence were also interesting.\n\nWith multiple endings, loads of optional interactions, and a great attention to detail, it's evident that a lot of care and passion went into the creation of this game.

A rapidly unfolding story of intrigue increases in complexity, wit, and surprising darkness as you proceed through a world more sharply realized than a lot of modern science fiction in that it actually concerns itself with social progress through a modern lens. It's a brisk and thoughtful point and click adventure with some awkwardly-mounted shooting elements and puzzles but nothing to distract you from the true meat of the game, which is navigating social cues with empathy for a world very different than your own.\n\nWhile the game didn't seem to give much regard to the choices I was making throughout at first, which made it feel a bit shallow beneath the texture of its wonderful cast, the game really is quietly judging you in the background for how you interact with people. As a result, you'll discover one of six different endings depending on how you get on with the citizens of Neo San Francisco, building an army of the people or alone and abandoned to your own arrogance and cruelty.\n\nGreat game. 8/10.","January 28","true","6.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/recommended/330820/","nekobun","nekobun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/","1568 products in account","Read Only Memories is simultaneously a return to point-and-click adventure glory and a step forward on several fronts. Even in presenting a better future where the gender binary's been chucked out the window and many current equality issues have been resolved, some things never change. Read Only Memories presents an apt metaphor for how difficult it can be for humanity to adapt to social change.\n\nThat's really the key thing to remember going into Read Only Memories: metaphor. Are the rights and experiences surrounding genetic hybridization, machine sentience, and cybernetic implants the most apt analogues for issues such as gender transition, body dysphoria, and non-cis/het rights battles? Not entirely. However, the struggles presented in Read Only Memories do present something of a "beginner's guide" look at such issues. Grasping those aspects of identity when you have literally no concept of them can be incredibly difficult, so easing players into that world with a more ubiquitous science fiction context was a good call. Does Read Only Memories succeed in that metaphor? Not entirely, but major points for even trying.\n\nSocial issues aside, Read Only Memories is a great game in and of itself. The pixelated presentation is beautiful and consistent, and I loved the peppy, fluid soundtrack. If you can afford the extra expenditure, I highly recommend picking that up as well. The noir undertones of the plot are woven surprisingly well into the bright, colorful version of Neo San Francisco you wander, which makes the looming shades of dystopia that much more impactful when you stumble across them. The characters are all rather memorable, though a few feel criminally underutilized. I expected more from Lexi, in particular, but for the most part she just feels like a nagging conscience, forever whispering about a past you never quite get to explore. I'd also love to learn more about Sympathy, and what made her such a hard-♥♥♥ in the first place.\n\nThe hybrid and cybernetics rights issues also took a back seat to the core plot, which I feel was a missed opportunity. I'm especially interested in the former, as the cyber side at least tied into the issue of ROMs a bit. Even some tucked-away, extra reading or collectable content would've been nice to look over to learn how genetic manipulation even began taking hold, and why. Midboss has expressed interest in doing more with the world of Read Only Memories, so we may see something to that effect down the line, but again, seems like a bit of a missed opportunity.\n\nAnd, as a quick aside, I really loved the whole Drinktionary thing, and the variety of drinks presented was both extensive and super-cute. I'm hoping this makes a return in future Midboss games, perhaps with more of a gameplay factor than just passing out after too many. Levels of tipsiness? Interactions changing (for better or for worse) under the influence? There's plenty there to work with, and if nothing else, I just want to see more of Majid and Gus.\n\nIn summary, Read Only Memories is a great first foray into what hopefully turns into a wider run of games. It's incredibly charming, and even with a few pitfalls, provides a nice change of pace and a memorable tale. Looking forward to the Endless Xmas DLC, even if it's coming a bit late to be entirely seasonal.","January 13","true","12.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

ROM's a game with a specific audience in mind.  From a telescope one might make the assumption that it's shooting broadly for the folks that enjoyed Snatcher, but I really think it's aiming for a different crowd.\n\nHowever, there are people I would recommend this game to.  I simply wouldn't recommend it to me.  At the end of the day, I felt that I was being introduced to labels as much as characters and it came off as a touch too preachy.

Compared to similar titles, this one isn't as dark, neon or noir - actually, you could say it is a universe on the brink of becoming the dark and dystopian nightmare futures Blade Runner and Co. are representing. So, if you want the hardcore stuff, ROM might not be the best fit. I did, however, find it interesting to explore a scenario where things can still be fixed and/or averted, that isn't too common as far as I am aware.\n\nThe premise of the whole thing is a crime-mystery that you and your robot sidekick want to solve. The plot might be a little convoluted, as there are many tangents and way too many deadends before a bunch of events really get things moving story-wise but considering this game is heavily inspired by the works of Kojima, I guess this can be excused. At least, nice pixelart and excellent music help in getting over some of the more uneventful parts of the story, especially in the beginning. I wouldn't call them filler per se, but pacing is an issue. For the most part you aren't doing much more than advancing the story by clicking text, simple give X to character actions and dialogue-trees. There are four instances in which you actually get to do stuff, and those threw me off so completely that I failed three of them - one of them actually leading to my death.\n\nHowever, my main issue with the game lies elsewhere - I do think it tries too hard. You have your murder-case, and that's dandy - but there is a ton of references and pandering to various groups and fandoms that really dillute the main story. You have this diverse and super-inclusive cast too, that more or less is in there to lecture you about gender-this and inclusivity-that. Which makes it doubly confusing when bearded, rocker-looking dudes getting refered to as she or some people are spoken of in plural. It took me half the game to understand those aren't typos.\n\nAnd before I even got to know some of them "in person" (Yo, Miss Kitten, looking at you!) they filled my screen with text that looked an awful lot like typical facebook-postings of people who talk about all that gender-stuff nonstop. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really give you much options to express yourself in the matter - it makes quite clear which mindset the makers find acceptable and which is not. If you play along, that is fine - but if you enjoy snark and black humour, this game is basically putting up the big ole "NO FUN ALLOWED" sign through dialogue whenever you try those options. And then lectures you about how you are being a jerk. It usually ends with your robot sidekick ignoring YOUR decisions and getting on with the game. On a few occasions this made me just go: "Little robot guy, if you don't like what I am saying - you might as well ♥♥♥♥ off and do your thing and I get back to writing headphone-reviews."\n\nFinally, the game misses the chance to explore both ends of the spectrum of the topics it brings up. A bunch of points that I would find worth exploring - particularly when it comes to the hybrids and genetic-modifcation - are explained in a rather one-sided way, maybe something worthy for a sequel. Rise of the Hybrids could be interesting.\n\nLuckily, in the final chapters of the game all that stuff doesn't matter too much anymore - because you have some real problems to solve and time is running out. And I gotta say, the finale was quite good - eventhough I wasn't that invested in the characters that it really had much of an impact on me, in fact - it pretty much played out the way I imagined it would - but it was well done, no denying that. All in all, ROM is the closest thing we have to Snatcher on Steam right now and unless KONAMI or Kojima decide to bring computer people that cyberpunk-gem, ROM is sufficient for that quick cyberpunk-adventure fix.","November 1, 2015","true","7.9"," 71 of 146 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","71","146","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AuraTH/recommended/330820/","AuraTH","[C*G*C] Aura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AuraTH/","80 products in account","tl;dr -\nThis game is going to forever be one of my favorites. It itself is fantastic, but its underlying message is what truly makes it good. 2064/10. As Turing says, "There is no time like the Present". So why wait for the future to buy this game, when you can buy it NOW?\n\n\nThis is probably one of the best games I have ever played, and will ever play in my entire life. It's hard to explain exactly why, but I think I can break it down.\n\nRead Only Memories has many great things about it, like its Soundtrack, its Art/Sprites, its Colorful Cast of Characters, etc.\nBut the most important thing about this game is it's Story, which it very well should be considering its a Point-N-Click. The story revolves around the disappearnace of one of your friends, and you assisting his robot, Turing, to find him. Interestingly, Turing is Sapient, meaning they think like a human.\n\nI'm going to stop right here about the game itself, because the game itself isn't exactly why its so great. I mean, sure, the game is funny, heart-warming, sad, and intense, along with other things, and it will make you feel very mixed emotions about the short 5 Hour-Ish story. (That being said, there are multiple endings. As of writing this review, I have only completed the game once.)\n\nThe important thing about this game however, is its MEANING. Y'know how in High School and College English classes you have to "Analyze the Book" for it's "Theme and Meaning" or whatever? This game's "Theme and Meaning" is what makes it special and so important for people to play.\n\nThe most basic way I can say this, is that playing this game will make you think about societal issues, Future, Past, and Present. The game itself has 2 Issues prominently featured in it. Those 2 issues are Human Augmentation (Whether with Genetics or Cybernetic Implants) and Sentient/Sapient Artificial Intelligence. As the future closes in on Humanity, it will eventually become a real, non-fiction, debated issue. And when you see issues like this in a game, you think about real life, and what issues there are now. What is humanity limiting themselves from doing because it's too dangerous (like Sapient Robots), and what are we discriminating against for no reason at all (Like the Cyborgs and the Hybrids).\n\nIt's incredibly difficult to put how this game makes someone feel into words, so instead, I'm just going to tell you to buy it. It's $15, its not really that expensive. If you even wanted to, you could wait for a sale, because it's steam and there are always sales eventually.\n\n","January 5","true","6.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Snatcher is one of my favorite games of all time, and Read Only Memories is without a doubt the closest thing I've ever played to a true successor. It uses its cyberpunk setting well and crafts together a really interesting story. The artwork is fantastic and really captures the essence of the era. It's got great music, unique characters, and a plot that will keep you guessing the whole time.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty straightforward, but there are 6 different endings for you to find, so there is definitely some room for player choice. In traditional adventure game fashion, you can interatct with all sorts of different objects, and if you're like me, you'll easily spend a ton of time laughing at all of the amusing dialogue that comes about from trying to give spoiled milk to people and talk to desks. What trumps even that for me though are the deep characters and overall atmosphere that the game conveys. It really captures the essence of cyberpunk and it couldn't make me happier.\n\nA lot of people are giving this game bad reviews because of the social message that it conveys. It's true that the game goes out of its way to be pro LGBT and call out discrimination, but I personally didn't feel like that got in the way of the game too much. Considering the game takes place decades in the future, it's not too unrealistic that society would be a lot more accepting of these social taboos. The topic may be a bit too heavy for some, but I think it aligns with the setting of the game just fine.\n\nBest of all, Read Only Memories knows how to do demos the right way. Not only is there a free version that lets you play the prologue, but it even lets you play most of chapter 1 as well! And better yet, your save data from the demo carries over to the full game. So if you're at all curious, give it a try. If you're like me, you won't be able to stop there!\n\nOverall, Read Only Memories was one of the best games I played all year. It's a true love letter to not only Snatcher, but classic adventure games and the cyberpunk genre in general. I don't want to get too caught up on the comparison, but since we'll likely never see a real Snatcher sequel, this is by far the next best thing. I couldn't recommend this game more.

It is one of the few that I have stayed to finish until the end, and I was not disapppointed. This game brings out everything to love about a point and click with none of the downsides. Fun little secrets, and no frustrating, nonsensicle puzzles. The characters, both in art and in personality, are quite spunky and idiosyntric, giving the game the perfect futuristic vibe that I, personally, have always had a fondness for. That being said, if you're looking for a game with puzzles you have to sit and think about for a while, or something a little more action-heavy, then this is not the game for you. The puzzles aren't very difficult, just difficult enough to make you feel witty when you solve them a certain way. And you don't come up against a lot of action unless you chose to (I still have yet to explore that arc, though). The game contains a lot of dialogue, so don't play it if you aren't going to read it.\n\n\nJust play the demo.\n\n\nIt's lengthy enough to give you a good taste of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/330820/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","IntroductionWhile I’m not normally a huge fan of point-and-click adventures something in Read Only Memories drew my attention. It might have been the graphics, or the fact that I’m familiar with some of the voice actors, but it could just as well have been the story. Or maybe just a combination of all of these things. So: is Read Only Memories the game that has finally managed to win me over? Will I start playing more adventure games from now on? Let’s head over to the next paragraph!\n\nGameplayThe game starts off with you hanging around in your own apartment. While you are tired and want to go to sleep you suddenly remember that you first have to write a review for some kind of new headset. After all, you still have to pay for the rent and you hope that this will be your big break, to finally make it as a journalist. After having written the review you decide that it’s finally time to go to bed. Suddenly, however, while you’re asleep, a robot silently enters your apartment. Upon waking up you are confused, a bit scared even. What does this robot want, what is it doing here? After a lengthy conversation it seems a friend of yours – who is also the robot’s creator – was being chased that very same night, by something or someone, and has suddenly vanished. Was he taken, did he run off, or..? What happened? That is the big question you keep asking yourself. Ultimately you decide to accompany this robot named Turing and try to find out what exactly has happened.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534271613\nI just described to you the first 15 minutes of the game or so: it was more than enough to pull me in.\nAll the aforementioned factors were a part of this. The writing is excellent and witty, the music and voice acting are superb and the gameplay… well, the gameplay is pretty much the same as many other point-and-click adventures out there, but it’s absolutely solid. It’s a well-oiled machine, with every little part of it functioning as it should. You can clearly see the passion that was put into this little gem from miles away. Simply brilliant.\n\nWith the risk of possibly spoiling the game I’m not going to dig any further into the story, though. You will just have to experience this for yourself. I can tell you that it keeps you interested and intrigued all the way through its six playable chapters, although it tends to drag for a very short while about 3/4th into the game and the ending also felt a bit rushed to me.\n\nI’ve already mentioned that the gameplay is exactly what you would expect from a point-of-click adventure. If you’ve ever played a point-and-click adventure in your life (and let’s be honest; who hasn’t?) then you know exactly how things work here. You point your mouse (objects you can interact with will then be highlighted) and click.\nClick on an object and the game will open a context menu that gives you the option to push/touch, look/read, talk to someone or use an item. Other games sometimes have the habit of putting actions or objects in annoying - extra - little submenus, but not here, though. And while Read Only Memories doesn’t do things wildly different; it all works effortlessly, without hindering me as a player or giving me the feeling that it’s interfering with my progress.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534271696\nThe puzzles themselves aren’t the most difficult puzzles I’ve ever laid eyes on. They’re more of the casual, anyone-can-solve-this-with-a-little-brain-activity sort of puzzles. They’re relatively easy to solve and the solutions can always be found in the same area or level. For me personally it’s ideal because I hate having to solve frustratingly hard puzzles while also trying to understand/follow a story (I easily lose track of the less important things), but I do wish there were more of them. In total I think there are 5 or less actual puzzles, and with its casual nature I personally think there should’ve been more. They’re just too easy to solve to really feel like (complex) puzzles. On the other hand, the puzzles blend in seamlessly with the story and this results in them not feeling forced or tacked on.\n\nAudio & VisualsThere’s not a whole lot to tell about the audio that I haven’t already mentioned before. The voice acting is amazing; everything is wonderfully and professionally narrated. But unfortunately it’s limited to only the intro and outro, and that amounts to roughly 5-10 minutes in total. So it’s just a small part of the game.\nThe music itself is similar to the games you used to play back when you were young, so there’s a lot of electronic music, but also sound effects. If you’ve ever played Mega Man then you should have a general idea of what it will sound like if you play it. At least, that is how I experienced it.\n\nI can be really short about the graphics, too (but I really don’t want to). The graphics use a retro style and are shown in pixelated 2D. The colors are used well, there’s a very cool atmosphere and everything is nicely animated. It all gives off a very polished feel.\nA lot of detail has gone into the graphics; from the character portraits during conversations to the environments: they did a tremendous job creating all of the art.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534629836\nLength/Replay ValueSince this is an adventure it’s highly likely that you will play it just once. I personally don’t mind, though, as long as it’s a fun experience, which it is. In total it will take you anywhere between 7-10 hours to complete, depending on how easily you can solve the puzzles the game throws at you and how much you explore. There are six chapters in total and each one will take anywhere between 30-90 minutes to complete.\n\nConclusionEven though I normally don’t play a lot of point-and-click adventures I am really glad that I gave Read Only Memories a try. It has become a to-the-point adventure, with a lot – if not all - of the fat trimmed off that you normally find in many other point-and-click adventures (please note: I am mostly talking about the puzzles here). It managed to keep me entertained and intrigued all the way through, despite its somewhat rushed and convoluted ending.\nAnyway, for a little over €1 per hour you get an excellent story-focused adventure and that’s not a bad deal at all in my opinion.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Magnificent – but limited - voice acting\n+ Beautiful retro graphics and music\n+ Solid point-and-click adventure gameplay\n+ Intriguing and focused story that pulls you in and manages to keep you interested all the way through (well, mostly)\n\nMixed:\n+/- Too few puzzles and they’re also too easy to solve, but on the other hand: it does keep the story going and they seamlessly blend in as well\n\nCons:\n- Drags just a little around 3/4th into the game\n- Maybe a tad too short\n- Ending feels a little rushed and convoluted\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 8.1 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

Beginning the game as a starving journalist, you are inevitably thrust upon a huge investigation which includes many dialogue choices, puzzles, and a few mini games here and about.  At its core, the mechanics don't bring many new additions to this type of game, but hold up, it gets a lot of it right.\n\nDon't let the faux retro graphics make you think it's a pull at your nostalgia, all of the environments, characters, and even the menus ooze with a techy, 80s like cyberpunk style which breathes a lot of life and character into the game.  The soundtrack (I recommend purchasing it!) and audio fit the theme of the game greatly.  You control the game with a mouse and keyboard or you can opt for a controller (Xbox 360 controller works great with no configuration).  The biggest plus of this game is its story.  There are a group of varied and genuinely interesting cast of characters that really helps pull the story along.  The writing is quite fantastic.  ROM illustrates a believable near future with funny dialogue that'll elicit a sensible chuckle and smart writing that keeps you gripped for the length of the game.\n\nRead Only Memories is a solid tech noir point and click that has great accessibility to anyone who wants an enjoyable story, memorable characters, and thought provoking themes that the game explores well.","November 3, 2015","true","20.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Much can’t be said about Read Only Memories (ROM) that won’t contribute to revealing spoilers. Reason why is because ROM is a strong, decision-based narrative game -- or more popularly known in Japan as a visual novel game.\n\nYou, the player, take the role of a starving journalist; a popular cliche used by many medias, who, after an exhausting attempt to rid oneself from poverty with a one-of-a-kind review, gets an abrupt visit from a Sapient Machine named Turing. Probably paying respects to Alan Turing, probably not. An atrocious crime has occurred and your new found partner wants you to utilize your snooping skills as a journalist to solve the case. Like I’ve said, I can’t go anymore in depth than that without revealing spoilers.\n\nThe game itself is heavy in narrative text, so expect a lot of reading. However, if you’re intrigued or have any moderate interest in technology, the idea of gene modification and hacking, then it shouldn’t be a tedious task but enjoyable and absorbing. The writing itself is sophisticated yet strangely comprehensible and tells a fascinating story of conspiracy, technological indifferences and an ideology between what is human and what is machine. Despite first appearances, bystanders may assume this game was a reproduction game for the NES, as it certainly has graphics to vouch for it, but it has a sweet ironic taste; it delivers a nostalgic element to older gamers who’ve played such games in the past while touching on newer elements.\n\nRead Only Memories is very captivating. It does this with both its exceptional decision-making and story dialogue while having a great cast of characters. Not only that, but it shows its diversity by paying respects to the LGBT community.

The game is played like most classic point and click adventure games, with an emphasis on choices (both dialogue and in terms of actions taken) having impact on the relationships and eventual ending you can get.\n\nWriting and aesthetics are the two strongest parts of ROM; the art is crisp and very colorful, and really takes the 'dinge' out of the usual cyberpunk games that focus on dreary, dark futures--ROM instead uses somewhat colorful pallettes of neon tones and primary colors to build character and personalty; individual characters have their own color schemes, and they reflect their personality.  The music is excellent too, on a somewhat natural level (it reminds me of the best tracks of games like Phoenix Wright, which really draw you in to the game through the aural atompshere).\n\nAs for the writing, all of the characters are distinct, and each choice you make has weight, meaning that the way you choose to have your character speak draws specific outcomes, and allows for you to act however you feel your character would; the game is even considerate enough to include options to select preferred pronouns (even custom), and (as what seemed like a joke), your dining habits, to help you flesh out your character.  I found this to be really engaging, because point and click games rarely care about the "character" of the PC--you're generally just a pointer that talks, but ROM really made it feel like I had created a character with existing relationships and preferences that I could work into my choices, instead of just hammering "Good" "Evil" or "Neutral" options.\n\nIf you're a fan of point and click mysteries, cyberpunk works, or even visual novels you may enjoy ROM; it really works to build an organic world that you get to interact with, and doesn't spend copious amounts of time on pseudo-science, instead using the setting to tell a great story, rather than use a setting to simply drop world-building dialogue and techno-babble.","October 10, 2015","true","8.3"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","10","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/330820/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Going into Read Only Memories, I expected the average adventure game trappings that have stuck to the genre over the years. A lot of people have been suggesting that Read Only Memories is the spiritual successor to the SEGA Saturn title Snatcher, that was written and directed by Hideo Kojima back in 1988. Even on the game’s Steam page they say that it was inspired by games like Snatcher. I have never played Snatcher though, in fact I have never been exposed to Snatcher at all despite some interest that I have had in the game. I believe a lot of people are in this same position as well, as the title was on a Saturn and now easily sells for over $300 on sites like ebay, making it not exactly accessible. Due to my inexperience, I was ready for those puzzles that glue you to the ground and laugh while you look for the incredibly specific solution. I assumed that it would be the type of game that I play for a while and come back to, only to still be stuck at the same puzzle I was at before.\n\nSo I had a surprising realization about halfway through that this game is an especially different experience from the average adventure game, with more of a focus on player-choice, character development and interaction, and mistakes. If I had to compare Read Only Memories to experiences that I have had in the adventure game genre, I would feel inclined to say that this game is incredibly similar to TellTale’s style of adventure more than anything else I have played. The puzzles are not very difficult, and instead the characters and dialogue choices are the most difficult parts of the game. The world is also well-realized and the game really dives into topics that are going on that could only occur in it’s existence. Comparisons aside, Read Only Memories does things that make it personal and unique from other games in the genre as well.\n\nThe developers have a set date and place in mind for the setting of the game: Neo-San Francisco 2064. Which is an interesting choice to make because instead of deciding that the year should go unnamed, something like 20XX, there may be a belief that the events that take place, and the technology that is standard will be feasible by this time in our reality. During this time, there is a conflict of beliefs between two groups of people over the integration of technology in the human biology. There are hybrids, people who utilize technological upgrades to bypass their human limitations, and then there is a movement called #stayhuman who believes that the augmentation of humanity is wrong, and that is corrupts the purity of being a human.\n\nToday we have conflicts that parallel this dispute, such as the acceptance of gay, queer and transgender identification, like there is an idea that someone’s choice may create an “adulterated” human race because it doesn’t align with their religion or their personal beliefs. Because of these conflicts, it honestly is not too difficult to think that approximately 40 years from now there will still be problems with accepting different and new changes in society and that it will still hurt people. The thought is incredibly disheartening, that someone in time is always going to be oppressed because they feel and think different than another human being.\n\nA lot of the game’s theme speaks about humanity, whether or not beings that are not humans can retain sapience, and what we really consider to be human-exclusive. For example, one of the struggles that I found in my robotic sidekick Turing was a conflict of greatness. Turing believes in the beginning of the game that he is top of the line and that there has not been anything as technologically advanced as him ever. As he progresses though, he finds that while he is special for some reasons, but there are also a lot of things about him that aren’t very special at all and I found that to be very human. That is just one of the many things that I interpreted from the game’s theme of humanity and sapience though.\n\nThe dialogue and writing in Read Only Memories are the strongest parts of the game. Along the adventure to find out where Turing’s creator, Hayden, went, there are a lot of varied characters that can change depending on which direction the story goes. There are some characters which are staples such as a hacker named TOMCAT who was friends with Hayden, but a lot of characters seem to have more to say in different paths. For instance, in my playthrough of the game there were two boys on a street that were spray painting a business’ wall with street art, and when I tried to stop them they attempted a getaway. I ended up succeeding in foiling their escape and as the game went on I purposefully made decisions to speak with them and befriend them. By the end of my time with the two characters I found out both of them were a lot more complex than what they originally had me believe.\n\nSometimes these different paths can go awry though. Similar to TellTale’s games, depending on certain paths you take people can live or die. During the period that I played the game I never had any really-close characters die from a choice that I made, but from the options and decisions that I had to made it is apparent that those alternate resolutions are possible. There are also some light puzzle elements that can change the outcome of a situation as well, but they are never too hard.\n\nWhile I like a lot of these characters, endings and different paths, the end of Read Only Memories really cuts off a lot of the options that made it so personal in the first place. The last part of the game has parts that are basically labeled as your decisions before the final chapter which would lead a person to believe that the decisions they have to make are going to make huge impacts on the last part of the game. This is not true though, instead, the results from actions that were taken earlier in the game occur and funnel you down a corridor of the choices you have made. I think this would work a lot better if it conveyed that this was the situation I was going into.\n\nThere are also a lot of static pieces of writing in the game that are just plain hilarious as well. One of the things that I really like about the game is how much there is to read depending on what you interact with. I am a huge explorer when it comes to games so I would try to click on every object in the room before I went on to the next one, and I was originally just happy to see that each of the objects had their own written pieces. Then I found out that most objects that are carried in the inventory in the game can interact with almost every object in the game, even if they do not do anything when interacting with each other, and they all have their own writing as well.\n\nRead Only Memories has patched itself through and into my brain unlike a lot of other games this year. There are a lot of thought provoking ideas about topics that have made me think differently about things that I interact with daily like technology, xenophobia, humanity and time. The story and characters are written so well that when I think about the other endings I may have missed I want to go back and play again so I can see what else happens.The gameplay elements of the game are never too difficult, which I think may make some of the game a bit monotonous for those who do not like to read too much during a game. The rest of the elements such as player choice, themes and story are the real pull though and if those sound appealing then this isn’t a game to miss.","November 3, 2015","true","17.2"," 32 of 74 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","32","74","0","0"

The story has some interesting parts but it's never really all that funny, at worst it gets weird with how it feels like you are reading a wikipedia article about a type of shrubbery without any seeming relation to the story. The story is very inclusive, including a lot of things that are still foreign to me such as people picking their preferable pronouns. Not that I have a problem with it, but it feels like the game is just as much about being a positive example in the inclusion of a large variety of characters than it is about telling it's own story. Almost everyone is willing to or downright overbearing in wanting to tell you their life's story, and if they aren't interested in telling you they'll give it to you in a mandatory way later.\n\nThe game is pretty, although I think some of the portraits looked kinda similar. The developers have deliberately chosen a VERY "low" res look, with what appears to be 5x size pixels. I get that they are trying to make it look like Snatcher on the Mega CD, but it almost gets too much with the art style occasionally requiring more detail than what can be allowed.","December 28, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Usually I like a lot of dialogue if it's done like Clannad, but in ROM it felt like too much which didn't add to the story. Banter is great for immersion, but I ultimately had a hard time enjoying it. This was most likely because I played almost all of it in one sitting and explored a lot of the conversation options.\n\nI felt that most of the game was about meeting a person, then having to go see another one, and another one, and another one... then thinking you found the right person, but no... they tell you to go see another one. Most of the objectives were then about pleasing the characters to get some info out of them.\n\nThe characters in ROM are interesting, but I had wished you could have explored their depth a bit more. I felt like the relationships you made were really shallow for some reason...\n\nAll in all Read Only Memories is okay. It sure is a bit different, and I love the aesthetic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangaengel/recommended/330820/","mangaengel","MangaEngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangaengel/","22 products in account","I bought this upon a friends recommendation and have to say, it was worth every cent!\nRead Only Memories is a adorable pixel point-and-click adventure with a story that starts out simple enough and becomes both exciting and interesting very fast. If you enjoy games like Ghost Trick, Ace Attorney or the occassional madness of Monkey Island (though not taken to such extremes), then this is an excellent choice!\nHere my (spoiler-free) review:\n\nStory:\nYou live your life barely getting around as a journalist when a cute little bot suddenly appears, asking you to help find a old friend of yours. You agree and meet a lot of interesting people, see what San Fransisco looks like in 2064 and soon become tangled in a plot about self-aware AI, media manipulation and more. Hitting right at the core of todays issues, the world in ROM is believable, relateable and frightingly close to today, taking all of todays events to its logical conclusions and beyond.\n\nArt:\nThe game is in pixel-style graphic, yet provides quite smooth animations at times. The characters (except for some bots) are all unique and recognizable, the interface is simple and thus easy to navigate and - in stark contrast with a lot of click-and-point games - you rarely have to scan the screen for a teeny tiny object that helps you progress (and even if, all interactable objects get outlines and have a hit box big enough to notice them).\n\nSound:\nThe music is jazzy, with a tad of inspiration from Noire detective stories and possibly some inspiration from Ace Attorney music, too. The  beeping sounds from the conversations can be turned off, if found annoying, yet fit this game quite well. The little soundbits that indicate good choices, laughter or similar also keep the conversation sounds from becoming too monotonous.\n\nGameplay:\nA solid click-and-point game which does mostly depend on the player taking the right choices instead of random "Use Can on Christmas Tree to make Phone ring"-logic. While the player has to pick up objects, they rarely are very obscure and even rarer does the player have to use them with something beyond logic (unless finding amusement in the fact that the developers made a lot of interactions unique, thus making it fun to have everything interact with everything for the pure conversations fun).\nThe main strong point of this game are the many different options that pop up in conversation which can define the amount of information, the relationship the player develops with the character and even the ending. Instead of taking the TellTale Games way of notifying you when you made a relevant decision changing a characters attitude, you have to simply take their reactions for face value though, keeping it realistic and relateable.\n\nOther points that I personally enjoyed a lot:\nThe developers spend a lot of time in thinking about the world they created. Simply looking at objects, reading the media outlets or talking to Turing will show the amount of work that went into the history between today and the games setting, from world wide conflicts over technology advances to even something like city development. While not necessarily relevant to the plot (its possible to get through the game without knowing anything about the world itself), it shows the love the developers put into the game as well as help understanding the characters that live in it.\nAnother quite interesting point about this game is that it is really revolutionary in its treatment of sexuality and gender expression. The player is allowed to be whatever they want and get confronted with multiple characters that identify in ways that society might frown upon (such as a lady with beard or a gender-ambigous character enjoying being referenced to as "they"). One can also find one gay couple as well as hints to at least two more, though the latter can differ based on the characters gender expression and the path of conversation leading to the characters being more or less intimate. It never is a actual story point, it is only mentioned with handwaves instead of making it extremely obvious, giving off a very natural and unforced feeling of people like that being the norm, especially since no character (including the player) sees any of it out of the ordinary.\nThe game further raises interesting questions for today as it deals heavily with racism, even though the aim shifted from non-colored/colored people to 'modificated' people and AI, explaining that discrimminating is apparently in the nature of humans and has to be constantly battled against.\n\nSummary:\nRead Only Memory is a fun game that starts out light-hearted and soon dives deep into topics about humanity, conscience and media control. It proves to be a world logical in itself with a strong foundation in todays world and with strong characters that are easy to remember and love/hate. With a good sense of humour, a lot of hidden jokes for meme and videogame fans, an interesting story and dark turns around every corner, it will give you a gaming experience in the wake of Ghost Trick and Professor Layton, all mixed with some nice flair of Film Noir and Shadowrun.\nWether you want to try and talk to cars, put your fingerprints on every window in the city or make all characters hate you to the bone, this game allows it all and makes you love it for what it is.\nCan you find the culprit behind your friends disappearance? Will you unleash the secret that caused all the trouble to begin with? And can you become friends with a machine that tries to be human? ROM asks all these questions, you have to find the answers.","December 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/recommended/330820/","realkct","Real KCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/","261 products in account","Having been unaware of the Kickstarter for this game, the first thing I thought when seeing the gameplay screenshot on the Steam new release page was 'that looks a bit like Snatcher'. Quite fitting as the term 'that's a bit like Snatcher' could be applied to approximately 90% of Read Only Memories.\n\nIt's just as well that Snatcher was one of the most under-rated games of the mid 90's (or 80's if you're going back to the original chibi sprite MSX version) & it's surprising that more adventure games haven't taken inspiration from it before now. So, in similar fashion, R.O.M. has the same 16-bit-esque pixel art/EGA look & letterbox game interface that Kojima's game has.\n\nUnlike Snatcher, the main protagonist is left undefined for you to project yourself in their place. The game interface is also far more akin to a point & click adventure than just a visual novel with objects in the environment window to be interacted with in a latter Lucasarts period SCUMM style interface.\n\nThe story & character writing is exceptionally good. Your robot companion Turing (again think Little John) who're you're introduced at the start of the game being particular affable as he discovers what it means to have true independent sapience. There is also an ecleptic cast of other supporting characters and while it is unfortunate that they are not voice acted, their personalities are delivered in the text dialogue adequetly to get a feel as to how to approach them.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that developer for the game is the organiser of the GaymerX convention (infact Turing is even currently in the website banner logo). As such there are multiple LGBT characters and themes throughout the game.\nWhile it's refreshing and a great step forward to see inclusion in entertainment media such as this, one criticism might be that there was an unrealistic ratio of both throughout the game. Of course, it's hard to say what the RL ratio is with social pressures & bigotry that still exist, but it felt a little skewed in one direction of the kinsey scale none the less.\n\nThe other criticism being that by not giving the protagonist an actual character to play, you form these friendships with people by making appropriate dialogue choices that don't actually go anywhere. I was hoping that the story would develop in a way where you would be able to take things further with either TOMCAT or Jess, providing an option for whatever pronoun you've decided to be refered towards at the start of the game. But alas, this wasn't to be.\n\nThroughout the game there's also a real lack of urgency or tension until perhaps the last hour of it's 8-9 hour span. Even in several occasions upon entering a darkened room, there's no decapitated Jean Jack Gibson here to really drive home the seriousness of the situation. Almost all the point and click style puzzles have the solution in the same location and are therefore trivial & feel like padding to prevent R.O.M. being purely a visual novel with dialogue choices.\n\nThe Snatcher homage is even perhaps a little /too/ closely adhered towards in that the game has a grid based light-gun section & more importantly that if you've previously played the Kojima game, you can already guess a character plot twist waaaaay before it happens.\n\nCriticism aside, it's still a fantastic title & with multiple endings & dialogue choices you can perform it encourages repeat playthroughs. Though it would be hard to make a sequel seeing that the story is self contained and definitely reaches a climax, anything else containing Turing would get an immediate purchase from me. Probably my favourite character of 2015!","October 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

It's a lengthy adventure(I spent about 8 hours on a first play, and then 4 on repeats) with a lot of dialogue puzzles, a smaller amount of inventory puzzles, and a few one-offs involving shooting or hacking things/people.\n\nThe plot is primarily a mystery story in which your faceless, hard-up journalist main character assists Turing, the first sentient robot, in solving the disappearance of their creator and the story behind their origins. Like in any good noir, the lines between good guy and bad guy are blurry, the protagonists are unknowing pawns, and people who are too close to the truth die. And like in good sci-fi stories, the stakes hinge on ethical consequences of future technology, even as they retain analogues to the present day.\n\nIf you are wondering about the "queer content" of the game - you don't need to be very invested in it to follow the story.  Many of the characters are composites of cyberpunk tropes against gender and sexual minority identities, but your character interaction doesn't revolve around those aspects, as the setting normalizes them into background flavor. Instead, choices to be nice or jerky are transposed to the new topics of 2064: the situations and rights of hybrids, cyborgs, etc. The game won't shame you too much to stay on the "good" path(you'll just feel bad if you have any conscience), and in fact it's a decent challenge to explore the game enough to find all six endings on your own, since they depend on character interaction throughout the game, not just in the final sequences. There's also plenty of alternative paths that don't affect the endings. ~4 hours times ~6 plays = good replay potential.","October 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","7","23","0","0"

I get that this is used to keep the story on its rails, but in at least one case it was done so unsubtly that it gave away a huge plot point.

There's also plenty of hipster bait if you're into that, (I am), old video games, CRT monitors, and old speakers galore.\n\nThe one thing I was a little worried about was whether it was going to start shoving SJW themes down my throat, which it didn't, it asks for pronouns at the start of the game and that's it, you can even skip that entire step if you wish, so for those of you who were thinking this game is another shameless social issue plug, don't worry, it's not.\n\nIf you like adventure games, cyberpunk, whodunits, or of course, Snatcher, get it, it's a lovely little trip down classic cyberpunk lane.","November 6, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","0"

You follow the developing plot in the role of a down on his luck journalist assisting your newly befriended self aware A.I. companion Turing. Deciding to set out on a quest together. In order to try and unravel the mysterious sudden disappearance of Turing's creator. Set in Neo-San Francisco in late December of the year 2064.\n\nYou're placed in a world where humans and implant enhanced hybrid humans share a shakey coexistence. Here you will encounter ominous, shady, corporate entities, a "pure human" activist group, along with a varied cast of other rough and tumble characters. Ranging from a young detective to some even younger street punks who can help aid you along. Helping to further fuel the intrigue and assisting Turing and yourself to piece together the puzzling  situation as you progress.\n\nThis all unfolds in a beautiful art style, that I would kind of describe as a mix of 80's and 90's anime, robo, sci-fi inspired awesomeness. The immediate influences from movies and gaming like Snatcher, Phantasy Star, Gabriel Knight, Akira, Bladerunner and even Deja Vu are very clear. This game isn't a bland clone however and stands worthy on it's own two legs. I consider it a very excellent first entry by Midboss into such a lofty kingdom of fondly remembered cult titles of the past from which it invokes. The beautiful pixel art, not to mention the fantastic mood driven synth music and creative sound effects makes it a pleasure for the eyes and ears.\n\nThe writing has alot of humor and offers tons of dialogue if you chose to interact with your surroundings thoroughly. Alot of attention is given to even small details. Which helps to give off a feeling of truly being immersed in this shadowy world. The menu system is very much like that of Snatcher. Pixel hunting is never really a problem, since you can usually use the keyboard itself to run through all the background to find things to interact with.\n\nOne of my favorite things this game includes, is that it allows you to try just about every option when interacting with the environment. Many times yielding some pretty hilarious results. Alot of games would take the lazy way out; just by repeating the same line over again about that doesn't work. While ROM on the other hand, makes an effort to reward your curiosity to keep making you want to explore. Of course much of this is optional and not required if you're just looking to cover the main story quickly.\n\nDavid Fennoy and Adam Harrington do a fantastic job of lending their voice talents to this project. The voice acting comes off very professional and adds some good personality. My only real complaint would be that they weren't used as often as I would have liked to have heard. In fact one of the few real complaints I have with this game would be that it could use more voiceover work. I'm guessing that budget an time constraints might have played a role in that matter.\n\nAside from that complaint. The only problem I have with the game at the current time of writing this are with the few bugs and crashes that I've encountered. Some of the puzzle sections can present bugs which render them impossible to complete. Reloading the game seems to fix these bugs that can come up. At least on the one puzzle bug that I did encounter. Most all of these I believe the developers are aware of and working to fix at the moment. However these things can make it rather hard to gain the achievement for finishing the game in a single attempt, without having to continue or reload a save. Not to mention making you lose alot of playtime hours if you didn't manage to create a save before hand.\n\nThe game features multiple endings scenarios. The main deciding factor on how you obtain these is through how you treat certain characters. This doesn't just change the endings, but also bits of the dialogue and story as the chapters progress. Offering a good reason to replay it again. It throws in a few puzzles as well, that offer a bit of challenge, but are fairly easy to grasp. It even features a few shooting portions very similar to the grid style shooting scenes in Snatcher.\n\nAs you can probably tell from the length this review ended up becoming I was very impressed with this game. All in all I found it to be a great game and would recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of that detective noir spun in a futuristic dystopia setting. Even if you're a newcomer to genre, I think this game offers enough to keep you entertained for many hours.","October 16, 2015","true","45.8"," 16 of 43 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","16","43","0","0"

Finally, the writing is quite well done and gives a strong feeling of the individual voice of all the characters that you meet, be they human or hybrid or robot.\n\nThe humor in the game is great (the puns are so on point), and references don't feel blantantly tacked on for the "pop" factor most of the time.

Top notch low resolution pixel art, really groovy chiptune vibes and the sound effects are a fantastic throw to the back in all the good ways! Also I like the way how the characters are really expressive even with such little frames and all!\n\nAnother banging note I wanna bring up is the level, and amount of writing in this game! Pretty much everything is interactable and examinable, and instead of non-descriptive "You can't use that with that", you get unique responses and really funny ones as well! There's so much of choice dialogue sprinkled everywhere and I genuinely enjoy talking with the characters I meet in this game!\n\nSpeaking of characters! It's really refreshing to see genuinely wide cast of vastly different kinds of folks in this game, with unique looks and personalities and such! It's also really inclusive game, and they've done pretty sweet job of recognizing LGBT folk and preferred pronouns and other really superb stuff - oh and don't worry! There's no force-feeding of any agendas here, which is also super cool in my opinion!\n\nWhile I can't say too much about the plot and overall run of the game yet, as I'm still working my way through it, the plot has gotten me pretty hooked up and I can't wait to see what kind of wild ride this game is going to turn out!\n\nOh, and extra note! The Midboss devs are like super SUPER nice and cute people and they're really responsive and just nice folks in general! You should definetly try out the demo and if that feels like your thing, give this game a shot!

This gameplay is your average point and click style puzzles, however the main chunk of the game is simply reading different thing everyone says, and if you miss just one sentence it can screw you up in the end.

I found this game when steam recommended it to me out of nowhere. looking throught the screenshots and watching the video makes it was obvious that this game is a point and click adventure with a sidekick R.O.M. (that's what robots are called in the future :P) who's the first to be gifted with artificial intelligence... I like that idea. so i picked it up (game only) and played an hour immediately to see if it was worth my time or i'd ask for a refund, and I've got to say that it's definitely worth it. To start explaining it without spoiling anything I'll say it straight: it's a point and click game, you click things and you select from certain options to progress the story or encounter entertaining dialogue, the choices you make affect how characters act towards you the further you progress in the game, and you better be prepared for the occasional puzzle that keeps things from going too fast, because if you really wanted you could finish this game in one day if you really commited yourself to it, but I'd recommend to play in sessions to digest what happened in each chapter and really get into the story. Enjoy the soundtrack while you're at it.

It's clear where inspiration was drawn from, but it's done in such a way that adds its own character on rather than being derivative. It's also very refreshing to see a cyberpunk setting that isn't constant gloom and grit.\n\nMy only complaint is that it's a bit linear.

The scavenger hunt-style puzzles here are too eager to hold the player's hand, though there are some decent logic puzzles to break up the rhythm. But winning the game isn't as important as how your choices shape the story, which maintains its light tone throughout (excepting an occasional tonal swerve into some legitimately creepy horror). Multiple endings are possible. The autosave system is unforgiving, so make frequent use of the manual save system in case you want to rethink a decision or take another stab at a puzzle.\n\nThe cast is appropriately large and diverse for a whodunnit, and mostly personable. Special mention should be made of Lexi Rivers. A hardboiled police detective with a great, distinctive design, she's definitely the game's MVP and could star in her own noir spin-off.\n\nAn entertaining indy game.

I wanted to like it, I really did. The graphics are great with some very nice and evocative pixel art. The characters are interesting and likeable enough. However it fumbled the plot. The game is just a bit too precious. Everyone helps you, even people who have basically no reason too, and it all comes across as very forced. The game is indeed inclusive and features a diverse range of characters but unfortunately it's not achomplished in a way I'd describe as elegant. I'd say they managed to reach about five notches above the kid in a wheelchair from those old burger king ads in the 90s. I say that but thats unfair as I don't think the diveristy here is a cynical ploy but rather a well-intentioned design-descision.\n\nOverall if the actual plot of this game had been exciting and intriguing I would whole-heartedly reccomend it but unfortuantely I can only hestitantly reccomend it.

In general i really liked it. For me ROM feels more like a 'casual' version of Snatcher. by this, i mean that there really isn't a way to fail or loose at ROM that i have found (execpt near the end). In fact you can mostly just sit back and just read the story they are telling you with small little puzzle breaks here and there. Some people may like this, others may not. I don't know if ROM is really a game or just an interactive novel because of this. Other games like the Ace attorny sereies actually have  'lose' conditons or have you puzzle things out more. Again, it's not a flaw, it's more of a design choice. they really wanted this game to be very casual gamer friendly. if you have never played an adventure game before this is actually a really good first game to pick up! ROM is really forgiving ;-) If you like it try to find an emulated version of snatcher (it's basically ROM on hard core mode :-)\n\nOkay so now for my negitives which are really just nitpicks. One, I guessed 'who done it' by chapeter 2 and was correct. really the game doesn't try to hide it too well and alot of in game text (if your good about reading everything) from chapter 2 down just reinforce it.  the good thing though is that even though i knew who did it i totally didn't know HOW they did it so the reveil at the end was still satisfying to me. Two. GOD! your inventory is just jacked! usually in an adventure game you can pick up things to solve puzzles and what not. And some things you pick up are just useless. they are just red herings to get you to think about the puzzle. In ROM your inventory constently shifts! sometimes you will see items you picked up before and other times you don't. I think this was a design choice to limit your options so you don't get confused or frustrated but i found it way to hand holding and also confusing when you ask "HEY! where did item X go?" only for it to reapper in your inventory later when it's more 'puzzle convient'. again, this isn't broken, you can progress fine but it's another one of those design chocies for more casual/ first time players.\n\nSo should you buy it? Oh yeah! totally! It's a fun little story that kept me intrested just don't look for deep game mechanics or a big challenge. It's an  easy, breezey, and beautiful casual game. :-)\n\nlast note. one of the BIGGEST thing i love about this game is that it's VERY LGBT inclusive! I mean it's based in san fransciso! Anybody who worries that they will be playing as a 'gay' need not worry. the game just have alot of LGBT people in it just living there lives, no one comes on to you or throws their 'gayness' in your face. it's just treated as a basic part of life and the story just moves on without blinking. which honestly its the way it should be. I will say though that if your not use to other gener identies some pronoun usage might get a little wierd but you get over it really quick. (i'm looking at you TOMCAT, love a hon!  your a doll! ;-)\n\n","October 17, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cauguste/recommended/330820/","cauguste","Auguste","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cauguste/","168 products in account","Read Only Memories draws its most obvious inspiration from Snatcher, although you can see hints of other works peppered throughout, and truly dedicated folks will uncover a wealth of one-off references and in-jokes that reward the attentive without making anyone not in on the reference feeling lost. It benefits from an incredibly well-written script and a beautiful aesthetic that pulled me in and kept me engaged in spite of what I felt were significant gameplay flaws.\n\nThe broad cast of characters is skillfully written to the point where even with a few lines you can really get a sense of the personality behind each character as you're introduced to them. Everyone has a slightly different motivation in helping you out, and their helpfulness is a reflection of those feelings. Regardless of what they may feel for you, the protagonist, appealing to characters' own interests means you're able to cobble together a shaky alliance from people that initially seemed unapproachable or unwilling to help. If there is one weakness in the game it is the highly diminished sense of agency that the game provides; while our protagonist can be highly customized, the choices we make at the beginning of the game have little bearing on the in-game world, creating a few callbacks at best. The player's agency only really shines through on occasion through interaction with Turing; who is inarguably the true main character of the story. It left me feeling detached from the situation -- I wanted the outcome for Turing to be the best possible, and yet the dialogue choices felt not quite right for how I might address the character, and their will made it difficult if not impossible to determine whether I was helping at all. I think this is a good narrative point -- in the game as in life we aren't really able to fundamentally alter the people we associate with, but we can at least hope to be important to them and act as a foil for their own growth.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward but enjoyable; I found myself surprised with the ease of use since point-and-click adventures are notorious for weird logic and frustrating conundrums. This is wonderful in the context of no longer having to fill my inventory with useless items and rub them against terrain features or each other to create solutions, but it doubled back on me at several cases when the ease of gameplay early on dulled my senses to times when I really needed to be more aware of the setting and surroundings. The minigames and puzzles which help progress the story have too few iterations to produce a sense of accomplishment or mastery when finished, giving them the feel of obstacles to be overcome rather than genuinely pleasing and rewarding. The interface feels intentionally clunky - which is effective at slowing the player down to have them experience the game's text, but it also becomes surprising when the responsiveness of the game becomes near-perfect in action sequences. There's a disconnect that felt jarring and took a few game overs to realize that no, there was no bug in the system, it's just that the previous sluggish text/adventuring controls had given way to highly responsive action controls.\n\nWhat stands out in Read Only Memories is the plot and the worldbuilding. The characters are well-realized and distinct, adding flavour to the setting, but the real star is the mystery that unravels as the player investigates strange happenings in Neo San Francisco. I get the feeling that people who have lived there or visited would be rewarded with familiar sights, personalities, and corporate presences - but as someone who has never been, it felt like a good representation of how San Francisco might turn out in a cyberpunk future unmarred by disaster. The city itself feels like the biggest supporting character, and the plot that unfolds within it paints a picture that is equal parts bleak and uplifting - 'plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose' could be the motto of Neo San Francisco which feels ironically like the San Francisco of today: blissfully ignorant tech giants changing peoples' lives for the better and for the worse with equal disregard, a gathering place for marginalized people where they can be themselves, a city fighting a continual ballet of urban decay and aggressive gentrification. For all the trappings of the future, what happens in Neo San Francisco in Read Only Memories could easily have happened ten years ago or next week in the Bay area.\n\nThe game's music is probably its strongest point - the soundtrack sets the scene and seamlessly carries the player through the game. In the middle of mundane tasks I would find myself humming along or bobbing my head, and a stand-out moment happened for me when I helped 4Moolah (an obvious insert of the game's composer, 2Mello) compose a rap. Not only was 4Moolah's rap a good kind of cheesy, but using objects to help him figure out the rap was one of the more amusing and empowering moments in the game. As far as I can tell, there's only one right answer, but the sequence subverted my expectations, made me laugh, and puzzled the hell out of me with a twist ending. I even tested the lyrics and they fit with the background music and was pleased to find that everything fits even for an amateur like me.\n\nAt the time of writing, I had only played through the game 1 1/2 times. It doesn't seem to have a lot of replayability but completionists will get a kick out of exploring the different dialogue and path options, and the script is rewarding enough that choosing all-new answers to most questions makes the game novel enough to stick with for another playthrough.\n\nRead Only Memories is a first effort from MidBoss, and as a first effort it is very good. The production values are incredibly high given the funding and timeline. The game is long enough to sit down and play in one night if you're really dedicated but every bit of it is packed with intriguing characters, excellent music, and lovingly rendered pixel-art. It feels like a unique product - an art project whose intent wasn't necessarily to amuse but to engage the player outside the context of the game to think about the world as it is written. It also subverts traditional game thinking by making the player-controlled protagonist a lynchpin to the events of the game without having a strong effect on the outcome. I came away from the experience feeling as though Turing had used me (as the protagonist) but could have easily used anyone in my situation; who I was was irrelevant, I was just convenient. It's unsettling and nontraditional but definitely worth a playthrough or two, and worth the price. I am looking forward to future changes and/or to the release of a second game from this studio. Read Only Memories is a great game - and with a gameplay overhaul, it could have been a masterpiece.\n\nPros:\n*Engaging story\n*Interesting and diverse cast\n*Amazing Music\n*Thought-provoking\n*Unique\n*Solid art direction\n*A rare take at a cyberpunk future that hasn't undergone a catastrophe.\n\nYMMV:\n*Limited player agency\n*Linear\n\nCons:\n*Puzzles and minigames are adequate but could be so much better.\n*Wonky difficulty; feels too easy at times, well-tuned at others; solving puzzles","November 3, 2015","true","11.8"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

The game feels more akin to Ace Attorney, minus the court settings. You try to solve a murder by talking and getting to know different people. The story is very well written and most all of the characters are great. There are only a few times where you get to interact with the scenery to advance the story. You're given a zapper early in the game, but you only ever use it at the ending (a very intense ending). I don't think you can die in this game, but you can get multiple outcomes. However, the amount of dialogue discourages me from playing it again. While I can’t fault the storyline, I just wish the game had a bit more use of the zapper and more puzzles.\n\nSo, if you like Snatcher and/or Ace Attorney this is the game for you.","January 1","true","8.0"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kmcbride/recommended/330820/","kmcbride","The Grimace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kmcbride/","214 products in account","I love Snatcher and point-and-clicks. I'm also looking forward to the upcoming game VA11-Hall-A, which shares a universe with this game, Read Only Memories. I figured I'd give ROM a shot since I needed something to do and got the game on sale.\n\nFirst, I'd like to start with the positives. The music is good and definitely evokes a cyberpunk feel, not unlike how Snatcher's music performed. The pixel artwork is also good- I was always excited to meet new people to see how their feelings would transfer to their facial expressions. Moving into the meat of the game itself, MOST of the characters and overarching plot are enjoyable and I felt invested in finding out exactly what would happen during the events of the story. Turing, the primary character you travel with, is a good character and their determination to find out the truth was a good way to ride through the plot.\n\nNow, the bad? Egh... For starters, the character "Jess" is just awful and I hated every single interaction I had with her. I think that was intentional on the developer's part, but it still wasn't a good idea. She's a person with lots of power in a high position, but she will not practice diplomacy and she will refuse to speak with you unless the player practically grovels at her feet... and even then, she is still completely crass and unlikable. She has a vendetta against everyone who lives outside of her own worldview and even if people try to understand her, I got the impression that she would hate them unless she saw them as "her kind." That's not the kind of image you want to give to someone with whom you'd like to sympathize.\n\nThe LGBT traits 95% of the characters deal with feel shoved in for the sake of just being able to say that the characters are LGBT. Most of the characters are implied to be gay through flavor text that didn't really need to be there, making things very heavyhanded. I would like to go into further detail, but the only character I found kind of genuine was Lexi. Each time after her introduction, when a character somehow implied their sexuality, it felt more and more heavy-handed. I'm positive that there's a good way to present homosexuality and transgendered characters in video games, but I don't think they succeeded. I also think that their failure took away from my overall enjoyment of the game. I will, however, give them points for trying.\n\nI know I've focused a bit more on the bad parts of the game, but that's because they're much easier to point out. The good parts I mentioned above are something that can only be experienced to understand, and so I would recommend atleast trying the game's demo if you are interested. This is not a game for everyone, but I think that for all of its flaws, it did a lot of things right. Just make sure to take the unwarranted admissions of sexual preference with a tablespoon of salt.","November 17, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

The game is in stark relief to franchises like Shadowrun that deal with similiar concepts, but in all the more gentle way. Much of the grit of the cyberpunk genre is eschewed for a more personal and affecting view of concepts like machine intelligent, transhumanism, and trans-ness in general, and the story is greatly improved by it.  ROM also extends the same kind of care to the player and their avatar, giving them several options for things like pronouns, attitude in conversation, and even religious restrictions on a food diet.\n\nThe game's only weak point is that it's ending lacks the personal punch it's been swinging the entire game - instead opting for a Besethda style 'where are they now' epilogue. While understandable in the writing team's long run, I felt this type of big picture ending was determential to ROM's very character focused writing and could have maybe been better served by a playable epilogue where talking to the characters revealed their fates.\n\nOverall, I really cannot recommend ROM enough - it is a game that is gentle and understating in way that is comforting while still allowing for good discussion of the issues it presents. I love this game.","December 30, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

This game really scratched my itch for sci-fi that pontificates big questions like what it means to be human and all that, but also my need for quirky humor, catchy osts, and bright colors.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the middle gets a little tiresome because more often than not other characters will push you forward in the plot rather than teasing out a lead for yourself through investigation.  On the one hand, that keeps you from getting lost and confused as to how to progress, but on the other it pushes it towards being more like a visual novel than a P&C adventure game.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay does get shaken up in interesting ways in a few chapters with randomized puzzles, mazes, and even an arcadey shooter minigame.  Also, you are not railroaded into a pre-determined ending; how you interact with people and whether or not you succeed in certain tasks has actual consequences down the line.\n\nAnyway I loved the game, I loved Turing, and I'm eagerly looking forward to anything the developer comes up with next :)","December 30, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

Sure, you'll have plenty of the usual themes but by the end you really do feel for the characters that you meet. Whichever ending you get it leaves a lasting impression, and with several endings it does have some replayability value.

I was so wrong! ROM has turned out to be one of my favourite games of 2015. I'm not a heavy gamer, but this thing had me addicted better than Phoenix Wright: Ace Attourney - the closest thing I've played to this style.\n\nThe characters are genuinely interesting and fun to talk to. Everything feels like it matters. There are heaps of different endings and paths you can take through the game. Sometimes you'll fail at parts, and have to clean up your mess later, sending you on paths to new adventures you wouldn't have seen otherwise. Doing badly at parts of the game doesn't slow you down. It doesn't make you respawn and try again until you succeed. It gives you a new entirely new adventure, a new way to solve the problem. While there's about 6-8 hours of play time in one playthrough, I think this is one of the extremely few games I will want to play again, to explore new paths and meet different people.\n\nI am so excited to see what MidBoss does next. Incredible. And the soundtrack is epic too.","November 1, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

Music is incredible, intuative, and imaginative. Visuals reflect a 80/90's take of the future, and show a good eye for detail. Love the different roms and color schems, it is very pleasant on the eye. Storyline is good. I LOVE this game but I feel like at times I wanted another puzzle or more interaction or influence to the environment. Yeah, heavy on LGBTQ theme but for the target audience I think it works well. Also who can't resist trying spoiled milk on everything?

Yes, I think the lore and questions this game brings up are compelling but I wouldn't really describe this as a "point-and-click" game; I think it's much more akin to a visual novel.  There are interactive elements and moments where you can explore your environment with the mouse, but the game is kind of a slog to get through cause of all the long sections of exposition that go on for like 20 minutes at a time.  Sometimes you'll enter a conversation and are suddenly forced to make a choice or move ahead in the story with no warning and no pause point to allow you to go back and accomplish what you intended to in the first place.\n\nWhat gameplay there is feels largely circumstantial and adds very little to the overall experience - I would even argue they detract from some of the things the game does right.  Gameplay sections appear very sporadically and don't feel well-paced out or integrated at all.  The final chapter features a lengthy portion of gameplay that comes out of nowhere and dooesn't feel like a test of skill or intelligence.  Puzzles are either completely obvious or require a lot of tedious trial-and-error.  Dialogue options often aren't telegraphed well and there were multiple points when I inadvertently made a decision I didn't realize I was making or had a character interpret my response in the exact opposite way I intended.  You have an inventory but it's kind of like when you have an inventory in a TellTale game - it's just sort of there to give the illusion that you might eventually use the things you're collecting.\n\nI kind of like it, but I can't imagine I'll be playing this again.  If everything I said above is your thing, more power to you but I wish I'd known all this going in.","February 28","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player is a web journalist and the first few minutes are spent applying some "smart" headphones to various objects in the room so the character can write and sumbit a review. Without giving away too much, the next morning you are visited by a robot created by an old friend who has gone missing. Your help is needed to find him.\n\n* The game interaction is similar to nancy drew in that you are given an environment with objects to interact with, a little clunky at first, but okay once you get used to it.\n\n* The game takes about 6 hours to play through and if possible I would reccomend playing it in one sitting\n\n+ There are several meaningful plot twists\n+ Choices matter, even some small ones.\n* for an old style game it can become very dark at times, incredibly spooky/chilling at others.\n-","June 2","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
