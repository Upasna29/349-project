In terms of mechanics, this game is basically metal gear solid with an open world and indie N64-esque graphics (similar polygon shapes to what you would see on the N64, but much less detail), but with a different art aesthetic than anything I remember playing on the N64, as it looks like the Madness flashes from Newgrounds. In comparison to Metal Gear, it has a lot of extra mechanics. For example, you can unlock spell like abilites such as the ability to stop time. I had a lot of fun with the beta, and this seems to be similar so far.\n\nAlso, in response to Fuffen, another reviewer, I rebooted steam after the patch today, and the game runs just fine for me. I have an HP 2000 laptop, so if it can run for me, it can probably run for you. Moreover, contrary to what Shimmy Like Jimmy said, that puzzle did make sense.   In that puzzle, there is a message that says the west determines order, the east determines value. In one room, there are three double digit numbers- 17, 22, and 34. So 7 is the first number, 2 is the second, and 4 is the third. It's a counterintuitive puzzle, but a logical one. Also, the correct answer is 724, not 743. Moreover, there are mirrors, and you can see the numbers in them using the R goggles you get in that dungeon. Even moreover, silenced headshots can kill some enemies in one hit, but there are different enemies with different levels of durability. Also, there are different endings depending on what choices you make. In a nutshell, "shimmy like jimmy" is wrong in most of negatives he lists.","March 1","true","13.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

I'm running windows 10, if you need any diagnostics let me know.\n\nEDIT --- Game works when launching it as admin (you have to browse local files to find the .exe and run as admin)","March 1","true","0.1"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","26","6","23","7","0"

One level in particular scared the hell out of me, which was the last thing I would've expected from a game like this!\n\nHonestly, I was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did (no offense dev, lol...), but I just spent that last 8 hours playing it!","May 30","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
