Prepare to wait).\n- Not really a con, but one thing to note. During Early Access, the game's price was 15 dollars, then it suddenly dropped to one (after the winter sale). The devs just wanted to increase the playerbase and that's fine, but I feel sorry for people who spent that much for it.\n- e-Sports? Wow.\n\nI encourage the devs to improve the game (even though that would be a lot of work) because it looks promising afterall.

I've now come to check on it again to find it is out of "early access" and dropped down to $1 but still has all the issues early supporters spoke of at the time. Honestly, it's kind of a slap in the face to early supporters but it happens. However, I can't recommend it at all, not because I was shafted, but because it's literally unplayable still. Code is still buggy, waiting time for games is longer than actual gameplay time, hitboxes are bad, players literally "teleport" through objects. Honestly they should've done a price drop earlier or more bundles to promote the game because the early cost of $15 is a big buy-in considering you could get CS:GO for that price and an insanely active community.","January 7","false","2.1"," 172 of 200 people (86%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","86","172","200","20","11"

In the entire time I played this game, I never acually got to "play" it. After waiting more than 15 minutes while spectating at 10 fps, the game froze and crashed. I had a 17 ping and I have an I7 6-core, a GTX 960 and 16 gb's of DDR4 RAM. Nothing special but it should be more than enough to play this game.\n\nThe gall of the dev releaseing this to 1.0 is huge. Dropping the price from $15 dollars to ~ 60 cents is also super insulting to the purchasers who paid $15 in early access. (Thankfully I got it in a bundle).\n\nWhen I had tried to play this game a few months ago, there was not one other person playing at ~21:00 PST.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs, even at 60 cents.","January 7","false","2.5"," 142 of 187 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","142","187","14","25"

They also dropped the price under the pretense of getting more people into the game. Even though they have given free keys almost every day and mass giveaways when they came to early access and still no one played it.  It is still unoptimized , the animations are still bad (they told initial supporters they where placeholders) and the game still crashes randomly.  If you are considering buying this game at its current price. PLEASE DON'T.\n\nAll you are doing is supporting developer's that cash grab with unity free assets by cobbling up "games" together for fast cash. The game has BARELY changed in a year and it is still a broken unplayable mess. The developers lied to all supporters saying these issues would be fixed before launch. They never got fixed. Their servers are so bad and the optimization is so bad that they can't even handle the load and crash. Same problem since day 1.  PLEASE DON'T SUPPORT THIS BEHAVIOUR. All you are doing is providing cash grab devs with income. They could care less about you or the game as its READILY apparent to anyone , especially those who purchased on day 1 and listened to their lies.\n\n\nTried enjoying this game but between the horrible animations , glitchy terrain , slanted buildings , wrong-sized doors and pretty much being completely opposite from what Battle Royale should be like (Everyone spawns and runs out from the same place instead of randomly on the map).\n\nAside from ALL that I still tried to enjoy the game. Until a 16yr old forum mod for this game decided to harass me for asking him about the connection issues the game was experiencing. Instead of removing the troll mod , he actually decides to ban me and not just lock the threads but delete every single thread or post I was ever in.\n\nHe bans me under the pretense of removing me for toxicity yet leaves the 2 other trolls who where insulting me through the whole thread. They are still not banned to this day. Nor is his mod either.\n\nIts bad enough the game is a broken mess. Early access or not this is barely even an idea. And 99% of the time is unplayable. Servers don't connect or no one is playing. But then you gotta deal with little kids as mods and devs that defend them...\n\nSo if you wanna know whether or not to get this game or even play it for free. The answer is clearly no. Its already as its name implies.\n\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/334040  2 playing 51all time peak\n\nAlso , those positive reviews seem to come from the mods and their friends. Most if not all received their keys for free. The dev continues giving out keys on twitter as well to try to infuse players into the game. Even with FREE keys the game remains dead. Not even enough people to fire up a match.","February 4, 2015","false","5.0"," 165 of 233 people (71%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","71","165","233","16","31"

The gamestyle is pretty much H1Z1s battle royale. You are dumped in an area to find resources, forced to flee from some type of gradually enclosing deadly force-field, explosions, snakes, and other players, who you have to fight to the death.\n\nThe gameplay when not buggy is pretty decent, but needs a good polish to put the icing on the cake. Some ideas that I think could be easily implemented are:\n\n-Basic character customisation.\n-A back story of some sort, even if its a small cliche blurb.\n-More variety of weapons, guns, fire extinguishers, crowbars & knives are fine, but what about spears and axes, something maybe a little more primal?\n-An alliance/team mode server or the option to pair up with someone.\n-Varying levels of difficulty.\n-More servers.\n\nI'll be keeping an eye on this one as I believe if the creators work hard enough this could be a cool little game.","January 11","true","1.2"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","40","52","5","3"

To make up for it, every day, the Dev announces games on twitter.  Plenty of people show up and we have a great time.  The game gets an update (almost) every night.  If you want to support the development of the game, and don't mind the current playerbase issues, then this is a great investment for you.  You rarely see a person care this much about a game they are creating.  If you can convince a few friends to pick it up, it'll never be hard for you to find a game.\n\nThe playerbase issue will work itself out as more and more people pick up this gem.\n\nNow, about the game itself:\n\nYou're in a desert of sorts, with various types of buildings strewn throughout.  You and however many people are joining the game enter via a lobby, and until everyone readies up, you can play some soccer or run around punching people and making e-motes.  Once everyone readies, the game begins.  Depending on the type of server you're in, you will all run from the center (ala Hunger Games), or be randomly spawned around the map.  Your fight for survival begins.\n\nYou go about scavenging what you can - Food, Water, Guns, Melee Weapons, Bandages, and other goodies.  You try to stay away from the poisonous snakes that prevent people from camping out in the rocky hills.  You keep an eye out for the air drop, that happens once a game and drops a crate with a decent weapon.  The weapons all have different attributes, and the hit boxes are actually where the should be.  If you swing an axe at someone, it hits where it hits.  Not in a magical line in front of you.  Bullet drop is a factor.  You will have to develop a certain level of skill.\n\nEven though it seems like each game is only within itself, there is a degree of on-going customization and personalization via the character screen.  The longer you survive in a match, the more money you earn to put towards perks and other goodies that follow your character through all games.  And the perks aren't boring, in fact, the perks you choose can vastly effect the way you try to survive in a match.\n\nEven in early access, it plays extremely well.  The servers seem to work fine, the mechanics are great, and the developer is very open about what needs to be worked on.  He's in constant contact with the community, and he really listens to suggestions.  All of which leads me to believe that this game is going to be a success.\n\nThrough trickery, stealth, or out-right brute force you must survive longer than every other player.  Do you make temporary allies?  How long can you trust them?\n\nBecause in the end, it comes Down To One.\n\n10/10.  In my opinion, you should definitely pick up this title.","March 2, 2015","true","22.0"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","40","58","2","4"

The idea of an extended survival deathmatch has been on my mind since Battle Royale/Hunger Games. I bought 'Down To One' over a month ago, and to this day the servers are still empty. All hours of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, past midnight!), the servers have either 1 or 0/42 players. I haven't yet been able to play the game so I can't pass judgement on the multiplayer. But from what I experienced in the practice server (only 1 person required to start): the audio sounds are weak and low-quality,  the environment looks like it was clumsily thrown together with cheap Unity assets and thoughtless lighting, the collision is terrible (floating pickups everywhere, can't reliably climb ladders), the theme/worldbuilding/writing is non-existent (there's no explanation at all for why a bunch of militants have gathered in the middle of a desert to shoot modern-day firearms at each other).\n\nI did enjoy the nifty IK animation they put in when you pick up an item (your character's hand extend towards the item). I also liked the way they handled the UI for items (you press a # key to select an item in your inventory, then press keys to either drop it or use it).\n\nThe survival game idea is definitely cool, and definitely a trending genre in PC games right now, but the execution is TERRIBLE. 'Down To One' in its current iteration isn't even playable. I don't know what the future is like for these guys, but best of luck to you.

I'm not a native English speaker, but I'll try my best to make my thoughts clear and literate.\n\nWell, it seems that Down To One is being criticised for it's animation, optimisation, some bugs, that spoil gaming experience, and that is a problem. But still, this game has some interesting features and ideas, which, anyway, need to be polished and refined.\nFor those, who don't know - Down To One is a game with a conceps similar to one in a japanese movie "Battle Royal", and it's the closest one to it. 42 men start a survival deathmatch with only one to be victorious.\n\nHere are some things, that I think are good\n+ Concept of matches is clear and easy to understand for a novice: you start at one location (or near a random one, if it is a server feature), get to any location to get some loot to start. Then, it's a weapon crate drop in a random location and playable area starts to decrease, making players move to a final location. Not speaking of survival part, which is obvious nowdays. And this is good.\n+ Terrain of a map sometimes make sense. Snakes spawn near the rocks, waiting for players, There is a mine field, that is laid... well... tactically correct, if you ask me. Sometimes you can find water under trees in desert. But finding a pistol or an axe in a basket is a bit strange, but still rewarding.\n+ Skill set is well-balanced, but not perfectly. You can't make an OP combination of perks however you try. But some game features make some skills not so effective (for example, "Play Dead" is irrelevant, as you get a message about a person died if he dies for real). This is easy to be fixed, and I hope developers know how to do it better.\n+ There are enough weapons for a game released 11 days ago. I've not got tired of shooting this weapons as I haven't tried all of them. But I hope there will be more of it. And by the way, it's a pleasure for me to shoot with all this guns. I feel all the guns more realistic, than guns in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3 *smiley face*.\n\nI know, thet there are some bugs, problems with optimisation, animation and graphics, but I won't tell a thing about it as I'm OK with it and play on "Maximum FPS" settings. So it's not me to tell you about the graphics, but still it's not too bad.\n\nThe real problems are:\n- Hit detection system is too random. It seems bearable if you shoot guns, but in melee you shall pray Tzeentch or any other god of Random to land a punch or get a target with an axe (especially snakes. If you meet it without a gun - you are 80% dead). The problem is that you can go through you enemy while fighting, and so can your fist/melee weapon, so hit will not be counted (I don't really know how to explain it). Just make player models solid, and it will be easier.\n- Snakes. Snakes! SNAAAAAKES! Oh god I never thought that i will hate this creatures so much. They are way too dangerous here They bite as strong as a US soldier punch you in the face (according to logic of a game). And they decrease your hunger and thirst bars every time they bite. And they bite really frequent. And you think they are easy to be killed, huh? HELL NO! You will be 3\4 dead, thirsty and hungry when you will finally get it. And it seemed to me, that I spend as much bullets to kill a snake as to kill a player. Nerf them or make them easier to hit. GG FIX PEASE!\n- Ladders. The thing is you don't reach the top of a ladder as you climb, so you have to jump to get to the roof. But that's a minor one. As some other minor ones I won't be wasting time here.\n- Servers. There are too few of them and they restart after evey match. and it's a bit hard to hit 42 men on one server. Or maybe it's so because of my time zone. Make some less maximum players on servers and make more servers themselves. This will be great. Really.\n\nTo sum up... This game is good. Not great, but playable. something "7.1/10" if you ask me. Good for an indie. And of course, I recomend it to survival genre fans wwho are tired of zombies and all fans of "Battle Royal" concept.\nI hope developers from Gadget Games read this reviev. You do great now. Don't give this game up. You still can make it better and better and I look forward content patches in future. Good luck with Down To One.

This game is so great to play with a small group of friends!  The servers are usually empty, but once you join one with a few friends then the people start trickling in until you have a large enough party to start the match.  This makes for a very closeknit and social community where players rely on each other to keep the game servers going.  There are for sure some flaws in the mechanics and gameplay, but this just makes for an even funnier time when playing with friends.  I bought this game on sale for around 30 cents and do not regret it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainTinker/recommended/334040/","CaptainTinker","Calypso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainTinker/","245 products in account","EDIT: Now since the game is fully released, I can with a clear mind say, that I don't recommend this "game" to anyone. It still has performance issues although they are not as bad as previously, but still. If this game tries to be competitive (Esports) then there is no room for such performance issues as these. The game is still hardly playable, the Ragdolls are still a joke, the same goes for animations. The game still looks like an early alpha of a game that shouldn't exist in the first place. And I feel sorry for those, who actualy payed more then 15€/$ for this game. I expected the game to be a mess and that the game will never reach it's playable state and I was proven right.\n\n\n\n\nWell where do I even beginn with this review here?\n\nI think I start of with what the game is suppose to be, what it has and what the game actually is.\n\nThe game is suppose to be a Last-Man-Standing shooter with survival aspects such as hunger, thirst and snakes.\nDepending on the server (whether random spawns are enabled or not) everyone is starting at the same spot in a "Waiting area" in which you play soccer while waiting for people to join, yes I say "join" because you mostly wont come as far as that. How ever, when the game starts you are suppose to scavenge for food and weapons to survive against other people in an open desert area. The area gets smaller after time so you don't have to search for other players. And, like I said earlier, it's last man standing, so the goal is to be the last survivor, Down to One.\nYou can also choose different perks and unlock new ones by leveling and "grinding" money, which you'll get for playing. You can choose up to 3 perks to carry at the same time and you can choose your "camoflage".\n\nThe concept may sound very simple, right? Well the execution of it is barely excuseable. Why? Because it's unplayable in it's current state in every possible way. I know, it's early access and that in such a form, bugs are inevetible. But you should at least expect the product to work in it's core state. Thing's such as getting into buldings, netcode, getting items (sometimes they float in unreachable places) and so on should work properly, which they doesn't. The awfull animations are bareable since they are only a visible aspect about the game and which SHOULD'T work perfectly in early access, that's okay. But if the core gameplay is not working, then it's only okay if:\n\n1st it is stated as "Closed Alpha" for experienced people, which should be able to fix the game as soon as they discover an issue.\n\n2nd if you don't charge money for that untill the game is ready and only needs balancing tweekings. Then it should be early access ready and only then you can charge money for your product.\n\n3rd if the developer himself can't find gamebreaking bugs which need to be fixed, then you can release your product as a public testing version to find new bugs and to fix them.\n\nThat is the purpose of testing and supporting. That's what early access should actualy be about. It's not something to use an excuse for a game which is broken right from the start and still charge money for that.\n\nThe performance is also very poor. For me, the game freezes every few seconds for a minute or so. My PC may not be the best, but I can still run games which require more ressources for instance: Call of Duty: Ghosts (Which is terrible) is still running more playable on lowest graphic settings then this game (which are also on the lowest settings set).\nI also know of people, who have a much better PC then I do and can run most games on highest settings, it still runs very poorly on the lowest for them and for me, when the game "runs" atleast in the waiting area and if i look on the ground the game runs playable. I think the reason for that is the unneccecary big map, which you cannot enter completly since the game will make the playable area smaller after time. Alternatively you could just make a more closed space like a building or something so your PC doesn't have to render unnececcary "Crap" which isn't even worth looking at (Endless desert with nothing to see and without being able to access it)\n\nBut the most thing, which I'm wondering about is, that' although it's "Mostly Positive", almost no one is playing the game. It takes way to much time to wait for players to join in and start a game and I ask myself "Where are the people who actually like the game". If I like a game, then I play it activelly for some time of course and this way, atleast 1 server should actually be constantly full. But it isn't and even people who recommend the game are just ignoring the game.\nI think it's because people recommend the game because it COULD be playable and good and that the developer is putting "effort" in it, which is the stupidest thing you can do in my eyes. Do you think a teacher gives you a good mark for your exam before you even write it because it COULD be good or, if everything you wrote is wrong and terribly readable although you put "effort" in it? I think not.\nThe only thing to expect from the developer now is that he fixes the bugs as soon as possible and that he should look for help to increase the chance to fix the listed bugs as soon as possible. Otherwise, the game will eventually die because no one is playing it and because of that, the developer will loose interest in his game (I think it's only 1 guy).\nOtherwise: Do Not Buy the game in it's current state because it is unclear, if the game will be playable or not but most things tell that it will not.\n\nIf you ask yourself, why I have the game? Well, I bought it in a bundle with various other games.","April 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","3"

Other than that, the concept and the gameplay itself is actually really good and fun. Players spawn in and spread out scavenging buildings and watch-towers for weapons and food and water. Yes you must feed and water yourself to stay alive as well as watch out for the other players. Once you're out... you're out and the game continues to last man standing. I found it pretty hard to find a ranged weapon at first until I came across a small military base. I picked up a gun very similar to an awp from CS and began lurking in the tops of the mountains killing other players. My first game lasted about 30 min but it wasn't slow paced at all. We had a total of 20 something people in the game and at the begining, people seem to die fast from not watching their backs and getting melee'd in the back. I would say that probably 10 min in we had less than what we started with. Now once it came down to me and the last guy, it became quite boring. I'm not sure if he was just camping or we were walking circles around eachother but it took quite a while before i finally snuck up on him and picked him off with a headshot from behind. All in all it was quite fun and I played a few more games. There definitley needs to be some updates and changes especially to the player animations and the scopes on weapons. There are updates being made and the Devs seem to be answering most the questions in the forums and taking suggestions. We all love to see that with Early Access Games. I definitley recommend trying this out eventually. You might want to wait for a few more updates and hopefully the player base will jump up as well, and possibly a sale before buying it.

For years I had simply been SWAT unit, tackling down the most dangerous criminals and hostile organisations to keep my city safe. Now, I had suddenly woken up in the middle east, along with a lot of other SWAT men.\n\nWe found little comfort in the small stone shack in which we were locked up and I could swear that some of my comrades had already succumbed to the madness of the desert. They began to hit one another. I kept my distance from them. A few moments later one of my comrades came walking towards me, hopping around in a manner which did not seem all that hostile.\n\nFInally, the barricades keeping us locked in the stone ruins fell down and we all ascended down into the desert. The other officer which did not seem hostile was keen on following me but kept silent.\n\nWe wandered the bare and empty desert and in the distance we saw one of our comrades get mauled down by a snake. This was truly a savage place. In the distance we noticed an abandoned village. We decided to scout it for food and water as we were growing thirsty and hungry.\n\nThe loud buzzing of a drone filled our surroundings and we noticed a small device with red lights fly past us. Could someone be filming this entire process? Were we merely here for someone's amusement? A few moments later I had discovered a knife. I turned around and beheld my comrade's spine break as his body twisted forwards to grab a vase. He came towards me in a threatening manner.\n\nI had no choice but to cut him down. As his body fell down his neck extended and his limbs began to move in an inhuman manner. I fell down on my knees, madness had infested this place. I heard the footsteps of some of my other silent comrades behind me and I was punched down on the ground, the two silently beat me to death with their fists.\n\nThey were Down To One.\n\nhttps://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/12473611_10206943817212505_4305050842061084916_o.jpg","January 9","true","0.7"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","56","43","77","46","0"

You need eat, drink and kill to win.\nI’ll start by saying that this game IS a survival game yes, and yes it IS in early access. I know a lot of people no longer trust the words “early access” and “survival game” when they are put together. But I must admit that this game is good and is only getting better.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is good. Getting a kill is really satisfying and is also quite challenging. It really is hard to get the perfect kill and that’s what makes it exiting since some firefights can take a long time and positioning and patients plays a huge part in winning those firefights. Since its early access do expect a LOT of glitches and so on. Although a lot of them don’t really affect you badly and mostly just funny to look at.\n\nGraphics\nIt is a nice looking game. The guns look unique and so does the map to an extent. I am not really a fan of fancy graphics and I don’t really care about them to be honest but I must admit that the game does look sweet.\n\nThe Map/Environment\nSince it’s a battle royal you want to make sure the map is interesting with plenty of different key locations. This game does deliver that with quite a few awesome locations like a US military base that spawns the best guns and you also have small villages that spawn lower quality gear but are easier to get to.  The map is also the right size with games not going on for too long. I do hope in the future to see more maps in the game that will be as good as the current one.\n\nCommunity\nThe community is very small. That is the biggest drawback of this game.  Games have to be organized because of this at certain times each day. But I must say what community this game does have is a really nice one. The dev is really active listening to what people has to say and also hosts a weekly cup each Friday which is a lot of fun to take part of.\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun but I only recommend buying it if you are truly ready to support the dev on a very long road and ready to take part in the community to help make this game even better, as it has the potential to do much more and it is already doing a lot as I write this!","May 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I played for almost two hours and it runs smoothly, the animations suck, but are funny as hell for a few minutes. The gun play needs work, but it's a start. The devs for this game are good, they update this game often, they just released this game too early. The gameplay concept is good, but the flow is murdered by the wait times between games. There is a glitch at the moment to bypass the number of players needed to start a match, and the devs said they would leave it in until population ( hopefuly ) increases. So basicly, not worth the buy now, but if you buy the game, you're fixing it's main problem of having very few people playing, which I, the devs, and the rest of the people playing would like very much.\n\nBannana/10 would fall off a cliff and die again.","February 4, 2015","true","3.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

This is essentially a battle royale standalone.

Looking through the cabinets is also a bit strange especially when you look down, it has this odd view to it.\n\nI managed to play one game so far, as there are very few players at the time, it is very difficult to get into a match.

Anyway to survive, but beware of your hunger and thirst as well as the poison filled snakes.\n\nCons:\n- Not well known, so hard to find a game to get it started. There are groups so people are informed.\n- Its EA, there will and is bugs.\n- People dont like to wait to gather more people to start.\n\nPros:\n- The current community is really nice, and will usually answer questions.\n- The map in the current state has quiet a large radius with a few different major areas, with a mix of smaller areas.\n- There are updates all the time\n- The dev(s) listen and constantly balance and update, as well as create tournament.\n\nin the end, regardless of the current state I would recommend this game to others, we need to get this game known so people can enjoy it.

Anyway to survive, but beware of your hunger and thirst as well as the poison filled snakes.\n\nCons:\n- Not well known, so hard to find a game to get it started. There are groups so people are informed.\n- Its EA, there will and is bugs.\n- People dont like to wait to gather more people to start.\n\nPros:\n- The current community is really nice, and will usually answer questions.\n- The map in the current state has quiet a large radius with a few different major areas, with a mix of smaller areas.\n- There are updates all the time\n- The dev(s) listen and constantly balance and update, as well as create tournament.\n\nin the end, regardless of the current state I would recommend this game to others, we need to get this game known so people can enjoy it.

This is something, and not in a good way.  This review is for the current stage of the game, and this game has a lot of potential, but currently it's uh...not too great.  This is one of those games you would find as an xbox 360 Indie game.\n\nPros:\nHas the nice battle royale trope\nHas perks and customization (could be improved upon)\nGun fire is ok (but can use some fixing)\nConstant updates\n\nCons:\nVery glitchy (Bethesda X10)\n-The whole ground on the map has no floor textures (glitch)\n-You clip through objects\n-Controls are wonky\n-Textures are glitched\nPoor optimization\nHigh price ($15 is a lot, especially for this; the current sale price seems about right, $0.59)\nHigh ping for servers (not me, the servers themselves)\nNot many players\nBland environment (and only one map)\n+many many more\n\nI just can't recommend this game at it's current stage.  The current game stage it should be in is pre-alpha, and shouldn't have been released yet.  There are many Beta games out there that are wayyyy less glitchy, and even Bethesda games have less glitches then this, that's pretty bad.  Only buy this if you want to have some laughs with friends, and when it's on sale for less then a dollar.\n","January 2","false","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Maybe this game is worth 1 USD.\n\nOnce you enter the game you will be greeted by an increadibly irritating sound effect that plays when scrolling-over or selecting something (great first impression). The next thing you will notice is the small  amount of servers and maps. In fact, there is only one map in this game, it includes 20 square miles of desert and 3 buildings. Good luck finding one of the 3 servers in america having the minimum amount of six players on it to start. if you do, you will run around  for 15 minutes looking at clunky animations and hilarious amounts of boring landscape. Spectator mode is one of the worst parts of this game. Not only will you be spending most of your time in it, but the glitchiness of it is incredible. Headache inducing animations and shaking. Like I said at the start, you can download and experience this game with almost no physical expense. But I believe it is an incredible waste of time. Just play TF2 ;)","January 20","false","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.\nFor the cake:\nAdd flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.\nAdd milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute to add air to the batter.\nDistribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.\nRemove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.\nFrost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.\nNOTES\nThe cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water.

But instead of showing potential through ideas and development roadmaps, this game shows you potential through polish. You can phase through some walls. Some ladders are broken. Animations are janky. The game isn't quite as well optimized or as good looking as it could be (even though all the claims that this game runs terribly and crashes constantly are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), but even through all that, the developer is doing his best to make a faithful recreation of Battle Royale for the price of one copy of Bad Rats. Even though the game reeks of "this should still be in early access," the game also oozes care from the developer. Animations for picking up items, opening doors and drawers, a complex and interesting perk tree, an interesting implementation of the ELO ranking system, perks that stay between playthroughs, rewards for surviving as well as rewards for winning, and many, MANY other good design decisions that show: This isn't some hack job, this is something different. This dev wants his game to be great, and he's working at it. Want to invest in this game's future? Buy it. Want to wait and see what it becomes? Go ahead, I assure you this game'll be worth the wait.

And though I haven't played other games from the genre, I don't think it stands out much from others in its genre.\n\nPositives:\n+Extremely cheap to buy (59 cents at the time I bought it and am writing this)\n+Perk System\n\nNegatives:\n- I'm pretty sure there's nothing here you haven't seen in another game of the genre\n- Graphics aren't good (and are glitchy)\n- Not optimized well, not at all (I have a 970 graphics card, but can't get anywhere near stable framerate past low settings. Even on low, it feels staggered)\n- Glitchy as can be (Climbing a ladder will likely have you INSIDE the ladder, and you won't automatically get off the ladder until you're a few feet above it. There are a few other annoying glitches, but I'd rather keep this short)\n- Less than good weapon spawns. You likely won't find a weapon until someone has already shot you with one they were lucky enough to find. I understand that they're supposed to be scarce, but it shouldn't take me 10 minutes just to find a little knife\n-Gameplay is rough. I haven't been able to try out a gun yet, but the rest feels like one of the lower quality mods using the Half-Life engine\n\nQuick little note: This is an EARLY early access game. It came out on early access 4 days ago, so my guess is that the dev merely wanted to rush something out so he can get funding for it.\n\nSummary: It's a case of "the quality you'd expect for the price you paid" in its current state. I have no clue how much the devs are wanting to put into it, so who knows where it'll end up in the future.  Feel free to buy it now, but wait a while before actually playing it. It's so cheap right now that you may as well pick it up just in case the devs manage to improve it majorly.","January 11","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

On the plus side the developer has been releasing updates to the game on a regular basis, but has made no attempt to change the game mechanics which are really really stiff.  The other issue I am having is I have yet to play a single match in this game. Every time I login to the game and join a server there is literally no one in there with me. Not once have I come across another player and I have made myself ready when in the match. The concept for the game is really a cool idea but the game is not executed very well at least not yet. I do understand that this game is in Alpha and will change my review accordingly if further development and changes are made. I really want to like this game and am happy that I bought it on sale. I really do not believe in its current stage that this game is worth the full price to play. Again over time my opinions my change but for right now I have to give it the thumbs down.","March 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

It's just poorly made. Some of the ideas aren't the best, either. Like for one, the ever decreasing playable area concpet is God awful. What if someone is just caught outside of it and trys to follow it back? You can't. I couldn't get back fast enough. I was in a building when it started closing in on me.

And though I haven't played other games from the genre, I don't think it stands out much from others in its genre.\n\nPositives:\n+Extremely cheap to buy (59 cents at the time I bought it and am writing this)\n+Perk System\n\nNegatives:\n- I'm pretty sure there's nothing here you haven't seen in another game of the genre\n- Graphics aren't good (and are glitchy)\n- Not optimized well, not at all (I have a 970 graphics card, but can't get anywhere near stable framerate past low settings. Even on low, it feels staggered)\n- Glitchy as can be (Climbing a ladder will likely have you INSIDE the ladder, and you won't automatically get off the ladder until you're a few feet above it. There are a few other annoying glitches, but I'd rather keep this short)\n- Less than good weapon spawns. You likely won't find a weapon until someone has already shot you with one they were lucky enough to find. I understand that they're supposed to be scarce, but it shouldn't take me 10 minutes just to find a little knife\n-Gameplay is rough. I haven't been able to try out a gun yet, but the rest feels like one of the lower quality mods using the Half-Life engine\n\nQuick little note: This is an EARLY early access game. It came out on early access 4 days ago, so my guess is that the dev merely wanted to rush something out so he can get funding for it.\n\nSummary: It's a case of "the quality you'd expect for the price you paid" in its current state. I have no clue how much the devs are wanting to put into it, so who knows where it'll end up in the future.  Feel free to buy it now, but wait a while before actually playing it. It's so cheap right now that you may as well pick it up just in case the devs manage to improve it majorly.","January 11","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And though I haven't played other games from the genre, I don't think it stands out much from others in its genre.\n\nPositives:\n+Extremely cheap to buy (59 cents at the time I bought it and am writing this)\n+Perk System\n\nNegatives:\n- I'm pretty sure there's nothing here you haven't seen in another game of the genre\n- Graphics aren't good (and are glitchy)\n- Not optimized well, not at all (I have a 970 graphics card, but can't get anywhere near stable framerate past low settings. Even on low, it feels staggered)\n- Glitchy as can be (Climbing a ladder will likely have you INSIDE the ladder, and you won't automatically get off the ladder until you're a few feet above it. There are a few other annoying glitches, but I'd rather keep this short)\n- Less than good weapon spawns. You likely won't find a weapon until someone has already shot you with one they were lucky enough to find. I understand that they're supposed to be scarce, but it shouldn't take me 10 minutes just to find a little knife\n-Gameplay is rough. I haven't been able to try out a gun yet, but the rest feels like one of the lower quality mods using the Half-Life engine\n\nQuick little note: This is an EARLY early access game. It came out on early access 4 days ago, so my guess is that the dev merely wanted to rush something out so he can get funding for it.\n\nSummary: It's a case of "the quality you'd expect for the price you paid" in its current state. I have no clue how much the devs are wanting to put into it, so who knows where it'll end up in the future.  Feel free to buy it now, but wait a while before actually playing it. It's so cheap right now that you may as well pick it up just in case the devs manage to improve it majorly.","January 11","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

We stumbled apon this game and we found it interesting. We looked at the reviews and they were poor, but I gave the game a chance. I thought the reviews were just people's opinion saying how this game was ♥♥♥♥. I was lagging really hard when I got into the game and when I was trying to refresh the game froze. After waiting for about 3 million lightyears the game finally refreshed the list of lobbies. All the games were in Progress but there were about 2 servers that were not in progress first. First server I tried to join it took me so long to wait while it was loading. In the end I never got into that server and I restarted the game. I tried to join the second server and then I finally got in after about 10 minutes. I was so happy to experience this awesome  game when I got in my character was shaking uncontrobally like I had a seizure. I started walking around and the graphics looked like McDonalds ♥♥♥♥ing potatoes everything was brown. I realized this game was not worth it after waiting so long to join one server . It took so ♥♥♥♥ing long that I was scared I couldn't refund this game for being in the game for more than 2 hours. Don't get this game and don't waste your time . My grandma is still in the loading screen after the last 70 years of her life trying to load the game.","January 8","false","0.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

But beware, the game is quite dead. In the 4 hours I've played, I played 4 matches.\n\nThe matches I DID play were fun, though. There is a very tense atmosphere, as the playing field gets smaller and smaller, and you know there's people who want you dead. Not only do THEY want you did, but there's currently snakes that do too, along with hunger and thirst. The game has somewhat poor performance, but I'm sure that's because my computer isn't exactly the best (High end 2009 laptop). It is also a a bit buggy. My first round was spent under the map, as I fell through it in the waiting area. I've also taken fall damage from stepping off a ladder, though I think that glitch has been fixed.\nOverall, once you get INTO a game, I'd give it an 8/10.\n\ntl'dr play it if you're prepared to wait a while for a match.","February 20, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Also, for only $0.99 this game has pretty impressive graphics for the price, good textures, and pretty descent mechanics.

Dont let the pictures fool you, this game is not worth any money at all. I can run most games on high so this game was a breeze for my computer on ultra, but even then the graphics are horrible, same as the frames. I know I havent played long but it is near impossible for you to. As soon as you start the game a poorly made menu screen will pop up, you will have to position the mouse to the left of what you want to select.  After selecting play you will wait a couple minutes while all six of the servers pop up. If you manage to find one with more than ten people then you will spawn into a laggy, poorly designed map. People only punch eachother and you cant get away from spawn because there are cliffs surrounding the spawn that kill you if yopu try to leave, on some maps it is possible to not kill yourself, but unlikely. If the servers were ever populated it would be hell trying to fit 42 players inside a area the size of a small gym during the start. This game is not worth your time. It is laggy, glitchy, poorly designed, and no matter what rig you have you cant see ♥♥♥♥ thanks to the glorious 15-20 frames this game decides to gift upon our grateful asses.","January 11","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When 15000+ own it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLEkUmmiHro\n\nGood example of why Valve needs to rethink Greenlight and Early Access and review games themselves before they even consider letting them through to the next stage.\n\nEarly Access game is Early Access game is no excuse for these games being terrible. Blind fans need to stop using it as the one stop defense to explain everything away.\n\nAs one fanboy attempting to defend the game on its Steam forums told me. $20AUD you could buy a pizza.

But right now this game is broken! Now here we have thirts, hunger alongside health so you have to go and get reasources, sounds fun right? WRONG! This game is on sale right now for less then $2. And it shows it. Bugs everywhere, you grab air, you teleport into the freakin sky and even clip through walls. Now it's up to 42 players but your lucky if you find five! Also freakin lag aswell, you thought Call of Duty lag was bad... this make that look like the best connection ever! Also in this wasteland there is no such thing as reasources! Only some sports drinks like two waters and some bags of mre's. Weapons are done well enough but the hit detection for them is nothing because of the lag, you can take an ak and because of lag unload a whole clip and it won't kill them. Now after playing this in bursts of a few minutes the game crashes and messes my pc up. What the hell is going on here?! Please someone help me out here. Are the devs drunk? Will this work eventually? Oh and the menus do not work, either they work with the cursor on them or you aim your mouse like a musket and hope it works. Now the premise is good don't get me wrong but the devs need to fix this game and fast, maybe make the map have more reasources, more maps and maybe make the maps smaller. I know this is early access, but this game reminds me of the glitchy mess of Fallout New Vegas when it first came out mixed with the glitches of Mindjack and connection issues of Arkham Origins with a dash of the looks of Alpha Protocol and here you go. Please fix this game, I want to enjoy it but I can't in this state, hurry devs, please don't waste this games potential.","September 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Out of the dozen or so times i've opened this game to see if any servers were running there was ONE time where i found a server with 6 people playing (and one or two guys were the developers)\n\nAnd once the game ends (once all players die) the server just shuts down and needs to be restarted so you have to manually refresh the server list hoping all the players will re-join that same server again for another round.\n\nThen you have to wait for 3 players to join and ready up (the chances of finding 3 other people playing this game at the same time is super rare)\n\nEven if there are people playing, the time in-game compared to time-waiting to play is like 95% waiting to 5% gaming.\n\nNot only that but its just a very mediocre quality fps","April 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's not the greatest game to ever exist, but it's not the worst either.

I've played free games 10 times worse than this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryon/recommended/334040/","veryon","V E R Y O N","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryon/","262 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA Game with lot of Potential\nI bought this game for only 51 cents. I saw the trailer and thought: "Damn, this is some triple AAA graphics, I should give a try!" And what can I say? I'm impressed. Read my review por further analysis of this game.\n\nDown To One is a survival game with a Battle Royal feeling. You start all together in one place and then you scatter around a huge map to find weapons, aid or food. After you all set up you try to eliminate the opponents. If you the only remaining, you win.\n\nGameplay\nThe ideia is good, it's just not there yet. Lot of bugs but I guess that is normal in this phase of the game. But I played worse believe me. Compared to War Z (or Infestation: Survival Stories) this game kicks ♥♥♥. There are still some major improvements to be done, polish some models and so on. There is a elo system (not sure why), perk system and some light customization. There is some things that made me exclamating: "Actually that is not a bad ideia". Two examples:\n1- When you begin the game there must be a minimum of players so you wait in a courtyard. Some people were complaining about the time that needed to reach that minimum level so the dev made a football yard! When you waiting, you can win money scoring goals so you can unlock perks later!\n2 - Cascavels that are posining and the PvE. Cascavels are a nice adition to the game and sometimes you enconter mines that blows you over.\nThere aren't many servers but they are decent. No EU server has it seems. As the game is a bit slow and if you die quickly, you can go right off to a deathmatch server which is very fast-paced and then go to a normal server again.\n\nMap\nHuge and pretty, again a lot to be polish. I hope there is going to be another maps in the future.\n\nMusic\nWrost feature in this game. Sometimes is off sync and is not paired with the gameplay music. Weapons sound realistic though.\n\nGraphics\nNot very optimized at least for my GTX 570. DirectX 11 is a nice adition and the graphics look beutiful. I haven't see any game with such clean and detailed graphics for this price. I recommend "potatoe" settings which helps you see your enemies from a far distance easily and it will make the job done. For some odd reason High settings are fine for my GTX 570 but medium settings i can't barely have 23 fps. So it still need improvements. Models are detailed and sharp.\n\nWhat I did not like\n- Some clumsy player models\n- Everytime that I fire a weapon my weapon starts to shoot to the oposite side\n- Lack of players to play. Seriously dev, boost somehow the number of players even if that means to ask PewDiePie to review this game.\n- You can see through walls\n- More bugs\n- Some server instability\n\nFinal Considerations\nA game with lot of potencial. This game is patched almost every week or so I think is going to the right way. It needs a lot of support to be considered a "Finished game" and a lot of work is to be done. Support this cause by buying it and playing it. Also report EVERY bug you find. Dev would apreciate!\n\nRating\n6/10\n\nPeace!\n","December 30, 2015","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the greatest game to ever exist, but it's not the worst either. I could really see it becoming a decent game if people would at least try it.\n\nConsider it a very cheap version of Ark SOTF or H1Z1 battle royale.\n\nFor 50 cents how could you really complain? I've played free games 10 times worse than this. The developers seem active and willing to continue even at the price it's going for, it's NOT abandoned; don't listen to the hate coming from people these days.

Steam forums are official forum. Translation: We neither had the funding to hire a web developer, nor know how to create a discussion forum for our game so we're using Steam as a free one.\n2. Has reached 1.0! Translation: This is the final product and full release. Included features are: General lack of physics, insane amount of bugs, completely broken animations, general lack of content.\n3. There are virtually no servers. Transaltion: We will pull our servers in a matter of months leaving all players unable to play the game.\n4. It cost 59 cents, and somehow didn't feel worth those 59 pennys.\n5. In order to view the contact email it brings you to the Dev's youtube page.\n6. When you declare a game to have "realistic bullet physics" it should have bullet drop and believable damage from guns. None of this seems to be in the game.\n7. This game seems to attempt to piggyback off of Player Unknown's BattleRoyale mods for ArmA II, ArmA III, and H1Z1. The idea of a stand alone BR style game enthralled me. Then I launched it. It feels poorly done and incomplete.\n\nIn summation. This game feels like a poorly executed attempt to create a unique style of survival fps done by a dev who seems to have no knowledge of how a game like this should play or feel, and with no knowledge of how to properly set up a website for a game that presumably would be only successful if able to build a community, and it comes up short in all attempts and aspects. Were one, maybe two of the things I have listed true it might simply feel like an unoptimized poorly executed game. Sadly this is not the case.\n\nIf this game was not so broken it would be amazing.\n\nHere's how to play properly.\n\nStep 1. DON'T BUY IT!\nStep 2. Buy ArmA III\nStep 3. Download Player Unknown's BattleRoyale\nStep 4. Enjoy what this game was clearly trying to accomplish.\n\nMaybe someday someone will make a standalone game of this type that doesn't suck. This is not that day, this is not that game, and whoever made this are not those people. I'd demand a refund, but honestly I could have used the 59 cents I paid for this on.... half a candy bar. So.

If you can get teleported into a small Deathmatch after a *short* amount of time whether you like it or not, then the game will be more interesting and fast paced so other don't have to wait.\n\nThe other thing is optimization. Just horrid, I went onto a server and the models gets this annoying laggy look, then the corpses morth into some kind of monster which I WILL have nightmare tonight. Movement is like Fistful of Frags, only worst. In what case do I walk backward and sideways like a turtle, try and walk backward and sideways in real life, then apply that into your game.\n\nWorld is nice, model is nice (except when they're turning into monster),\nAnimation: COMPLETELY BROKEN, your gun doesn't get put away so what you do is, you have a gun in your hand, while at the same time using the same hand, you grab a drink that gets overlapsed on the gun and chug it in. Why.\n\nGraphics is a different issue, it is okay for me personally because I don't take it that serious, the models for the map looks like it was made out of a game from 2010.\n\nI played one match. And that was it, I waited 20 minutes for those 3 minutes only to get kill by guy with a shotgun and then I waited 10 more minutes and I said:"You know what.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrapNuggets/recommended/334040/","TrapNuggets","Trap Nuggets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrapNuggets/","123 products in account","I feel like i need to write a clear honest review on this game due to all the negative and unhelpful reviews. To start with, the trailer is alot different than the actual game, and this game was 15 dollars in early access. There is no where near the amount of content in this game that it should have with a 15 dollar pricetag. But with release the game is 99 cents and on sale currently 59 cents. I would say there's enough content for 99 cents, but this game is hard to play.\n\nThe servers are alright in my opinion, theres definitly some lag spikes but what makes this game hard to play is how you move and the animations. When walking and sprinting you move at a very slow pace and your screen flickers. It's real jumpy and very awquard in how you move. The animations are horrible and often dont match up with what your currently doing. Honestly until they're fixed and look okay, i would rather have no animations at all. If you can get over these two things, then game plays OK at best.\n\nNext up, the bugs. This game has a few very annoying bugs ive noticed. Sometimes when you pick up items, they dont go to your inventory. Sometimes when you use items, they stick to your weapon after being used. I have glitched through some walls every now and then but thats all that comes to mind at the moment. Some of the smaller bugs are often hilarious like the dead bodys becoming distorted and girafe-necked.\n\nAnother thing i should mention, the servers have been pretty empty. Recently due to the huge price drop and coming out of early access, they're have been alot more players than there was before and now you actually have the chance to play this game with other people, due to the cheap price tag i encourage you to give the game a try and add to the playerbase. There isnt much you can do with 99 cents and if you downright hate it, go to steam help and request a refund.\n\nThe only reason im giving this game a thumbs up is because when you look pass all the issues, this game can be entertaining and enjoyable, i think worth the 99 cents. Also the Devs are very active with very frequent updates, i think this game definitly has potential and with the Devs as active as they are, i think they'll fix most of these bugs and the issue with movement.","January 9","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent about 3 minutes fixing the resolution, took tweaking, but it happened. Then, fumbled for another few minutes with the perks menu; with five more on the server menu. Found out you have to right click to connect, couldn't connect to anything.\n\nHere's gameplay, soon after finding a server to play on. It was a slideshow from the lag, where I clicked ready, and eagerly awaited my turn. But that's just it, there are no time limits on rounds, so I had to wait. And wait. And wait some more. Twenty minutes of watching these people fumble through the lag with poorly optimized animations, sounds and textures.\n\nWhen it was down to two people, one of them died from thirst. It was time, I was ready. Loud music played, followed by... the main menu screen. It didn't start a new game and let me play, it returned me to the lobby. So, the previous paragraph IS THE GAMEPLAY, thus far.\n\nI am certain that you have to hit ESC and click "ready", where a mass of people gather in the "dead" lobby. I didn't miss a mechanic, it's like Counter-Strike. There are no respawns or drop-ins. You wait until a fresh game is there.\n\nThe Good:\n-- 59 cents\n-- Active devs\n-- Cool name\n-- Can run on a crappy machine\n-- Decent concept\n\nThe Bad:\n-- LOL\n\nOverall, I am not refunding, I am going to wait a few patches and try again.

Steam forums are official forum. Translation: We neither had the funding to hire a web developer, nor know how to create a discussion forum for our game so we're using Steam as a free one.\n2. Has reached 1.0! Translation: This is the final product and full release. Included features are: General lack of physics, insane amount of bugs, completely broken animations, general lack of content.\n3. There are virtually no servers. Transaltion: We will pull our servers in a matter of months leaving all players unable to play the game.\n4. It cost 59 cents, and somehow didn't feel worth those 59 pennys.\n5. In order to view the contact email it brings you to the Dev's youtube page.\n6. When you declare a game to have "realistic bullet physics" it should have bullet drop and believable damage from guns. None of this seems to be in the game.\n7. This game seems to attempt to piggyback off of Player Unknown's BattleRoyale mods for ArmA II, ArmA III, and H1Z1. The idea of a stand alone BR style game enthralled me. Then I launched it. It feels poorly done and incomplete.\n\nIn summation. This game feels like a poorly executed attempt to create a unique style of survival fps done by a dev who seems to have no knowledge of how a game like this should play or feel, and with no knowledge of how to properly set up a website for a game that presumably would be only successful if able to build a community, and it comes up short in all attempts and aspects. Were one, maybe two of the things I have listed true it might simply feel like an unoptimized poorly executed game. Sadly this is not the case.\n\nIf this game was not so broken it would be amazing.\n\nHere's how to play properly.\n\nStep 1. DON'T BUY IT!\nStep 2. Buy ArmA III\nStep 3. Download Player Unknown's BattleRoyale\nStep 4. Enjoy what this game was clearly trying to accomplish.\n\nMaybe someday someone will make a standalone game of this type that doesn't suck.

But with a great dev team who is working very hard on fixing the game, it is improving, and getting an update almost every week, which is more than what we need. The game has outstanding graphics, in my opinion. Also a very realistic survival atmosphere.\n\nLet me just sum everything up, because I don't want to tackle every aspect of the game in detail and waste your time so the following main review is bascially look at the whole game and every aspect of it.\n\nThe game has lots of bugs, and that bascially ruins the neatness of the game, if it had no bugs at all, it would've been a complete 100% 10/10 survival game of its gern( I am taking into consideration every aspect you might think of, for example, the graphics, optimization, or even skill). But since the bugs are fading bit by bit, through the unwavering efforts of the Dev team, I suggest that you either wait a while until it is improved to its fullest ( which will happen in time) or you can support the devs in order to speed up the fixing of the game. The game haso nly one problem as I've mentioned multiple times, the bgus are the sole problem with the game, whether it may be in the game itself or in the server connection, whatever it is, it is the only problem with the game. Maybe the physics is a little off, more like way off, but they're working on it.\n\nIf any of the developlers are reading this, I'd like to just give you a peice of advise.\n\nYour game is great, you just need to keep up the effort long enough, and fix them buggy bugs, in order to make it great, and when it is great and fixed, don't run off with the money. Also, DO NOT read any of the negative reviews, because that will only make you feel down and feel the loss of hope towards the game, so just hang in there, keep up the good work, and in three months tops,  I guarantee that this game will have great review %age.","January 14","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game although it is version 1.0 has no optimization, the servers lag with only a few people on them. The game locks up and crashes randomly, and unless you use the join feature server option, chances of actually getting into a game are slim. If you join a game in progress and spectate till the next round a message pops up saying "round is over please join another server" and kicks you out.\n\nI like the concept of a pure battle royal game but this game is not the one to deliver it. The servers are crap the player base is small and something as simple as aiming down your scope is broken and might crash the game.

I joined a server (Which are slim to none for a game)! I then was instantly blown away by the lag. My computer is a mid-level computer that can handle most gaming usually depending on the game. I got 8 frames, but since I joined a game in progress and was forced to spectate others the entire time I wrote it off as "Im spectating them in first person maybe thats it!". Wrong, I joined a match shortly after and here's what happened: got in( lag was unbearable but did it anyhow), foundak-47 aimed and my hand went through the barrel of the gun, died to snake because I couldn't shoot cuz of the lag. 3/10 Looked good at least and had alright survival and perk system.","January 25","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you had any issue with the game, the developer would immediately help you out as he could. Any suggestion, criticism, etc, he was there to listen.\n\nThe updates were extremely frequent. At first, the focus was on content, from weapons and locations to gamemodes and mechanics, and more recently, the focus shifted towards the bugfixing.\n\nWhat is perhaps the cause of one of the big problems with this game, is the fact that when in early access, the servers never got to fill up with the serverlist often being completely deserted (people who wanted to play, logged in and upon seeing 0 online players, they naturally closed the game instead of waiting on the lobby area for someone to show up). This situation basically hid many latency/performance problems that would only become apparent on the day of release.\nIt certainly wasn't for lack of trying though as the developer motivated it as much as he could by organizing and recording weekly tournaments. But still, people (like me) would only show up for the tournaments as that was a time where we were certain that we would be able to play the game (still, they rarely went above 15 players)\n\nGame development is not easy at all. It is an extremely exausting line of work that as the added bonus of producing something potentially subjective to the worst types of criticism. I am not saying that no game is above criticism, but I can assure you that the best efforts were being made here. Whatever reason the developer had to release this game, I am sure that it was a least desired choice that had to be made.\n\nBut in the end, when people buy a game, they buy the final product, not the story behind it's conception.\n\nDown to One has been an enjoyable and competent game, but it is extremely buggy, has some game-breaking glitches and (as many report) has some severe performance issues. As difficult as it must have been to keep this game going in early access, releasing it in this state will most likely hurt this game in about a month or two as the playerbase may very well go down again.","January 7","false","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrapNuggets/recommended/334040/","TrapNuggets","Trap Nuggets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrapNuggets/","123 products in account","I feel like i need to write a clear honest review on this game due to all the negative and unhelpful reviews. To start with, the trailer is alot different than the actual game, and this game was 15 dollars in early access. There is no where near the amount of content in this game that it should have with a 15 dollar pricetag. But with release the game is 99 cents and on sale currently 59 cents. I would say there's enough content for 99 cents, but this game is hard to play.\n\nThe servers are alright in my opinion, theres definitly some lag spikes but what makes this game hard to play is how you move and the animations. When walking and sprinting you move at a very slow pace and your screen flickers. It's real jumpy and very awquard in how you move. The animations are horrible and often dont match up with what your currently doing. Honestly until they're fixed and look okay, i would rather have no animations at all. If you can get over these two things, then game plays OK at best.\n\nNext up, the bugs. This game has a few very annoying bugs ive noticed. Sometimes when you pick up items, they dont go to your inventory. Sometimes when you use items, they stick to your weapon after being used. I have glitched through some walls every now and then but thats all that comes to mind at the moment. Some of the smaller bugs are often hilarious like the dead bodys becoming distorted and girafe-necked.\n\nAnother thing i should mention, the servers have been pretty empty. Recently due to the huge price drop and coming out of early access, they're have been alot more players than there was before and now you actually have the chance to play this game with other people, due to the cheap price tag i encourage you to give the game a try and add to the playerbase. There isnt much you can do with 99 cents and if you downright hate it, go to steam help and request a refund.\n\nThe only reason im giving this game a thumbs up is because when you look pass all the issues, this game can be entertaining and enjoyable, i think worth the 99 cents. Also the Devs are very active with very frequent updates, i think this game definitly has potential and with the Devs as active as they are, i think they'll fix most of these bugs and the issue with movement.","January 9","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

H1Z1 or the Battle Royale mod for Arma 3 would be a better decision. The latter may be more expensive but at least you get more content than if you buy this game. The price barely compensates for this terrible, laggy, glitchy and unoriginal game.\n\nMaybe if the devs spent more time on the gameplay and not the first person animations they would have a better product.","January 14","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game needs work but as it stands its something pretty fun to play with your buds for a few hours.","January 20","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiplayer is pretty dead\n2. It controls like an old N64 shooter......not so much like a Goldeneye, as much as it is like the Southpark shooter.\n3. The multiplayer really makes very little sense, it tries crossing survival mode in with the Battle Royale mode, and it just isn't fun.\n4. Graphics are nothing to brag about\n5. I guess for $0.99 you could potentially get some entertainment value from this game, I couldn't, but maybe if you and a few friends get drunk, and want to waste a few hours, then maybe.\n\n\nI can't see this game being played longterm by any person with the amount of shooters out there. I just feel like I have went back in time and played PO'd or some subpar PS1/N64 era shooter that I would pull out of the discount bin and say what the hell, it's cheap....and then instantly regret everything.","January 16","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
