You're just in this to read the noninteractive story, which clocked in at just over 10 minutes for me, and is horrendously written and erratic, with an equally abrupt and nonsensical ending. The developer advertises a newly added save/load feature - for what, exactly? This is a ridiculous scam of a product, and I am thankful for Steam's refund policy.","June 1","false","0.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","4"

I was expecting something that wasn't so genuinely terrible as this perhaps? I feel like this is a cruddy source engine horror map converted to a visual novel. You can't save boring and inane writing by making it the focal point.","June 2","false","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
