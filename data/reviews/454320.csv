The basics are simple, you have a couple of modules you can use in order to move a white dot from the start to the finish, but the amount of things you can do with those simple modules is incredible, and the levels are really really well designed to make you think hard and figure out all of the possibilities.\n\nOn the design side, the game is beautiful and the sounds are really good! One complaint would be that the interface isn't adapted for horizontal screens. The game started as an iOS game and so it looks like you have an iPad in the middle of your screen. The different buttons could have been place on the sides to leave more room for the actual level, which could have taken more space on the screen. It would be nice also if the game would detect the screen orientation so it would rotate if you want to play it vertically on a Windows tablet. It'd be nice if they could add controller support also. It shouldn't be too hard and it would work great with a controller since the game is a grid with simple controls.\n\nTalking about tablets, the game works great on a touchscreen! I added the "Touch-Friendly" tag to the game, but more people need to add it for the game to be officially tagged as touch-friendly, so if you have a minute, please add the tag so this game gets more visibility for people playing on tablets!\n\nThis game is freakin' amazing. If you like puzzles that really make you think, you can't go wrong with this one!","April 12","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PoobahGorg/recommended/454320/","PoobahGorg","Poobah Gorg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PoobahGorg/","480 products in account","This is a great puzzle game. It's along the lines of Great Permutator, but with decidedly different tools/mechanics. The info presented on the screens is somewhat sparing, so it's important to remember that the fixed block with the dot inside is of course the one you're moving it from, while the fixed box without one is where you're moving it to. Sounds incredibly obvious, but my brain was in abstract mode at the time and it took me a few minutes for it to sink in.","April 28","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never seen this kind of puzzle gameplay before, at least in this form. It reminds me of cellular automata. You could do similar things in Infinifactory (move movers), but usually Infinifactory puzzles involve just moving the resource blocks, not the movers themselves.\n\nWholeheartedly recommended, especially if you're into logistics puzzlers (Infinifactory, Spacechem and such)","April 6","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, rotate and reverse polarity should be bound to hotkeys or mouse buttons; the play actions should always be visisble; pause and play should be a single toggle button.","April 2","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
