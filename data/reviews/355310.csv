In BA: R you play as Nia, a cyborg who is able to slide along as well as up walls, shoot enemies and even cut them in two with her sword. Your aim is to increase your multipliers and score as many points as possible, hopefully more than you scored last time, on one of the three levels the game features.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by Evolve PR.\n\nLet’s start with the game’s visuals, one of its stronger points. BA: R opts for a pixel art style that serves the game well, it not only fits with the idea of the game, it also looks pretty good. The UI is basic but it gets across all the information you need when playing. I may as well clump in the other positives here, the game’s audio. Both the soundtrack and sound effects in the game are good, fitting well with the game and more songs are unlocked through gaining experience points. Lastly, the dev has been pretty quick to fix any serious issues with the game, there have been several updates in the relatively short time it’s been out.\n\nBefore I move on to negatives, I’ll briefly discuss the game’s unlocks which is more of a neutral aspect. The idea of having everything but the bare minimum locked behind the player’s level is a good idea for a score attack game in my opinion. However, the lack of content I’ll go on to talk about means that these unlocks run out pretty quickly and there’s also a large gap between what I would call the more important unlocks. The first map isn’t unlocked until level seven which means you have to play the first map for at least six times before you can even play another one. It does work well for the equipment and music, since they aren’t hugely important, but I feel like the maps shouldn’t take as long to unlock or they should be unlocked from the get-go.\n\nTo kick us off with negatives we have the amount of content that the game offers. Sure, it has 63 equipment combinations (three guns, three secondary weapons and seven ‘cores’) but it only has three maps. If the game was far cheaper than it is then perhaps only having three maps would be acceptable but only three maps at £9.99? That’s just not good enough in my opinion, as has been said by others, it simply feels like a paid demo. Hell, maybe I’d even be satisfied with it if there was a high amount of replayability but there isn’t. I’ll talk more about its lack of replayability as I discuss other parts of the game but a score attack game without replayability isn’t a great prospect. I mean, even the majority of positive reviews for the game have less than one hour of play time. This lack of content is why it feels so much like an Early Access game, I feel like I’m just getting a taste for something that I’ll get more of down the line but, as far as I know, that isn’t the case.\n\nThe next big issue, controls, they’re pretty rough. I’ve played with a gamepad as well as the good old mouse and keyboard and there’s not a huge amount between them, the gamepad might be slightly better. Firstly, you have to click (or press a button) for every shot, holding the fire button/key down just charges up a more powerful attack (one that takes an incredibly long time to charge, frustrating when getting hit by an enemy resets the charge). It might not sound like a huge deal but when the game is supposed to be a fast-paced shooter having to click for each shot slows things down a fair bit when you’re trying to take out enemies, especially the smaller ones who are hard to hit.\n\nSpeaking of hard to hit, the aiming isn’t great either. You can aim in eight set directions whether you’re aiming with a mouse or a gamepad. As restrictive as this is, I can understand why you might have this for a gamepad but it just makes no sense to have it for the mouse. Having your aim not being directly linked to the movement of the mouse just feels weird, perhaps I’m just not used to it. But like I said it feels very restrictive, again something that’s not great when you’re supposed to be playing a fast-paced game. These two control issues make BA: R quite frustrating to play at times, particularly in high enemy count situations where you really need tight controls, and they’re among the reasons as to why the game doesn’t have much replayability.\n\nWhy do I keep saying it’s supposed to be fast-paced? Because it isn’t. To be fair, it is pretty fast-paced (and a little manic) when there are a lot of enemies on screen but I often found myself running around the map just to  find an enemy because they all seemed to have disappeared, completely killing the game speed. Since you have to rely on getting high multipliers to get lots of points (you even need the highest kill multiplier to be able to heal yourself by shooting down some robot thing, often on the other side of the map) these slowdowns and often complete lack of enemies really hits you. Every time I had this happen to me both of my multipliers (you have one for just killing enemies and one for your use of movements and attacks) went back to 1x as I couldn’t find any enemies quickly enough.\n\nEnemy variation is up next. It’s seriously lacking. I’ve played two of the three maps, the second replaced an enemy from the first with a new one, I’d say I’ve probably seen around nine or ten enemies and I imagine there’s probably another one introduced on the third map. The lack of variation is made worse by the fact that every enemy is an exact clone of every other enemy of that type. There’s no variation in appearance, attacks or behaviour. Really this comes back to how much content there is versus the price. Again, this lack of variation/content might be acceptable if the game was being sold at a lower price but at £9.99 it becomes another reason for me to not recommend this game.\n\nLastly, I'll briefly return to the health regen system I mentioned earlier. It's completely broken. You heal by shooting down some robot type thing from a larger robot type thing that's bear hugging it and in return you get one third of your health back, really it should be all of your health back. This health regen thing (I don't know how else to describe it) only appears when you get a kill multiplier of 10x and as soon as you lose that multiplier it disappears. This means that even if you're on very low health, you're going to have to keep your multiplier up while running to the other side of the map to get one third of your health back, chances are you don't make it. What's worse is that once you've got the health the only way for another one to spawn is for you to drop below your 10x multiplier. If you've managed to keep that multiplier on the way there then why the hell would you deliberately drop your multiplier in a score attack game?\n\nVerdict\nLet down by its lack of content, issues with controls and the feeling that it should really be an Early Access game, Bloody Alloy: Reborn simply isn’t worth your time or money. If it gets updated or it goes on sale it might be worth picking up for fans of score attack games in general or those who simply like platforming shooters.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","March 9","false","1.5"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","49","53","0","9"

I've never passed on the opportunity to play it at PAX East or BostonFIG, and now I am happy to say the final product lives up to expectations. The initial tutorial is a little rough, but once the camera pulls back and the gloves come off, the game does not disappoint. You'll be dashing, slashing, running, and gunning your way through waves of enemies, with nearly reckless abandon, all while enjoying the grooves of a killer soundtrack. It's not a game that demands a lot from you and you'll be unlocking new items, levels, and music every couple rounds.\n\nNow for the main reason why I'm posting this review: justification of cost. At $12.99, no, it's not the cheapest game ever made. It's also not the most expensive one, and I can say on good authority that the developer, Suppressive Fire, has been busting their butts for YEARS to get this game out. The results speak for themselves. It's smooth, fast, and most importantly, so far for me at least, stable. People have paid much more for games on Day 1 that can't even connect to their own servers. Blood Alloy offers a solid chunk of content with really fun gameplay for a fair price without ANY online requirements. For a game to be stable on Day 1 in 2016 shouldn't be such a shock, but it honestly is.\n\nThe game seems to be set up in such a way that if enough gamers support it, more content will follow. You may think that means waiting it out, but it's a catch 22: they can't make content unless you support it, but you don't want to support it unless they make more content. To that I say, give me a break. There's no Season Pass, there's just the game, and this is a game and a developer worth supporting. Watch this game can ramp up over time and become unstoppable. Like I said, it's a solid chunk of content built on a very solid foundation.\n\nI would say this seems like an excellent game for streaming. With rounds being (for me at least) under 5 minutes long, and a consistent reward loop, this has the makings of a great game not only for communities to enjoy, but potentially even for competitions.\n\nIf I had any feedback, it would be that the mouse is very sensitive and is currently unresponsive in the menu; the vertical dash section of the tutorial is pretty punishing; and the menu UI could use a bit more polish and some more options like max camera distance and screenshake level, but these are HARDLY killer criticisms and the kind of stuff that can be taken care of in a patch or two. The game itself is great. G-R-E-A-T great. Pick it up and support a really cool developer who's made a really cool game.","March 2","true","0.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

So there's not really much of a "game" just a clear cut reflex quick-twitch reaction tester. It really hurts to say all this because well damn is it fun to sprint around and ninja kick your way across the screen and roll through a hazard bot holding down a button to charge up your power, while sliding up a wall to fire multiple homing missles at a bunch of training bots and jumping through another obstacle. SOOOOOOO the Adrenaline is great in here man. Unfortantely it's much like a trip to the bearded clam as after they hype there just isn't anywhere fun to go with all of this excitment. There are a very limited set of enemies that behave in a very defined pattern and while the soundtrack and unlockable content is a nice touch there's just not enough incentive to keep me interested. No dynamic enemies demanding my Ninja Skills attention or story elements giving me some loose sense of direction to cling too. The Environments themselves are exactly what you see above and that's it...the whole game's backdrop has already been painted and displayed to you at the top of the Store Page.\n\nI understand this game was a failed kickstarter and that may be the reason Blood Alloy is what it is today. It seems like they did it up making a tight physics engine and put a ton of effort into a demo. Unfortunately it looks like they may have than ran out of money to make an actual game. If this is in fact what happened I'll note this as the first time I've actually regretted not donating money to help this thing happen. This is a shell fo a game that is going to be great it's just that now it doesn't look like it will ever get going.\n\nReally though this game ENGINE is superb and if it were sitting inside of an audi or bmw frame this would be a must have...instead it's just jammed inside of an old-school VW Van and I'm too old for cross country road trips. This game was an amazing start maybe someone else will grab the baton and run with it. Here's hoping....\n\nNo idea how to rate this really. I enjoyed it for exactly 20 Minutes and realized where the title was going (nowhere) and was bored stupid after another 20.....but that ninja, slash, dash, sword thrust hijanx though....\n\n4/10???\n\n\n","March 8","false","0.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","2"

I have only played 20 minutes of the game thus far but I already feel like i've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nBlood Alloys combat and movement is it's biggest strength. Movement is very fluid in it's simplest state. You then also have the abilities of dashing and double jumping which make moving around the map and avoiding enemies very enjoyable. Combat involves use of the mouse to aim and shoot enemies. You also have a jump dash ability to attack enemies. These movements and combat made a very enjoyable survival experience.\n\nEnemy variety is very good as well. They increase in difficulty to kill as you progress. It turns into a kinda bullet hell type game later as a lot of enemies and they fire in different patterns. Enemies are very enjoyable to kill and require some skill to avoid there fire while also attacking them.\n\nAesthetically the graphics are rather pleasing. It presents it's self in a nice looking fashion that isn't too complex graphics but is still satisfying to look at. Animations are very nice looking too. The soundtrack goes along great with the gameplay.\n\nBlood Alloy is a survival game at it's heart. No real levels exist aside from different asthetics and slightly different layouts. So really it's a score attack game to see if you can survive as long as possible. This I would be happy with, but there is a huge problem. There is no real motivation to get a higher score. No unlocks exist as far as I can tell from my current progress. They also don't have an online leaderboard system. The game doesn't even have achievements. It feels like they rushed the release and felt this was a low priority to add. However a score attack game is not fun unless you have a reason to get a higher score.\n\nI really did enjoy my short time playing blood alloy. However it has very little reason to replay it. Therefore 20 minutes is as much enjoyable time I got out of it. So until there is some kind of reason for me to play more of it but into the game i'm afraid I cannot recommend you to purchase this.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free review key to write this review.","March 12","false","0.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/355310/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","When Blood Ally: Reborn first appeared in my sights I kind of thought it was a game in the vein of Contra. What Blood Alloy: Reborn actually is, is a 2D score attack twin stick shooter set in one of 3 arenas that sees you last as long as you can against waves of every increasingly difficult and numerous enemies.\n\nThe game has a strong 16-bit visual style and looks good unfortunately I am not a great fan of the camera which rather than centre around the character like most games in this genre seems to always be playing catch up and as such you are forever not able to see things off screen that you really should be able to. Equally this camera catch up actually made me feel a little motion sick at times which is incredibly rare for a 2D game but the developers have stated this is something they are going to be fixing.\n\nAs you play the game you gain levels which allow you to unlock new levels and gear. There are a lot of different gear options in the game which mix things up but sadly there are only 3 levels and while the levels are different they are simply just themed and relatively small 2D arenas that have the odd bizarre invisible wall.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is simply cost to amount ration at £9.99 (or your regional  equivalent) the game is a fairly mid-priced indie game but what is on offer sadly feels like either a demo of a much larger game or a score attack mode added onto a game with a fleshed out campaign. I spent my first few playthroughs trying to work out how to access more of the first stage only to be disappointed when I eventually realised I could not. Sadly you can travel the entire distance of the first map in a matter of seconds.\n\nGameplay wise it is a mixed bag. The controls are very twitchy and are a struggle to get to grips with. I played the game with both a 360 controller and a mouse and keyboard and whilst a mouse and keyboard was better neither were perfect.\n\nYour normally gun does very little damage but enemies require a lot of hits to kill. Annoyingly you must press fire for every bullet which is a very odd choice. Holding down the fire button charges up a charge shot but this takes far too long to charge and is reset when you are hit. Equally the fact you are trying to kill things quickly to keep your multiplier up makes the charge attack almost unusable.  There is also a flippy melee attack that reminded me of Raiden out of Metal Gear Rising which you quickly realise is the most powerful attack in the game but sadly using this against anything but the most basic enemies leads to you getting hit in the process. Health is only recovered by reaching a 10x multiplier and then shooting down a robot thing (whilst maintaining the multiplier) but even then you only get 1/3 back and this is a tall order when you have barely any health left, you are unable to use your best weapon. And you multiplier drops every time you sit and try and use the charge attack. The final kick in the teeth is if you manage to finally get some of this health back the only way you can get more is to lose your multiplier and get back to 10x which is totally stupid and against the whole point of the game for a score attack game.\n\nThe game does however sound lovely with the official soundtrack also being on sale next to the game. For a small indie game with a lack of content you can’t help but think maybe that OST should have been included with the main game.\nThe game has a lot of promise and if this was an early access title I would be invested to keep an eye on its progress but as it stand it isn’t. At its best the game feels like an early access title and at its worse feels like a score attack mode inside a much bigger game.\n\nOverall I could see some people would get something out of this. If this is on sale and you like score attack games then it is probably worth a go but for the majority of people there are much better games to spend £10 on.\n\nA COPY OF THIS GAME WAS PROVIDED BY EVOLVE PR FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVIEW. MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS ARE HOWEVER 100% MY OWN.\n\nThis review was originally published on www.thegametutor.co.uk\n\nIf you found this review helpful join our curator page here:  Curator Page\n\n\n","March 20","false","11.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/355310/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Blood Alloy desperately wants to be a Metroidvania game crossed with a twin stick shooter, the truth is it struggles to do ether well. You’re put in the role of a cyborg ninja style character that can fly around the screen taking out enemies and looking flashy as you do it.\nUnfortunately this doesn’t cover the gaping holes in its control scheme and this is where the game really falls apart. When played with mouse and keyboard the game is a mess and makes some really odd choices like having two jump keys but on controller things become a little easier. Even then though the choice to make the shoot button something you have to press repeatedly instead of the traditional hold to fire that’s been tried and tested just serves to frustrate even more than is necessary.\nThese aren’t the only issue I find with the controls ether, much of the time these controls seem to focus on style rather than substance. The character has a dodge that takes you so far across the screen chances are you’ll avoid one enemy only to land on another. Your sword attack can be done in any direction, but its hit and miss if the game will pay any attention to the direction you’re pressing. I could go on, but I’m sure you get the idea. There are even issues with level design too, sometimes you can shoot through platforms and more an inch to the left and suddenly you can’t. There’s no consistency with the game.\nOn top of all this there’s no guidance on what you’re even doing, you wonder round shooting things until an onscreen marker shows up and you go kill what its pointing too and you’re on your own again until it decides to show up again. I don’t know if you have to kill X amount of these to progress or if the game is just score attack as it doesn’t tell me. You get a brief glimpse at a plot when completing training mode, but nothing to give you any idea of what the hell is going on. The game shows me an upgrades menu, but gives me no idea of how to unlock them and this story continues. . .\nThe Steam reviews so far show a very different story than mine, it seems to be really well received. Maybe if you persist with the game thing improve, maybe it becomes clearer but I have little to no incentive to do so as the game gives me no hint of this and I’m not inclined to continue in some blind hope. This isn’t an early access game, I have no reason to suggest it might improve or get better. Maybe this game just isn’t for me, or maybe everyone else is wrong. I don’t know but I do know I don’t recommend it.\n","March 9","false","0.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You have a lot of abilities though using these things. If you just your boost along a floor you will gain a quick charge which if launches fires a barrage of missles that target and destroy most enemies. You can also use the sword to fire an energy wave that has a great spread for massive damage. You can use your gun to fire pojectiles out the air so it can be defensive as well as offensive.\nThis is one of those games that is just a joy to play, its fast paced and full of energy.

However one should not be quick to dismiss it as an attempt to tap into a gamers nostalgia. The gameplay combines the style of a run & gun with that of the hack & slash genre while adding elements of an RPG. Players earn XP by fighting-off waves of robots with their blaster or blade while performing special stunts.\n\nThe gameplay may be old school but it’s the artistic design along with the musical score that makes Blood Alloy: Reborn a unique title. The musical score is an all too familiar tune that reminds gamers of cyberpunk classics like Blade Runner and Akira.\n\nOverall, Blood Alloy: Reborn is an example of why indie games have become so popular in the last few years. Suppressive Fire Games created something unique using a familiar setting while focused on the artistic tone.","April 16","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I should really stress that Blood Alloy is NOT an easy game. You might find yourself getting frustrated at first, but stick with it! After a few hours with the well-tuned controls you'll be comboing like a cyborg god.\n\nGreat music and overall a lot of fun!","March 5","true","23.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The fast-paced movement feels incredibly tight and the combat has plenty of depth, making you fight for every single point you earn. This game will demand a lot from you, but will reward you handsomely for your efforts.","March 6","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was pretty impossibly bad when I started, and after playing a few times I am already getting a better feel for how to use my abilities and combine techniques to avoid damage fire from better angles.  It's super fun just blasting your character up a wall and around corners while fighting off robot hordes!  The levelling up system to unlock equipment is also nice, so even if my score wasn't better than last time, I still am getting somewhere.  I'm excited to try out some of the other equipment as soon as I actually get a handle on the current stuff!","March 3","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The camera whips around a bit too much and the controls could use some polishing up, but overall this is a pretty damn good action game. If the camera was centered on the character so you could see what was going on better and the aim snapped to enemies so you could pop them off one after another then it would be pretty much perfect.","March 4","true","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even if it had no score nor leaderboard, I'd definitely still play it for the satisfying combat. One of the few games (along with Risk of Rain, Hotline Miami and the likes) that actually make me feel super proud that I'm getting better at playing them over time. Progress is not only about unlocking new toys to play with. It can also be about finding new fun and new ways to play with whatever toys you already have.","March 12","true","16.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You hold as long as you can while making the highest score and reaching some "achievement" like not firing for 2min or dodge an attack, etc.\n\nThe levels are not that big while not being small either but give you enough space to move around.\n\nI won't lie, it takes a little while to get use to the character's special moves and the entire energy system, dash, homing, and so on... (don't expect to make those cool fast move seen in the video just right off the batch, you'll need a little training even if they're pretty easy to execute in the end)\nDon't expect either high score from the start, you'll die pretty quickly but it doesn't really matter as there aren't any progression as in a regular platformer but instead an exp. system which unlock stuff at each level (including song to play during a level because yes, you can chose it later on)\n\nWhat I would definitely recommend to get this game for is the soundtrack, if you like what you hear in the video, jump on it ! Getting this game without buying the soundtrack makes little sense :P\n\nIn the end, a really nice coffee break type of game in which you can sink in for 5 or 30min or longer if you're absorbed by the game =)\n\nI barely started yes but the mechanics really hooked me and I'm still getting used to it.\n\nOn the down side:\n-No real level progression, it's a survival arena only\n-No story whatsoever, it's all about score streak and ranking.\n-No mouse in the menu (it's a bit weird)\n-Few options in game (no difficulty settings, time of survival defines the difficulty, no control remap in game, no graphic settings... All done through the launcher which isn't necessarily a bad thing but a bit annoying)\n-A work in progress type of tutorial\n-No coop or VS (online or splitscreen) :( could have given much to the game IMHO\n-Only one character, no choice even she's enough by herself\n\nUp sides:\n-Really cool idea\n-No frustration to have to play hours upon hours, satisfying as a coffee break\n-Cool exp. system which rewards the player\n-Survival with difficulty progression\n-Cool move set, easy to learn and hard to master\n-Music, Music and again Music ! Entertaining while playing and sticking with the sci-fi theme\n-Graphic style, you like the pixel art or you don't... I did and place it as a strong point\n-Score ! While not being a fan of score games, I was hooked to the system and wanted to beat myself on the next try :)\n-Size of level\n-Level design full of obstacles to jump, run, and slide on !","March 8","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
