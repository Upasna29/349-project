Just as soon as I stop dying.\n\nLamia Must Die is a game of adventure wherein you are not just one person but rather four people. You can change two of your party members and their styles are definitely unique. You adventure into a dungeon and skip all the trash tier monsters completely. The only game play is a big epic boss battle.\n\nGraphics and Art\n\nThe graphics are not that good, but it's excuseable. This game runs mainly on artwork and pictures anyway and it's played through various GUI's, which all look and feel rather fluid and work well. The artwork itself is rather nice and sometimes kind of mediocre, though certainly better than I could care to draw. I'm not completely convinced that some of the pictures of the characters drawn were drawn by the creators of the game or anyone they hired. I don't think they were commissions and rather just something free. If they were drawn by the creators then I ask why there is no consistency in the art work. Some of it looks great while others look like it was drawn by a complete ametuer who had way too much interest in ♥♥♥♥. I of course refer primarily to Lamia.\n\nStory and Characters\n\nThe story is pretty alright. I give it a 6/10. Basically, there is a snake-lady (Naga?) monster attacking the village and eating their children. Many people have tried to slay this foul, big ♥♥♥♥♥♥d beast but all of the soldiers were eaten. They probably couldn't tear their eyes away from her ♥♥♥♥. So now you and your vagabond party of adventurers/heroes/whatever-the-f*cks embark on a perilous journey to which you get little to no part in as far as interaction goes to venture into Lamia's cave and slay the bodacious reptilian babe. A bit sexist, if you ask me. No one's asking me so now we continue. It gives a campfire scene and talks about what they're going to do and how they're going to get to Lamia. This kind of bugs me because "You" say that it's not as easy as just getting to the big bad monster, but it skips any gameplay that could have happened anyway. You're treated to a dialogue between yourself(s) and Lamia to which you learn a little more about her and then combat is engaged in. Overall, it's a fairly "meh" storyline.\n\nWhat I do like is the characters. They all have their reasons for being there, whether that be royal responsibility or just straight up revenge. They have different personalities and lives, as you would be able to see if you beat the game. The outro for each character is different depending on if they died or not. Try and find them all! I found myself at least a little bit drawn into their characters and those characters' lives, despite how little I'm told about them and how little exposure I get.\n\nSound and Music\n\nThe sounds are what you'd expect from a game like this. For the most part, generic. Though they are satisfying to some extent. You've likely heard most of the sound effects before. Something nice is that they voiced the character's themselves. My favourite is the Male Paladin, as he does the best job. I also quite enjoyed the narrator's voice and I'd encourage them to dub anime or something as they have fantastic voices. Unfortunately, most of the women don't seem to be so gifted and they seem to be trying a bit too hard to sound Fantasy-esque and it just doesn't end up working for them, though I wouldn't say they're terrible. Just average at best.\n\nThe music, while I'm unsure if it's stock music or composed music, was fitting to the theme and sounded good. I didn't find myself getting bored of it at all. That being said I've only played about an hour and a half so far.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay consists of nothing other than a big, epic boss battle. I use the word epic and I mean it. It's challenging - hard as my ♥♥♥♥, in fact - and leaves you seething just enough to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Lamia for kicking your ♥♥♥ time and time again but not enough to make you rage quit. In fact, I found myself being driven to win. You have to manage many things at once. I recommend starting out playing the "Turn" based mode before trying the "holy♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥twtf" mode.\n\ncough cough Oh, sorry! I meant "Active" mode. In active mode you have to know what you're doing, how to do it, and when to do it and you have to do it fast! If you don't you're simply a sitting duck until you make up your mind. So plot out a strategy in turn based mode and then try it out in Active mode after that. If it fails miserably, don't do it again. Simple concept, difficult execution.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the gameplay I still have no idea what half the spells, specials, and items even do exactly or what some status effects mean. What would have been nice is some sort of brief tutorial or a manual menu to look this ♥♥♥♥ up. Sometimes it's fun to figure out what something does, but sometimes you can't. Cut out the middle man and just let us know. I look forward to some kind of update regarding this though I don't expect one since the game is completely free.\n\nIt's relatively short, depending on your skill at this sort of thing plus your reaction time and how fast you win. I can see myself giving this at least a few more hours of play time and when you get the game completely free with no catches, hooks, or microtransactions - not to mention the game takes all of 2 minutes, tops, to download - why not give it a shot?\n\nIt's a good bit of fun and overall I give this game a solid 80/100 with all things considered.","August 28, 2015","true","1.5"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","33","43","12","0"

Some setup, some voiced dialogue (Charming amateur work.), some nice art, and one boss fight. It's all quite easy.\n\nJust turn off active time battle. You don't know these characters so you'll have to check their skills.\n\nYou can change two party members, so you might want to replay to see what different plot there is.\n\nStill, the whole thing is incredibly trivial. A lot of effort went into the art, voice work, etc, and everything is certainly workmanlike, but there's nothing all that interesting here. Fun enough for a freebie though.\n\nIn reflection, though, I think that is actually something profound. Look how rare it is for a game to have the monster ACTUALLY BE A MONSTER that must die. How rare it is for the heroes to actually save the day from a monster. There's no twist where you were the monster all along. No stupid navel gazing about two so gray so grimdark factions and having to pick blah blah.\n\nWhen you get down to that, a game that promises heroes slaying a monster and saving the day and delivers exactly that... that is kinda rare these days, isn't it?","September 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","15","22","4","0"

But you're at a significant disadvantage from the start by not knowing the characters and skills. After a few tries though the battle is pretty straight forward. It took me 3 tries to beat Lamia and I have to admit I was a little disappointed that she didn't have multiple forms.\n\nSome cons: I hate the button input sequences for the spells; I was using a controller and had to keep switching back and forth between that and my keyboard. It's also pretty devestating when you miss a input and waste your turn. I also experienced a significant amount of slow down even with the lower resolution. I have a pretty powerful setup so I know that wasn't what the problem is. My last nitpick is that I wish the meters and status effects for the characters where displayed more clearly and the turn reticle/circle thing was bigger.\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you're an old school rpg veteran, I mean you have nothing to lose (except time I guess) because it's free. I hope there's a sequel.","August 27, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

While I beat it on my first try, I'm sure others will try once or twice depending on how you go about the battle.\n\nI understand that this was originally a standalone game, so I can see why you'd want to focus mostly on the boss battle itself. The battle system itself was definitely the star of the game, seeing as how it was more active than turn-based, which required more strategy and quick-thinking on the players' part. I did like the fact that you could choose different party members, for a different type of experience and ending depending on who you chose.\n\nThe voice acting, while it was nice, did feel a bit hammy and even forced on some lines.

You must assemble your team and then face down with her. That's all Lamia Must die is - cutscenes and her boss fight. Considering it's free, that's plenty for me.\n\nAfter you choose your team from a couple options for your Paladin and ranged damage, you're given some brief cutscenes. After those you're thrust into the battle with the Lamia. She's not easy and will require quite a bit of strategy to actually take down. I definitely enjoyed how much she made me think, and how much I struggled to make it through even on Wait mode. The ending with all four heroes surviving was worth the struggle at least.\n\nDon't go into Lamia Must Die expecting some award winning story. Do expect a boss fight that will keep you on your toes and thinking to figure out the best strategies. I do wish that there was an option to enter the menu at some point to adjust settings other than at the very beginning after you choose new game, but ah well.

Yeah it looks like every other game on the engine, but voice acing for the main characters was something I never expected. There's only one problem, when I defeated Lamia in the beginning, My character wasn't visible and I coud not progress. Pleeeeeaaaaase fix this, I really think this game has awesome potential.","August 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcgamingmasterrace/recommended/385260/","pcgamingmasterrace","SquallLeonhart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pcgamingmasterrace/","51 products in account","Would I recommend this game? No, I wouldn't, but that isn't because it's bad, it's because it's flawed, which you may see as the same thing, but I believe they're different. A bad game is a game with enough mistakes made to make one not want to play it at all. A flawed game is one that has mistakes, but small mistakes that are few. I think this is the latter.\n\nSo, the first flaw in this game, and probably the first you'll experience, would be the voice acting. Although you can turn it off from the options at the start, I played with it on, simply to see just what it's like. It was... Interesting. For those of you that have played Castlevania: SotN, you would know of the semi-cheesy lines between Richter (I think that's his first name) Belmont and Dracula. The voice acting in the game is a bit like that, just without the awesome gothic feel and the emotion. (And in my opinion, this is a little worse than said voice acting.)\n\nThe second I came across was the lack of character depth, as well as the general script. It's just TOO cheesy. Everyone's seen the Vengeful Vigilante stereotype before, and the female protagonist I used OOZED Righteous Warrior. *COUGHCOUGHRichterBelmontCOUGH* Not to mention, the origin of this group isn't told, or at least from up to where I got, which leads into my next point:\n\nThis feels like a tech demo. There's really no depth to the combat system, just another Final Fantasy style RPG. Also, why on Earth would you start us off at the END of their journey? That's like driving to the top of a mountain and walking down; unless you're doing that for some sort of activity, it's pointless and will only hinder you, the same as dropping people off at the end of the story and telling them to walk from there only works if you're doing something special with that.\n\nAlthough I just listed a bunch of flaws in this game, it's actually not THAT bad. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to RPGs, so I may be being a little harsh, but even so, I can still recognise this game's potential, or at least, the potential of the developer. Iron out a few little kinks and you'll be well on your way with this.","August 31, 2015","false","0.4"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","17","35","3","3"

Instantly after getting into the fight all of your characters get their health lowered by 33%, about a quarter of the way into the fight the boss spawns two minions that require more than five turns to defeat each. You are turning a majority of your audience away if you are instantly going to throw them into something like this...\n\nNow let me get into the bugs that I have experienced. Immediately after starting the game I readjusted the resolution, and turned off the voice acting because that is not my cup of tea. Around two dialogue boxes are still voiced for some odd reason along with the characters voices in-fight as well. I restarted the game then went back into the fight, the game not being the resolution I had selected before, every image was resized to what I believe to be the previous resolution image size. I couldn't see Lamia and all of the characters were large and half not on the screen. Also, there is a cinematic scene in the beginning of what looks to be a plane of grass, the thing is that when you go into a larger resolution the image is not large enough and begins repeating on both top and bottom of the game.","September 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

I mean the boss fight itself wasn't very balanced.  Once I had Eric attack he dealt 1200 damage with a boost from the Priest. None of the other heros could deal more then 200 with the same boost. After I realized this I just had them heal with potions or the priests magic while I make the paladin murder the Lamia and then the thralls. After I got the ending where they all go off on an adventure we will never see I decided to do it this time but with everyone but the paladin dying.\n\nIt was kinda funny how the paladin didn't even show up to mourn any of the dead people, simply just going of on his adventure of saving the world, not even mentioning how they died.\n\nAlso no alternate ending where you can save the lamia, even if its a bit cliche.\n\nVoice acting was a nice touch I guess, but the boss fight was lame mate, and in the end only the paladin dealt any real damage, regardless of who I choose for the 4th fighter. Hell I would had even taken a second or final form boss fight or something.\n\nBut I did dabble a bit with RPG Maker myself and I know how annoying it is to set up the fights to be balanced.

I like the concept: Skipping the typical RPG grind and going straight to the endgame with all of your items and powers in tow.  The game gives enough of a narrative prior to the battle to at least become interested in the overall story.\n\nWhere I find fault with the game is with the presentation.  I have two main gripes.  First, the UI elements at the bottom which represent your party are far too small to suit me.  I found it a little hard to tell exactly what my party's status was at times as it was also hard to determine what, if any, status effects they were suffering.  This didn't become an issue until later in the fight because I found a protection spell and cast it early, but it made managing party health a little more troublesome than it should have been.  Likewise, I couldn't tell if status effects I tried to cast on Lamia were working; I'm not sure if the text/graphics were too small or if they may have been covered by her health bar.  I kind of just had to go with it.\n\nControl schemes are the other big issue.  The game seems to demand that you play with the keyboard.  I may have just not known how to find the option, but I was unable to either view or reconfigure the controller inputs for my game pad (this is another game where keyboard-to-controller profiling software may come in handy).  While you can play with a controller, the inputs for additional spell effects cannot be effectively completed since the game displays the keyboard input it expects without translating it to a controller.  This meant that I could not complete these sequences, costing me additional damage and artificially extending the battle.\n\nNone of this necessarily means the game isn't fun to play, but it shows a lack of polish.  The concept itself is sound, and the actual battle is interesting.  A nice touch is that you can choose from either a standard JRPG turn-based battle system, or a form of Active-Time Battle like you might see in a Final Fantasy title.  You also get a respectably long ending sequence after the battle is won.  It took me just under half an hour for a complete, first-time playthrough, and I managed a completely deathless playthrough as well (meaning that I not only didn't lose my party, I never lost a fighter in battle).  RPG veterans shouldn't have trouble navigating the battle; if you're a newcomer, it's not unreasonable to fail a few times, but this is actually a good beginner's RPG to get used to the ideas of resource management, status protection, and healing.\n\nSo the answer is yes, I recommend this game, moreso because it is a free game.  Despite issues with the presentation and controls, it's still relatively fun for the half hour it lasts.  I believe that a future update can eliminate the issues it still has.  I hope that the developers learn from this and put together something similar that's a little more refined in the future, because I think this type of concept has legs.  I think it's a respectable first attempt for what it is trying to accomplish.\n\n6.0 out of 10","January 10","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is rushed in the beginning to get to the touted battle with Lamia and it leads to you learning the characters and the battle system simultaneously.  The game is also partially optimized for each resolution option instead of being fully optimized for any of them.  The opening looks fine on a lower resolution, but the background and character pictures don't fit correctly into the larger ones.  The battle is only fully viewable on a higher resolution, though.  Also, the full sized character models don't really match the partial ones and some of the full sized models are somewhat grotesque.\n\nOne positive is the character selection in the beginning.  The story reaches where the main character arrives and when you choose between Janet and Eric it describes their benefits and drawbacks as part of the story.

Once I get farther, I will probably be editing this review.\n\nThe story is beautiful, amazing. And I haven't even gotten past the first fight. Why? The gameplay is genuinly hard. Not for the faint of heart. It seems to be turned based, but not traditional turn based, so it's a bit awkward to fight in. My only complaint is that there is no in-game tutorial, at least that I noticed.\n\n8/10. Probably would be a 10/10 with a tutorial.","January 13","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is rushed in the beginning to get to the touted battle with Lamia and it leads to you learning the characters and the battle system simultaneously.  The game is also partially optimized for each resolution option instead of being fully optimized for any of them.  The opening looks fine on a lower resolution, but the background and character pictures don't fit correctly into the larger ones.  The battle is only fully viewable on a higher resolution, though.  Also, the full sized character models don't really match the partial ones and some of the full sized models are somewhat grotesque.\n\nOne positive is the character selection in the beginning.  The story reaches where the main character arrives and when you choose between Janet and Eric it describes their benefits and drawbacks as part of the story.
