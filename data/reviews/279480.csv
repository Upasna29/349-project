It's sort of an abstract sumo wrestler strategy thing where you're trying to lure opponents to the edge and use their momentum against them. The weight of the pieces as they clack along the track and against each other was just perfect.\n\nThis adaptation does a great job of capturing the physical feeling and the controls are just right. It's also nice that you can try out moves and undo them without the opponent seeing, rather than having to imagine the outcome and poker-face.\n\nMatchmaking finds me an opponent within about 30 seconds and seems to do some amount of matching based on skill. Since lag and language isn't an issue it can easily pull from the worldwide pool. There's no chat features... I wish there was at least a selection of emoticons so I could congratulate good plays. After each match you can watch the full replay at fast speed. In about 10 games I've never seen anyone rage quit when I'm clearly at an advantage.\n\nI haven't tried the single player vs AI or non-traditional layouts. But it has a nice interactive tutorial and several simple practice levels of increasing difficulty to teach the game.\n\nMy only complaints are the missing chat feature, a way to see the total online pool of players searching, and the stupid chime sound when you knock out a piece. Otherwise I'm really happy with this version.","May 4, 2014","true","15.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","3"

And despite the dominance of ancient classics like Chess and Go, abstracts are still being designed and produced in the modern age. Like most abstracts, it’s pretty simple. The game is played with marbles on a hexagonal board. You can push a group of one to three marbles as one move, so long as they all move in the same direction. If you can line up more marbles along an axis than your opponent, then you can push them backwards. The aim is to push your opponents’ marbles right off the board.A slow paced game that at first is reminiscent of Chinese checkers, but is actually quite different. Whether playing the puzzle mode against the computer or a game against a friend, board game and puzzle fans will find value in this title.While the gameplay is extremely engaging however, the camera controls and presentation are a little on the average side. The textures have a soft blur focused look to them and the background music isn't that memorable. Also, there is no move function when zoomed in and the game is forcing you to zoom back out instead.In general, fans of the game, or those that love competitive board games like Chess,  should be very entertained by this game. It has the right balance of depth and complexity, and barring a few niggling control and visual issues, is a top notch digital version of a very interesting board game.","August 18, 2014","true","81.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

I've never played the physical boardgame before, but this digital version seems solid enough, and in addition to the requisite multiplayer options, has many single-player scenarios to teach you the basics and progressively tougher strategies (I've only played SP so far).\n\nSee those screenshots on the store page? That's exactly what the game looks like--no bells and whistles here.  I've encountered only one music track so far, and it loops pretty fast, but I just turn it off and play my own music... or have silence if I need to concentrate, which is most of the time ;) The controls are very simple, and there are easy ways to backtrack if you accidentally click on the wrong piece. However, you can really tell this is a port of a game that had touch controls; small things like having to move your cursor all the way to the bottom right corner to finish your turn could have been a bit more streamlined for the PC version.\n\nThe big question for single players is: is the AI good?  As of now, I'm working through the scenarios to learn the game and the AI is still at the Easy level, but as a complete newbie I find there's still a fair amount of challenge to be had and I'm improving and making steady progress. Would a veteran Abalone player be challenged at more difficult levels? I'm not good enough to judge properly! But for a beginner, the difficulty seems accurate so far.\n\nJust a note for achievement hunters that this game does have achievements, but they appear to be broken.\n\nAbalone is straightforward strategy game that wears its boardgame origins on its sleeve, and has a good amount of content for the Single Player. It may not have any flash, but it's solid.","July 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

In addition to that nicknames seem to be masked or something - every search for player's profiles I made on Steam turned out empty. Why?\nWell, if there are people playing, matchmaking almost always gives you ridiculously weak opponents: they walk into the most obvious traps and let their forces be split incredibly easy. Out of my 50 games I had like 2-3 really good ones.\n\nBesides that the game has a lot more issues:\n- some people seem to be unable to start the game at all\n- Devs don't care / forum's dead\n- Connectivity\n- Ugly unintuitive menus\n\nDon't get me wrong though - Abalone in itself is a great tactical game with a certain geometrical beauty to it.

If you are like me and were getting the janky background music on a small black screen try dropping the resolution of your launch monitor to 1024x768.  That at least permitted the graphics to load for my rig, which nominally has a multimon setup at 3640x1920.\n\nOnce in the game, however, things didn't really improve.  ESC doesn't bring up a settings menu, it exits the game.  That's massively frustrating when you are searching for the controls in order to get going.  Thankfully, the launch sequence takes a while every time you reflexively hit ESC in an attempt to get to any control-map or settings.\n\nUltimately, this is a bad port to PC.","June 25, 2014","false","10.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

And despite the dominance of ancient classics like Chess and Go, abstracts are still being designed and produced in the modern age. Like most abstracts, it’s pretty simple. The game is played with marbles on a hexagonal board. You can push a group of one to three marbles as one move, so long as they all move in the same direction. If you can line up more marbles along an axis than your opponent, then you can push them backwards. The aim is to push your opponents’ marbles right off the board.A slow paced game that at first is reminiscent of Chinese checkers, but is actually quite different. Whether playing the puzzle mode against the computer or a game against a friend, board game and puzzle fans will find value in this title.While the gameplay is extremely engaging however, the camera controls and presentation are a little on the average side. The textures have a soft blur focused look to them and the background music isn't that memorable. Also, there is no move function when zoomed in and the game is forcing you to zoom back out instead.In general, fans of the game, or those that love competitive board games like Chess,  should be very entertained by this game. It has the right balance of depth and complexity, and barring a few niggling control and visual issues, is a top notch digital version of a very interesting board game.","August 18, 2014","true","81.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

I've never played the physical boardgame before, but this digital version seems solid enough, and in addition to the requisite multiplayer options, has many single-player scenarios to teach you the basics and progressively tougher strategies (I've only played SP so far).\n\nSee those screenshots on the store page? That's exactly what the game looks like--no bells and whistles here.  I've encountered only one music track so far, and it loops pretty fast, but I just turn it off and play my own music... or have silence if I need to concentrate, which is most of the time ;) The controls are very simple, and there are easy ways to backtrack if you accidentally click on the wrong piece. However, you can really tell this is a port of a game that had touch controls; small things like having to move your cursor all the way to the bottom right corner to finish your turn could have been a bit more streamlined for the PC version.\n\nThe big question for single players is: is the AI good?  As of now, I'm working through the scenarios to learn the game and the AI is still at the Easy level, but as a complete newbie I find there's still a fair amount of challenge to be had and I'm improving and making steady progress. Would a veteran Abalone player be challenged at more difficult levels? I'm not good enough to judge properly! But for a beginner, the difficulty seems accurate so far.\n\nJust a note for achievement hunters that this game does have achievements, but they appear to be broken.\n\nAbalone is straightforward strategy game that wears its boardgame origins on its sleeve, and has a good amount of content for the Single Player. It may not have any flash, but it's solid.","July 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

In addition to that nicknames seem to be masked or something - every search for player's profiles I made on Steam turned out empty. Why?\nWell, if there are people playing, matchmaking almost always gives you ridiculously weak opponents: they walk into the most obvious traps and let their forces be split incredibly easy.

That at least permitted the graphics to load for my rig, which nominally has a multimon setup at 3640x1920.\n\nOnce in the game, however, things didn't really improve.  ESC doesn't bring up a settings menu, it exits the game.  That's massively frustrating when you are searching for the controls in order to get going.

It's sort of an abstract sumo wrestler strategy thing where you're trying to lure opponents to the edge and use their momentum against them. The weight of the pieces as they clack along the track and against each other was just perfect.\n\nThis adaptation does a great job of capturing the physical feeling and the controls are just right. It's also nice that you can try out moves and undo them without the opponent seeing, rather than having to imagine the outcome and poker-face.\n\nMatchmaking finds me an opponent within about 30 seconds and seems to do some amount of matching based on skill. Since lag and language isn't an issue it can easily pull from the worldwide pool. There's no chat features... I wish there was at least a selection of emoticons so I could congratulate good plays. After each match you can watch the full replay at fast speed. In about 10 games I've never seen anyone rage quit when I'm clearly at an advantage.\n\nI haven't tried the single player vs AI or non-traditional layouts. But it has a nice interactive tutorial and several simple practice levels of increasing difficulty to teach the game.\n\nMy only complaints are the missing chat feature, a way to see the total online pool of players searching, and the stupid chime sound when you knock out a piece.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashpotato/recommended/279480/","mashpotato","MashPotato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashpotato/","407 products in account","Abalone is a strategy game with very simple rules (the tutorial will take about a minute of your time), but is pretty tricky to play.  I've never played the physical boardgame before, but this digital version seems solid enough, and in addition to the requisite multiplayer options, has many single-player scenarios to teach you the basics and progressively tougher strategies (I've only played SP so far).\n\nSee those screenshots on the store page? That's exactly what the game looks like--no bells and whistles here.  I've encountered only one music track so far, and it loops pretty fast, but I just turn it off and play my own music... or have silence if I need to concentrate, which is most of the time ;) The controls are very simple, and there are easy ways to backtrack if you accidentally click on the wrong piece. However, you can really tell this is a port of a game that had touch controls; small things like having to move your cursor all the way to the bottom right corner to finish your turn could have been a bit more streamlined for the PC version.\n\nThe big question for single players is: is the AI good?  As of now, I'm working through the scenarios to learn the game and the AI is still at the Easy level, but as a complete newbie I find there's still a fair amount of challenge to be had and I'm improving and making steady progress. Would a veteran Abalone player be challenged at more difficult levels? I'm not good enough to judge properly! But for a beginner, the difficulty seems accurate so far.\n\nJust a note for achievement hunters that this game does have achievements, but they appear to be broken.\n\nAbalone is straightforward strategy game that wears its boardgame origins on its sleeve, and has a good amount of content for the Single Player. It may not have any flash, but it's solid.","July 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

In addition to that nicknames seem to be masked or something - every search for player's profiles I made on Steam turned out empty. Why?\nWell, if there are people playing, matchmaking almost always gives you ridiculously weak opponents: they walk into the most obvious traps and let their forces be split incredibly easy. Out of my 50 games I had like 2-3 really good ones.\n\nBesides that the game has a lot more issues:\n- some people seem to be unable to start the game at all\n- Devs don't care / forum's dead\n- Connectivity\n- Ugly unintuitive menus\n\nDon't get me wrong though - Abalone in itself is a great tactical game with a certain geometrical beauty to it.

If you are like me and were getting the janky background music on a small black screen try dropping the resolution of your launch monitor to 1024x768.  That at least permitted the graphics to load for my rig, which nominally has a multimon setup at 3640x1920.\n\nOnce in the game, however, things didn't really improve.  ESC doesn't bring up a settings menu, it exits the game.  That's massively frustrating when you are searching for the controls in order to get going.  Thankfully, the launch sequence takes a while every time you reflexively hit ESC in an attempt to get to any control-map or settings.\n\nUltimately, this is a bad port to PC.","June 25, 2014","false","10.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"
