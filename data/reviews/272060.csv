This is an interactive story, so people not interested in that can walk along.\n\nThe whole game takes place in a cabin lost in the woods, where you unfold the plot by exploring objects and opening furniture. The main character is deftly voiced, his emotions are convincingly genuine. There is no jump scares, loud sounds, and so on, the fear comes from the well crafted story and presentation. The game world might be small, but each items hold lots of memories, and as the plot advances, you see them in completely different lights.\n\nThe length of the game is perfect (roughly 1h30) for what it aims to achieve, and the pace consistantly ramps up in tension. The writing is descriptive, metaphoric and subjective. The emotional side is highly nuanced, and despite the length, you will feel conflicted several times concerning the characters and the situation it presents.\n\nIn short: a free game with the quality content you expect from a commercial product. Be aware this is a condensed experience focused solely on storytelling.","October 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 148 of 158 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","148","158","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/272060/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” ― Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice\n\nSerena is a short adventure game that packs a truck load of emotion, inviting you to investigate a painful mystery. When I was browsing through adventure games in Steam, the title took my attention, yet I never got the will to actually try the game while other games that I purchased before were in the waiting line. Now that I did, I'm positive that the story will haunt me for a while. I have to declare here and now: it is immensely difficult for one to write a review about this game without giving any kind of spoilers; but I will try my best.\n\nWe play the game as a middle aged man that shares a small cabin out in nowhere with his wife, Serena. He sits on the table and looks at a photo of him and his wife. He is unable to recognize his wife's face. What did her face look like? Her eye color? Was she smiling when they took the photo? Come to think of it, where actually is Serena? She is not there... and doesn't seem to be returning soon either. We take a stroll within the cabin, and try to find some clues about our wife's whereabouts. Every furniture, every memento, every stain makes a life. Every tiny detail scattered around presents us a fragment of our memory with her. What happened to her?\n\nThe game is your basic adventure. The only place you got is the small cabin itself, in which the developers managed to fit in a grand deal of story. The atmosphere is a marvelous success, accompanied by beautiful background music that reflects the mood in echoes. Everything around is dim, dark and dusty, as if the reality is old and static as our protagonist's perception. What is certainly remarkable for the gameplay is that; as our memory comes back and our perception change, associations that we have through objects do change also. That is key for the progress within this game. You click on an object for the millionth time - ok, I exaggerate, but at least 15 or so in given progress - , and you still discover something new about the story. The mood starts with faint, content reminiscence, growing to become heavy suspense and conflict; finally calling the trumpet to make room for pure wrath and agony.\n\nYou won't be using anything else besides your mouse to go through our protagonist's memory lane. And take note, the game IS really short. I've run through the game 2 times already, and it took me a bit more than an hour to complete it for the first time. Considering the length, the game doesn't have a save game option. You launch, you play, you complete and you exit. That's all there is. I believe the length of the game is one of the reasons that the game was startling. The last moment comes as a punch to your conscience.\n\nSerena is a wonderful short story that you'll keep with yourself even long time after you finish the game. I've made some research and discovered that the developers' intention for the production bears a story of its own. The game is made to correct a wrong and outweigh the pleasant as an intention in gaming community. That's why the game is free to play. So, if you are an adventure player and enjoy high quality, yet disturbing narration, what are you waiting for?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 79 of 88 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","79","88","2","6"

It will exit the game and you'll have to start over.\n\nSerena is a very interesting experience. I hesitate to call it a game since there's no real gameplay. You only interact with a small environment and learn the story of your unnamed narrator and his wife Serena.\n\nI won't go into details about the story, but I will mention that the twist took me a second playthrough to truly understand. The first time through I pegged the game as predictable, but I didn't realize how much of the story I had missed. The second go round, I discovered the "real" twist ending (and felt quite stupid for having it fly over my head before).\n\nBecause of this, I definitely recommend you to play through slowly and carefully. Use the spacebar to highlight objects you can interact with and click through them until you've heard every story dialogue from them. There are small clues scattered throughout as to what happened in that lonely cabin.\n\nIf you pace yourself and listen through the whole story, the ending goes from predictable to quite rewarding (for you, at least).\n\nBut as I mentioned earlier, I can't really call this a game. If you're looking for a horror game, this isn't the title for you. If you want a tense, haunting experience, you're in the right place. This would be a game worth a few dollars; the fact that it's free is icing on the cake.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark and moody, and the music and sounds really seal the deal; the songs will knock you off your mental balance, and the silences will raise your nerves on end. It's a short experience, but it's one that will stick with me for a while.\n\nIf I had to make any changes, it would be these:\nTake out the ESC quitting the game issue. I tried to pause the game partway through my first run and had to start from scratch. Most people expect ESC to lead to a menu, so I imagine this is a common occurence.\nA bit more notification that an object has been fully interacted with would be nice. It's a short game, but there's no need to pad it out further.","October 24, 2014","true","2.1"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","60","66","2","1"

It seemed pretty obvious to me how this would play out. The ending does leave a bit of mystery, and so you are left to decide what you think actually happened. It's really  not scary or shocking or anything, but it is definitely a dark tale.\n\nThe gameplay itself is super simplistic. Point and click left mouse, and you can use the space bar to highlight interactive items. Outside of that, it's all about finding the right sequences to unlock the next part of the story. Everything happens inside the cabin, so you aren't really going anywhere although you do move around the cabin examining stuff.\n\nThe voice acting was not all that great. Not sure why it was lauded on the store page, lol. Could have been much better.\n\nThe actual setting looked nice and the game was easy to grasp. The story itself...you can play through it in about a half hour.\n\nMy overall rating for this game would be 6 out of 10. It's not a waste of time, but it's not all that exceptional either. I feel they over hyped the collaborative effort of the various programmers/developers/writers. This game seemed more like the sort of thing you would create in a one or two day workshop (graphics notwithstanding). Still, it's free and very short, so why not give it a try and see for yourself.

You're a dude in a small cabin who seems to have lost his memory. The story takes about an hour to complete, and throughout you'll be told the story of two lovers and try to find out why the guy is now alone. You'll explore the humble abode and hear the main character's thoughts on things as he tries to remember, as well as hear the echoing voice of Serena, his love who has seemingly disappeared with no reason. No real puzzles to speak of, just you exploring and being told a story that gets progressively more unsettling.\n\nAfter you've clicked on everything, the atmosphere will slowly change. Through subtle lighting and musical cues you'll know that things aren't quite right. Keep going back and looking at the same items, find new ones, and discover the dark truth and even darker future of their story.\n\nStarts off nice and serene (ha) but then Serena happens and... yeah, it's not exactly such a happy and sun-kissed place to be anymore. This game uses its cozy, cabin atmosphere and the storybook love story against you to great effect. It's not exactly a scary horror game, but it definitely features some horrific and scary components. The music is haunting, the atmopshere is increasingly forboding, and the sense of place is fantastic. Voice acting is awesome as well, with some very effective performances that go from loving to surly to veangeful.\n\nIf you like adventure games in the style of the developer's other games (like Scratches), or just games with a dark and morbid story that catches you off-guard near the end, definitely check this out. And it's free, so I'd say just go for it.","January 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

Stories like this plague the over-saturated "art game" genre, and ending a story with some vague "shocking" ending doesn't make it a great, controversial, beautiful thing. This game was very atmospheric, but it claiming to be a "point and click adventure" is a very general description. Yes, you do point and click things, but the story is boring when it makes any sense, there are no puzzles, there are no hints to help you progress, and the voice acting was some of the most emotionally vacant work I've heard in ages. Another thing that made me mad was that the pictures on the wall, namely the one to the left of the window, and alot of the talking implies that there IS actually something interesting going on here, but try as I might, I could never figure it out. The game managed to draw me in, but the ending was so incredibly disappointing that it soured the entire experience. 3/10 for being aesthetically pleasing and having momentary tension.","January 31, 2014","false","0.5"," 70 of 107 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","70","107","0","17"

If anything, I'll probably end up using them as a stick to sort of beat this game with and show what it could have been. Both feature a man alone in a house in the woods forlornly trying to piece together the events of their past while their emotional and mental grip on the world gradually spirals out of control with the realisation of the true history that they have somehow forgotten. Both use a minimum of space for a maximum of focus on atmosphere and tension while also instilling the player with a sense of being extremely confined, to mirror the same trapped feeling the characters have, both in their current situation as well as their lives in general. Both also toy with many of the same themes and apparent approach to environmental design and other such aspects. But where they differ greatly is Anna is a fully fledged game complete with puzzles and an in-depth story that plays with the occult and supernatural forces, while Serena is more grounded in reality and has you walking around a single room for an hour examining things and listening to one man's flood of self-pity at the breakdown of a relationship.\n\nI'm all for "games that aren't games", but rather "experiences" that invite you to submerge yourself in a unique world and present you with an interesting story or something pretty to look at, and I think that's just as worthy an endeavour as any other form of interactive entertainment or art, but Serena fails badly on this count. The diminutive cabin is pretty well crafted and at least serves well in creating a bleak and withered feeling to reflect its emotional themes as it tries to draw in the player to inhabit the protagonist's state of mind. But the actual story and its characters never capitalise on that and are ultimately uninteresting and not especially likable. This is partly due to the male lead's voice acting which seems at times out of place and unconvincing (made even more jarring by the much more natural sense of the female voiceover), but also by the writing that feels a little awkward or rushed through at times and just never really ingratiates the player to the subjects of its tale. It doesn't help either that the big story revelation is so annoyingly and artificially withheld until the right point in time when they want you to find it, despite the fact it can be seen coming a mile away.\n\nWithout an interesting story or characters to latch onto, all that you're left with is wandering around a small area examining the items, hoping to gain insight into what went wrong so you can progress your character's recall and further re-examine the items with a slighter newer perspective, then repeat. It's a tedious structure that will essentially have you running small laps of the cabin from the start right until the very end and quickly extinguish any initial excitement you had for exploring this new world. And that's really my biggest problem with the game. It's not exactly outright terrible, as the music, look and presentation is generally good and paints a scene of beautiful torment and misery with increasingly oppressive undertones of fear and madness, but all this is squandered by everything else and never really goes anywhere. Had they expanded it to several areas and spread the story out over a longer period, perhaps even added in some more conventional adventure game staples like some basic puzzles or light scavenger hunts, the story elements and character progression would have felt much more natural and they even could have charged a modest price for it. But, instead, my experience with titles like Anna and Dear Esther, which much more masterfully achieve the aims this game strives towards, makes Serena pale quite badly in comparison. I would still look forward to their future projects and hope that they can hone their craft to finally reach the greatness that this game hints at, but as it stands, this just feels like a failed experiment more than the touching, emotional masterpiece many would have you believe it to be.","February 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

Because, in such a small place, a whole world unfolds.\n\nThe story takes place in a cabin far into the woods, and away from civilization. You, the narrator, struggles with your faint memories of your wife, Serena. You look around your home, trying to find mementos that may reveal truths, or even lies? Little by little, you start to remember what happened to both you, and your missing Serena. But still, some things remains unclear. In the very beginning, you two had a romantic relationship going on, but slowly, it all went in flames.\n\nAs you may already know. Serena is a dark story that can leave many questions inside your head. Certain things are clear, just not directly to your ear.

The answer is no, the game does have its dark moments but there is no monsters or anything like that.\n\nStory Every object and furniture in the house has a story in their relationship which makes the story quite immersive. Some of them change in appearance according to what the main character has remenbered and is feeling.\n\nGameplay In this game you click multiple times in the various objects to get the various pieces of dialogue.

I liked it. I'm trying to figure out how to describe the game. In terms of gameplay, it's a "point-and-click adventure" but there really isn't much adventure and there are really no puzzles to solve. In terms of concept, it's a "horror walking simulator" though there isn't much walking and the horror is all psychological; there are no jump scares, though the game is atmospheric and it tricked me into bracing myself for jump scares that never materialized. This game is like a one act play or a one-man show in which the story (non-linear, ambiguous, and open to interpretation) takes place in only one setting and is gradually revealed though the protagonist's inner dialogue and flashback memories. The voice acting is good enough to evoke some emotions and instill a sense of dread as story builds to a very creepy climax. Sound effects and music are used very sparingly, but to good effect. This game is free, takes a little over an hour to play, and has a chilling story.\n\nOK, now on to some technical stuff. I almost was not able to experience this game. The first couple of times I tried to play it,  the game crashed hard the first time I tried to interact with anything. On a hunch, I put my dual Radeon HD 6950s in CrossFire mode and then the game worked for me with no problems. If I had not thought to try this, I would have missed out on a really cool and creepy experience.\n\nUPDATED: I recently played Going Home and so now I feel like I can make some comparisons between the two. This game is shorter than Going Home, but has a similar setup, you are in one location and you rummage through things to piece together the story of what is going on. However, this game has an actual horror element to it, unlike Going Home, which was a fake horror story.","May 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

That being said, it is full of artistic flaw as much as its strong points.\n\nPros: Great ambience and music. Wonderful design of the cabin to fit the *I'm assuming* desired feel. The female voice actor did her job well. The animations while few were well designed for the story. And oh god the plot twist...\n\nCons: The damn main voice actor reads his lines as if being teleprompted at 6am with not a damn in the world. Probably cuz he did it for free. He just didn't fit with the rest of the projects paticularly somber mood. His highlights were when he was angry and even that was bordering on dull. Aside from that, the repeating of dialouge after exhausting memories was a bit annoying, the cursor was bordering on non-intuitive, and...\n\nLike I said, for free its worth the 1 hour acknowledgement of a decent piece of digital artwork. If they asked for money, I'd say pass it up. It tried hard, it really did; but it missed its mark somewhere and I'm guessing its because of its main actor and frustrating mouse interface.","January 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Maybe I've played too many "art games" in the past, but, honestly, I think it would have been a lot better if she just came home from the market in the middle of the darn thing and the guy suddenly realized that maybe he needs to try different medication because this stuff is really messing with his memory. That way, it wouldn't have droned on for so long and the player might actually be surprised.","June 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","57","33","58","15","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/recommended/272060/","tawnylawns","Tawny Lawns 💗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/","1742 products in account","Like many Steamers, I have a forever growing list of games cultivated for my minor addiction for purchasing video games. So in the perpetual sea of Steam deals and "Humble Bundles" I am quick to ignore the freebies offered in my Steam library without a second glance.\n\n\nThe only reason I happened upon Serena was because I was flipping through my list looking for another game and noticed this indie adventure horror title. I dig horror especially when it's heavily reliant on the story. When I first ran Serena it reminded me of walking through the alleyways and rooms in Amnesia minus the scariness and evil things lurking around each corner. Created via the same game engine (Dagon) as the upcoming Asylum, Serena is a positive preview of what's to come this year when Asylum is released. As it's based in one cabin with minimal room to roam, it doesn't expect much from you and is a practically zero stress game. If you like watching horror films but dislike partaking in gory FPS games, you'll enjoy the ambiance in Serena. It has sinister context set in a mildly soothing atmosphere which is the best formula for an entertaining but laid back experience. You don't do anything but click random objects and read/listen to plenty of text. It's a fun change of pace for horror gamers and easy to sample for those less inclined towards the genre. Just sit back, and enjoy the story. It's like those interactive flash games back in the day that just gave you a wicked storybook with sounds and moving pictures and that was it.\n\n\nWhat's more, the game has no control menu so once you start you should aim to finish as it hasn't got a save mode either. It doesn't require one as it isn't challenging to finish and relatively short to play. There are specific places you can click with your cursor to hear snippets of memories and clues to what has happened in that cabin which has a intense atmosphere of "something gravely wrong" from the get go.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes wondering about, clicking all you can, in turn collecting an abundance of information on the couple introduced in Serena, you may get stuck. If you do you always have the option of pressing SPACE BAR to toggle hot spots. That way you can scan any object you haven't checked out and move on with the story.\n\n\nPersonally, after 20 minutes I looked up and read llewellynator's play-through (no plot spoilers) on Steam's community hub and breezed to the end, finishing Serena in half an hour. It would have been even more entertaining had I saved myself from previously Googling the game and noticing a huge spoiler in the search results (basically the ending and what I'd find somewhere in the cabin). I suggest making sure you have an hour to spare just "wasting time" clicking stuff and seeing if you can get through the story on your own. If progression is slow, then use a simple run-through like the link above so you know which actions to take but nothing of what will occur.\n\n\nUsing a guide for my last ten minutes of Serena is a probable culprit but it wasn't a rewarding game and I could see why it's free (on PC). My review is a positive one only because it's free and quick, it is well made and finished the simple task it was meant to do which is tell a short horror story in the likeness of Edgar Allan Poe's literary creations.\n\n\nThe game itself has a bit of IRL drama behind it that wasn't too interesting to me as an outsider so I'll skip that and move onto the story. Serena is fantastically narrated by Josh Mandel which makes the repeated clicking, reading and listening more enjoyable. He plays Serena's husband, the character the gamer will play in first person. Your memory is foggy and you're extremely disorientated as you move around the dusty, abandoned log cabin you seem to reside at with your "better half". But she's nowhere to be seen so you look around the cabin, thinking back to distant moments that seem somehow distorted now. Your goal is to reach the end of the story by clicking certain objects in a somewhat set order and releasing a change in your perception, the truth of what happened to you and Serena and why.","February 26, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game is more a story than a game. It took me about 25 minutes to beat it, and I listened to everything the character had to say. This is no ordinariy point and click adventure game. You'll never leave the cabin, because it's the only place this game takes place.  To progress in the story, you'll need to find certain spots in the cabin to trigger the main character's memory. The whole point of this game is to remember all about Serina. Check everything, even twice or more if neccessary. Revisit the photo on the table multiple times. If you found the correct trigger to regain some memories, the photo will change. You'll also notice a progress when the music changes or the character has a different emotional state and reacts differently to his environment.\n\nTo me, it was a very interesting experience. At first, I couldn't quite get in touch with the voice actor, but it soon wasn't a problem anymore. To learn so much about that woman Serina, although you're just in a small cabin, it makes it very special. I liked the sudden change of drama this game had, and sometimes, I was a little frightened. I try not to spoiler anything, but there is one part, it gaves me the shivers. Recommended to all folks who dig a good, well thought, even if small story with dramatic plot twists.

Ooh, we're punning already...\n\nThere is one thing that Serena did well that I want to start off with. Serena tells an amazing story in a short period of time. You're in a cabin trying to recall what happened to your beloved and once your memories are becoming a little more clear, you're not so sure if it's madness or clarity. Things are not what they seem. This is a basic writing scenario. The point is to take these things, elaborate on them, and make them very strong. Serena excells at this and gives you a twist ending that leaves you staring at the screen and (at least for me) scrambling for more answers because I just couldn't believe what I saw.\n\nIt's a story that starts off simply enough and leaves you to click around for your answers. Things start off sweet and loving and shortly they become a more twisted vision of those "love goggles" your character had on.\n\nSerena is a simple point-and-click style game that is more of an interactive story than a heavy game. There are no heavy puzzles you need to solve other than progressing your mystery you're wrapped up in. You don't ever leave your cottage so there's no heavy exploration. This is not a walking sim. It's just you and your obsessive searching of your cottage and your grisly discoveries.\n\nIt really is a lovely game and for what it does, it does well. It is perfect in that respect. I love the attention to detail. There are slight changes made to your surroundings the further along you get. What was once beautiful suddenly becomes ugly and...well...disgusting.\n\nOf course, there is the caveat that it's just really a short story that's interactive. It doesn't do much else. Some people have mentioned their irritation with the narrator. Considering the short length of the game, I'd suggest if you can't stomach him, you'd just have to turn off your volume. Personally I found him fine. Maybe a little dull and uninspired at some moments, but nothing awful enough that I'd have to turn him off. Sure, he talks a lot because you have to click on everything (no exaggeration) to progress the story, but I really didn't get that irritated. In fact I kept clicking on the bookshelf because I wanted more Lovecraft references read to me.\n\nThis isn't a game for everyone. There's no action. None. Zero. This is your best example of "a free game to kill an hour or less". It's also something I'd probably suggest to people who are trying their hand at horror writing just to see an example of how to do slow reveals. This is a great learning piece of material as opposed to something that's perfect gaming-wise.\n\nI loved this more as a reader than I did as a gamer. It's simple and it's just plain nice. Though admittedly, if someone is getting into horror games, this is probably the best thing you could offer them to get their feet wet before introducing them to more combat oriented games.\n\nSerena is like an ex I compare other games to.

Point and click is pretty easy, but the difficulty lies in finding some of the more obscure places to click which are not immediately obvious -- and going back to re-click them after discovering certain new things.\nPros: Very intriguing storyline. There is a lot of depth in the journey through the main character's psyche, which takes us through his entire relationship with Serena, helping us piece together why she isn't there and why he can't remember things. There are plot twists after you begin to feel comfortable with the knowledge you've gathered.\nCons: It can get frustrating when clicking items starts to give you repeated text, leaving you to blindly wonder where you have to seek your next clues and progressive text to continue the game. Determination is needed, and a highly developed sense of curiosity to make you determined to find out what happened. (Tip: There is no 'inventory' in the game, so when you pick up the one object, do not try to hit escape to find a menu -- that will exit the game and you have to start over. There is a correct place to put the object, you just have to find it.)

Their previous game, Scratches, used a similar style but was all subtitled with no voice acting and could get a little clunky with transitions (So much so that it was constantly crashing). It's nice to see a game from Senscape getting voice acting and moving much smoother. The story is very fleshed out and empathetic with tons of dialogue to explain what's going on. Small elements change throughout the game to add to emotional journey the main character is going on. Be sure to play a few times to make sure you don't miss all the little details. The only downside was the end; it wrapped up to quickly. The player still has time to understand what is going on, but by the time you know the end is coming, it's over in 30 seconds. Something just seemed missing. Overall, It's definitely one of those psychological games that you will be pondering after it's over.

If you do, I would recommend you putting aside that time for this short adventure. There is no save feature that I am aware of so you should probably make sure you have that hour when you won't be interrupted.\nThis game have focus on story telling and atmosphere, the graphics are what you'd expect from a free game and the voice acting can sound a little computerish at first but you'll get used to it. Everything is done by mouse, the only non mouse actions I've found are spacebar to find hot spots and escape to well...escape or exit game if you're looking for a better word.\nThe story is well written, intriguing and has plot twists. The twists are fairly obvious but they are still well written and goes hand in hand with the atmosphere. As you progress the story the lightning and sound effects does a good job of changing the mood, creating a creepy and gloomy atmosphere, and no - there are no jump scares.\nIt's a rather depressing themed game though, but if you're like me you love that stuff ;)\n\nSo if you have around an hour to spare, try it!","January 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But if you want to be taken on a wild emotional rollercoster ride, strap yourself in and play this game right now! Well, maybe wait till night time. This game is amazing. The story is fantastic, Never before have i felt so many emotions in such a short period of time. It is blissfully serene one moment, and then the next thing you know your stomach is in your mouth. This game is very uncomfortable, yet paradoxically oddly comforting at the same time. I would recomend that you play this game alone, in the dark, with headphones on.\nGraphics are okay, they are not bad at all but not amazing. There are no options that i could find, this game is more of an experience than a video game though. Voice acting was okay, again not bad, but not fantastic by any means. Seeing as this game is free, i see no reason why you shouldn't try it at least. Yes it is a little bit boring and unclear at first, but just sit down and play it, you will not regret it. To anyone who gets stuck, all i can say is click on every item throughout the cabin, then do it again. Each time the story is furthered, also, click the item a few times to hear all of the dialauge.

Don't expect cheap jumpscares, and freaky monsters running around dark halls. This is not what "Serena" is about. What it really is about, is a journey through a man's psyche.\n\nThe whole area of the game is confined to one, small, old, dusty cabin. And in this dark, cramped space you experience a man's thinking process. You walk around the cabin, looking at different pieces of equiment, furniture, clothes etc. The man slowly remembers the story of him, and his girl - Serena, drifting apart.\n\nThis game is an experience worth having. If you're expecting scares, well you will be dissapointed. But the mood is extremely creepy and sort of threatening, so I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything - even though I love horror.\n\nIt is unbelievably depressing, but also fascinating. To go through the stages of a person's thinking process. How this man goes through sadness, denial, longing, anger... all these emotions rushing through him in powerful waves. How one hair brush, or bottle of perfume can cause this many associations... This is something most of us have experience at one point or another, due to heartbreak. And it feels liberating to see others go through it so similarly.\n\nAnd don't worry, the game isn't all just reminscing. There is a mystery. Why is he having trouble with his memory? Why is the atmosphere so disturbing? Where is Serena, and why is she gone? The ending might not be the most surprising thing ever, but it did send chills down my spine. The lack of music only enhances the feelings.\n\nPlus, it's free, and going through the whole thing didn't even take me an hour, so even if you don't love it... you won't really lose anything. So I would suggest you give it a shot, and let yourself immerse in the unhappy outcome of a bad relationship. Experience "Serena".","May 28, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game only takes place in one main area, there is plenty to look at over time. One interesting point in the gameplay is that descriptions of items around the area change as you examine more things and uncover the story. The graphics are nice, as well.\nOne main con of the game revolves around the length. It is not, by any means, a long game. It took me less than an hour to play through it, and that included time taken commentating. It is a very intersting story, and it may have benefitted from being at least a little bit longer. It is also quite possible that being longer would only hurt the story. It's hard to tell.\nThe voice acting in this game is nice. It's not fantastic, but the main character's audio quality is pretty good. All in all, the voices certainly aren't unenjoyable.\nIn simple terms, Serena was a good game. It might seem boring or uneventful to some people, but to anyone that loves a good ambience-style game, this is certainly a game to pick up. Besides, it's free!\n\nFeel free to check out my playthrough of this game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R84kazK_nRc","July 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The voice acting is well done, and the ambience and design of the cabin gives the game a good sense of immersion. This game is in a similar vein as Gone Home, and Esther in that its more about the mood, setting, and story than it is about gameplay. There are no puzzles to solve, or complex mechanics to learn. You simply explore and interact with just about any object you can find to slowly uncover the cabins secrets.  The story dark, sweet, nostalgic, and increasingly creepy. It requires a fairly small investment of time, and is certainly worth playing through. Just a word of warning though, there doesn't appear to be a save function, so be sure to set aside at least 30-50 minutes to play it in one sitting. However, it can still be worth replaying as the dialogue changes, and you can get a fuller picture of the story.

It's simple and haunting with a great atmosphere and story. You're confined to a one-room cabin where you examine a wide variety of things in the room and use the protagonist's musings to piece together the story. It uses sound very well to set the tone. The music is melancholy and tense, but when the music stops you can feel the uneasiness growing. The twist at the end was interesting and well-excecuted and leaves space for different interpretations about the details of what happened. Overall, the game is free, downloads in less than 10 minutes, takes an hour to play through, and is fully worth it. A great little story for a pensive afternoon.","April 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the game only takes place in one main area, there is plenty to look at over time. One interesting point in the gameplay is that descriptions of items around the area change as you examine more things and uncover the story. The graphics are nice, as well.\nOne main con of the game revolves around the length. It is not, by any means, a long game. It took me less than an hour to play through it, and that included time taken commentating. It is a very intersting story, and it may have benefitted from being at least a little bit longer. It is also quite possible that being longer would only hurt the story. It's hard to tell.\nThe voice acting in this game is nice. It's not fantastic, but the main character's audio quality is pretty good. All in all, the voices certainly aren't unenjoyable.\nIn simple terms, Serena was a good game. It might seem boring or uneventful to some people, but to anyone that loves a good ambience-style game, this is certainly a game to pick up. Besides, it's free!\n\nFeel free to check out my playthrough of this game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R84kazK_nRc","July 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere and soundtrack were top-notch and the story, at first, seemed really cliche, but towards the end got really cool, pulling out a completely unexpected ending that, get this, actually makes sense! It's easy to tell the makers of this game wanted to do something completely fresh and original and they succeeded brilliantly. It, at first, gives off a nostalgic, gentle feel that quickly turns to uneasiness and discomfort, then to a dark tenseness that envelops the setting. The color scheme remains the same throughout, but as atmosphere builds and soundtracks darken, everything looks more oppressive, dark, and tense. Very well done. This is one of the few games that really touches me emotionally: seeing something beautiful and ideal wither and die before your eyes is one of the hardest things to see for me and people who find that emotionally depressing or at least touching will very much appreciate this. Another thing I noticed: items you look at in the beginning take on a completely different meaning in the end, which is something I really enjoyed. Very very very good.

It's shorter and much, much cheaper than actually BEING in a relationship (i.e. free!), so what have you got to lose...other than any and all faith you may still have in "true love"...but who needs such frivolous, self-deceiving nonsense in their lives, anyway?\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","March 24, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Thus Hera punishes Hercules by ‘sending madness upon him’, and Agamemnon confides to Achilles that ‘Zeus robbed me of my wits’. Thanks to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 BC), madness first became an object of scientific speculation.\n\nSo Serena (a short point and click adventure set in a single setting - a lonely wooded cabin) opens with a man waiting for the arrival of his wife. As we point and click on various items strewn about the incredibly run-down cabin (a not-so-subtle metaphor used to display the clarity of the mind of its main protagonist) cracks in the veneer begin to surface. Without going into too much detail its suffice to say gamers should expect to see exactly where this story is headed within the first five minutes of playing (the game roughly lasts about 40 min before concluding).\n\nWhilst it's an interesting experiment that comes along with some pedigree - Josh Mandel of Space Quest fame handles the narration of the main character. My mine gripe is that he is probably not the person who should have handled these duties. He comes across as stilted when the script calls for emotional variation and I didn't buy it for one second. The woman who handles the wife's duties comes across as robotic in her line delivery even when called upon to display hysteria and it feels like both are reading from a script as the voice-overs just don't flow naturally. Yes -  I realize this is a free little title that probably didn't have the budget to hire professional actors - but having professional voice actors on-board would most certainly have been more beneficial.\n\nI was also not mad about the main character voicing his thoughts about every single little thing I clicked on. Yes we may be dealing with a descent that's crux is akin to an emotional ship-wreck but having studied basic psychology at Uni before switching, I get that we are merely an observer inside another man's fractured mind but instead of drawing me in to the complexity of a mind unraveling I was left distanced and more and more annoyed as the tale progressed.\n\nShort and bleak this tale of love, loss and misery is thankfully over quickly. I would hardly call it a "love-letter to the adventure gaming clique" as there are far better examples out there but as a mild diversion you may end up enjoying it more than I did since I can't say I was overly impressed.","May 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 43 of 84 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","43","84","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsyhappiness/recommended/272060/","doomsyhappiness","KY Joey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsyhappiness/","107 products in account","Serena is a wonderful game that is artistic within its own right.\n\nThe game is entirely played within the cabin, and the game is played by interacting with objects within the cabin itself via point and click. The point of the game is the story itself, so interacting with each object gives you parts of the story (make sure that you interact with each object multiple times, though!). As the story progresses, you are able to re-interact with objects to obtain more of the wonderful story. You're able to interact with each object through 3-4 phases, each one giving you completely different dialogue for each object. The end of the story was both expected and unexpected at the same time (more-so when you get further into the game).\n\nThe voice acting itself was alright. The sad emotions seemed lacking (which is important within a plot like this), but everything else was pretty solid. The music was good when it was there, and the silence also empowered the general eerie feel of the game.\n\nThe biggest thing with this game is that it makes you feel so mixed towards the character by the end. You spend so much time sympathizing with this character, feeling confused for him, understanding his rage, but then you become infuriated with him beyond belief. It's an emotional roller coaster in the simplest of forms, and it keeps you thinking for a while after you finish it.\n\nFor a free game, this is really solid. I'd pay a few bucks for it, honestly.","January 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But as you move along the story, it gets creepier and darker and sets the mood for the grand finalé.\n\nThe experience of this game is quite short.

Serena is a great opportunity for that escape. A very beautifully created point and click adventure story featuring a very dirty and gritty but appropriate environment. The plot follows the main character trying to regain some of his memories about his lost wife. The game does a great job at carrying the player through a gambit of emotions as well as helping to progress the story at an increasing accelerated rate.\n\nThe game was created using a brand new adventure engine called Dagon developed by the Argentinian studio Senscape. Senscape was founded by the writer and creator of Serena, Agustín Cordes who also created the hit adventure game Scratches.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy story driven adventure games, this game is well worth the time.

But as you move along the story, it gets creepier and darker and sets the mood for the grand finalé.\n\nThe experience of this game is quite short. You can finish the whole thing in an hour, but a well invested hour I'd say!\n\n\nPROS:\n+NOTHING BEATS FREE!!!\n+The story!\n+Voice acting is decent.\n+Decent visuals for the cabin.\n+Music sets the mood of the game (you can even get the soundtrack from the installation folder; files labelled as "trk.xxx.ogg".).\n\n\nCONS:\n-Maybe a bit too short? An hour and you're done!\n-No puzzles.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nEven if it is really short, I do recommend this game. I urge you, the reader, to play this game and experience it for yourself... even if the reviews / comments are very positive! Heck, skip the comments to avoid spoilers and just play the game!\n\nIf you do have an hour to kill, give this freebie a shot!\n\nRATING:\n9.0 / 10","October 20, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Serena is a great opportunity for that escape. A very beautifully created point and click adventure story featuring a very dirty and gritty but appropriate environment. The plot follows the main character trying to regain some of his memories about his lost wife. The game does a great job at carrying the player through a gambit of emotions as well as helping to progress the story at an increasing accelerated rate.\n\nThe game was created using a brand new adventure engine called Dagon developed by the Argentinian studio Senscape. Senscape was founded by the writer and creator of Serena, Agustín Cordes who also created the hit adventure game Scratches.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy story driven adventure games, this game is well worth the time. It was very short but considering the story, the length was perfect. This was just like sitting down to read to a great short story.","October 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the game is inside this little house where pointing and clicking every single object inside the house you are able to rebuild all the story between the protagonist and Serena (and of course i will not reveal the final).\nAs a horror game it was in my opinion little bit aseptic: you can see the circle of the feelings of the protagonist (love-anger-disperation-depression) but i think are not really good connected to each other and as a player i wasn't able to feel the connections between them inside my mind. The only moment where i can found a connection is only when you are pointing and clicking some objects (with a particular order) without trasport the player FOR REAL into the deeps of the protagonist's mind.\nAbout the graphic and the music nothing to say: i think they were good.\nGraphic design is dark but simple and related with the atmosphere of the house. The same thing is for the music: easy going and good with the atmosphere of the game. But nothing to be surprised or something that said to you "oh wow! This is great! Make me feels distressed as the protagonist!".\nThe gameplay as a point-and-click is really simple, and it was a good choice for a product like this but it wasn't good to do the scripts on the screen, because every time you click the same object for the scripts, these overlap to each other (and in few cases, even the voice, but maybe it was a problem of my speed of the laptop's processor).\n\nThis game is a sort of fifty/fifty, not good but even not to bad, i think the developers have done the right choice to put "Serena" as a free-to-play and also is a really short game (i've finished it in 20 mins or something like that) so if you want waste some time with a cute "horror" game, this is a good title.","October 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll find the narration of a story you can't change, but told in a very interesting way. The game is really worth the time you will put in it, which won't be too much over 1 hour. It might seem short, but for a free game, and for a story, it is enough. The end comes at the right time in my opinion, closing the story in a way i did not expect.\nThe graphics are not new gen great, obviously, but still very good; trust me, you have seen much worse in indie horror games.

Whilst there is no save function I think I could now probably finish the game in 5-10 minutes (knowing how to do it). That's the fun of the game though. So the lack of saving isn't important.\n\nThe game keeps you guessing in many ways, and when you've stopped guessing it lets you finish your investigation into what happened. The ending is pretty fantastic too. I really recomend playing this game when you have a spare hour.\n\nListen out for the clock chiming, that signals that you can do something knew (even if it's clicking on the picture on the table again).

It does an excellent job at making the player wonder what happened and also what will happen next. The immensely good voice acting ensured the emotions were portrayed powerfully enough to invest me into it - a plain text version would have nowhere near the same effect. I also have no complaints about the graphics or sounds; they all did their jobs perfectly. The camera and player control are reminescent of Myst (albeit updated to today's standards) and will feel odd, if not flat out annoying, to a percentage of players, especially the ones who aren't familiar with old adventure games, since it doesn't allow for 100% free roaming. I myself found it to be a plus, since the fixed positions allowed for the ideal visualization of objects which, in this game, contributes to the emotional connection.\nIf you have between half an hour to one full hour to spare and are into "story over gameplay" kind of games, then I very much recommend you try this game.","January 31, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a FREE download and is about 30 long (give-er take)\n\nSerena and you are happily married, or so you (the husband) say you are.  One day the husband wakes up and Serena is nowhere to be seen.  There is a photo of you and her on the table, but her face, is smudged out.  You do what you would do in ANY adventure game and CLICK ON EVERYTHING!!  You must desperately search for something, Anything, that will remind you of what she looked like.  When you finally remember her face you look back at the picture, but, she doesn't look happy.  She's kinda frowning.  Clicking on more objects prompts the husband to to remember the, slightly less, good times.  After that you take another good look at the photo you see that her frowning intensified.  Going around the room another time make the Husband remember the bad times and going so far as to curse out his wife saying that she was horrible and its all her fault that there were problems with there relationship.\n\nAfter that.  The Creepy side of the game starts to reveal itself.\n\nYou walk over to your closet and look inside.  You find a Corpse.  Decaying.  It looks like its been there for months.  The husband suddenly starts to think "did I, kill Serena?" "Was I so mad at her for some reason that it drove me to kill her?"  As you click around the cabin some more the Husband starts to contemplate his actions and what he could do with the body.  As he stumbles around his home he hears people talking.  He thinks its the police but when he walks up to the Curtain drawn windows he sees shadows of 2 people talking about what they should do with the "evidence".  This results in them burning down your cabin with you trapped inside.  THE END!!\n\nIt took me a while to figure it out but YOU are the Corpse in the Closet and the 2 people outside are Serena and her New Lover.  Serena killed you and hid your body in the closet and burned down the house to hide the murder.  You are simply your "spirit" ,or whatever you want to call it, Observing the horror from beyond.\n\nBut that's JUST my thoughts on it.

As you can guess, it's a dark story with no clear objective, just hero trying to remember his life with wife by searching there. No worries, there are no jumpscares. You navigate through the log cabin by pointing and clicking and then search various items by pointing and clicking too, resulting in main character commenting on them, most of comments being linked to his wife - Serena.\n\nThe game itself is supposed to be like a "tutorial" for upcoming developer's title "Asulym", mostly showing multiple character's reaction on objects. Each time that you click on the object, it will bring yet another character's thought, until it starts to loop in more generic lines. As the game progresses and overall mood of scene changes, each object will awake a different kind of thoughts in hero's mind with a different mood flavor.\nIt's also told that this game is "disturbing love letter" to adventure genre fans, that this game happened because of events that most of you didn't notice.\n\nWhile the progression is not clear and is rather washed out, it does exist. There is no puzzle, you just have to explore log cabin and click-click-click it all. My hint would be to recheck photo on table from time to time. The story is not exactly clear, and most is told to be open for impretation. There is only one ending. The usual kind. For "art" games. You know them.\n\nThere really isn't much to say about graphics and music, just your standard fare. And there is no menu, ESC button kicks you out.

That's it.  There's no real gameplay.  Having said that, it was very interesting to me to hear all of his comments.  There were a surprisingly large number of comments for each object before he started repeating himself.  Then after hearing everything for all objects, he remembered something and then there were new comments on all of the objects with a slightly different tone and more detail, and then he remembered something else, and it repeated a few times with me going around the room clicking on all of the objects until he repeated himself, and then doing it all over again.  By all rights that should be boring, but after a few minutes I was very caught up in the story and trying to piece everything together to figure out what happened.  It was also amazing how much detail came across about his character as well as Serena's just from natural-sounding comments on various objects in their cabin.  Considering it's free, I think it's definitely worth a download and give it a few minutes to absorb the atmosphere and setting to see if you like the story :)","August 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Also in all honesty I was waiting for something to pop out at me such as what dead space1 did, maybe it was the game was dark and creepy but either way it never happened.

Its a FREE download and is about 30 long (give-er take)\n\nSerena and you are happily married, or so you (the husband) say you are.  One day the husband wakes up and Serena is nowhere to be seen.  There is a photo of you and her on the table, but her face, is smudged out.  You do what you would do in ANY adventure game and CLICK ON EVERYTHING!!  You must desperately search for something, Anything, that will remind you of what she looked like.  When you finally remember her face you look back at the picture, but, she doesn't look happy.  She's kinda frowning.  Clicking on more objects prompts the husband to to remember the, slightly less, good times.  After that you take another good look at the photo you see that her frowning intensified.  Going around the room another time make the Husband remember the bad times and going so far as to curse out his wife saying that she was horrible and its all her fault that there were problems with there relationship.\n\nAfter that.  The Creepy side of the game starts to reveal itself.\n\nYou walk over to your closet and look inside.  You find a Corpse.  Decaying.  It looks like its been there for months.  The husband suddenly starts to think "did I, kill Serena?" "Was I so mad at her for some reason that it drove me to kill her?"  As you click around the cabin some more the Husband starts to contemplate his actions and what he could do with the body.  As he stumbles around his home he hears people talking.  He thinks its the police but when he walks up to the Curtain drawn windows he sees shadows of 2 people talking about what they should do with the "evidence".  This results in them burning down your cabin with you trapped inside.  THE END!!\n\nIt took me a while to figure it out but YOU are the Corpse in the Closet and the 2 people outside are Serena and her New Lover.  Serena killed you and hid your body in the closet and burned down the house to hide the murder.  You are simply your "spirit" ,or whatever you want to call it, Observing the horror from beyond.\n\nBut that's JUST my thoughts on it.

It is also very beautiful but very disturbing. Is Serena worth looking into?\n\nIf you are into games that are heavily story driven and with great narration, then I would recommend giving Serena a go.\n\nIt was enjoyable to play from the start to the finish. I found myself in questions after I had completed it since it tests your emotions and logic. The controls are very simple (point and click) but I highly recommend you play this game with sound on and if possible, with headphones on. This is because the game would feel rather empty or lacking in emotion and atmosphere since the best part about this game is the narration and the music used in this game. If I had any issues with this game, it would be a few minor problems, mainly technical though (game mechanics). Other than that this game is definitely worth giving a try.\n\nPros:\n- Narration is the strong point of this game and with that in mind, the writer did an amazing job with the script (words weren't  as boring to listen to).\n- Short and simple\n- Easy to immerse yourself into the mooding and atmosphere of the game, which makes this another strong point of this game.\n- The music truly set the mood to this game.\n- VA (Voice Actors) did a great job by putting emphasis their words so that the narration didn't feel empty.\n- Good details and features, it was nice to look at from beginning to end.\n- Things that weren't really neccessary connected to the story had great detail. You can tell how much love and conflict they felt within the relationship.\n- The lamps are so plain but beautiful..\n- It's free!\n\nCons:\n- Hitting ESC will close the game automatically, so yes, that means no pausing the game or changing volume in-game (there is the volume mixer outside the game so it can still be adjusted)\n- Hitting ESC also means when you go to play again after re-opening, you'll have to start from the beginning\n- Movement is clicking, it may not be as bad but you need to move to other areas to interact with certain objects\n- The photo (yeah the photo) was... ..well you can find out.\n- No visual indicator if you've clicked on an interactable object many times to a point where it'll repeat already read lines.\n\n\n","February 3, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If it were to be a true adventure game more freedom and exploration would most certainly have been required, but as a short interactive story it works. Add the fact that it's completely free and runs on Windows as well as on Mac and Linux and there is little left to complain about, really. Try it.","February 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosbiro/recommended/272060/","janosbiro","Janos Biro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosbiro/","364 products in account","Playing Serena may be a disturbing experience, but totally worth if you like psychological thrillers. My take on it (SPOILER ALERT):\n\nWhat is love? How can love turn into obsession? What separates love from hate? Both are strong feelings that can absorb us completely. This game deals with this question with a simple mechanic: changing descriptions and character’s reaction to examining objects. All you do in the game is examining objects. There is no puzzle, except for a very simple one. Descriptions change (the photo, the poem) once you examine the objects around you, leading you to another psychological level. Nothing around you changes, but the comfortable cabin turns into an oppressive and scary limbo, because your mind changes. That’s the point I guess the game is trying to convey.\n\nGames are the perfect platform to create this dramatic effect. In a movie, it is possible to show exactly the same scene and make it look like a completely different scene using a different soundtrack, for example. But in a game you can do it much better, because the character’s reactions complement the visible scene. The players feel attached to these reactions, taking them as their own, trying to see through the eyes of the character. In this case, not only we know that something changed, but the objects around you are “reframed”, even if they look exactly the same.\n\nSerena also plays with the idea of slowly sliding into insanity. Games are also very good at this, because players can experience this transition on their own pace.\n\nThat’s all I have to say. If you played Serena, tell me what think about it. Let me show you that the value of a game is not related to how much time you spend (outside reality) playing it, but how much it can make you think about real things, things that matter.

But as you move along the story, it gets creepier and darker and sets the mood for the grand finalé.\n\nThe experience of this game is quite short. You can finish the whole thing in an hour, but a well invested hour I'd say!\n\n\nPROS:\n+NOTHING BEATS FREE!!!\n+The story!\n+Voice acting is decent.\n+Decent visuals for the cabin.\n+Music sets the mood of the game (you can even get the soundtrack from the installation folder; files labelled as "trk.xxx.ogg".).\n\n\nCONS:\n-Maybe a bit too short? An hour and you're done!\n-No puzzles.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nEven if it is really short, I do recommend this game.

Serena is a great opportunity for that escape. A very beautifully created point and click adventure story featuring a very dirty and gritty but appropriate environment. The plot follows the main character trying to regain some of his memories about his lost wife. The game does a great job at carrying the player through a gambit of emotions as well as helping to progress the story at an increasing accelerated rate.\n\nThe game was created using a brand new adventure engine called Dagon developed by the Argentinian studio Senscape. Senscape was founded by the writer and creator of Serena, Agustín Cordes who also created the hit adventure game Scratches.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy story driven adventure games, this game is well worth the time.

The whole game takes place inside a cabin, which works very well. The voice acting is ok, and the music is rather good.

You can't fail or lose in this. To progress, you simply click on various items in the cabin to invoke memories of the protaganist regarding his relationship with his wife, Serena. As time passes with you clicking on items (even the same items you clicked on earlier) and exploring around the cabin, the protaganist's emotional state undergoes changes (there are three total emotional stages) until the ending approaches.  The total time taken varies from 40-60 minutes.\n\nThe point of Serena is not to have fun. The developers were more concerned with leaving an emotional impact on the gamer. In my opinion, they did a solid job at it because the dialogue and progression of emotional stages of the protaganist made the characters feel real and relatable, thus preparing us for the ending twist. To what extent this game has an impact on you, as with any piece of art, depends on what you make out of the experience as well as your own background in intimate personal relationships.\n\nI really feel that this game is a testament to how video games have the capacity to be great art. It's free and short so I recommend that you try Serena. Take your time in the game. Click on items multiple times for the protaganist to say different things and focus on connecting to the character rather than trying to finish it as fast as you can.","June 14, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing it is like reading a short-story written by Edgar Allan Poe: it's dreary, haunting and the storytelling... ah, it is marvelous. The environment looks just like Poe's chamber in the poem "The Raven", or like the shack in Lars von Trier's "Antichrist" - so you can tell that things are going to get creepy at some point. Serena is an inviting point-and-click (or rather a point-and-read) adventure game with no puzzles for you to solve, so you'd better go with the flow. The plot is about longing, resentment and despair (or even hope, anger and guilt) and how memory and perception alter our judgments regarding the things that surround us. At the core of it all are also themes such as love, hatred and murder, so be prepared to deliver some thinking in order to make sense of this fantastic story. The voice acting, the graphics and the gameplay are decent, so, if you are into reading letters and listening to thoughtful remarks, then this is one of the finest games you're going to get nowadays.","March 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play the part of a man who has forgotten why he's in a rustic cabin, and whatever happened to his wife. In this point and click adventure game you will have to reassemble the pieces to discover what you do not know and what you forgot.\n\nGraphically I have to say that this is a very good looking game. I felt like I was in a dusty old cabin, devoid of any true light, but showing that it was lived in, at least at some point, and that the clutter and the items found in the cabin make it all feel real. The only images that I didn't really like was the fact that there were two slightly different hand icons and sometimes made it hard to distinguish between cannot do anything and pick up this item to interact with it.\n\nThe sound was probably the hardest thing to pull off about this game, and I have to say that I was impressed. You could feel the emotion in the voices. To be a bit nitpicky I have to say that when the auditory memory flashes of the wife happened I couldn't really picture that voice coming out of the wife, but like I said, nitpicking.\n\nThis is not really that long of a game, and to be honest to tell this story it really didn't have to be. There were some very frustrating aspects to this game, most of them revolving around having to touch objects throughout the cabin over and over again trying to pull clues out after you found the last clue spot, but then again we are talking about a man who cannot remember a thing of why he is in the cabin, and where his wife is, so I can understand that as puzzle pieces fall into place, going back over something that meant nothing at first could make a hell of a difference later.\n\nNow as far as I can tell, as of right now the game is free, I'm not sure if that will change, it was released at the end of January 2014, so take it as you would have. I do have to say that I was impressed by the fact that there seemed to be a lot of collaborators taking part in this, but at the same time I don't think it really shows, maybe with everyone adding their two cents and refining details it made it better, but it's hard to tell. Alright so lets give this game a grade shall we? Even though it was short, and there were some frustrating parts to it, once I started the game I literally did not stop until I got to the end, so for that this game gets an 8.9 out of 10.","March 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosbiro/recommended/272060/","janosbiro","Janos Biro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janosbiro/","364 products in account","Playing Serena may be a disturbing experience, but totally worth if you like psychological thrillers. My take on it (SPOILER ALERT):\n\nWhat is love? How can love turn into obsession? What separates love from hate? Both are strong feelings that can absorb us completely. This game deals with this question with a simple mechanic: changing descriptions and character’s reaction to examining objects. All you do in the game is examining objects. There is no puzzle, except for a very simple one. Descriptions change (the photo, the poem) once you examine the objects around you, leading you to another psychological level. Nothing around you changes, but the comfortable cabin turns into an oppressive and scary limbo, because your mind changes. That’s the point I guess the game is trying to convey.\n\nGames are the perfect platform to create this dramatic effect. In a movie, it is possible to show exactly the same scene and make it look like a completely different scene using a different soundtrack, for example. But in a game you can do it much better, because the character’s reactions complement the visible scene. The players feel attached to these reactions, taking them as their own, trying to see through the eyes of the character. In this case, not only we know that something changed, but the objects around you are “reframed”, even if they look exactly the same.\n\nSerena also plays with the idea of slowly sliding into insanity. Games are also very good at this, because players can experience this transition on their own pace.\n\nThat’s all I have to say. If you played Serena, tell me what think about it. Let me show you that the value of a game is not related to how much time you spend (outside reality) playing it, but how much it can make you think about real things, things that matter.

To me it's totally innapropriate for this kind of game, and really bothered me. However, I grit my teeth and continued on with the game.\nMy breaking point was probably after hearing "I hate her so much" and "I don't even care about the damn thing" a million times, and I almost tossed my computer accross my room.\nI wanted to be involved in this game, I wanted to really be a part of it, but to me, it was like reading a great novel that was covered in some sort of noxious mould that burns your nostrils. I couldn't sympathize with anyone or anything, maybe it's just me, but I disliked everyone, even facial-paralysis/transplant Serena.\nI have nothing negative to say about the visuals, they're perfect for this kind of atmosphere and story, creepy, homey, lonely, neglected, mysterious, and slightly unsettling. From the little dust particles dancing in the muffled sunlight, to the decaying squeaky floorboards and cabinets, I can tell that so much time and detail has been carefully crafted into this game to create the atmosphere it posesses. The music and ambient noises work in tandem with the graphics to move the plot along, change the atmosphere, and to reflect the state of the man's mind.\nThe story I'd give a  3.7 out of 5, it's pretty good, but the plot twists, and changes in direction, make it even better, even I didn't see that coming.\nOverall, for myself, I wouldn't ever pay for this game, or even maybe play it again. To me, it was just tarnished by so many irritaing trifles, that it kind of ruined it for me, from the guy's voice, Serena's sappy 'poetic' letters, to the pre-adolescent usage of the f-bomb tossed in at the end, just made me enjoy it less and less.\nFor someone else trying this game, I'd reccommend to just give it a try, you might just fall in love with Serena and it's brooding dark atmosphere, it is a truly unique gaming experience that is not easily forgotten.\nBut for me, it just missed the mark.","March 12, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I felt the method of story telling was pretty satisfactory, as was the atmosphere and art. I very much loved the amount of details and progression, though the character writing could be improved just a bit to increase likeability. This is definitely more of an 'interactive' story than it is a game. It does not cost much of your time, so it is very much worth the play through if you are a fan of dark short point and clicks.","September 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the game is inside this little house where pointing and clicking every single object inside the house you are able to rebuild all the story between the protagonist and Serena (and of course i will not reveal the final).\nAs a horror game it was in my opinion little bit aseptic: you can see the circle of the feelings of the protagonist (love-anger-disperation-depression) but i think are not really good connected to each other and as a player i wasn't able to feel the connections between them inside my mind. The only moment where i can found a connection is only when you are pointing and clicking some objects (with a particular order) without trasport the player FOR REAL into the deeps of the protagonist's mind.\nAbout the graphic and the music nothing to say: i think they were good.\nGraphic design is dark but simple and related with the atmosphere of the house. The same thing is for the music: easy going and good with the atmosphere of the game. But nothing to be surprised or something that said to you "oh wow! This is great! Make me feels distressed as the protagonist!".\nThe gameplay as a point-and-click is really simple, and it was a good choice for a product like this but it wasn't good to do the scripts on the screen, because every time you click the same object for the scripts, these overlap to each other (and in few cases, even the voice, but maybe it was a problem of my speed of the laptop's processor).\n\nThis game is a sort of fifty/fifty, not good but even not to bad, i think the developers have done the right choice to put "Serena" as a free-to-play and also is a really short game (i've finished it in 20 mins or something like that) so if you want waste some time with a cute "horror" game, this is a good title.","October 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is short, but it took a very smooth approach at storytelling, has nice graphics and quality of sound, and mainly - the wonderful atmosphere, one of the key points of which - the steady narration of the story. It would be nice to see this game growing into something bigger, extending the story and gameplay into a full-scale game. There are a few downturns (listed them lower), but the game isn't long enough for them to be significant. And yes, this is an absolute recommendation. Enjoy the game.\n\n+ Good story\n+ Good sound\n+ Excellent artwork\n+ Excellent narration\n+ Atmosphere of a well-written book\n\n- Sometimes can be a little confusing in terms of progressing.\n- The game is a little buggy and it crushed for me a few times.\n- Doesn't have the save option, so if you quit, you should start it all over again (but it is fairly short).","June 5","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If there's one thing I would say needs improvment is how you move around. The game felt kind of linear and restrictive in the way that you can only click on certain Items to move to them, I think WASD would have worked alot better. Another criticism is the lack of an explanation about the ending. Maybe I just didn't find every thing, but the ending did need a little more explanation.

It relies on a story telling element rather than fear tactics to induce the player in its setting. Depending on how you play it, you can beat the game in as little as 10 minutes, but on average you'll spend about 30 minutes to an hour playing though the story. The only bone I have to pick with this game is the fact that it literally throughs you in blind and clueless leaving you to do tons of searching around for triggers that progress the story. That being said, the story makes up for the searching. As the story goes on, your attitude towards Serena changes dramatically and it eventually leads to an incredible ending. Overall, if you like adventure/horror games and have an hour to kill, there is no reason not to play this game.\n\n","November 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Heavily story driven. A first person explorer, you play a nameless man in a cabin trying to piece together memories of his relationship with his supposed wife, the titular Serena. To do that, you must explore and click on items and objects in the tiny cabin.\n\nThe game is simply an interactive horror mystery novel and seems simplistic, but the writing is of a calibre alongside Poe and Lovecraft. Josh Mandel delivers a brilliant performance as the protagonist, and the story will grip you to the very, very end. There's simply no reason to not play this game and experience its story.

When I started, I was hoping for a little more, maybe the ability to move without the use of point-and-click, though it was alright for what the game is. Felt a bit repetitive from clicking on each thing nearly over and over again, but as the story went on, it felt more interesting to get what he was thinking about, and why.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice, that dreadful feeling as you keep going was perfect.\n\nAt the beginning I already guessed what had happened (I was right), and I'm sure a lot of other people will be able to as well. It's a kind of predictable story, but a lot of it is missing so we sort of piece together what happened ourselves.\n\nAn interesting collaboration, but I guess I shouldn't have wished for a lot out of a free game.

It's dramatic,poetic and all that hullabaloo was there to make it intense but because it's short it failed to give out what i really wanted to feel. The art was dark.. I'd defend it saying that it was made that way to give out that depressing creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe game mechanics are what you percieve in a normal HOG game, creepy atmosphere but not creepy enough. The paintings terrified me and I was away from them most of the time. It needed more interaction with items,combining them and using them. Would have been good if i could have gotten out of the cabin or at least a secret trap door, but then yeah the plot required it to be that way so no complains there.\n\nI'm already used to the esc key booting you out of the game instead of making you go to the title because of PCSX2 so no rage there.\nOh and the best plot twist ever and should play it again tonight.\n\n"Erotic but not Obscene" the man said XD","February 2","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are so many good things about it-but unfortunately it all fell apart for me pretty quickly.\nWhen the game opens, the cabin is perfect-its bleak, oppresive, and dark. The details are wonderful, as is the curiosity and anticipation that it brings. When your character starts narrating, I was able to overlook  the terrible voice acting at first. I was still in awe at the atmosphere, and hanging onto the reviews that some gaming sites gave the game. To clarify, I'm not sure that it is just because he did a terrible job, but his actual voice was not proper for this story. It just didn't sound believable-at all.\nWhile this started to frustrate me, I became more frustrated with the idea of having to click the same items over and over and over and over again. I am not exaggerating either. There was so much different dialogue for the same damn item. After clicking it until he started to repeat himself, you would think you were done with that item-nope! Walk around the cabin a bit and what seems to be randomly, the same item elicits different dialogue, and then again, and again, and again. Are you getting the idea yet?\nTo ice the cake, there is no pause, and if you try to pause it via hitting the escape button (like every other game's menu/pause normally pops up) it will close the game, and you have to start all over again! Seriously? Now I understand this game was free and I really do appreicate developers that work their a$$ off to bring us cool free stuff. I can also tell that a lot of work went into this game. Sadly it fell flat with a jumbled story, that consisted of WAY too much dialogue, that was poorly narrated.

But you appear to have some memory problems.  You do not know how long you have been waiting for her. But as you continue to explore your little cabin, you start to realize that maybe there is a reason she is gone.\nThe colorless graphics are perfect for telling this kind of story, which gets creepier and creepier,\nThe sounds are just the bare necessities like creaking floorboards, ticking clocks and of course: the voice acting (which is not bad).\nThe controls are very simple.  You move your mouse around & click on various objects to hear the husband narrate various thoughts & memories.  He will have multiple things to say about nearly everything you find in the house.  As you examine the right combination of items to trigger key memories, things in the cabin will start to change, unlocking new memories & objects to examine until you uncover the truth.\nThe game is very short, it takes less than an hour if you listen to everything.\nSerena is a short and simple game, but somehow kind of beautiful.\nIf you have spare time and do not know what you could play, you could try Serena but don't expect too much.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 2/10\nAtmosphere 6/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","February 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

There's maybe an hour of play in which you'll mainly be listening to dialog within the beautifully rendered cabin in which the game is set, which may sound dull, and if i'm honest after about 5 minutes that was my impression, but the way the main character's disposition changes as the story develops is excellent and by the end I was hooked.

It can take less than 1 hour, and that is actually a lot, considering it starts and ends in such a small place. Everything you need to play this is a mouse, nothing else. Rather than just finishing it, Serena tries to focuse you on its story:\n\nYou remember you had a wife, but you don't have any other memories of her other than that - you can't even imagine her face. In order to remember her again, you will have to examine various mementos around the house that will uncover more than just your wife's face...\nWhat makes this story interesting is something that you will see once you start making progress. I would say, it is decent, and reminds me of one of my favorite games, Silent Hill 2.\n\nIn addition, if you stand still for a small period of time, you will receive a hint in where you should look.\n\nAesthetically, the game doesn't really reveal anything new; the graphics, although not bad, could've used a bit more of detail. I actually liked how the house is made out of wood, almost fully painted with faint brown. It resembles the real nature of the protagonist in some way.\n\nBut there are some points within the game that affect it negatively.\nThey aren't exactly bugs, but issues that can be improved.\nThese points are:\n\n1. No pause screen. Pressing escape will just close the game without saving any progress you could've made. There isn't even a start menu, and Serena will automatically shut itself down once the credits end.\n\n2. Voice acting is below average. Regardless of the surprises you go finding throughout the game, the protagonist seems to be barely surprised at all. A special example is when you open the closet.\n\n3. Fading texts. Once you finish a speech from any element, and yet you click again to keep the speech going, it will restart. Since you can always keep clicking to repeat it, the fact that subtitles fade after some period of time becomes a problem, as they can block your view with ease.\n\nLast of all:\n\nThere's also this: It relies on you if you want to play the game until the very end; while the story is well-thought, the gameplay can still become very boring after a short time, specially if you get stuck; in order to progress you would have to pay special attention to what the protagonist says about each object. Going through that process is not pleasing.\n\nOverall, Serena is not bad, but would need a bit more of polishing.\n\nIt's still a good title to spend time on; it's also free to play.\n\nI recommend it.","June 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hate the feeling that I can't really control what the character is doing. Horror games are the worst, getting away with cheap jumpscares that you have no control of. Serena was an exception.\n\nSerena is not a horror game. It is not scary...but it does give off an eerie, yet appropriate, feeling as you stumble around the cabin.\n\nYou walk around your decaying cabin, discovering items that spark memories back into you. Where is Serena? What did she look like? I can't quite remember...\n\nThe quiet that you face in the cabin (with the exception of a ticking clock) is unsettling. Our protagonist slowly makes connections that ultimately lead to our solution. However, if you're like me, you've probably figured out what's going on before the game ends.\n\nThe game doesn't take that long to play, so if you have half an hour, you should be able to complete it.\n\nThe only problem that I believe the game faces is, like most point-and-click adventure games, you may reach a point where you have no idea what to do. You've clicked on everything ten times over and are running around trying to find the next connection. (The game features different dialouge on the same items, so you could click a chair three times and get a different response from our protagonist) Other than that, this game is worth your time, especially since it is free.\n\n","February 17, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now that I dreamed of this game after finishing it, I feel compelled to writing a recommendation.\n\nSerena is a short exploration game with emphasis on narrative design. As opposed to Gone Home, which brought many haters due to its price tag, Serena is completely free, so nobody can complain here. You basically explore the same room over and over again, while your character undergoes several emotional changes, slowly understanding what actually happened.\n\nThe narration is cleverly integrated into the exploration and the emotional response can be quite intense. This is one of those "a game for an evening"-games and as it is free, you can't complain, you'd gone into the cinema for the same price. Free doesn't come without setback, though. While the graphically, the game might not look too bad and delives the dark atmosphere well, the sound design is dreadful and the voice acting could have been a -lot- better. Especially the recording quality of Serena's voice is horrible and always brutally kicked me out of my into the story immersed state.\n\nYet, as mentioned several times, the game is free, one can overlook these flaws. Yet I can't help but think, that some polishing here and there would intensify the atmosphere immensely.\nRecommended nonetheless, because it delivers an strong emotional experience for the small price of free.","March 1, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Serena is a "love letter to the adventure game community", as stated by developer Senscape. I cannot begin to describe how emotionally charged this game is. It will intrigue you, mystify you, and shock you to the point of shaking. At least, that was my experience.\n\nSerena puts you in a wood cabin in the middle of a forest. Your wife, Serena, is not there with you. Why? Hopefully something in the cabin will make you remember...\n\nAs with most point-and-clicks, the game is entirely played with the mouse. You click on objects, and the main character will give a short comment. I highly recommend exhausting all the dialogue, as the voice acting is terrific.\n\nBe prepared for a short session however, as completion time will take about 20 minutes to an hour, depending on your level of immersion. It is worthwhile though. Short, but sweet, as some would say. The best part is that it's completely free, so I urge you to try it out.","January 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But this game, doesn't necesarily do anything wrong... but they do a lot of things, for lack of a better term, lacking in potential. It feels an awful lot like a Twilight Zone episode, building up a plot of a man and a wife, who live in a cabin in the middle of the woods. The man is a introvert while the wife, you don't really get to learn too much about her character (minus the main character is her husband) except that she is unhappy with something. The man's unconciderate personality, living in books and studies, ignores what her attempts to tell him why she was this way.\nThe story picks up as you try and find out where your wife is, while never leaving the cabin... Then, to add to more problems, you get to keep clicking on random objects around the house - over and over and over again... Given, that practically every time that you do click on it, it does say somehting new... But it is clicking after clicking after clicking...\nThis game went for a psycheological aproach where it messes with the main character's mind and he becomes ever more angry at the sittuation and the objects in the room. But it does it to the point where you need to keep revisiting objects in order to piece together a memory that may give reason to where the character's wife is.\nThere were no glitches or crashes when I played through the game, so that is plus wihtout being said.\nAt the end of the game I felt displeased. Entertained. But displeased needless to say.\nI played the game through but whether it has alternate endings or not, I did not find it worth my time to go back and play through the game, again.\n\nIt is a descent "one time play-through", but I am glad that it was free...\nI'd barely give it a 2/5","February 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That said, the story is presented in such a way that the journey is still enjoyable. The voice acting is pretty well done which is good, because otherwise the game would not have been effective.

You start completely confused, not knowing what is happening. The man you are seems very confused and has trouble remembering the events that have happened, so you must explore and examine every aspect of the cabin, finding objects that begin unlocking memories, which then lead to more examination opportunities.

I love point and click games because they make me feel like a snoop.  The main character tells you different things about all the items that he can interact with.  Memories associated with them.  It seemed a little dull at first and then that quickly changed.  This game is very psychological.\n\nYou're in a cabin that's basically one large room.  There are several things that you can look, drawers to open and look through.  The atmosphere really fits as the game progresses.  Little things that he says that seemed unimportant begin to have more of an impact as you start to recover memories alongside him.  Not to mention there are only two peices of artwork in the cabin.  I'll let you see those for yourself.\n\nThere are some funny parts to the dialouge at times.  The bookshelf is one of my favorite points of interest.  The titles are hilarious and if you click a few times to get him to speak at one point he says "I didn't lend out my copy of the Necronomicon did I?"  If any of you have played the game Scratches take note of the easter egg in the second shelf.  There is a book that will look familiar that is laying on top of the other books.\n\nI'll certianly be playing through it again to see if there is a different ending, or if I missed anything.  Bottom line, this game is a great way to spend an hour.  And it's free.

At first, noticing its a point and click, made me think ''ok it might be ok but will probably get boring pretty fast'' but the story sucked me in!\n\nBasically youre a man in a cabin who is depressed and missing his wife who has mysteriously left and you are unsure of why she left or if she is coming back. You start completely confused, not knowing what is happening. The man you are seems very confused and has trouble remembering the events that have happened, so you must explore and examine every aspect of the cabin, finding objects that begin unlocking memories, which then lead to more examination opportunities. Eventually your mood as the character goes from depressed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and angry. Then the story takes a huge twist and the ending is wonderful.\n\nThe graphics were well done for a point and click game. The twist and the graphic nature of it actually made me feel his emotions, which was great. If a game can make me feel as crazy and sad as this guy feels about what hes finding out, you won my vote lol. I don't need great graphics or amazing gameplay. Its the story and impact of emotions.\n\nWell done! Hope to see more in the future.","January 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

He vaguely remembers that he used to live with his wife. You basically point and click the various objects in his cabin to progress the story. Each object giving more and more memories to the man.\n\nThis game is more of a piece of art, if anything at all. It tells its story through digging through objects and looking around the man's cabin. The haunting aura kept my heart beating the entire time.\n\nWas it fun? Yes, if you enjoy exploring.\nPlus, this is free. If you got an hour to kill, try this game out. Great story, and great voice acting for a small game.

It's free, and overall is amazing. Great music, great story. Throw in a few achievments and trading cards and I'd even consider buying it. However, it has big pluses and big minuses. On the up side, the music is great, the story is great, and in terms of point and click, there no stupid puzzles. One part or two parts felt predictable, but turned out differently than expected.\nThere's a lot to explore and alot of content to such a small and impactful game - great, but some of the things aren't defined from other objects and are almost pixel-hunt feeling, which can means you can easily end up missing a few things - bad.\nThe voice acting, although good, is just that. Good. Not great, which drew me back slightly since everything else is done very well. Also, I guess it's supposed to feel like you're pacing around a cabin, but it just starts to feel repeative. It's buggy, not having an alt+tab feature or any options. Make sure your volume is ok before you start.\n\nOverall amazing game and definitely worth playing, with mostly only mechanical issues being biggest draw back.","January 30, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

But this game, doesn't necesarily do anything wrong... but they do a lot of things, for lack of a better term, lacking in potential. It feels an awful lot like a Twilight Zone episode, building up a plot of a man and a wife, who live in a cabin in the middle of the woods. The man is a introvert while the wife, you don't really get to learn too much about her character (minus the main character is her husband) except that she is unhappy with something. The man's unconciderate personality, living in books and studies, ignores what her attempts to tell him why she was this way.\nThe story picks up as you try and find out where your wife is, while never leaving the cabin... Then, to add to more problems, you get to keep clicking on random objects around the house - over and over and over again... Given, that practically every time that you do click on it, it does say somehting new... But it is clicking after clicking after clicking...\nThis game went for a psycheological aproach where it messes with the main character's mind and he becomes ever more angry at the sittuation and the objects in the room. But it does it to the point where you need to keep revisiting objects in order to piece together a memory that may give reason to where the character's wife is.\nThere were no glitches or crashes when I played through the game, so that is plus wihtout being said.\nAt the end of the game I felt displeased. Entertained. But displeased needless to say.\nI played the game through but whether it has alternate endings or not, I did not find it worth my time to go back and play through the game, again.\n\nIt is a descent "one time play-through", but I am glad that it was free...\nI'd barely give it a 2/5","February 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a first person point of view and all you will do is point, click, and hear/read everything the character say/think.\n\nThe minimalism of this game coupled with the intense stream of consciousness, that immerses us in a feeling of suspense, reminded me a little bit of Hitchcock's films. Its minimalis opposes and juxtaposses with the grandiosity of the work (a work of art, indeed) just as the way as the Master of Susupense.\n\nThe entire game is in a cabin. The main character barely have memories about his lovely wife, Serena, and he made everything that is possible to remind what did happen between them. As he recalls all the events of their relationship, the history guides us to an creepy climax and a great ending.\n\nI think this game can, and must, be used as a good approch of the common player to artistic games like Dear Esther, Dinner's Date and The Path, for exemple.\n\nNow, I can only thank the developers for having it available this masterpiece for free. It is a great gift, indeed. I would pay for a game like this.","March 3, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The time it takes for you to finish is less than an hour but the time it takes for you to stop thinking about the ending and the entire story itself is more than a week. If you're looking for a horror game with jumpscares, loud sounds, and combat, "Serena" is not for you. The reason it's classified as "horror" is because of the way the player can perceive the story and events that take place. Immersing yourself in the story can and will cause chills to be sent down your spine, anxiousness, and maybe even fear. I would definitely reccomend this game if you're the kind of person more interested in the "psychological horror" category.","December 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's free, and overall is amazing. Great music, great story. Throw in a few achievments and trading cards and I'd even consider buying it. However, it has big pluses and big minuses. On the up side, the music is great, the story is great, and in terms of point and click, there no stupid puzzles. One part or two parts felt predictable, but turned out differently than expected.\nThere's a lot to explore and alot of content to such a small and impactful game - great, but some of the things aren't defined from other objects and are almost pixel-hunt feeling, which can means you can easily end up missing a few things - bad.\nThe voice acting, although good, is just that. Good. Not great, which drew me back slightly since everything else is done very well. Also, I guess it's supposed to feel like you're pacing around a cabin, but it just starts to feel repeative. It's buggy, not having an alt+tab feature or any options. Make sure your volume is ok before you start.\n\nOverall amazing game and definitely worth playing, with mostly only mechanical issues being biggest draw back.","January 30, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

At least different to any I've seen. I quite enjoyed this game but i wouldn't call it a horror game, it's more... creppy. I do like that creepy painting that you see in the screen shots. I really had to nitpick to find issues with this game.\n\nGood stuff first:\nI liked this game, not because it's fun but because it felt more like a book or short indi film. The game is story heavy and you have to peace it togeather yourself considering you have no memory of what happened... like in Amnesia: the dark decent... moving on! The overall graphics are great, i saw no flaws nor breaks in textures, This really helped my immersoin thoughout the game. Hell, even the light is god damn beautiful. Graphics can make or break a game, so to see the devs do such a great job is an experiance in itself. The sounds and overall music are good even though I didn't pay much attention. I mean, you make up your own mind about this game. No really, this game is free, just go play it.\n\nNow the not so good stuff:\nThis was the first thing i picked up on: controls and movment, I know this point an click but moving around is like those old Escape the Room flash game, this really annoys me. Not only that but the mouse feels reall floaty, and I mean like you're moving it underwater. Fortunatly they have the option to use the WASD keys to look around... yeah those are worse then the mouse. I'm not going to get strated on the WASD contorls, but there's one more thing: the main character. Holy crap biscuts he's insensitive, so insenitive he forgets what his own wife looks like. Talk about cold hearted. Not only that but if you click on something enought he'll go into a loop of things he's said. this isn't normally a bad thing but if your game is this story heavy at least make him say something like: "I've nothing more to say about this,"\n\nOverall: go play this game even if you aren't a fan of point and clicks or "horror" game. Really I feel it's just plain old creepy. You're alone in a dusty old cabin somewhere in the forest with slight amnesia... Either I give this four out of five creepy paintings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/recommended/272060/","nekobun","nekobun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekobun/","1568 products in account","Serena offers a compact, slowly darkening tale of one man's relationship and its progress over time, as told by a cabin full of his memories of their time together. Despite being constrained to only a couple of rooms' worth of space, the tale that unfolds as you pore over mementos is touching, thought-provoking, and more than a little bit scary come its climax.\n\nUnder the premise of waiting for your wife for a romantic weekend at your cabin retreat, your character begins reminiscing about his time in his marriage, rolling off anecdotes left and right. As these tales go on, subtle changes begin to transform the cabin's interior, revealing new information as you re-inspect things and eventually making it clear that everything is not quite what it seems.\n\nIt's difficulty to say much about this without spoiling things, but be sure to keep checking everything over and over; I got hung up for a bit because new stories got tied to the same item rather closely to one another, and I didn't think to check said item a second time so soon.\n\nEven if you do get a bit hung up, Serena is super-short, and given its lack of a save function, the game's clearly meant to be played in one session. It's certainly not anything revolutionary, but given the price, you can't really go wrong with giving it at least one run-through. If anything, I'd recommend more than one, as I'm still not entirely clear on what went down.","January 10","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is for you sake more than it is mine, because I'm saving you an hour of your time. So this game started oit incredibly weak, then built it's way up. I started to geuinely enjoy it. There were mysteries to be solved. It gave you just enough information to begin piecing things together, but not so much that you had your answer. You play as a writer, name not given, as he patiently awaits his wife at the cabin. The thing that kept me playing was the thing where he would talk about patiently awaiting the love of his life, and occasionally break off into how he missed her so much... How he'd do anything to see her again but realistically knew it couldn't happen. It reminded me a lot of Silent Hill 2, and as a very avid fan of the orignal Silent Hill games, it gave me a damn good feeling. Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that after a while, all this untapped love and immense amounts of nostalgia turned into bitter hate. He talks about burning her clothes, how much he hates her and how vein she is. It turns violent. Fast. Something happened between the main character and his wife Serena. They never really tell you what happens. He talks about pouring salt down her throat until she vomits. Throwing entire bookshelves into the damn lake. You hear the voice of Serena once you look at certain objects; going from sweet and loving to angry and hate filled. Now, before long, after finding a jewelry box in a trunk and setting it down on the wooden table, you have to go to the ama- amair- dammit I don't speak French. You go to the big old dresser right next to the bed and there's a dead body. By the way, Mr. "I'm a writer so I have to use unnecesarrily big words" Goes into a horrible fit of rage earlier in the game, the likes of which are usually reserved for insulted Russians and Patrick Kane after a cab driver forgot to give him the extra $0.25 to his change from cab fare. (I wouldn't lie to you. Look it up.) So, you hear voices and there's a dude and a chick. They talk about bulldozers taking down the cabin and how the female left something in the cabin. (I thought it was the body but she said she wore it. I dont think many people can slip into a dead body like it were some type of dress.) The female voice is very obviously Serena. They then set the place on fire and the credits roll, leading to a more disappointing ending than Arkham Origins. It also leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Who was the dead body? Who was the stiff Serena was talking to? Why did they set the cabin on fire? Why didn't the main character remember anything? Why was he even in the cabin in the first place? Did Serena invite him there so she could kill him? What bulldozers? Why bulldozers? Why does the same damn spot on the floor make an ungodly amount of creaking sounds? Is there a sercret there? I'm not just being dumb and skipping over things here. I spent an entire hour exploring every possiblity in the game. These questions and more are left unasked. I'll hand it to them though. The creators did do a pretty good job of making an overall somewhat creepy atmosphere. It'd grow oddly darker for no reason. There is a picture of Serena on the table, the face is first scratched out, but before long you can see her face there. Soon, the face is scowling. Noises, whispers, voices; whenever you make some type of revelation. But besides that massive ♥♥♥♥♥ don't waste your time.","August 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloneClooney/recommended/272060/","CloneClooney","Clone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloneClooney/","118 products in account","Genre: Point & Click\n\n2/10\n\nStory: The game starts off with a man thinking about Serena (which we find out a bit later was his wife) and how he remembered her but not her face. As you progress, he goes from sounding like a really creepy stalker to some dudebro who got rejected and placed on the "friendzone" with his hatred of Serena. The story progresses within a total of around 10 minutes while clicking on random things. The ending was the most confusing part, play it to find out because I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what is even going on.\n\nVisuals: It's alright? Nothing bad but nothing good, it's just bland with shades of gray and brown. There's a porn mag though, so there's that.\n\nSounds & Voice Acting: The sounds were alright, creakiness of an old cabin gave it a feel that the rest of the game didn't. The voice acting I felt came off as shakey and just downright awkward and creepy at times. Not creepy in a scary way, creepy as in a brony trying to hit on you type of way. Fedora and all.\n\nFor a free to play game, there isn't much of a risk to playing this. If you need to waste a few minutes and don't give much of a care what is going on, play it. If you're in it for a decent story that you are able to follow along with, I'd skip it. There's a "plot twist" near the end but I'm sure you will already see this coming as you soon start this game. If you're looking for a horror game, this is not it. This is more of a mellow psycological thriller that doesn't have much of a build up. If you're looking for a better game, try Gone Home. The story, voice acting and overall feel of the game is great as this one is lacking.","August 19, 2014","false","1.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

In Serena you play as un un named man who is visint a cabin from his past because he wants to relive the memories of his wife Serena, but then everything goes wrong and the events are darker. But is it any good ? The game is played in a point and click format. Its pretty simple but the game turns complex pretty quickly. The game has no puzzles what so ever and all you do is go around the cabin and click on items to hear the story of the man and Serena. The game is a pretty disturbing journey from the begging to the end. The game has a really eerie atmosphere and it gets disturbing real quick, but the game has many bugs that keep the game from beeing good. Some bugs include you not going where you need to and then when clicking on the items you will not hear the story youre supposed to hear. But the game has great writing that might keep you on the edge of youre seat until the end.

You walk around a log cabin and click things until something happens.  Once all the things happen the games over and at no point are you ever made to feel anything for any of the characters involved.\n\nNo skill or brainpower required for this "game", just click until it's over.\n\nIf you want a real adventure game with a vague plot about a man walking around a cabin, go and play Anna instead.  However there is a lot of talent on display here so I'll look foward to the day that Senscape make a real game.","February 13, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplay consists of exploring a cabin, examining items and letters with narration. I did get a little bored with things towards the end of my first round of the cabin, but the plot promptly kicked in and I was pretty rapt for the rest of the time. Also, this game is freakin' beautiful. Everything is very, very visually-detailed which certainly adds to the player's immersion into the world. Due to the point-and-click nature of the game, it takes relatively little power to run. My playthrough took 76 minutes; I explored the cabin completely during each section of the plot, and watched credits.","February 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In about 60 minutes one experiences a truly involving and disturbing maelstrom of a story and all that in one (!) little cabin in the woods. But only if you let yourself in on this trip and be at least a little patient and open minded.

Gameplay consists of exploring a cabin, examining items and letters with narration.

Also, this game is freakin' beautiful. Everything is very, very visually-detailed which certainly adds to the player's immersion into the world. Due to the point-and-click nature of the game, it takes relatively little power to run.

There seems to be no menu, but I've figured out that left-clicking changes camera movement and that pressing the space bar highlights things that you can click on. Also don't press escape, that will automatically close the game, there are no saves, and they don't tell you anything. Besides that, the ambiance and suspense were definitely well done. I was pleaseantly surprised to not have a jump-scare shoved in my face. The story was definitely predictable, I totally called it except for that last part at the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/recommended/272060/","IxianMace","IxianMace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/","57 products in account","At its core, Serena is a point and click story game, with the player interacting with objects in order to hear the protagonist deliver his thoughts relating to that item. In this way, the game tells a story through the character's monologue, as he recalls the events which occurred within the cabin the game is based in. Yes, this entire game takes place within a single cabin, and while this may seem limiting, I feel that it's what makes the way the story is delivered so impressive.\n\nThe game opens up into the first person perspective of a man sitting in a cabin. There is no menu and there are no options to adjust; the game begins immediately upon launch. I don't feel that this detracted from the accessibility or usability of the game too much (if at all), since the game doesn't really need much customization, though at times, I felt the lighting within the cabin was a bit dark or obscure, and could have appreciated an option to adjust in game brightness.\n\nSerena competently demonstrates that there are many ways to view the same thing. An item is just that; it has no meaning until we give it one, and this is subject to change depending on our experiences.\n\nVoice acting is delivered with appreciable and believable emotion, which really helped me to connect with the mental state of the characters. An equally well done soundtrack only serves to complement the atmosphere and emotion of the game.\n\nHad it not been for the surprisingly engrossing story, Serena would just be another point and click problem solving game, requiring the player to find objects and interact with them in a specific manner or order. The moving story, well delivered audio, and competent writing that has gone into this short game make it one of the better point and click games around. I found myself actually wanting to hear what the character had to say about all the items in the cabin as the story progressed, rather than just trying to find the next trigger to proceed further.\n\nAs a free, short, story telling game, Serena is at least worth a look, if not the hour or two you may spend finishing it.","January 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This "game" may only have an hour and a few minute's worth of gameplay, but the impression it leaves on you lasts for quite a long time.\n\nIn "Serena", we see through the eyes and thoughts of the narrator (unnamed husband), waiting in a worn-down cabin, isolated in nature, for the eventual-return wife. As he waits, he/we go through his and her belongings, prompting both good and bad memories of his love life; it is then that we discover more...\n\nAlthough admittedly, the voice-acting is something akin to letting Mickey Rooney narrate an animated movie or Lorenzo Music, it does have its own charm. The developers working on "Serena" have mentioned an update that may add some small surprises into the game a few days ago (at the time of this writing prior), which means this probably won't be the last time  this blogger  will be replaying this. Interaction is one of  this blogger's  my favorite elements in a video game, As every action stacks and pieces the story together, bit by bit, tempting you to look at everything interact-able for little clues to the whereabouts of Serena. For those looking for a sight-seeing point n' click game, this is a welcoming title. You're not going to be "trying it out", you will indulge in it.\n\n8/10\n\nPS: The playtime is wrong because I played the game on Steam Online mode while I had no internet, so it didn't accumulate it or something - I played for roughly 2 hours.\nNote: First version got lost, after FireFox decided to crash - this is the half-arsed replica version of the review.","February 18, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not a bad experience, it was a fast download and it did genuinely feel creepy.","January 30, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/recommended/272060/","IxianMace","IxianMace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IxianMace/","57 products in account","At its core, Serena is a point and click story game, with the player interacting with objects in order to hear the protagonist deliver his thoughts relating to that item. In this way, the game tells a story through the character's monologue, as he recalls the events which occurred within the cabin the game is based in. Yes, this entire game takes place within a single cabin, and while this may seem limiting, I feel that it's what makes the way the story is delivered so impressive.\n\nThe game opens up into the first person perspective of a man sitting in a cabin. There is no menu and there are no options to adjust; the game begins immediately upon launch. I don't feel that this detracted from the accessibility or usability of the game too much (if at all), since the game doesn't really need much customization, though at times, I felt the lighting within the cabin was a bit dark or obscure, and could have appreciated an option to adjust in game brightness.\n\nSerena competently demonstrates that there are many ways to view the same thing. An item is just that; it has no meaning until we give it one, and this is subject to change depending on our experiences.\n\nVoice acting is delivered with appreciable and believable emotion, which really helped me to connect with the mental state of the characters. An equally well done soundtrack only serves to complement the atmosphere and emotion of the game.\n\nHad it not been for the surprisingly engrossing story, Serena would just be another point and click problem solving game, requiring the player to find objects and interact with them in a specific manner or order. The moving story, well delivered audio, and competent writing that has gone into this short game make it one of the better point and click games around. I found myself actually wanting to hear what the character had to say about all the items in the cabin as the story progressed, rather than just trying to find the next trigger to proceed further.\n\nAs a free, short, story telling game, Serena is at least worth a look, if not the hour or two you may spend finishing it.","January 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an overly sentimental story about a man and his musings about his relationship with the titular Serena.  The problem with this story is you really aren't given anything about the characters to really care about them so in the end, that is somewhat predictible, you really aren't emotionally drained in the least, which to me makes it a failure because I think that's what the devs were going for.
