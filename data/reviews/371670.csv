You should definitely get this game, it is fun, it handles well and you just need to see the environment for yourself.\n\nThat being said, it isn't a flawless game. Now that I've completed it, I have two major issues with the game:\n\n- Most of the time, you'll get back to a previous checkpoint not because you died, but because you tried to go explore the environment, and you just reached the side of the corridor you were supposed to follow. This isn't much of a problem up until level 6, where checkpoints are scarce and it is not at all obvious where you're supposed to go.\n\n- The biggest issue, I think, is that in the two hours I've played this game, I've actually completed it, collected all orbs and have finished the three bonus levels as well.\n\nWith that in mind though, I definitely recommend the game, I had fun with it. If it goes on sale, I'd say it's a no-brainer.","June 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","2"

So you roll around a whole bunch and are like hey what's that fun shiny blue pebble soul shard looking thing and sure enough you're all like oh my that must be part of my soul so you roll towards it and do a fun jump move and then boom it disappears into what I can only assume to be is your pebble body and you then become a little bit smarter and faster maybe I can't really tell as I'm totally smack dab wasted beyond anything most of you mortals can even understand. Anyhoo if you fall down one of the holes in the world some kind of god-like protector of all things pebble swoops down and picks you up and sets you back down a few feet back from where you were which is kind of nice I'm sort of hoping that he's your emperor-pebble that you're on your way to becoming as he looks like a fun mask that ancient people would wear when they were on their way to have a wedding or a funeral or a sacrifice I guess it's alright yeah? Got me? Awesome. Now as for level length I was just at the point on the first level where I was all like wow mate is this ever even going to end and then LITERALLY right when I thought that I reached the ending so I'd say that it's about perfect level length wise. It's also pretty pretty JYNX MY SNIKAH crud now I can't talk anymore. Nah I’m just messing with you, anyhoo it's also a pretty pretty game i'd say since its all cryengine up the wazoo so you're not looking at some sillyness it also runs pretty well but that might be because I have a better computer than probably 99% of people reading this. I mean if you like platforming pebbling rolly games I'd say get this one yeah it's alright yeah I'll finish it sooner or later yeah? Yeah!","May 14","true","0.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","23","27","4","1"

You get 6 atmospheric main + 3 bonus levels, which can be pretty challenging. (Optionally you can collect orbs.) It might be a short, but very well made lovely game. You gain new abilities as you proceed further.

One of them is the Sun God! You will now represent this god through the ball of magic stone in this stunning 3d environment.\n\nRolling Sun is a platformer/ adventure game where you are in control of the ball of magic stone. You will have to show your skill to manoeuvre this globe through obstacles in these well-designed levels. This is all about dexterity and timing. Let me elaborate a little bit about it. . .  the physics of the ball are really well done and every small or subtle movement you make can determine really quickly whether you succeed a hurdle or have to start all over again.  On each level you will have to get all the orb stones without falling down crevasses or touch water and you will….. Guess what!! Do it again!\n\nYou will be able to make your ball jump and this can led you to interesting situations, especially with these floating round platforms! These are very tricky to negotiate as they lean backward or forward if you do not land straight in the middle of them, which can influence whether or not you have to start all over again. Reach the end of a level and you will get a new ability.\n\nI am extremely impressed with the presentation of this game - graphically it is stunning. From the control point of view, either you use the keyboard or the gamepad; they are sensitive and will take you a little bit of time to get use to them but they are fine. The soundtrack is very good, too, and fits the game very well.\n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Very well-designed levels\n-	Stunning graphics\n-	Very well priced\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No achievements or trading cards\n-	No indicators to find out how many orbs you have to collect\n\nRolling Sun is very well presented with stunning graphics. A different and enjoyable platformer/ adventure game. Worth having in your game library!\n\n7.9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Discovered it much later.\n\nIf I had to describe the game with one word only: CUTE.\n\nThe game is CUTE. Graphics are very nice (cryengine is well used and runs smooth), level design is sweet (very Trine-ish) and gameplay is extremely simple.\n\nYou just go around in a 2.5 D environmente with this 'rolling sun'. You can collect orbs, but the main goal is just reaching the end of the levels. At the end of the level you get a new 'power' that keeps things spicy and interesting.\n\nThis is a great game for kids or for anyone who likes simple games....and in this case it has also wonderful graphics which is a nice plus.\n\nNotes: it supports 360 controller, it supports ultrawide. Graphic settings are very limited (low-medium-high presets, resolution, nothing else) and the game feels quite indie-ish (cryengine default loading screen, for instance) but is really well made.","March 27","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It takes awhile to truly master the feel of your rolling ball but its rewarding when you do. This game is predominately side scrolling but does move have sections of into the screen scrolling. I haven't finished it yet but it looks like 6 levels with 3 bonus levels. It may be more but the main menu screen suggests this.

You'll roll through some pretty envionments but that's really all there is to it.  Challengers seem to be more co-incidental than by design.  And are mostly the challenge is caused by the camera.  The ball is centered in the screen even though every stage scrolls to the right.  At speed you can jump significantly further than the amount of screen that can be seen.  This is a problem because it reduces landing to luck.  Or rolling very very slowly.\n\nThe physics sections are silly, I'm on the third of what looks like six stages (in less than half an hour) and nothing I've encounted so far has needed more thought than mashing the jump button.  As long as a piece of stage mesh has been touched you can jump again so wall climbing is doable.  With that said the physics on the floating rafts is annyoing because they bob up and down quite fast; and impart interia when jumped off making it impossible to judge far you'll jump.\n\nThere are switches in the game.  There should not have been switches in the game.  Rolling into a swtich triggers a long switch rotation animation which is bad.  Worse is that whatever is switched doesn't start animating until after the switch animation is over.  This makes it easy to trigger a swtich, wait, roll out of the switch and then roll down a hole because the platforms raised by the switch are still raising.  What was the point?  Everyting switchable could have been left permanently in place without the aggravation of having to switch it\n\nThere is no gameplay challenge.  There is no fail condition.   You can fall down holes as often as you like, you'll be placed back at the start of the jump afterwards.  There are blue balls to collect but no indication of how many you need to collect - if any at all.  There is no timer so there is no time pressure.  Roll slowly and you should have no problem at all.\n\nLastly I've run into a few glitches in the short time I've played.  Big red textures saying replace me, getting stuck behind the far side of the level.  And still having ball control whilst being rescued from a hole.  When given the strafe power-up the jump button re-binds from A to Y and strafe left becomes A; which is confusing.\n\nAll-in-all Rolling Sun is not a game I'd recommend unless you're looking for something very laid back.","August 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","1"
