You do this by altering the wind strength, which always blows toward their destination, and by dragging your mouse through the sea to create currents.\n\nThis sounds simple enough, but you also have to prevent the ships from hitting rocks and sand bars, and avoiding other dangers like a cyclops throwing rocks at them (you can catch the rocks by clicking on them with the mouse). Additionally you need to direct the boats to statues to unlock gates and there are also bonuses to pick up along the way. Naturally it gets harder as you progress, with newer dangers and more difficult maps to negotiate.\n\nAlthough the graphics are pleasing, the resolution is only 640x480. You have a choice of full screen or windowed.\n\nTo be honest, it's not my type of game and it didn't hold my interest for very long, but it's by no means a bad game. It wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it's fairly challenging and I'm sure some gamers would enjoy it.\n\nConclusion: a decent casual game ideal for a quick play when you don't have much time to spare.","November 7, 2015","true","0.3"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","40","60","3","1"

You'll be creating small physical phenomena on the way of those boats, to save them from harm. In a Greek god way, indirectly and somehow messy, but with the good intentions at heart.\n\nWith the current price and the reality of Steam "greenlight" Augean stables going wild with the really bad things selling great just because they have trading cards on the board... I'd say "The Odyssey: Winds of Athena", or whatever that game calls itself - is a decent project, which is not trying to rip you off, and providing with just enough gaming experience for the small price.\n\nThat is correct, of course, only by comparisons with the weakest part of Steam, all those sleaze stuff that have any value only with cards... If we remember, that almost for the same money we can buy high-quality things like WItcher 1 (where even the optional mini-games are more inspiring than that "Odyssey")... That so many good games of the equal cultural value, as "Odyssey", are freeware from the start... Well, I can't say that I Really Recommend the game.\n\nIt is working, it has quite rare, almost unique game mechanics, it is fairly provides you with the promised puzzle-like gameplay fitting to fill short pauses in your life, like awaiting in the traffic or in some queue... Yeah, that goes mostly as the thing for mobile platforms, and not full-time PC gaming experience.\n\nSo I'll mark the Odyssey as 5.7/10. It is not a bad game, it is fair, costs little, has cards to align the price even more. It provides enough gameplay to fill your hands for some time... yet it is not inspiring enough to really go for it.\nSo if you get it discounted or bundled - that's not a waste.

Your goal is  a simple yet getting progressively more difficult one: Get your ships safely to the exit by manipulating wind/air currents. To finish a level you have to have saved a certain number of ships; stretch goals include an expert rating (save more ships) and a perfect rating (save all ships). While it is pretty easy at first to get perfect rating, pretty soon the difficulty steps up by introducing environmental hazards like sand banks, reefs and even enemies e.g. Cyclops, Harpies (the later can even be used to your advantage and you will have to utilize them at times).\nThe game itself is nice to play in between or to relax. My only gripe is the lack of incentive to go back to levels and try harder at getting expert/perfect rating...achievements would definitely do the trick here.","November 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/416080/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nGod Game: The Odyssey is... difficult to give a standard genre category... the popular tags are: Action, casual, strategy, indie, simulation. But I would create my own genre called "Phone app games" or "minimalist computer requirements."\nGod Game: The Odyssey was developed by Liquid Dragon Studios and released in 2015, you play as the Greek Goddess Athena, your goal is to help guide Odysseus's fleet back home by controlling the wind, and water currents.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: God Game: The Odyssey follows the story of Odysseus returning from the Trojan Wars. ('Ya know, the war all the hackers fought and e-mailed each other the Trojan Virus, there were many a computer casualty lost in these wars. Sad tale really. If I could write music I'd write an "ode to the Trojan Virus Wars".)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597788793\n\nAs the story progresses, you hear more about Greek mythology, which introduces a new mechanic/NPC that you must learn to combatant to successfully pass through the next set of levels.\n\n\nGame Play: There are two core controls in guiding the ships through the various puzzles: Controlling the wind, and controlling the currents. When you use wind, the ships will try to sail directly to the end goal. This sometimes works in your favor if there are no obstacles obstructing your path... if there is something in the way, you will need to click and drag to create "water currents" to guide your boats. (or watch them ignore your currents and go the wrong way. I've actually seen my whole fleet go the wrong way... I showed them by crashing them into the rocks for their insolence!)\nAs the game progresses you need to face giants, tornado's (or were they waterspouts? Same thing), Harpies, Lotus (yes, the flowers are apparently devilish), and much more. The game is very good at pausing and explaining just why you should avoid _____ because _____.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597786086\n\nyou move the ships with two main functions: currents and wind. As the game progresses there are new mechanics that build off these core controls... mostly new mechanics to just frustrate you though.\n\n\nAchievements: There are no achievements for God Game: The Odyssey. But I have seen some forum posts requesting achievements. You REALLY don't want achievements for this game, the only people who will try to get them all are maniac-achievers like myself, and please don't make me get perfects on each levels, that's just madness. (Madness? THIS! IS! ...an over used joke.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597784719\n\nThis is a sample of what it looks like to complete a level, if you do very well you'll get a "perfect" or "excellent" star rating for getting enough points.\n\n\nPrice God Game: The Odyssey is priced at $4.99, I personally like having my games last an hour for every dollar I spent, however, this game started to grind me down after playing through several puzzles. I think it has a fair amount of content, and a fair amount of replay value... but it's best on a mobile device, rather then on a computer.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion... not a bad game, but not a game I personally won't be spending much time playing it. If Achievements are added, I'll be forced to return to Odyssey ...and wish for death because the game can be agonizingly painful at times. However, there is a sense of pride when you complete a puzzle in Odyssey.\nI recommend this to people who enjoy "app-style-games", as well as anyone looking to support an indie game publisher, and lastly people that play games on mobile devices. (It seems like Odyssey was designed for it.)\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update January 14, 2015:\nSo yeah, apparently the spell checker on the text program wasn't either there, or malfunctioned.

Water currents develop depending on your actions, so you must plan your use of wind carefully.\n\nWhile this is a novel idea, it does unfortunately have some major design issues which cannot be overlooked. These include the repetitive, limited set of sounds which can often overlap; but also means playing this game at a very low resolution with no option to alter it.\n\nWith lots of fun ways to interact with the environment, you may find new mechanics that will surprise you. This game will test your multitasking skills, but this game can quickly become frustrating and tedious.

I thought that nothing could go wrong with a 20p investment. I was wrong, oh so wrong.\n\nThe game is structured around you getting boats from point A to point B, e.g. you start with 40 boats and have to get 10 to the exit. This idea is so flawed, firstly due to the fact that you may as well kill the boats yourself if you want them to get anywhere since they often get stuck in annoying places, making you want to commit genocide in order to get to the next mission 30 seconds early. The main score is pretty ♥♥♥♥, exemplified by the fact that it's the only song you’ll hear.\n\nMy favourite thing about this is probably the fact the water looks hypnotically psychadelic to the point where I just ♥♥♥♥ about with water and don’t really do anything with the boats.\n\nPerhaps this game is actually a complex metaphor about the mundanity of life as a Greek; with which your worshiping results in your impending doom and failure as a human beings.

I'm not sure if theres a tablet port but if so I recommend you play it on that device.","February 8","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play god by controlling the oceans and wind and other things.

Say you have 20 boats, you can pass the level by getting 5 boats to the objective without being destroyed, or you can pass the level with EXPERT by getting 15 boats to the end.\n\nDefinitely a cool concept and I would recommend it as an interesting puzzle/RTS.

The player can use wind and water currents to guide a herd of ships to their destinations while avoiding various perils, Due to the force of the elements, the ships are very hard to steer in an exact manner, so the player can only be successful if he thinks a bit forward and plans sweeping fleet movements ahead. Good multitasking is also an advantage as many of the perils can be negated by divine (ie. player) intervention, but leave the ships to their own devices for more than a couple of seconds, and they're bound to stray into their destruction.\nAll the levels so far had adequate solutions - sometimes you can get away with being a bit clumsy if you're lucky, but luck is not required.\nGod Game: The Odyssey is simple but fun, quality entertainment for a few hours. It's worth your money even at the full 2.5EUR price.\n","January 24","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
