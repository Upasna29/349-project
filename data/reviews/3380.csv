Has plenty of modes to keep you occupied for hours.\n\nI'd recommend this if you like puzzle games. Can also be played for free from PopCap's site so if you want you can check it out there aswell.","December 8, 2013","true","1.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

This realisation could, in turn, lead to the revelation that we may not be with a purpose, which in itself could be succeeded by the questioning of basically everything we’ve even known (whether this be a particular format of governmental structure or the motivations for a certain person acting altruistic). Once we lose faith in ourselves, is it really fair to remain faithful to everything else?  We might even begin to question our previous passions and hobbies – to ask ourselves questions such as ‘why does art exist?’ Is it merely a form of distraction to consume our attention long enough for us to forget or ignore our own temporality? Another form of expression to convey various aspects of ourselves, to remain permanent in the minds of many? Or perhaps we, as humans, brought artistry into existence to elevate ourselves above the feral? To separate ourselves more so from the primitives before – a way of demonstrating our own superiority in sentience, if you will. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any of these queries we all will have – I am neither a saint nor a prophet. But what I can achieve is the installation of an idea in the hearts and minds of the many who might read this. An idea to instil hope, joy even. An idea that should hopefully lead some into a brighter and more optimistic version of their current position. This idea being that this particular game is good.","November 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","12","12","4","1"

If you like classic puzzle games like Bejeweled, Tetris, or anything of the like, then you will have a blast with this game. It doesn't have a ton of game modes (only 3) but games like this do not need that many since you will be absorbed rather quickly. Plus it has dinosaurs and dynomite, and who doesn't like that combination?!","April 24, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics are long outdated and you'll have to run it in boxed mode just to not be annoyed by it. The size of the box though, will not be much larger than the screenshot on this page - that small!\nHowever it's a nice game. I played it for the first time back in the 90' and it has the same features now as then. It has four modes; Endless Puzzle, Stomped Puzzle, Fossil Challenge and Time Trial.\n\nIn Endless Puzzle you have to shoot eggs at the eggs pushed down the screen, making matches of three or more, to break them and make them fall before they reach the rope at the bottom. When the sand runs out in the hourglass the dino Whirley will come flapping, trying to add a new colour to the eggs making in more difficult and you have to shoot him down for it not  to happen.\n\nIn Stomped Puzzle the mother dino gets mad when you break the eggs and will lower the roof when her anger reaches the top of the meter. When you clear the screen her anger will go back down and you'll get a new formation of eggs to beak as fast as possible.\n\nIn Fossil Challenge  you get a formation of eggs with a piece of a fossil in it, the goal of the game is to shoot the eggs to make them drop and the fossil along with them. Take too much time and the roof is lowered.\n\nIn Time Trial you have to pop eggs as fast as possible.\n\nOnly buy this if you're really passionate about this game or it's on a really generous sale, you'll kick yourself otherwise.","June 27, 2014","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Despite of having quite some years already I still think it is a game that aged well. It is a fun puzzle game inspired in the dinossaur era with mechanics that are very similar to Puzzle Bobble. There is a classic unlimited mode, a time trial mode (to break a group of eggs the quickest you can), a Stomp Puzzle mode (puzzles to clear areas full of eggs) and a Fossil puzzle, which works as an "adventure" mode where you can collect a fossil part per level of a creature that used to exist in the pre-historical era. All the modes have a difficulty level that you can choose. However, after you complete the Fossil mode, there's nothing much else to do so the game might end up repetitive and boring so do not expect a big longevity. On the other hand, it is a good casual game to play if you have some spare minutes to spend by entertaining yourself with something random. I recommend Dynomite Deluxe to everyone who likes casual puzzle games.","March 1, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You must reset your settings each time you launch the game, plus the scoring is completely messed up compared to the original version.  You play 20 minutes on normal endless, and your score is still really, really low. The game is not as visually smooth as it was on my old computer either. Would I recommend spending 10 bucks on this game without a fix from Steam?
