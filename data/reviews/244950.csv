So understand my feeling when I say that this game is a labor of love, and that it shows in every facet of its design, right down to the oddly (somehow) unique pixel graphics.\n\nThe premise is simple: you have three little monsters, you control them one at a time, and you must guide them each to the exit of each level. There is no time limit, and no serious penalty for death; they simply respawn at the entrance. But here's the tricky bit; the world has become fragmented, though not necessarily broken. You can see the full picture, it's just that the full picture is muddled and confused, with pieces going every which way in no discernible order. Simply reaching the exit of each level becomes more complex, as even a straight pathway can take your monsters to every corner of the screen, or worse, numerous corners all at once.\n\nEach monster has a specific color, which may be required when activating a block or, as you'll later discover, special abilities. Each monster can transform into one of three specific beasties, each with their own special ability necessary to complete a stage. The only one I'll mention is that of our orange monster, who transforms into a bird(?) of sorts and has the ability to shift the fragmented world in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. For the other monsters, this matters little, but for her, she can remain still, while the world swirls around her, allowing her to move to entirely different fragments that may have been unreachable otherwise.\n\nTo reach each end, you must gather a number of hearts strewn about each stage, thereby opening the door. But as you progress, this task slowly becomes more complex, as mechanics more complicated than jumping ledge to ledge are uncovered. The way these mechanics present themselves is a big part of why I enjoy this game so. See, it's never spelled out for you; there isn't a mid-level tutorial message or loading screen hint giving a dry description of how hitting a switch opens doors. The game simply presents you with the opportunity to touch and experiment with things, and these range from the simple (hitting a block with the correctly colored monster) to the complex (learning to properly manipulate the world's fragments). What makes this game special is that even the simplest mechanics are so often used in different and unique ways between each level. I often felt impressed by the simple brilliance of many of the layouts, and how so many of them would educate and influence your actions in the next. It quickly became intuitive to take what I already knew and wonder, "but can I use it this way..?" or, "what happens when I try this".\n\nEach level presents the challenge of gathering every heart without losing a single monster even once, rewarding you with a special heart symbol and, on occasion, an entirely new level. Majority of games, I wouldn't care for such frivolity, but the very clear dedication that went into making each and every level stand out as a unique entity makes the practice of perfecting every single one of them feel very, very worthwhile.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I've completed what I suspect to be over half of the available levels, and I do plan to complete the rest before too long. Should I make any new discoveries in that time that I feel just has to be in this review, I will be sure to make note. That's just how good this game is. I very much want to fully complete this title, and experience every last ounce of thought and love that the developers put into making it. And as someone who typically feels indifference towards these types of games, that says a lot.","May 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 81 of 94 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","81","94","0","5"

The atmosphere the game works to create is very fitting of three little tree spirits on an adventure. The exact story of that adventure is a little hazy as the game tries to tell it wordlessly through the first and last levels and you’d learn more by just reading the steam page description, but the mood is there. Most of my complaints are around the special abilities of the characters. Rainbow spirit if often not as responsive as I’d like to buttons relating to his special abilities and the requirement to jump before rotating yourself out of the puzzle to drop into a new screen sometimes moves you into another screen and your rotation happens from that place instead. Bat king’s ability to find hidden ground to stand on is only useful for him but somehow the hidden holes he finds the others can walk into. Of course, if they stop inside the hole and bat king moves away they’ll phase into solid matter and die. All that said, the game stuck to its cute and childish roots with random amusing sayings from the characters between levels and a lot of effort was put into the puzzles to really utilize all the spirits’ skills and the player’s ability to mentally rearrange the fragmented screens. Clever use of background patterns, made more clear by the pixel graphics, provided ample clues as to how the pieces of the level were actually arranged relative to each other. Overall the game was a cute and short with puzzles that stretch the player’s visualization abilities.","June 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

The idea is simple; the level is split up into several little windows all containing parts of the level, and some of them overlapping each other. So if you walk in a straight line you'll appear in a different window after just a few steps (which can basically be anywhere on the screen), all this while still walking straight, mind you. It's a difficult concept to explain and really needs to be seen in action to understand it all. It's confusing at first, but once it clicks it's one of the best and charming puzzle games you'll ever play.\n\nIt's short, with its 26 levels (2 hours) of gameplay, because it's also the only way to keep the idea fun and fresh. Any longer and it wouldn't have made such an impact. Well, or maybe less anyway.\n\nThere's also a story behind all the puzzling and it too is charming, and even a bit sad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/244950/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Where is my heart? It's a rather existential question that I wouldn't have an immediate answer to. Perhaps with a loved one, or a place I am or long to be; at any one time my heart could be any number of places or nowhere at all, if I'm feeling especially down. Where is my Heart, the game, doesn't concern itself as much with metaphorical musings or heavy philosophical discussion, but all the same invites a certain curiosity to it. Even when saying little, there's a distinct undertone of the developers hinting at something more meaningful than the journey of a trio of monsters to find their magical tree, which feels trapped just beneath the surface longing to get out.\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself, Where is my Heart is a puzzle platformer best summed up as a walk-in sliding puzzle. The world has become shattered, disorganized, split into various sized panes that each show but a part of the whole level. Your objective then becomes one of observation and out of the box navigation, having to traverse an area where walking through one pane rarely puts you on the other side, but instead somewhere entirely different on the screen. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around, even after spending a good deal of time with the game, but as you begin to understand it as a mechanic its brilliance starts to become apparent.\n\nTaken out of context, the levels themselves rarely amount to much, but when splintered into dozens of screens then switched around they become puzzles within themselves. It pushes you to think of abstract paths and tests your memory to remember which panes line up with each other. Adding in a selection of special character powers only adds to the tantalizing challenge, that seems so thoughtfully planned out and lovingly designed. But for all the love and care that evidently went into making WIMH, all throughout the experience it seems almost scared of becoming too clever, or inserting too much personality into the level designs.\n\nThe outcome of this is a game that lacks substance. Levels are enjoyable to navigate but disconnected from each other and unmemorable in their own right. When I saw the end after only two hours, I couldn't help but feel like much of the game was a missed opportunity to use such an original mechanic, which never seemed to evolve past what was seen in the first few levels. This doesn't mean I disliked WIMH, but I was disappointed that it made such shallow use of its design concepts, instead playing it close to the chest with a game that's cute but not especially inspired beyond its core mechanic, and as such will likely fade from my memory rather quickly.\n\nAll that aside, Where is my Heart is still a rather deliciously adorable adventure that is worth undergoing if you can accept it for what it is. The charming ascetic and soothing audio design goes a long way in making up for its underwhelming ambition, to the degree I doubt I could legitimately hate the game even if I wanted to. Much the same as a children book, it's simplistic by nature even to its own detriment, but still incredibly easy to fall in love with and want to revisit again and again.\n\nSo where is my heart? I suppose right now it's being held captive by an enchanting little game that wants so much to love you too, if only for a short while.","May 30, 2014","true","2.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","4"

The pixel art style is gorgeous and the music is soothing enough so that it doesn't become annoying as you listen to it for hours on end. Unfortunately, in the world of indie games, "artsy" has been done a few hundred times already. For a lot of people, this alone will not be the deciding factor.\n\nIts main feature (shattered screen) is fairly unique, but sometimes it ends up feeling like more than just a simple inconvenience. While it's certainly the thing that makes this game in any way challenging, there are times when it makes a jump that's challenging enough on its own absolutely obnoxious.\n\nThe game's main downside is that if you die, you get penalized by making it impossible to collect all hearts in a stage, ultimately forcing you to restart the entire thing if that's what you're after. I'm not entirely sure what was going through Bernie's head when he decided that this was a good idea. To make the whole process even more frustrating, there is no quick restart button or menu option. Every time you wish to restart you have to exit to the stage selection screen and load the stage again, which ends up being a chore after you fail a precision jump by a milisecond for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe story and relationships between the characters feel rather shallow. While I don't necessarily need a story in a simple platformer, I do expect something a little more substantial than what Mario had 30 years ago.\n\nOverall, I find that the game did not live up to its full potential. It's worth playing through if you got it in a bundle, but I wouldn't bother paying the full price for it unless you have nothing else to play.","October 1, 2015","false","5.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/recommended/244950/","whitetigershiro","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitetigershiro/","450 products in account","So what is Where is my Heart?  Is it a platformer?  Is it a puzzle game?  Well, it's a little of both.  Okay okay, so that was a generic opening, but it is what it is.  Where is my Heart is unique among puzzle platformers in that the levels are broken-up into fragments.  As the player explores to the edge of one segment, they must watch the rest of the screen to see which segment the character will be navigating next.  It's a little bit of spice that makes what would otherwise be a bland and straight-forward platforming game into a puzzle, almost in the literal sense as the player is required to look at a jumble of pieces, and try to make-out the greater whole.\n\nStory-wise, I couldn't tell you what's going on.  I remember reading a quick summary on the store page, but the game itself doesn't make much mention of it, and that's fine.  During the game, the player controls one of three members of a monster family.  One looking like a Domo wannabe, one orange thing, and a vampire, because of course there's going to be a vampire.  The player must toggle between them to navigate the levels; using them as stepping stones to reach higher ledges, or unlocking character-specific locks that reveal a passage elsewhere on the level, and even forming a sort of totem to turn the top member into a special spirit beast.\n\nYes, each member can turn into a special spirit beast, and it's often required to do-so in order to complete the level.  The brown monster turns into a forest spirit that can double-jump, allowing him to reach higher platforms; meanwhile the other two members of the family turn into spirits so that he can take them with him.  This allows the player to reach areas that would otherwise require someone to be left behind after being used as a stepping stone without needing to leave anyone behind.  The orange monster turns into a rainbow spirit that lets you rotate the segments while she remains in the same spot on the screen, thus allowing her to skip around the stage (though it has its risks if the player tries to "teleport" into solid ground, or stays in a space without a segment).  Finally, the gray monster (the vampire) turns into a bat spirit that can see hidden passages and platforms that he can use so that the other two can use him as a stepping stone.\n\nThe levels are short, but sweet.  It's a case of quality over quantity, allowing the player to focus on a smaller playing field while trying to figure out how to navigate the heroes to the end goal.  Every level has two goals.  The first is to simply get each hero to the end goal, and the second goal is to collect all hearts without letting anyone die.  The first goal is oftentimes simple enough, where some of the levels will really stretch the player's mind to figure out where that heart with very little context clues in its tiny segment might be hiding in what would otherwise be plain sight if the level wasn't broken-up into scattered segments.  The only real hassle is that once the path to the end goal has been opened up, it can feel like a bit of a chore having to manually walk the other two characters over there to finish the level.  Some levels require the other characters to take a new path, but for most levels it's just selecting the next character to walk the same path three times.\n\nWhat few faults this game has are out-weighed by it's over-all charm, so I can definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good puzzle/platformer.","September 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You're given a sort of fragmented level wherein you try and collect hearts.\n\nThe big problem I have with this game is that if you should die at any point, you basically lose your progress on that level.

I'm not a massive fan of that.\n\nAlso, in a lot of cases the level will rely on trial and error to complete it. Given that there are part where you can figure it out using logic, I don't think that making the player resort to trial and error to figure things out is a good approach to take in your level design.\n\nSo, it's an okay game, but I really think it needs some changes to be truly a good game.\n","February 25","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Eventually the tree becomes miserable, though I haven't gotten so far as to find out what happens when they ingest too many corrupt pumping pixels.\n\nA little later in the game, you're able to add all of your little characters together to create one with special powers. There are specific boxes that you can jump on in different levels. With these boxes, your characters must jump on each other as a tower and make sure a certain colour is on top; (The game itself will guide you with this).\nThe boxes that I've encountered so far are pretty neat. One of them requires the orange character to be on top. This turns him/her into a flying white cube angel that can rotate the map, but will deteriorate if left outside of it for too long.\n\nThe other box, I'll leave you to figure it out.\n\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy this game, even as someone who usually isn't into these sort of styles. It opened me up and did NOT have me wondering where my heart is! :-)","August 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/244950/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Where is my Heart? is an adorable puzzle platformer that puts you in control of three little monsters that happen to be bestest friends. They collect hearts (the cute kind, not the still-beating kind) to feed to their tree friend, but ♥♥♥♥ up and feed him some black hearts. This makes the tree float away and the entire world fracture into scrambled shards.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, this makes getting around kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥. The main gimmick is that you see the levels from a scrambled perspective and have to figure out how each piece relates so you can navigate to collect all the hearts and reach the exit. If this doesn't sound particularly fun, well, it isn't. Not only does it take a lot of mental bandwidth to keep the levels straight in your head, a lot of the links between pieces can't be established without some guesswork or some oftentimes-fatal leaps of faith. You control each monster one at a time, with a dedicated button to switch between them. They don't jump real high, so stacking them to reach high places and make long jumps is a common task.\n\nOther puzzles include getting the monsters to heart blocks colored like them to bonk and release their heart, and making platforms by collecting specific hearts that are not distinguished from the others in any way. Each monster can also turn into a special form by stacking everyone on a special block. The brown one turns into an elk-thing that can double-jump, and the gray one turns into a bat-thing that can see and step on hidden platforms. But the orange one turns into this cloud-thing that can rotate the level pieces to realign them. What's more, if he jumps before doing it, he stays stationary while the level rotates, effectively allowing him to teleport around. This is obviously the coolest gimmick in the game, but the level design turns it frustrating fast. Levels that center on his power often have you performing complex shifting combos to get him into isolated pieces, and if you rotate him into a wall, he dies.\n\nThere are 30 levels that get pretty hard pretty fast. To beat a level you just have to get all three dudes to the exit; the hearts are just for completionists. However, dying subtracts from your heart total, so to 100% a level you have to find all the hearts without dying. I couldn't be arsed to get more than halfway through the game, and that only took 45 minutes. It's cute and has some unique ideas, but is just too irritating to get all the way through.","September 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

You control 3 characters who don't have any special abilities but must climb on eachother to succed and specific ones are required to hit matching color switches.  Some levels provide special blocks which let you give one of the characters a special ability temporarily.  Levels are scored by collecting additional hearts, and a perfect score requires no deaths as well as collecting all the hearts on a given level.  I'm assuming there's some sort of special ending for perfecting all levels but I'm not sure I have it in me.\n\nI don't think I've ever played such a disorienting game, and I mean that in a good way.  It's a unique twist on what would otherwise be a pretty simple puzzle game and it works well.  Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you, the game makes you work for your perfect scores, though strangely neither that nor finishing the game are required to obtain all the achievements.\n\nWhile I recommend the game, I wish it was a bit longer and had a bit more complexity.

Personally, I agree that it is annoying the game is set up to force trial and error, jumping where you don't know to land, and lots of repitition. It is kind of cool how it being slip up plays with your mind and you make mistakes you shouldn't because you're tripped, but that only happens sometimes. Most of the time it's just dumb. The platforming is boring and the game is repetitive. It's mostly just a puzzle game. You are forced to control 3 guys instead of one, to triple the annoyance, and you get just from point A each level to point B. You use the same 3 abilities, and jump on boxes to get hearts. This never changes and gets old fast. It is dumb how there is no ability to sue controllers in a game made for it. Also there is no story. The graphics are terrible. Some of the powers, especially the spinning the level, can be confusing on how to use, and are so finicky because you have to be in the exact perfect position or you will end up in a wall or die, which is annoying.

A few cases you can vaguely piece together the world but a lot of times it's just pure trial and error figuring out where everything is.\n\nThere's one character who can rotate pieces of the world and it's trial and error to figure out where you need to start and end in the map because there's not much indication of where you'll end up.\n\nWhen you start most levels, you have to wait for all three characters to come in from the door, which takes something like 10 seconds, and is unnecessary on almost every level. It's really tedious. Add to that the slow pace of the gameplay and there being no quick restart, and you have got a colossally slow-paced, tedious mess.\n\nI think there's a few shreds of an idea buried in the stack of trash, but I really, strongly recommend not playing this game.

I eventually came back to it. This game is incredibly fun. As the difficulty increased I was worried the puzzles would start to get cheap, but they didn't.  The art is gorgeous and the color scheme is well thought out. The puzzles are also thought out in a way that they are so amazingly balanced with fun factor. My only gripe is the lack of controller support. It's not really an issue considering the use of 2 buttons outside of the left/right arrow keys. If controller support was added I might say this is one of my favorite games as of late. The concept is similar to Thomas was Alone, with  a few new tricks. Someone had mentioned that when you die, you lose hearts, and you need to restart from the main menu for the completionist method. Unless I'm mistaken, you can post one of your little guys by the checkpoint (cave entrance to next level), and when someone dies, the guy you posted will grab your hearts, so you don't lose any. Whoever they hired to create the art/style, high five.","August 24, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I agree that it is annoying the game is set up to force trial and error, jumping where you don't know to land, and lots of repitition. It is kind of cool how it being slip up plays with your mind and you make mistakes you shouldn't because you're tripped, but that only happens sometimes. Most of the time it's just dumb. The platforming is boring and the game is repetitive. It's mostly just a puzzle game. You are forced to control 3 guys instead of one, to triple the annoyance, and you get just from point A each level to point B. You use the same 3 abilities, and jump on boxes to get hearts. This never changes and gets old fast. It is dumb how there is no ability to sue controllers in a game made for it. Also there is no story. The graphics are terrible. Some of the powers, especially the spinning the level, can be confusing on how to use, and are so finicky because you have to be in the exact perfect position or you will end up in a wall or die, which is annoying. The game is just pretty meh, but sometimes it can be fun to figure the puzzle out yourself. Other than that not much to see here.","August 29, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few cases you can vaguely piece together the world but a lot of times it's just pure trial and error figuring out where everything is.\n\nThere's one character who can rotate pieces of the world and it's trial and error to figure out where you need to start and end in the map because there's not much indication of where you'll end up.\n\nWhen you start most levels, you have to wait for all three characters to come in from the door, which takes something like 10 seconds, and is unnecessary on almost every level. It's really tedious. Add to that the slow pace of the gameplay and there being no quick restart, and you have got a colossally slow-paced, tedious mess.\n\nI think there's a few shreds of an idea buried in the stack of trash, but I really, strongly recommend not playing this game. I actually gave up on the first bonus level, which is, no joke, essentially fumbling around mostly blind trying to figure out where the next platform is, and one mistake and you have to restart from the beginning. It's... awful.\n\nIt's just... awful, I'm sorry, there's nothing to like here at all.","August 20, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed the music and fun visual style. If this were a straightforward run and jump it wouldn't be that hard; but having the level mixed up adds an extra challenge. Basically, the game requires you to figure the layout of a level based on several jumbled up frames. However frames that are next to each other are not necessarily contiguous; you might walk out of one frame and fall into a spike pit on the other side of the screen.\n\nEven so, the game is not all that difficult or even very long. It dose include a few challenge levels at the end which are a bit more advanced; but those are just for a bit of added fun. Unless you are a completionist and try to collect every heart, the game shouldn't take you more than a couple hours, if that. Still, this game is a cute break from some of the longer games out there","October 5, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer, but the level layout is scattered and mixed, leading to some confusion on purpose. Besides that, you need to collect hearts and take your 3 guys to the exit in various levels. The game isn't hard, but it can be frustrating at times, for example because it can be hard to measure a jump, which is essential in a platformer. Sometimes you have to do some trial and error. There isn't native controller support either, nor a steam cloud function. My review is neutral for this game, but at least the controls are responsive, so it's completely playable. I only recommend it on sale, but know that this isn't a great or terrible game. 5/10","June 28, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
