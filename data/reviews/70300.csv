"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperCraig64/recommended/70300/","SuperCraig64","SuperCraig64 *Vacation*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperCraig64/","58 products in account","VVVVVV is a platformer. Are you surprised yet? You shouldn't. On with the review:\n\nThis game has caught my attention when it appeared on the Nintendo E-Shop on 2012. Being the person I was, I downloaded the $5 game (on the 3DS that eventually got stolen in 2014). It was worth every buck. The plot is very simple and quite complex when digging for the backstory.\n\nLet's focus on the basic right now: You are Captain Viridian. Your crew has been seperated in a strange, and facinating universe. And it is your job as captain to save them. With the power to flip upside-down, you can explore places where you thought never was possible. That's all you have for a power really: no attack, no special, just flipping. However it's all you need besides skill in this game: as everything can be avoided and can be done without dieing a single time (no joke, everything is. I dare you to get the "Master of the Universe" achivement.). Along the way, you may find "Shiny Trinkets". These come to a good use after beating the game..after collecting all 20. I'm not going to list them or spoil anything since the steam community already did (plus this is a revivew, not a stradigy guide).\n\nThere are 4-5 (depends if you count the Lab areas as one area or two different sections) major areas in the game (not counting the transmission levels or the final level) all that can be accessed from the very large overworld. This brings for a total of 7-8 Levels in the entire game. Again, you have 20 Trinkets hidden in this entire world to search for.\n\nThe music & presentation is just excellent with everything being retro, and it gives that Atari vibe really well. Still, the music is just awesome! Souleye did a great job with creating the wonderful soundtrack for this game, as well as the 3 songs added in one of the updates.\n\nIt's mechanics are quite simple to grasp, such as moving platforms, vasnishing platforms, enemies, you know: the usual. The new comes in with the Warps. There are two types. One where you enter the side of a room, you are teleported to the exact other side. The other is a portal. Quite expected: you would be taken to a particular place in the world. You'll never know where it goes unless you used the portal once or twice.\n\nMust I say the Level Design is very fair, balanced at times, and very devious. How is all of this possible? Simple: Each area has their own "special" quality, including the transmission levels. The Lab, for example, focuses on Gravity Lines and you have to use these to do some flips you thought you wouldn't be able to do. The devious part comes in with some of the enemy placement, spike placement, and even the name of the room. Yes, every single room in the entire game has a name: which for me makes it more enjoyable. "What tricks you have up your sleeve this time?"\n\nThere is a bunch of extra content too: such as Time Trial mode (each time trial is unlocked after beating the actual level ingame), Flip Mode (after beating the game), player made levels that come with the game, and other levels that people in the community made..which brings me to the next topic: the Level Designer.\n\nYou can create your dream levels of pure difficulty or possibly test out a few new things that can or cannot break the game. Again, you are the creator and stuff. Scripting is quite difficult to learn, but it's easy to input them once learned.\n\nIn the end, VVVVVV is a classic game in my steam library that I was glad to experience once again. Would I advise someone like Jirard (aka "The Completionist") to play this game? If you are tough as nails and can handle the challenge of 100% Super Meat Boy (at the very least), this probably be another game down the cake walk. However this can be quite difficult for new players. If you are going to go as far as 100% the game, prepare to die..a lot. You will suffer if you attempt that no-death run. I've only done it ONCE. Just ONCE on my 3DS. Just don't go that far as I did. If your curious, I still love the game even after all of that torture I went through. I know, I am very insanely crazy.","October 25, 2015","true","36.6"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","44","49","9","2"

Platforms are setup in a way that require incredibly precise, conscious flips and movement to surpass, at times feeling almost impossibly difficult. But VVVVVV is never unfair, offering you an abundance of checkpoints and excessively precise controls that caused me to surprise myself with what I was capable of.\n\nThe nonlinear design also allows you to opt out of some of the most challenging rooms, or revisit them later when you feel better in tune with the game. Completing the game will test your mettle regardless, but the sense of accomplishment and the ever present feeling that you can possibly surpass any challenge given just one more time makes it impossible to give up and extremely rewarding when you do eventually succeed (though all the same, "Doing it the hard way" will forever haunt my nightmares).\n\nVVVVVV's vision is so strong and consistent, that even though the experience lasts only a few hours it was so incredibly fun and well put together that I never noticed the short length as I was simply having too good a time getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me again and again. That's probably a peculiar way to recommend a game, but VVVVVV is something of a peculiar game, coming out of essentially nowhere, putting blisters on my fingers, and making me curse and rejoice over and over while what can only be described as the best music to ever enter your ear holes played in the background.\n\nIt's good, so just play it already won't you?!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","6"

I’ve played this game on and off for the past 5 years, and I’ve gradually come to realize it's not that great. I’ll try to explain why.\n\nTo get one thing out of the way, the music is fantastic. The chiptune album “PPPPPP” is a true modern classic, catchy and energetic and well-produced. The game sells for $5, but I’d be willing to pay $20 for the soundtrack alone. It’s that good. Even after hearing these tunes for 5 years, most of them still haven’t gotten old to me. But chances are you’ve already heard the music and know this for yourself.\n\nTo get another thing out of the way, I think the visuals are awesome. The minimalistic art throws back to a time older than the NES, and the ever-changing neon colors are strange and mysterious in their simplicity, and demand to be explored. In a way, the game itself is a fitting music video to one of the greatest chiptune albums there is.\n\nSo, what do I dislike about this game? Well, where do I start…?\n\nThe game is built around a novel idea – flipping the gravity of your character instead of jumping – and then spends an hour or two trying to pretend this mechanic has no crippling limitations before just giving up.  And I’m not exaggerating here: the entire game can be consistently beaten in about 30 minutes. The first time I played it, it took me about 50. Finding all the hidden trinkets can take about an hour more, depending on how many tries it takes you on the “Prize for the Reckless” and “Veni, Vidi, Vici” challenges.\n\nMost games which are built around a central gimmick will try to expand it with additional game mechanics. VVVVVV comes up with about four new mechanics to complement its gravity-flipping gimmick: conveyer belts, automatic-flip lasers, auto-scrolling rooms, and rooms that wrap around the edges. It then uses each of these mechanics in a tiny dungeon area and almost nowhere else. Two of the game’s areas use a somewhat irritating mechanic where you have to lead a friend around, with the level design poking fun at the fact that your friend has no common sense and you have to do everything for them. As far as new ideas are concerned, that’s pretty much it.\n\nThe central hub area, which comprises the majority of the map, is mostly just empty space: no enemies, no platforming puzzles, nothing but a few spikes here and there and a few of the collectable trinkets hidden away in corners. Even the interesting mazes are scarce. The hopelessly catchy track “Passion for Exploring” plays in the central hub, but in this case, “exploration” means just repeatedly falling through dozens of empty screens and searching for the next dungeon entrance. The overworld is also littered with dozens of checkpoints and teleporters which you will never use because there’s just nothing out there. They could have removed it entirely, replacing the hub with a series of teleporters to the dungeons, and the game hardly would have lost anything.\n\nThe game is touted as a “super hard” and “tough as nails” platformer. If that’s the case, it’s the easiest “super hard” platformer I’ve ever played. Some parts are hard, but there’s no steady sense of progression; the difficulty is mostly just limited to a few problem rooms which may take hundreds of deaths each, but otherwise the whole game is smooth sailing. If you want real difficulty, you can try no-death mode or the time trials, but it just amounts to repeatedly playing the same ridiculously short game until you get it perfect. In this case, the difficulty is mostly just self-imposed rather than the work of a level designer. Personally, I’ve spent the most amount of time on the Super Gravitron, a fearsomely difficult mini-game that was probably the spiritual precursor to Super  Hexagon.\n\nThe game’s story might as well not be there. I can summarize the story as follows: “You are some kind of captain of some kind of crew piloting some kind of ship, which crash-lands on some kind of planet due to some kind of disturbance. In order to escape, you need to deactivate some kind of device located in some kind of alternate dimension.” I’m not exaggerating. Nothing is explained. This story could have been mysterious and compelling, but instead it chooses to go the “self-referential humor” route by having the characters poke fun at checkpoints and the level design, while they’re not busy talking about nothing.\n\nAnd for those who say “Why would you play this game for the story?” I propose that you consider this: the game’s story could have been better if you removed all of the dialogue. The story is told perfectly through the visuals. The explosions, lost crew members, and alternate dimensions are all self-explanatory, and it would have left all the details up to the imagination. Captain Viridian would have made a great silent protagonist that you could have projected your own motivation into. Instead, the characters are all given completely needless speaking lines which don’t convey anything, and I’m just left wondering why anyone bothered to write dialogue.\n\nTL,DR: Aside from the superb music and the visuals, VVVVVV feels like a game that was hastily thrown together. The difficulty is schizophrenic, rather than a fine-tuned progression curve. The overworld map is mostly empty space, as though the level designer had tried filling it with enemies and mazes but finally said “screw it, nothing works” and deleted everything. The story had no effort behind it. Interesting game mechanics are few and far between, and are only used for a few rooms each. The bonus game modes are needless masochism that are far too great of a difficulty jump from the main game. Overall, it feels more like an hour-long proof of concept than a full-fledged game exploring the possibilities and implications of its main gravity-flipping gimmick.\n\nYes, it was influential. Yes, it rode the very first wave of indie games back when Steam was gaining steam. Yes, the music is crazy good. All things considered, I respect this game. But after five years of playing and reflecting on it, I can’t help but see it as a short, pointless waste of time with no interesting gameplay statements to make (even for its time) and no heart put into it. It’s style-over-substance. But hey, it’s got a great style, so I can’t quite fault it for that. I know a lot of people love this game. I loved it for a while, but now that I've noticed its flaws I can't shake the sour taste this game leaves me with.\n\nI know that few will agree with my sentiment, but hopefully I’ve explained my thoughts adequately.\n\nAnd finally, all achievement hunters but the most dedicated should stay far, far away. This is one brutal 100%.","January 15","false","36.5"," 101 of 157 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","101","157","12","10"

The gameplay is excellent and the retro graphics really make an impact even in their simplicity. This is by no means a long game. In fact I finished it in less than two hours in my first serious try. The thing is, you shouldn’t really expect anything else from the game. It’s a super fun bite-sized goodie with a lot to offer if you just give it a chance. The game is pretty simple and straight forward. There aren’t many mechanics but mastering the few there are is a challenge in itself. The soundtrack by Magnus (SoulEye) Pålsson is magnificent. It keeps you pumped up for the action and keeps the flow of the game up even if you happen to die 50 times in a single room. Overall, if you like retro platformers, this is a must buy. It’s not quite a masterpiece contender since the length barely gets you started with the game and the gameplay is super simplistic.

The flip-flop control scheme works perfectly, and the levels are designed around it, not thrown together to accomodate it.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic, the Commodore-ish visuals and sound actually manage to create a pretty spooky world, although I'd say the challenging difficulty has something to do with that too.\nThe only thing I wish this game had is Steam achievements, as it definitely is a great game to complete 100%.\n\nRight now it's on sale for 30 cents, so I see absolutely no reason not to buy this game instead of a few Steam trading cards. And even at the $3 full price it's worth every penny.","January 1, 2014","true","6.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spudderdudder/recommended/70300/","spudderdudder","Spud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spudderdudder/","78 products in account","This game, VVVVVV, it calls itself. A mess of letters that blend together into a mess of jagged lines, as if to trace one's path through life in a retrospective essay of Adobe Flash and Steam winter sales. It infuriates me. But not for the reasons one might expect, no, not the usual cries of difficulty and despair.\n\nI double-click the name in my Steam library and prepare for the worst. Forty nine cents, I say. This game cost me less than a round of slightly clogged arteries from the local fast food joint and was paid for entirely by selling virtual headwear and trading cards to those less fortunate than myself. Surely I will be able to find some modicum of enjoyment of this mess of Flash. Flash? Perhaps not! The forums of the Internet tell me that at one point it was remade in a proper programming language. As such, the game can suffer random slowdowns in fullscreen and neither the Steam overlay nor capture software such as Fraps will recognize the game. I found myself unable to take and upload screenshots of my trials in this pixelated, single-colored world, for all to see but none to comment on. A Google search leads to a Steam forum post regarding then-'soon' updates for overlays, achievements and the Cloud. The famous Cloud. This post dates from over two years ago. Nothing has been done since. Alt-tabbing the game will lock your cursor in the corner of your screen and sometimes just crash. This game was not built on Source, they tell me. They're lying to me.\n\nThe game itself controls acceptably. Sometimes I find myself sliding off platforms and into hazards and sometimes getting stuck inside either. Platformers should not have slippery controls like this, but the air control is precise and exact. Why is there such a difference? Is there an underlying message to be found here, perhaps describing the trials of Man trapped in his earthly plane? I would hope not, as this game predates the trend of waves upon waves of lazy, 'deep' indie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by several years. To the untrained eye it appears to fit quite well, though, with the simplistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack.\n\nThis. This is where this executable of poor optimization and developer laziness gets to me. The game's art style is obviously meant to harken back to an era of dial-up and diskettes, in truth even earlier than both. Simple graphics and single color palettes attempt to imitate the limitations of old, yet miss the mark entirely. The developers want you to think you're playing a Commodore 64 game, down to including an imitation tape deck load screen upon startup, and yet they so clearly miss the appeal of the C64. Why go for plain, blocky graphics when it was capable of so much more? Why use a soundtrack consisting entirely of generic chiptunes churned out in Fruityloops in an afternoon when the Commodore was famous for its SID chip, used even today for its unique sound and characteristics? This was perhaps the biggest indicator of Vee Six's origins.\n\nVee Six? Yes, that will do. I feel it fits this game nicely. You wanted the big American V8 with more displacement than the total Coke bottles in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, but instead went for the more frugal six-cylinder for better gas mileage. Perhaps it shows up under a different name, like Grand Sport or Touring, but the illusion disappears as soon as the hood is opened and the guts of the machine become visible. Likewise, you wanted a game that harkens back to the days of incredible difficulty, but without actually playing a game from that era, so you bought Vee Six.\n\nIt was quite ahead of its time, really, this poor little game. Perhaps it actually started the trend of retro-throwback games that only appear as such to the untrained, Mountain Dew chugging eye, taking a small break from his endless stacks of semi-futuristic first person shooters starring Sgt. Master Sgt. Technician of Operations Captain Slabmeat and his sidekicks, Alpha Team Bravo Charlie Omega. I have doubts about his ability to find such a game, though. This seems like one meant for that other audience, the one that cuddles into their woolen hat at the corner coffee house while typing on their ridiculously overpriced, shining white laptop and adjusting their lensless, thick-framed glasses. A game for those who want to go back... but not really, because they never experienced what they would be going back to in the first place. An imitation that falls apart like that disgusting hipster's Volkswagen as it gets driven around a small upstate city in New York looking for guys in skinny jeans and no shoes while struggling from no oil changes to no oil changes.\n\nSo. An interesting word, 'so.' Both a statement and a question. So what? So this is a review, after all. Reviews have to have one final word, else the whole page might as well be used as a paper airplane to send your thoughts and dreams. In these modern times of instant messaging and ironic tendencies, no one has time to read more than exactly one hundred forty-four characters without requesting a short-form so their attention deficit disorder-afflicted minds can process that one tidbit of information before riding the rollercoaster of latest trends down the next incline while that child in the back row vomits all over himself and the poor sod sitting beside. Do I recommend this game? The question weighed heavily on my mind for days on end, pervading every waking moment with its incessant inquisition.\n\nYes. I suppose I can recommend this game, if you enjoy throwing money at walls to throw a small, single-color, virtual person at a wall over and over. I move my mouse and hesitantly click the checkmark instead of the thumbs-down icon. Nobody reads negative reviews, after all, and unfortunately there is no option for 'indifference' or perhaps 'Yes, but only if on sale first.' I paid forty nine American pennies for a sadomasochism simulator in the guise of a 'retro' platformer game.\n\nI should have found two more quarters in my couch and bought a burger.","January 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Or, more likely, I would've ignored your suggestion until I got the game half-free as part of a Humble Bundle (sorry, brother, your suggestions are the best!) and had no excuse not to play this highly-praised game.\n\nI enjoy quality platforming as much as most gamers and don't mind the difficulty that typically comes with such games, especially when they are indie-made. But I need to be in a very specific mindset if I am to endure countless re-attempts at the slightest mistake and I run out of that energy eventually regardless of how far I got in the game. VVVVVV rectifies the image of indie platformers you have in your head with a surprising breath of clarity - even the confusing name makes perfect sense after staring at those same spikes room after room. Instead of jumping, you switch gravity back and forth so that you're either standing on ground or on the ceiling - and that's all there is to it. No upgrades, no weapons, everything you come across is doable from the get-go. The world is open, reminiscent of Metroidvania games, but even with a minimal plot and the ability to choose your own path, playng is straight-forward and you never feel lost.\n\n\nWhat could've been only a gimmick or proof-of-concept-gameplay comes together as a tight, addictive package, thanks to the gratituous use of checkpoints. There is typically at least one in each room and as you die you reappear next to it without further hassle, so once you figure out how to gravity-change yourself out of the next pickle or ace the pixel-tight patterns of moving obstacles, you're safe again.  Dying constantly is not only allowed, it's celebrated, with the total number of deaths in your current playthrough proudly displayed in the menu. There are Steam achievements for finishing the game with a small number of deaths, but you don't have to care about that unless you really want to. You can collect trinkets in the game, which unlocks some extras, and there are a few which can test your patience, but thanks to the checkpoints, you don't have to memorize minutes of tough manouvers; it's all finely chopped down.\n\nOf course, the platforming in this game is still challenging - if you didn't enjoy the joys of precision jumping in a game like the original Super Mario Brothers, you probably won't enjoy this. But the game isn't needlessly or falsely difficult. VVVVVV presents itself as exactly as it is, trial-and-error gameplay in the word's most positive sense. You can focus on the platforming puzzles without being punished for dying while trying to get a "feel" of each room's pattern. Each new checkpoint reached feels like a little win and you get through even the more difficult parts with the knowledge that the gameplay is logical and rewards your patient learning, not luck.\n\nOf course, the game also has a great soundtrack and little details like the amusing dialogue and room names. My biggest grief is with the Steam Achievements; they should be more varied. Finishing with less and less deaths makes sense as a challenge, as do the flip mode and no-death mode achievements, but the many Super Gravitron and perfect Time Trial achievements seem pointless and don't motivate to play more.","March 29, 2015","true","11.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm not very good at platformers, and I often get annoyed with them. But, even though I died over 1600 times finishing this game, each death only filled me with hope and determination. Every time I pressed the wrong button and ran into spikes, or didn't press any button and ran into spikes, or fell onto spikes, or jumped into spikes for no reason, or any of the other 1600 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed things I did, I just felt more resolve to finish this game. Even the 400 deaths on Veni Vidi Vici just made made me want to get it even more after each try.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, the music absolutely perfect, and even though it's a small thing, the room names were a standout. Sometimes encouraging, sometimes ironic, sometimes scathing, it was like having a biting narrator quip over your shoulder while pretending they weren't really interested in what you're doing.

The game revolves around an intersting mechanic where the player can reverse the gravity of their character (Captain Viridian), causing him to flip between the floor and ceiling. Extremely clever level design makes using this mechanic fun, challenging, and rewarding.\n\nThe minimalist style, both in art and narrative, manages to display a lot of character. Some of the dialogue suggests a bit of narrative, not enough to floor anyone, but it adds to making the game feel personal and whole. The art style also showcases the level design nicely, which is the highlight of the game. The soundtrack is icing on the cake.On top of the main mission of fighting your crew, you can also unlock extra bits of soundtrack by collecting "shiny trinkets," which adds extra challenge and length to the game.\n\nFinishing a level in V is extremely satisfying; there is a definite, and fair challenge present.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/70300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nI'm still not really sure why it's called VVVVVV, I remember playing the game expecting the game to be chaotic, but it actually was a fairly entertaining game and interesting game. The game is a 2D exploration/adventure game that feels like something I would play on a classic GameBoy.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are the captain of a ship and you have lost your crew mates! you need to go save them and get collect various artifacts of the strange world you're now stranded on. This game will give you various fun, enjoyable puzzles.\nAt the time that I'm writing this review (08/20/14) I haven't completed the story, I stopped half way through, and then achievements were added so now I've boosted up when I want to complete and play this game. :D\n\nGame Play: I cannot say enough about simple controls. I love simple controls, jump, right, left, up, down. That's all you need.\nAs I said earlier, the game plays like something you might play on a Classic GameBoy cartridge, I've never had a problem playing games which low graphics, it actually makes the game more fun and easier to play on mobile or smaller devices like laptops.\nThe puzzles can sometimes be challenging but the game itself is very simple in nature and quite forgiving. As you progress or try to get special extra's the game challenges you more. I installed this game without expecting anything at all, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the game. (I've played 32 minutes worth of content before achievements were added)\n\nAchievements: At this time I haven't earned any of these achievements, but I had a glance and most of the achievements seem pretty straight forward. Beat the game, beat the game without dying X amount of times, do this interesting thing for X amount of time, Beat the game in X amount of time.\nThe achievements look a bit last-luster and uninteresting but there really isn't much they can do with the game, and ultimately it's impressive that there are achievements at all for a 2D game with graphics this low.\n\nPrice: VVVVVV is currently $4.99 That's a bit high of a price for a game if you don't plan to play it, I got the game for $1 on a 90% off sale in the steam 2013 Summer Sale. There is also a demo version of the game, which I would recommend trying out.\nWhenever there's a Demo you should try out the demo just to see if you actually like the content inside the game. It's good to read reviews for how a game plays, but testing out the graphics and game play for yourself is second too none.\n\nConclusion: Most people are put off by the idea of playing a 2D game, especially one with very low graphics that looks like it was made for a very old game system, but I've always enjoyed games, both high quality, low quality, and in-between.\nI recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a short little game to play through that won't take up much memory, and has a few hours to burn. I also recommend it to anyone who already knows they don't mind low quality graphics in their video games.","August 20, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In many ways, it looks like something that could have existed on the Atari 2600, but that's not really true - games didn't exist back then that were this polished, either design- or control-wise. So this is really the best of both worlds for people like me: great nostalgia value, but also designed to look and play great for modern times. But what is VVVVVV, anyways? It's a 2D exploration platformer with only one character action - the ability to 'flip' gravity up or down. You might think that having only one mechanic would really limit the game's playability, but it doesn't. There are enough fresh twists sprinkled throughout the game to keep it interesting from start to finish (around 3-4 hours for the main quest). It's really a brilliantly designed game, with just the right amount of challenge. This should be a no brainer for 2D platforming fans, and especially for those who grew up gaming in the 80s.","February 19, 2012","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I got this as part of a pack of games during the 2010 steam holiday sale. I don't even know what else was in the package. Five dollars for this game, by itself, is a fricken bargain. The graphics are aggressively retro, bringing you back to your DOS days of command prompts and computers with no harddrive(er, if you're old, like me). The soundtrack is sublime. The controls are deliberately floaty and imprecise; Like with Super Meat boy, this is a game where you need to learn restraint in order to achieve precision, a game where you're constantly sliding after landing and flying further than you intended. Every action has inertial consequences. But unlike super meat boy, it's less reactive, its inertial force harder to fight, and thus more consistent and predictable yet no less difficult. Where the slightest backtap could mean spikey death in SMB, which makes Meatboy feel weightless and heavy at the same time, VVVVVV feels consistently heavy but low-gravity, and therein lies its brilliance.\n\nFantastic. Just really good.\n\nPS: I played this to completion before they added achievements; I don't know how complete I'd have gotten it but I do know I finished the game with all the shiny trinkets(though, it must be said, dying hundreds of times along the way).","February 2, 2011","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While the former may be true, this is definitely not your average platformer.\n\nThe story of this game is simple: you're a captain of a spaceship and your crew has been scattered through another dimension due to some interference. You need to find them and stop the interference. The graphic style is heavily inspired by the Commodore 64's graphics, while the sountrack is more reminiscent of that of the NES. Both of these work great together, although they might not be amusing for someone is tired of retro styled indie games.\n\nVVVVVV is a metroidvania game: meaning that you can explore the dimension you're in looking for all sorts of things (crew members, trinkets, teleporters). What makes VVVVVV so special however is that you can't jump, but you can flip gravity so that you'll go up instead of down, and vice-versa. The concept is easy to learn (but incredibly hard to master), and leads to many creative levels. There will be some levels *cough*Doing Things The Hard Way*cough* that will usually frustrate the crap out of you, but at the same time you'll have a blast trying to figure out how to get through them (unless you are very easily frustrated, in which case, you should stay away from this game). On top of the main game, there are tons of other features that will keep you playing for hours, such as collecting all of the trinkets, time trials, various game modes (flip mode where the entire game is flipped upside down and no death mode where if you die once you have to restart the game), and even a level creator.\n\n\nVVVVVV will make you want to break your keyboard and you will love every minute of it. What makes this game even better is that it's often on sale for a low price (sometimes even $0.49!). This is a must have for those looking for a challenge.","June 25, 2014","true","21.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I liked the game a lot at first, but as I play more it feels like bundle fodder more than a solid game. It's short and focused on replaying for completion, but the game doesn't seem to change much in replaying. The only real reason to replay is to seek out all the achievements, but that will be an agonizing process of precision and deaths.\n\nI like how it focuses on one mechanic, flipping gravity, and plays with it in many good ways. However, that makes platforming a bit rough. Since "jumps" are based on left/right motion and timing of flips, I think the devs intentionally made left/right motion INCREDIBLY slipppery. See, you slide on every surface like you are a dog-♥♥♥♥ icicle, accelerating like a madman and never able to take a small step. Platforming becomes very unforgiving with smaller windows of mistakes. It IS satisfying when you complete some sections quickly, but most likely you will feel aggravated relief after you finally complete a painful section. The "Do as I say, Not as I do" section will show you how bad the sliding can be.\n\nI like the concept and style, but the execution makes it difficult to enjoy. However, it could be far worse. The short length and open paths means you can complete sections as you please (for the most part) and see the core of the game to completion with some patience. Eversion is even shorter but far more frustrating. And Yet It Moves takes the flipping idea, applies it to 4 directions, adds enemies and awkward physics, and kills you if you fall too far. AYIM is one of the games I hate the most.\n\nSo, it's interesting, and done better than most. Still frustrating and handles awkwardly with the acceleration, but I hesitantly recommend if you are a platforming fan wanting something new to replay for time trials.","July 23, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is heavily based on another one of Cavanagh's games titled Sine Wave Ninja. After a short development in flash, the game was ported to C++ a year later, and it was highly praised by critics. Now, let's see what I think of the game.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n+Jumping is replaced with switching gravity\n+Obstacles add sense of variety\n+One-of-a Kind Gameplay\n+Keeps itself fresh by forcing you to change your approach to situations\n-Gets somewhat repetitive\n\nGraphics: 4/10\n+Sleek pixelated look is highly reminiscent of Commodore 64\n+Environments each have different coloring techniques/schemes\n-Characters are copy/paste\n-Minimal graphical options\n-Stretches to widescreen (if turned on, or you could leave black bars on the sides of your screen)\n\nSound: 10/10\n+Fantastic soundtrack\n+Quirky sound effects\n+No missing sound effects\n+Kept me engaged in the game\n+Helps to build VVVVVV's atmosphere\n\nLasting Appeal: 9/10\n+Once I started this game I knew I wanted to finish it\n+Community-made maps downloadable online\n+Challenge Modes to add replayability\n+Makes you want to replay once you finish it\n+/-There is only a story mode (but it can be modified with challenges)\n\nControls: 10/10\n+Tight Controls, very little drifting\n+Highly responsive\n+Has controller support (that's always a plus, I guess)\n+Very easy to learn\n+Doesn't hurt your hands (that's always good, too)\n\nStory: 9/10\n+Fairly interesting\n+Made engaging by dialog between shipmates and terminals found throughout the environment\n+A heart-warming story about rescuing your lost shipmates after a crash\n+Has some length to it (it's a about 3 hours to complete just the story)\n+/-There's a lot of (text) dialog\n\nMultiplayer N/A\n\nOptimization: 5/10\n+Should run very smooth on almost every computer\n+/-Pretty good port, so there are minimal problems (but it natively runs windowed)\n-No resolution settings (a problem for higher resolution monitors)\n\nContent: 8/10\n+Plenty of challenge modes\n+20 "shiny trinkets" to collect\n+TV sets/terminals are always good to find\n+Community made maps add replayability\n-Spikes are your main enemy (that's not entirely bad, it's just...boring)\n\nDifficulty: 9/10\n+Hard on any mode (challenge or not)\n+Trinkets are hard to get\n+/-There are a LOT of checkpoints (even though it's relieving to get to one)\n\nOVERALL RATING: 81/100\n\nAuthor's Notes: Let me say I absolutely LOVE this game. It's in the favorites section of my Steam library. It's also one of the few games I wanted to replay. Also, don't let that 81/100 score scare you away from buying the game. Not every game is perfect.

This alone already makes for some very original & interesting puzzles, however the game doesn't stop there. The level design, in a Half-Life 2 way, introduces new gameplay mechanics every so often, many of which is only featured in the segment that it was introduced in. This provides lots of variety to the platforming while constantly challenging the player in new ways. Mix that with awesome music & Atari-style art direction & you've got a slam dunk in game design.\nThe game is of an appropriate length for it, clocking in at 2-3 hours for the main story mode, however there are custom levels you can play as well. The story is good, well delivered & actually has a fair layer of depth to it. The information nodes scattered around the game world provide some insight to the nature of the incident. It isn't as deep as Half-Life or F.E.A.R. but that's okay since VVVVVV is a 2-3 hour retro platformer where that kind of stuff isn't expected, not an first-person action game.\nThe only flaw would be the hyper-sensitive controls, though they are more consistent than something like Super Meat Boy, so mastering them is easier.\nVVVVVV sets a new standard for not only 2d platformers or indie games but video games in general.","May 6, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Checkpoints are scattered everywhere and your going to need them from all of the times you die.

It's fun to explore VVVVVV's open world and tackle its levels in any order.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/70300/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","There are really two types of people in this world. Those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one, and those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one so much, they can't stop playing them. Spiritual elder sibling to "You Have To Win The Game," VVVVVV is to the Commodore 64 platformer of yore what its CGA cousin is to the DOS platformer of yore, and I cannot possibly recommend both games enough.\n\nTo paraphrase the words that prefaced the Dungeons and Dragons rulebook so many years ago, those gamers who lack patience, those who don't care for Monty Mole's adventures through sprawling maps of tricky-to-navigate rooms, who feel no thrill upon waking up with Lester in the suspended cage in that famously Another World, who do not enjoy rubbing their palmheel raw on the molded plastic grip of an old one-button joystick with a nine-pin connector or trying hundreds of times to see what lies beyond that maddening gauntlet of hazards, even if it's just a blank room that hasn't been visited before, will not be likely to find VVVVVV to their tastes. But those whose curiosity knows no bounds and whose frustration tolerance rivals that of a Zen master will find this game the answer to their SID-soundtracked, load-star-comma-eight-comma-one prayers.\n\nThe very simple graphics may put you off; don't let them. The six Vs of the title, the cast of the game, take a little getting-used-to, certainly, and I admit, I would have liked a slightly less stylized (if still period-appropriate) character model, but their simple Carcassone-like iconic cuteness grows on you, or at least a tolerance to it accumulates. The characters have two recognizable facial expressions, and their paddle-like, boxy heads are sized, I suspect, to accommodate those easily-recognizable expression changes. Without sharing spoilers, I should note that it becomes clear, later in the game, that their box-headed design was thematically intentional. If you don't like it, relax, and don't let that stop you from enjoying this amazing game.\n\nThe backgrounds, with their stylized metal plating, single-color enemies, and two-plane-deep parallax scrolling gamefield, will be immediately recognizable to C64 fans, as will the bombastic, cheerful, strident soundtrack of in-game looped hits by Magnus Pålsson. While You Have To Win The Game offers only monophonic sound cues, in line with its pre-soundcard DOS-and-PC-speaker pedigree, VVVVVV feels much less stark and empty for its consistently cheerful, upbeat and hopeful tone, and the soundtrack plays a huge role in creating that atmosphere of "Let's play space explorers!" Saturday morning excitement.\n\nAgain, like its cousin, the massive, sprawling map is liberally dotted with continue points, which make recovering from one of the game's many nigh-inevitable deaths less painful, as little ground must be regained afterward. Like its cousin, exploration is key, and will be rewarded -- the map view offers a tantalizing glimpse of area not yet traveled, and the desire to wipe away all the blank areas on it is strong. Like its cousin, the game's locales can be revisited after winning, explored anew, and there's a reward in store for completionists. Like its cousin, spikes are an ever-present and vexing environmental hazard. Like its cousin, there are a few graphic options that help to recreate a much more obviously retro gaming platform experience. (I love Analogue Mode, though I wish there was a way to reduce the frequency of vertical hold failures, or to turn off vertical hold failures completely.)\n\nSo, you might be asking, how does VVVVVV differ from You Have To Win The Game? Quite significantly, despite their many similarities. First, the bombastic, upbeat optimism of the game is a stark contrast to YHTWTG's quiet and emptiness. There are no friends to be found in YHTWTG, while in VVVVVV, reuniting the titular Vs is, in fact, the primary goal of the game's main arc. (This is not a spoiler, for not; it's stated from the get-go.) Furthermore, while YHTWTG uses a fairly conventional run-and-jump platformer mechanic, there is no jump button in VVVVVV. Rather, the protagonist can reverse personal gravity, and elect to "fall up" rather than down, more or less at will.\n\nMore or less, indeed. To flip gravity, one must first be standing on (at least momentarily) solid ground. A flip in progress must complete, and land successfully, before the player can flip again. Our brave Captain Viridian can steer mid-fall, but can't stop a fall. It is entirely possible to end up missing a safe landing point this way. Be grateful for those ubiquitous continue-points. You'll need them. At least, mercifully, one can't die from too long a fall.\n\nI've already mentioned the difference in mood, but beyond this, VVVVVV is communicative in a way YHTWTG isn't. The landscape is dotted with computer terminals hosting messages, and of course, there are five crew members to find and rescue. While YHTWTG offers no clues about its landscape, VVVVVV tells a coherent narrative, and while many questions are left unanswered, one leaves VVVVVV with a better sense of the events of the game in a narrative context than the state in which one leaves YHTWTG.\n\nVVVVVV offers some really spectacular accessibility features for gamers who would normally not be able to play this sort of game, too. One can slow down the game incrementally, turn off moving backgrounds and screen effects, or set the protagonist invincible. The granularity of slowdown control allows you to easily notch the game's reflexes-related difficulty back to a point where it's still challenging but playable, for those who can't react quickly enough at full game speed. This option, as opposed to simply implementing the invulnerability switch, shows a real solid understanding of not only what such a player might need, but how to provide it while preserving as much of the challenge of the game as said player wishes to face. It's rare that this much thought goes into accessibility accommodations, let alone in an indie game.\n\nFinally, VVVVVV offers tools to build one's own levels and scenarios, to bundle them up, and to share them with others. There are quite a few fan-made levels out there, and they're often quite impressive. Terry Cavanagh offers a free "Make and Play" edition of VVVVVV that creates and plays fan-made levels, allowing you to easily and legally share what you make with others. That feature alone extends VVVVVV far beyond the scope of YHTWTG, and makes it a real must-have at its $5 price point. (Frankly, it was more than worth its original $15 price point, too, but I'm glad the price dropped, and VVVVVV became a much more comfortable impulse buy for the still-unconvinced gamer.)\n\nVVVVVV will frustrate you. It will vex you. It will make you scream in frustration and insist it's 'impossible' at least once or twice, but then you'll sail past a difficult level and the palpable joy of your triumph will eclipse the frustration. (Veni Vidi Vici, anyone...?) If your frustration tolerance is limited, this is probably not the game for you. If you can't get beyond the lo-fi visual style, if "chiptunes" annoy you, if dying over and over again bothers you, and especially if you're not not a twitch-reflexes run-and-jumper (run-and-flipper?), then this is probably not your game.\n\nYou're probably either put off or curious now. I hope you're curious. VVVVVV rewards curiosity, as long as it's tempered with a healthy dose of patience. Jump in, flip gravity, and rock out the soundtrack. This is a fun, sunny, bombastic return to Saturday mornings on the Commodore 64, in all the very best of ways.","June 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are lots of areas to discover and things to collect, there are also in-game "Trophies" to acquire too if you're feeling up to a tough challenge.\n\nThis game is brilliant for so many different reasons, one of the main reasons is because It has the ability to create a great atmosphere while using extremely simple graphics, said graphics are also one of the primary things that gives this game it's charm.\n\nWhile it's a difficult game (but by no means impossible), it has a nice frequent checkpoint system that keeps you from losing too much progress at one given time, as it is likely that you will die a LOT on your first run. People who have posted negative reviews of this game by saying "It's too hard" are most likely just bad at it. The game is hard, yes, but it's not hard to the point where it takes hours to get through a certain area. The balance is just right, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, a great game with a great soundtrack.

VVVVVV is a fantastic Indie platformer where instead of jumping, you flip, or reverse gravity. You can only flip whilst on the ground, and can only move left or right while moving through the air.\nVVVVVV has a simple but charming tale of a spaceship crew that crash into another dimension, and you must rescue all your crewmembers. The story will take you 2-2 and a half hours to complete if you don't speedrun. (And might I add, this is a beautiful game to speedrun) However, there are collectible trinkets which can be found, as well as a secret area when all 20 are found, Speedrunning missions, and a no death gamemode. A level editor and support for player generated levels also extends the life of the game.\nThe graphics for this game aren't anything special, but move smoothly as they should, despite the pixel art design. They really feel like something from the classic arcades of yesteryear, but while remaining a modern touch in the backgrounds.\nThe soundtrack in VVVVVV is fantastic, you will be jamming to it admist playing. Great 8-Bit chiptunes that complement the gameplay.\nThe game is quite difficult at times, but checkpoints are frequent and rewarding, allowing challenging gameplay, without the risk of losing lots of progress.\n\nGRAPHICS: 7/10\nMUSIC: 9/10\nGAMEPLAY: 10/10\nSTORY: 7/10\nRUNTIME: 6/10 + User Generated Levels: 8/10\nREPLAYABILITY: 8/10\n\nPersonal rating: 8/10 A fantastic Indie game with fun and fast gameplay, a kicking soundtrack, and great lifespan.","December 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The dynamics in this game looks like it was made on an NES but is actually on multiple consoles like Wii, PS3,Xbox, and PC but are in their own digital shops.\nYou play as Viridian, a captain of his ship that was crashed in a mysterious universe called Dimension V. All of the members of the ship are teleported to diffrent areas or the dimension. You must search the entire dimension for ur lost members with ur abilty to go up or down. The achivements in this game are really hard to get especially beating no death mode since your always going to have at least 50 deaths. While ur exploring the dimension, u will encounter trinkets which dont do anything until u find 20 of them but i wont spoil it for u. Every room is quite puzzling and u might do some backtracking which is every gamers nightmare (im talking to u Metroid).\nThis game gets 8 out of 10 because the game is really short and u can probably beat the game in less than 3 hours depending how good u are.","October 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you like 100%ing games.\n\nVVVVVV is challenging, but quite fair, most of the time. Uh....I guess there isn't really much of a long story. If you can't tell by the screenshots, the game has a visual style reflecting older game systems such as ...well, something a tad more powerful than an atari, perhaps. The era between atari and NES is lost to me. But yeah, really retro graphical style, but it works to its advantage since it leaves less of a busy screen thus letting you focus better. Except one area, which brings me to something else:\nIF YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO SEIZURES, and whatnot, DO NOT GET THIS. There's one area of the game that just messes with your eyes too nasty-like that left me feeling sick after playing. That's the only real downer, I have to say.\nMusically, it's great. It's easy on the ears, some reminds me of Toki Tori on the gameboy color with it's bleeps an' bloops,  but it's chiptune stuff so if you're into to that or not, there you go.\n\nSo, if you like teasing your brain, are not able to seize out, and are fine with trying over and over at things many many times, then get this game, because it was well worth what I spent, I tell ya.","December 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He was really big on drinking "soda pop" and inventing secret handshakes.\n\nLater on I was forced by the government to retake my senior year of highschool because of some legal loophole, with Barack Obama frequently accompanying me against my will. At some point Legion from Mass Effect enrolled at my school and suddenly he became pregnant. Legion's child looked like he would if he was a Chinese knock-off, and was kind of a prick.","August 8, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

VVVVVV looks like an old Commodore 64/Atari 800 game, but feels like a modern platformer. The gameplay is wonderfully simplistic - challenging without being frustrating. The dialogue, controls and timings are all exemplary. The music is special. This is retro gaming at its very best and is definitely worth purchasing.

If you yearn for a masterfully paced narrative, this game probably isn't for you.\n\nWho, precisely, is this thing for?\n\nVVVVVV is, at first glance, a rudimentary platformer: with a bag of tricks consisting entirely of "run" and "jump," progress through your environment without touching any of the many things which will make you dead. A simple gravity inversion mechanic ("down" is whichever direction you're falling in) really changes things up though, and as you explore your surroundings the puzzles get steadily more challenging and engrossing.

If you like 100%ing games.\n\nVVVVVV is challenging, but quite fair, most of the time. Uh....I guess there isn't really much of a long story. If you can't tell by the screenshots, the game has a visual style reflecting older game systems such as ...well, something a tad more powerful than an atari, perhaps. The era between atari and NES is lost to me. But yeah, really retro graphical style, but it works to its advantage since it leaves less of a busy screen thus letting you focus better. Except one area, which brings me to something else:\nIF YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO SEIZURES, and whatnot, DO NOT GET THIS. There's one area of the game that just messes with your eyes too nasty-like that left me feeling sick after playing. That's the only real downer, I have to say.\nMusically, it's great. It's easy on the ears, some reminds me of Toki Tori on the gameboy color with it's bleeps an' bloops,  but it's chiptune stuff so if you're into to that or not, there you go.\n\nSo, if you like teasing your brain, are not able to seize out, and are fine with trying over and over at things many many times, then get this game, because it was well worth what I spent, I tell ya.","December 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's core mechanic; the ability to change to flip the pull of gravity leading to varied and interesting puzzles beyond those possible with just a jump. The story is simple, yet hold enough to hopefully draw the player on and gives the game a larger overall context.\n\nThe game is incredibly good value for money regardless of it's length, although if you are looking for a shorter 2-3 hour title, this could well be worth a look.","May 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will unlock Time Trials of stages you've completed, be able to return to the intermission levels, you can scower the world for all twenty trinkets, and even play the full game over with the entire world flipped upside down, which for some reason makes it more difficult.\n\nShort, incredibly sweet and fairly cheap.

And everything worked out better than expected.\n\nVVVVVV understands an important thing that a lot of games seem to not: The difference between difficult and frustrating. And it is the former. While the puzzles and actiony bits are indeed quite hard, you have infinite lives and checkpoints are scattered everywhere, and this is actually a very good thing as it encourages you to keep trying and get better at it rather than encouraging you to quit and uninstall the game. There's also a lot to explore which 1) means you can go and try some other level if you're stuck on one, and 2) means there's enough to keep you going for a while. As of writing I haven't even finished this game (normally I wait until I've either completed a game or uninstalled it out of rage before writing a positive or negative review respectively).\n\nThe story's nothing special and just serves as what is known in some communities as an "Excuse Plot", which is perfectly fine as it doesn't pretend it does have a good story and you can just ignore it. The characters are all generally likeable though, which is of course better than the alternative.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, it again pleasantly surprised me as I don't usually like chiptunes but this OST somehow stands out. Pretty much none of them are tracks that I would bother turning the music off for. It's worthwhile picking up the soundtrack for general listening purposes.\n\nOne negative I will say about this game though is the lack of native gamepad support so you need Xpadder or Joy2Key or what have you in order to fully enjoy it. Perhaps I'm just weird and most people can play this with a keyboard just fine, but I don't.","January 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead, Cavanagh's VVVVVV opts to take its core, the gravity-flip mechanic, to its extreme, easing players from simple early levels to some of the most rewarding puzzles and stages ever in the later game and maintaining use of infinite lives and checkpoints throughout so as not to cheat the player. The core "story" (the plot is relatively unimportant) can be finished in two hours or less, but time trials, collectibles, and a sense of exploration that recalls the original Zelda or even Adventure makes this game worth playing over and over again.

You move like a standard platformer, but rather than be able to jump, you instead are able to flip gravity. What starts off as a simple concept very quickly becomes one of the most brutally hard platformers I can think of! I think the best way to describe VVVVVV is "Nintendo Hard". By this, I mean that the difficultly never feels forced or cheap, but rather 100% dependent on your skill level. Luckily, there is no set amount of lives, and the savepoints are placed in decent locations to allow you to trial and error your way past most of the deathtraps you will face. Death provides you with an instant respawn to get right back into retrying without being annoying. The game is setup as one big map, allowing to to explore in any direction as you seek out your 5 lost shipmates. The team is stranded in different areas of a giant space station, each with a unique level built around them. You can do the levels in any order you choose, or just explore around. If you are looking for a challenge, give it a go - but be warned; it's a tough one!","February 10, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Visuals are simplistic yet effective, making good use of the color palette. Reminiscent of the Atari console era. The audio also is set in a chiptune manner that we all were so familiar with not so long ago. And yet, still, all these are brought together to the modern era, clearly, with more instruments being played at once, and with how much is happening on screen. It's what one would think a classic game to be if developed with what we're given today.\n\nThis game will test your patience. Yes. This game is the VERY DEFINITION of "Trial and error" where you'll try time and time again to overcome obstacles. Fortunately, this game is most forgiving and doesn't make use of a life system and instead gives you save points of which are within reach of the obstacle you must overcome. But, that is the meat of the game; Overcoming obstacles. You'll find very quickly that this game is short. Very short. Nothing is terribly hard to get through, though, where the trinkets scattered throughout the map will test your mettle most. But these things are not required, so you do not have to sweat about acquiring them.\n\nBecause this title is so short, I can recommend it. And at the price it is, it's hard not to be okay with it. Glorious chiptune, simple visuals, and gameplay that will measure your character, this is an indie game worth your time.","January 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And everything worked out better than expected.\n\nVVVVVV understands an important thing that a lot of games seem to not: The difference between difficult and frustrating. And it is the former. While the puzzles and actiony bits are indeed quite hard, you have infinite lives and checkpoints are scattered everywhere, and this is actually a very good thing as it encourages you to keep trying and get better at it rather than encouraging you to quit and uninstall the game. There's also a lot to explore which 1) means you can go and try some other level if you're stuck on one, and 2) means there's enough to keep you going for a while. As of writing I haven't even finished this game (normally I wait until I've either completed a game or uninstalled it out of rage before writing a positive or negative review respectively).\n\nThe story's nothing special and just serves as what is known in some communities as an "Excuse Plot", which is perfectly fine as it doesn't pretend it does have a good story and you can just ignore it. The characters are all generally likeable though, which is of course better than the alternative.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, it again pleasantly surprised me as I don't usually like chiptunes but this OST somehow stands out. Pretty much none of them are tracks that I would bother turning the music off for. It's worthwhile picking up the soundtrack for general listening purposes.\n\nOne negative I will say about this game though is the lack of native gamepad support so you need Xpadder or Joy2Key or what have you in order to fully enjoy it.

Mix in a good sense of humor, some lovable characters, the catchy chiptune soundtrack, Commodore 64-inspired graphics, a bit of Metroidvania-esque exploration, an interesting storyline, thousands of spikes, and the perfect balance of difficulty and fun, and just wow. You've got all sorts of good times ahead of you. You've also got a handful of bonus modes (time trials, flipped game, etc.) and secrets to keep you busy afterwards, a respectable number of options (such as invincibility, and an analogue mode that'll probably just hurt your eyes), a level editor, and best of all: player levels! A selection of the best levels created by various people (including one by everyone's favorite Minecraft god, Notch) almost ensures you'll get a fair amount of playtime and fun out of this one.","August 13, 2011","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this to fans of platformers, puzzle and retro style games. If you want to get into platformers this might be a challenge for you so try something easier like Mario or Kirby then maybe move on to games like this or Super Meat Boy.

Fans of VERY old-school games will probably enjoy this most of all. It's surprisingly longer than you'd expect (took me 2 hours to complete, in short 25-minute bursts, with full grief counseling sessions in between), and the music is absolutely ROCKING.

Six 'V' ? Why? But I think it is judt because in the game you have to rescue your crew after you spaceship crashed and everyone was sprayed over the map. It's an simple 2D jump and run game or no, that's wrong. It is not just a jump and run game and it is defenetly not simple. The mechanics are simple, you have a character (the captain) and you can move (left and right arrowkey) and reverse the gravety (spyce or one of the other arrows). That's it. There is a world you have to explore and you have to find the rest of the crew. Back to the name :) all crew member names are starting with a 'V' all together (you + five you have to find) six 'V's. If there is an other explenation for the Name, please let me know.\nThe game has it's own charm. The simple grafics, the oldschool music (which is really good) and the simple gameplay are fitting together very well. And death are not bad. They are normal in this game. During the 2h campain you will die a couple of times ( I reached over 1000 times, a friend over 1500 times), so don't be frustrated if you don't get one of the extra points, just move on. And if you have really problems, you can turn down the gamespeed so you have more time to react, nice idea to do it this way, so everyone can go on without leaving anything.\nI would not buy it for the normal 5$, but if you see it on sale...get it! ;)\n","January 6, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

VVVVVV goes further than just look retro, and the reverse gravity ability (instead of jumping) goes to great lengths to make it both enjoyable, and challenging. With a Metroid-vania style of map exploration system, this is one of the few games that actually makes me want to explore every nook and cranny. The music is a retro, 8-bit style delight, and the checkpoints are vast, which means you get back on your feet quickly. The game grows on you, and as you complete the game and find every secret, you feel a great satisfaction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duckduckgus/recommended/70300/","duckduckgus","The Shattermage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duckduckgus/","114 products in account","A Diamond in the Rough\n\nDuring my first foray into the Steam sale over Christmas, a friend of mine alerted me to a game on sale for 50 cents. How could I say "no" to that opporunity? I didn't care what it was. Much to my happiness, the game turned out to be quite fun and a lookback into the 1980s. VVVVVV is a 2010 flash game from developer Terry Cavanagh, known for his retro-style, 2D games.\n\nThe story of VVVVVV is easy to dismiss since the game's main feature is it's puzzle platforming gameplay rather than storytelling. You play Captain Viridian, commander of a science space vessel that gets caught in "dimensional interference" forcing evacuation through a trans-dimensional portal. You quickly discover that your crew has been scattered across multiple dimensions and are tasked with their individual rescue.\n\nControls are very simplistic. If you were to rank a game's control complexity on a scale of "Dive Kick" to "Steel Battalion", VVVVVV would rank just above Dive Kick.  Left and right directionals plus an action key are all there is. The most notable limitation is you cannot jump. Instead, the action key reverses your character's direction of gravity from the floor to the ceiling and vice versa.  This, combined with the various puzzles of the different levels, defines the gameplay. You use your lone ability to traverse the map avoiding enemies and, most notably, the endless plethora of death spikes, the appearance of which one could argue contributes to the game's namesake (the game's title is actually named for the dimension your ship is stuck in).\n\nThe is no health meter and, thankfully, no limit to the number of lives, for you will be dying a lot. However, I surprisingly found myself not being at all frustrated with this for a few reasons. There's no death sequence; respawns are near instantaneous and checkpoints are rather frequent. Also, the simple joy I got from trying to figure out how to safely traverse a section using the unique controls deterred "rage quitting" at least for me. There is a death counter in the pause menu if you like to see how many times you've died since starting the game.\n\nThe game is rather fast paced, but for those whose eyes have a terrible time keeping up, the game's speed can be dialed back. A time trial mode, no death run, and flipped mode are also unlockable for the truly hardcore.\n\nVisuals are textbook Commodore 64 era.  If you're a spoiled child of 3D visuals, bright bloom, and HDR lighting, you will find none of it here. VVVVVV is classic 8-bit, 2D display with nothing entirely special about it. It's a simple thowback to gaming days of yore. All characters are the same model, differentiated by solid color alone, with only two facial expressions (happy and sad) while legs move about a pixel width back and forth during movement. Enemies appear in forms ranging from squares of garbaled mess to seemingly arbitrary words and numbers flying across the screen.\n\nI was instantly in love with the soundtrack scored by chiptune artist Magnus Palsson. The tunes are incredibly catchy, upbeat, triumphant at times, and you'll find yourself having many of the songs stuck in your head for days on end.  If I wasn't too into the game itself, I'd play the game simply for it's scoring. I wouldn't put it past myself to turning the game on and pausing it at a certain level just to listen to the music although that's easily accomplised by YouTube.  The songs are also available for purchase through the composer's website.\n\nVVVVVV is a great puzzle platformer anyone is sure to enjoy. The programming is solid and simple.  I never came across a single glitch.  System requirements are not worth mentioning as any 10-year-old PC could probably handle this game. Nothing hampered my enjoyment short of dying 100 times on one obstacle. Your patience will be tested, your eyes will work a little harder, and your ears will be singing praises.   Check out VVVVVV on Steam and Nintendo 3DS.  An iOS, Android, Ouya, and PS Vita release are slated for 2014.","January 11, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Visuals are simplistic yet effective, making good use of the color palette. Reminiscent of the Atari console era. The audio also is set in a chiptune manner that we all were so familiar with not so long ago. And yet, still, all these are brought together to the modern era, clearly, with more instruments being played at once, and with how much is happening on screen. It's what one would think a classic game to be if developed with what we're given today.\n\nThis game will test your patience. Yes. This game is the VERY DEFINITION of "Trial and error" where you'll try time and time again to overcome obstacles. Fortunately, this game is most forgiving and doesn't make use of a life system and instead gives you save points of which are within reach of the obstacle you must overcome. But, that is the meat of the game; Overcoming obstacles. You'll find very quickly that this game is short. Very short. Nothing is terribly hard to get through, though, where the trinkets scattered throughout the map will test your mettle most. But these things are not required, so you do not have to sweat about acquiring them.\n\nBecause this title is so short, I can recommend it. And at the price it is, it's hard not to be okay with it. Glorious chiptune, simple visuals, and gameplay that will measure your character, this is an indie game worth your time.","January 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like 100%ing games.\n\nVVVVVV is challenging, but quite fair, most of the time. Uh....I guess there isn't really much of a long story. If you can't tell by the screenshots, the game has a visual style reflecting older game systems such as ...well, something a tad more powerful than an atari, perhaps. The era between atari and NES is lost to me. But yeah, really retro graphical style, but it works to its advantage since it leaves less of a busy screen thus letting you focus better. Except one area, which brings me to something else:\nIF YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO SEIZURES, and whatnot, DO NOT GET THIS. There's one area of the game that just messes with your eyes too nasty-like that left me feeling sick after playing. That's the only real downer, I have to say.\nMusically, it's great. It's easy on the ears, some reminds me of Toki Tori on the gameboy color with it's bleeps an' bloops,  but it's chiptune stuff so if you're into to that or not, there you go.\n\nSo, if you like teasing your brain, are not able to seize out, and are fine with trying over and over at things many many times, then get this game, because it was well worth what I spent, I tell ya.","December 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an action puzzle game where you play as a lost captain trying to find six crew members. You move around a big map and get crewmembers by going into dungeons and reaching the end. There are disks you can collect and it is really an exciting game. It's called VVVVVV because that's what the spikes look like, and you walk normally (left and right) and hit V to flip.

The good: challenging platforming that doesn’t frustrate 90% of the time. A simple and nice are style, with a retro feel. The open world is a pleasant surprise, and the levels all have a unique gimmick to them. There are 20 objects to find, some errand by exploring, others by completing a challenge. I also liked the techno and "spacey" music. The bad: the characters are rather shallow, and some sections are just infuriating. During my play through, I was forced to guild a NPC to the end of the level. I wanted to kill them by the end, just because of one room, and their non-stop whining. Also, there are times where the game tries to give the player epileptic attacks, so don't play with the lights off. Over all, VVVVVV is a fun game, but the bad moments can really hurt the experience. If you get stuck at a point, I would recommend muting the game and putting on your own music, and don't rage quit.","December 5, 2013","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No "if"s "and"s or "butt"s about it. I don't usually like replaying games that have story lines(i.e. Half Life). But this game I can play over and over and it never gets old. I also love how challenging it is, a lot of games I've played I could just win no problem. Even though this game has infinite lives, that's honestly better. Because you can try over and over at one thing you keep dying at(which causes a little more frustration sometimes).\nHowever, I do have a single complaint on behalf of mac users. This game does not have an in game volume control, and since mac os does not have the equivalent of "Windows Volume Mixer". The sound track is at what the game sets it at. So if you like your own music(which you should just listen to VVVVVV's music, pretty good), or you talk to people while playing, you may want to get a third party volume control.","December 11, 2013","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am not a big fan of chiptune music, but this OST has some really catchy tunes and is of extremely good quality. The gameplay is very solid, just as the visuals it is retro-styled. However, due to very good placement of save-points VVVVVV is not as severly punishing as those games, by which it was obviously inspired. The storyline is not really important and does not add anything to the game. The graphics do the trick of making the game look really old-school and reminding me of many games I played in the past.

This mechanic leads to some of the most inventive and challenging platforming gameplay I've ever encountered. Every single room becomes a platforming puzzle as you try to figure out how to use gravity to move through hostile environments without dying, which you will do often. Luckily, the game wastes no time respawning you at the nearest checkpoint, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the environment. VVVVVV also thankfully leaves lives and game overs out of the equation. The result is a game with a high challenge but that never feels punishing or impossible and moves forward at lightning speed.\n\nAlso welcome is the open world game design that makes VVVVVV feel Metroidvania-esque. Different areas of the map have different sorts of obstacles and challenges, allowing you to explore and progress at your own pace.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the game's story, which does not feature a villain or enemies of any kind. The story feels like a small side quest happening in a larger world, which is a refreshing change from a typical platformer where you need to save the world/princess.\n\nIt also has one of the best chiptune tracks that you will ever hear and features simple but effective graphics inspired by C64 games.\n\nOverall, VVVVVV is an immensely satisfying experience for anyone up to the challenge and I highly recommend it.","March 31","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's core mechanic; the ability to change to flip the pull of gravity leading to varied and interesting puzzles beyond those possible with just a jump.

Can get through the game from scratch in just an hour and a half easy, if your reflexes are good enough, and it'd be an hour and a half well spent.\n\nWhile the game sticks to the mechanic of "run around and flip gravity to get through areas" it changes the rules or environment in each of the areas in a way that keeps it interesting. Except for the "escort quest" spots that make up about 2 to 10 minutes of your time (depending on skill) I found the whole thing enjoyable. Final level's rough, and some of the shiny trinkets are asking too much, but they're not necessary.\n\nSo yeah, worth the hour or two it will ask of you.

This mechanic leads to some of the most inventive and challenging platforming gameplay I've ever encountered. Every single room becomes a platforming puzzle as you try to figure out how to use gravity to move through hostile environments without dying, which you will do often. Luckily, the game wastes no time respawning you at the nearest checkpoint, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the environment. VVVVVV also thankfully leaves lives and game overs out of the equation. The result is a game with a high challenge but that never feels punishing or impossible and moves forward at lightning speed.\n\nAlso welcome is the open world game design that makes VVVVVV feel Metroidvania-esque. Different areas of the map have different sorts of obstacles and challenges, allowing you to explore and progress at your own pace.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the game's story, which does not feature a villain or enemies of any kind. The story feels like a small side quest happening in a larger world, which is a refreshing change from a typical platformer where you need to save the world/princess.\n\nIt also has one of the best chiptune tracks that you will ever hear and features simple but effective graphics inspired by C64 games.\n\nOverall, VVVVVV is an immensely satisfying experience for anyone up to the challenge and I highly recommend it.","March 31","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the premise of VVVVVV, a simple game, but very fun! The colored graphics, like a Commodore 64 game, is nice and can bring a sense of nostalgia for those who played these old games. The soundtrack is spectacular, an agradable 8-bit sound for the ears.\n\nIn the main game itself is not large, perhaps, as were the classic side action games, however, it will spend a few more hours if you are hunting achievements. This can be the negative criticism for some players, they are almost impossible - if you are patient, a bit of training and soon you can, because has a pattern for beat the levels.\n\nThe controller compatibility works very well, in my case, I used a Xbox 360 controller.","December 24, 2015","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can only switch gravity while on the ground (or ceiling), though, meaning you can't change direction while in mid-air.\n\nYou are a space captain and your team is flying through space. Suddenly, the crew is evacuated due to a catastrophe, and you must find your way back as well as save the other members of your crew. The gameplay is solid, but it gets frustrating after about ten deaths in the same room (or the same checkpoint). That isn't to say this game is bad. It's an excellent indie game that everyone should at least try, especially if it's on sale.","January 2, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This mechanic leads to some of the most inventive and challenging platforming gameplay I've ever encountered. Every single room becomes a platforming puzzle as you try to figure out how to use gravity to move through hostile environments without dying, which you will do often. Luckily, the game wastes no time respawning you at the nearest checkpoint, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the environment. VVVVVV also thankfully leaves lives and game overs out of the equation. The result is a game with a high challenge but that never feels punishing or impossible and moves forward at lightning speed.\n\nAlso welcome is the open world game design that makes VVVVVV feel Metroidvania-esque. Different areas of the map have different sorts of obstacles and challenges, allowing you to explore and progress at your own pace.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the game's story, which does not feature a villain or enemies of any kind. The story feels like a small side quest happening in a larger world, which is a refreshing change from a typical platformer where you need to save the world/princess.\n\nIt also has one of the best chiptune tracks that you will ever hear and features simple but effective graphics inspired by C64 games.\n\nOverall, VVVVVV is an immensely satisfying experience for anyone up to the challenge and I highly recommend it.","March 31","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

VVVVVV is an excellent example of a good platformer that has been made better by adding an original, interesting core game mechanic. In VVVVVV, you play as Captain Viridian who must rescue his crew after a disaster nearly destroys his ship. Traveling all around a strange new universe called "VVVVVV", you must rescue each crew member in their own zone of the map. Each new zone introduces a new game mechanic such as moving maps, bouncy ropes, and NPC co-op.\n\nVVVVVV's system of introducing new mechanics allows you to adjust to each challenge before entering the last stages of the game which require you to navigate maps containing every mechanic simultaneously. This isn't an easy game, but not too hard to beat if you're persistent. Many of the most challenging puzzles are previously-optional challenges which are required to reach a treasure. Veni Vidi Vici. After completing the main story and collecting every treasure, you receive a special reward.","December 27, 2010","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of repetition required (trial and error), but the game never really becomes overly irritating. It's always just frustrating enough to make you want to finish it, just so you can say you beat the developers at their own game. It's as quirky as it is fun.

Some of the levels are intense, and I found myself sort of spacing out and getting lost in the bright colorful lights. I can't imagine what this would do to someone with epilepsy, but it would definitely be very bad. As it is, I had to turn it off after playing the same level for about five minutes and not being able to make the jump because it was changing between screens so rapidly and the colors were so bright that I couldn't take it. And I'm not epileptic, I've never had this kind of problem with a game before. So yes, I recommend it, in short doses to people who aren't bothered by strobes of light and color. But I can't imagine myself playing this for an hour or two straight, it's really more of a "take five minutes to enjoy the soundtrack" kind of game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drnoooo/recommended/70300/","drnoooo","Elaine!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drnoooo/","191 products in account","OK, a serious review this time - maybe this game simply wasn't *for* me. I've never really been a fan of retro-styled platformers, probably because I didn't grow up with them so the nostalgia doesn't really do anything for me. I've tried to play some of the classics but the ones that do hold up (Mega Man, Gimmick!) still have plenty of gameplay flaws that their indie counterparts don't seem to want to let go of.\n\nVVVVVV has a great, great soundtrack (I even bought it) but it's an immensely frustating game in a way that it's arcade contemporary Super Meat Boy is not. You respawn instantly, like that game, but with an irritating sound effect that feels like a punishment for dying. The odd control scheme is slippery and feels inconsistent, although I'll admit some people have mastered it enough to speedrun it. And, unlike many of Super Meat Boy's levels where you see what is coming far before tackling it, VVVVVV by design blindsides you with its Zelda-style screen scrolls into traps you have no time to prepare for. Veni Vidi Vici is the quintessential example of this design philosophy in action.\n\nWhat this results in is a game that is entirely based on trial-and-error. That's really all it has - the actual platforming isn't fun due to the slow pace and iffy controls, so what it does instead is throw a bunch of gimmicks at you while you slowly inch your way through an Atari-skinned meat grinder. There's some elements of exploration in the hub world (one of the songs is even called Passion For Exploring) but nothing to really do in it, making it just a fancy version of a level select.\n\nThis could all be fine if the game was charming or interesting enough to make up for these flaws (Gimmick! is also a frustrating game with a lot of trial-and-error) but, unfortunately, it really isn't. The characters are literally stick figures. The world is mostly blocks and spikes with an occasionally cute theme or object in a room, reinforced by the nice touch of giving every room its own name, but its very barebones.\n\nObviously, many people have enjoyed VVVVVV a lot, and saying something binary like "this game is the worst thing ever" is silly and unfair. But my honest opinion is that it's just not worth the short time you put into it.","September 9, 2014","false","3.4"," 56 of 111 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","56","111","7","10"

The graphics are extremely simple though, very basic. In this game you have to find your friends. There are a lot of spiked platforms and you can avoid them by pressing a button to switch the gravity. So instead of walking, you'll then fall down and you're able to avoid them. It sounds easier than it actually is. It can be quite difficult. So if you're into hard platformers add this one to your list.

Luckily, VVVVVV isn't like that. There's just so many things that make VVVVVV so enjoyable. This is game exceeded my expectations immensely, even if I did find myself constantly challenged by some levels that even hardcore button pressers would struggle to master.\n\nWhen you first start playing VVVVVV, you are thrown straight into the cataclysmic life of a desperate but forever-smiling Captain Veridian, aboard a giant spaceship that has just smashed into something that is only described as "dimensional interference". Veridian and the rest of his crew leap into a conveniently located teleporter, but instead of all teleporting to the same place, they are spat out into a different dimension, called Dimension VVVVVV. Veridian must then rescue his lost crew and find out the cause of the "dimensional interference".\n\nThe game is displayed in a beautiful 2D pixel-art style world, remeniscent of video game systems like the Commodore 64. The world has a vast variety of colours, and the levels range from simple plaforming to others that require ultimate precision and timing. VVVVVV's world may be short, but its highly demanding design, along with a great chipset soundrack will keep you on your toes.\n\nOverall VVVVVV is a creative and amusing platformer, and although its overall story is short, what it lacks in size it makes up for in difficulty.\n\n8.7/10\n","October 5, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It sounds easier than it actually is. It can be quite difficult. So if you're into hard platformers add this one to your list.

The game is short, it only took me about 2 hours to beat it, but it has a lot of replay value, as most of the achievements/alternate modes are unlockable/achievable after beating the game.\n2.

Вместо этого он меняет свою ориентацию в пространстве. То есть он находится либо в обычном положении, либо вверх ногами и его притягивает вверх. Ещё он ходит влево-вправо. На этой нехитрой механике и строится весь игровой процесс. Путешествие проходит по мини-уровням, которые между собой неразрывно связаны. Проще всего за продвижением смотреть по специальной карте. Игра не линейна. Исследовать разные уголки карты можно в любом порядке. По уровням щедро разбросаны точки сохранения. И это неспроста. Гибнуть придется очень много. В особо сложных местах гибнешь несколько десятков раз, прежде чем пройдешь. Также есть телепорты, которые перенесут героя в нужную точку карты. Но телепорты для начала надо отыскать. Графика стилизована под игры для Atari 2600. Это тот самый показательный случай, когда классная игра сделана с минимумом графических наворотов. В игре присутствует великолепный саундтрек, который длится полчаса. Он не успевает приестся за всё время прохождения.\n\nПройти мимо VVVVVV — преступление для всех тех, кто считает своим долгом оценивать лично самые лучшие игры. Это инди-шедевр! Рекомендую!\n\n","October 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This type of game lends itself very well to the low tech style, and in my opinion is the best genre a game that emulates Atari or C64 has to offer. It has plenty of hours of gameplay and quick respawn for instant retrying. Music is very catchy and endearing. Story is interesting.\n\nCONS: I had run into several game-breaking glitches while playing. Even after I had restarted and reinstalled, the game malfunctioned in similar places. This made the game nearly unfinishable for me. It took three attempts to make it through without getting stuck in limbo, which was very frustrating.\n\nOVERALL: Despite its glitchiness, I had a lot of fun with VVVVVV. There have been recent updates (Including Steam Achievements!) So I have faith that eventually, the game will be largely without flaw.\n\nSCORE: 6/10","June 9, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has a great soundtrack. It's challenging. There's really no reason not to buy it. For a game that I thought was just a funny jumping game, it really got me invested in the storyline, which although is short, is fun and makes sense, something that I feel a lot of games don't do. I love it.\n\nMy only three cons are not even about the gameplay, which I feel is incredible.\n1. The game is short, it only took me about 2 hours to beat it, but it has a lot of replay value, as most of the achievements/alternate modes are unlockable/achievable after beating the game.\n2. If you are epileptic, you shouldn't buy this. I won't say when, but the game at some point has a lot of flashing colors.\n3. If you rage easily (no offense) then you probably shouldn't  buy this either. You will die A LOT on your first run.\n\ntl;dr 10/10 I very much recommend this game to anyone looking for a very unique and challenging game.","February 13","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sountrack is AMAZING and it features some of the best chiptunes tracks I ever seen on a game and I simply love it. The story is nothing special, atleast for me. What makes VVVVVV an excellent game it's his simple yet well polished flipping mechanic along with some optional exploration and high precision platforming sections which might make the game abit frustrating, this is definitely a great platformer and a great game, buy it, support the dev, play it, ENJOY IT!","October 4, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You explore the map looking for teleporters, and your crewmates, as well as shiny Trinkets. You have to deal with gravity, spikes, moving platforms, disappearing platforms, and enemies. This game is NOT for the weak hearted though. It's easy at first, but then it gets harder. The gauntlet will make you ANGRY. There's also custom levels made by the community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codyrockleex/recommended/70300/","codyrockleex","主のハーリ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codyrockleex/","92 products in account","VVVVVV is a challenging yet short indie platformer that is well worth the cost and a lovely fun time as a whole. The game's main innovative platforming mechanic of doing away with jumps and instead allowing the player to flip gravity in the opposite direction is delightfully fun and memorable. The characters in the game are likable even without a gripping, dramatic story and long dialogues, and the environment is easy to understand and fun to explore. Overall, the game has an atmosphere that's hard to describe perfectly, I feel. This game's only noticable short-coming, if I had to give it one, is its length; it's not too terribly long, giving the average player somewhere in the ballpark of six to twelve hours of gameplay. However short this game is, though, I absolutely recommend it. Great things come in small packages, eh? Terry Cavanagh did an excellent job as a lone developer.\n\nSpecial attention must be paid to this game's music, composed by Magnus Pålsson. This game is worth the price you pay just for the game's soundtrack alone. I'm a video game music aficionado, and this game has one of my favorite soundtracks amongst all games I've ever played. Please, do yourself a favor and either play this game or find and listen to the soundtrack by itself. Add this amazing music to a wonderful, impressionable game? Just, damn... it's too good. It's truly incredible.","December 4, 2014","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gravity reversal mechanics add something to the game play  that makes it really fun to play despite the simplistic graphics.  I feel like I'm playing berzerk but on a better platform with a twist.  The game is hard and rewarding.  You feel achievement when completing a checkpoint.  When you make a mistake, it is usually because you forgot to orient yourself to the reversed mechanic in order to get past a set of obstacles.  It's addicting and challenges the mind.   I saw Mike Matei live stream this game a couple days ago.  It was so interesting to watch, I had to give it try.\n\nEDIT:\nOne bad thing I noticed is that the character walking is slippery and inconsistent.  Sometimes a slight press in a direction bursts him into a full run often hitting spikes.  Other times his movements barely register leading to death in some other way.  Sometimes the character has momentum, and sometimes he does not.  I never understood why game devs release games like that, but overall the rest of the game is stable.","August 15, 2015","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/70300/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","VVVVVV takes its name from the game's main objective, which I shall not touch upon in order to leave the discovery to you. The first aspect of the game that took me by surprise is the superb 8-bit chiptune music. The only problem with that is that it does get repetitive only because it replays one single track for about 30 minutes at a time, until you complete each level. The graphics are imitating the general style of the Commodore 64, including its startup screen. VVVVVV's main platforming mechanic is the player's ability to flip the character's screen position vertically, going from bottom to top and vice versa. This makes for some complicated platforming in general, as well as some challenging and entertaining rooms. Because of the game's incredible difficulty, the developers have cleverly implemented checkpoints liberally throughout the game world, which cuts down on rage and frustration. With that said, VVVVVV still manages to be extremely difficult, and you should expect to die hundreds of times, if not one thousand times by the time you complete the game. The platforming and controls are not badly designed, as in Super Meat Boy, so do not confuse this well crafted, yet simplistic game with that developmental disaster. Younger generations of gamers may find the overall presentation of VVVVVV to be unique and hip, but as we all know, these graphics have been done before, about 30 years ago. One serious flaw is that there are no audio options for volume. The in-game default is quite higher than usual, and requires turning down in Windows. While the majority of the levels' rooms are a lot of fun, and well designed, some are simply unreasonable and require too much luck as opposed to actual precision and skill. Because of this, you will die many times and spend far too long attempting single rooms. Which also means being forced to listen to a single song on a loop, for the entire duration of your trials. This is something of a shortcoming and should have been avoided completely by the developers, as these uncalled-for rooms only add negatively to the experience. Even though you get unlimited lives and unlimited continues, having to repeat a single room hundreds of times in order to pass it gets boring, repetitive, annoying, and only serves the purpose of replacing actual content with limited and mundane game play. While the music is once again, excellent, there are only a few that repeat over and over, as the rest must be unlocked by finding and collecting certain orbs within the game world. There are also a few more game modes for the player to experiment with once the campaign has been completed. The storyline and ending are endearing and delightful, and once you complete the game, there is an overall feeling of satisfaction. VVVVVV is short but perfectly sweet.\n\nVVVVVV is good.","March 20, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as Captain Viridian whose spaceship gets caught in a space warp. The warp damages the ship and scatters the crew of the ship in space so its up to you to find them and rescue them. So how is this game ? Its a great platformer without a doubt. Youre Charecter controlls great and if you die its pretty much youre fault. The game style is sort of like those Metroidvania games. It has an open world enviroment and you can go where you want. Even though it might seem simple enough this game gets very complex on the later parts of the game. Youre charecter can choose where to walk on the ceilling or on the floor. Later levels get really hard and it might make you quit the game, but the game never gets so difficult that you will never finish it. The music is really awesome and its one of the best soundtracks out there. The only major flaw is that this game is pretty short almost under 2 hours. Overall a really good game that if by the time youre reading this review havent played it, check it out right now great music, awesome enviroments and collectibels throught the game you can find to increase the games lenght.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfienoakes/recommended/70300/","alfienoakes","Dolphin Buff Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfienoakes/","230 products in account","This game is one of those faux hard games where it is generally the fact that you can't see what is coming in the next room that kills you, not interesting AI or challenging puzzles. I persoanlly do not appreciate these types of games, but I do understand there is an audience for them. If you are into speed runs and that sort of thing, then this might be for you. I do not beleive this applies to most people though.\n\nThe actual exploration of the world was really cool though, I always love Metroid style exploration. I beleive that it was done well, with the map being quite interesting, and each section having some really unique bits and pieces to seperate it from other parts of the world.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioing is that it is incrediby short if you are just trying to finish the "main story". I'm not the best at these games, but the 1.8 hours is all it took. No doubt the time trials will make up for this for people willing to go through some severe frustration.","November 20, 2015","false","1.8"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Dexterity challenges and puzzles became mean spirited and unenjoyably difficult. I found myself cursing the game on many occasion "♥♥♥♥ this game!" I only finished it because I knew that my friend had and that it is mercifully short. Overall I'm pretty disappointed in the overall experience of this game and wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe Good:\nOpen world to explore. I really dug this aspect of the game. Even though it is a fairly small world it makes the whole game feel more cohesive.\nSome really great mechanics and level design.\nFun challenges\n\nThe Bad:\nShoddy controls. Half the time I died was because the character wouldn't stop when I wanted or go as far as I needed it to when commanded.\nLame graphics. The 4 bit art style itself was not offensive to me. I thought it kinda charming. It was the "enemies", obstacles, and "glitchy" elements of the game that just were just plain lame or ugly.\nThe music, which was pretty catchy at first, overtime became annoying due to how much it repeats as you replay a section over and over again.\n\nThe Ugly:\nLevel design that just feels mean. I seriously felt like the designers were laughing at me as I struggled to overcome some of the ridiculous sections of the game. The frequency of some of the check points are an indicator of just how difficult some parts of the game are.","May 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"
