"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackplastick/recommended/444650/","blackplastick","LolUMad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackplastick/","466 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYet another unplayable game accepting your money TOO EARLY for early access. Since when did steam become kickstarter? People want SOMETHING playable for their money. They are not on steam to hand out donations.\n\nYou don't even need to make playable games anymore. Just make an attention grabbing description and PROFIT!\n\nHere are the things you can do:\n\nGather plastic, wood and scrap.\nDeficate everywhere (I'm serious. They squat and leave a turd pile. And they do this a lot in full view of everybody).\nBuild an outhouse.\nKill German Shepherds (who die and immediately become "rotten").\nYou can mark out a zone for storage but once your people put stuff there, there is apparently no way for them to get anything out again.\n\nThe UI is cryptic and impossible to figure out.\nThere are no icons for anything (just white box place holders for them).\nThere are no descriptions of anything (white boxes with no text)\n\nWhile I was playing, a foreigner came to my camp and everybody just stood around taking dumps in full view of her.\n\nI explored nearly the whole map and there were no enemies. I am still trying to figure out what this game is supposed to be. Is it a zombie game? Is it a mad max type game? Is it a game where I can build an outhouse, a fence or a cardboard bed and play it like The Sims?\n\nI guess we will have to wait and see.  It's a cool idea, I hope it eventually becomes something worth playing but for now thumbs down.","April 21","false","0.9"," 205 of 272 people (75%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","75","205","272","26","35"

The creators repeatedly reference that this is a pre-alpha and that it'll probably take two years for the game to be finished.\n\nWith that in mind, the game at this stage is severely lacking practically everything that makes a game a game. Visuals will become distorted periodically, the game’s mechanics are still on their early stage of being introduced, and hilariously there’s no saving system in place (WTF I know). But….. and that’s a big but, I recommended this game for its stated goals and ambitions. I recommended this game because I want others to at least ponder the idea this game is trying to develop. I highly doubt I’ll be playing this game anytime (I’ve played some 10 min and for god’s sake it’s in all seriousness broken).\n\nBuying this game right now is more like funding a Kickstarter with an access to a dysfunctional game. Though, I’m really excited for what’s to come. Plus, they’ll raise the price up once they near official release date, so I’m mainly taking advantage of the early discount.\n\n**Edit**\nThe game is "playable" now with its latest patch with graphics being more fine-tuned (No more severely distorted visuals, YAYY) but still lacks depth. Many planned core essentials are still to come.","April 21","true","0.8"," 41 of 67 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","41","67","0","10"

It does not contain enough playable content (and yes I know it's Alpha) to merit spending the money at this time.  You cannot currently save your progress, you can't truly control what your citizens do, there's no real rhyme or reason for why your citizens choose to do what they do.  I would recommend buying this after the dev has had a while to incorporate some more playable features and refine the game a little bit.","May 1","false","1.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

They just really need to quickly update it with some of the key feautres without compeletly broken bugs, just 1-2 shanties, or even just a save.

The developers are pretty clear (see the roadmap on their site) about the current state of the game and their future plans. I bought this fully on the look and feel and concept. If you want to eventually play the game that this rough platform *can be* then support the devs at this early stage. If not then wait until it's ready to play, or at least further along. This is totally the post-apoc game I want to play someday.\n\nI did a little "Let's Try" on this one on my YT site.

I mostly bought this game because it has real potential and it is a game I have wanted to see for a while. It seems like it will be awesome once it is polished and has some shoes on its feet.\n\nIt isn't playable - for me at least - in its current state. The good news is the Raod map ( http://endciv.de/roadmap ). It is promissing and doesn't seem to over exurt itself with over cocky ambitions. It is focused and it has momentum. As long as they do not follow in the foot step of The Dead Linger, then this game will be just right for those who want something of this nature.","April 21","true","1.9"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","0"

The game is very simplistic as stated, but does offer some interesting components to play around with.\n\nCurrently the music plays wonderfully and most menus are usable and working correctly.\n\nMy maps load with terrain missing (as expected) but I am still able to gather resources and build a fire.\n\nAlready I am happy with the the very early stages and expect this game to fully meet my expectations. I love the whole idea of Sims meets end of the world.

I personally dont think the asking price is extortionate, hell I'll go out on Friday night and spend five times the cost of the game and have nothing to show for it in the morning.\n\nNow for the review.....\nAt this time of this review I have just over 2hrs of  gameplay and a few things i need to mention. This game was only released today and i expected it to a bit buggy with some features lacking but theres loads of features missing or not implemented yet i should say. Crafting is very limited, with only a fire, cardboard bed, light, toilet, storage barrel, fence and crafting bench to build at the moment, the crafting bench doesnt work for me although it does give me a produce option which is all blank, Im also unable to plant any crops so anyone expecting these features now may want a wait for a few updates before purchasing it. Overall I'd say its worth its current purchase price but it definatly needs work.\n","April 21","true","3.7"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","9","22","0","0"

But it has the potential to become outstanding, hence why I recommend it to anyone who is fine with investing in an incomplete game.\n\nThere isn't much to review yet and as to be expected with an early Alpha there are bugs and issues galore but I've seen steady if not speedy progress on development.\n\nSo, buy it if you're willing to take a fairly cheap investment risk, just know it isn't a playable game yet.","June 2","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
