Look no further as Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is what you need.\nGame Overview\nMegamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is an open world action RPG that focuses on a theme inspired by the vibe of the 1980s. You play as Phoban, an aspiring wizard who attempts to follow the footsteps of their father by joining the Order and the younger brother of Deimon.\n\nGetting a grasp on how the gameplay goes is fairly easy as the game guides you through any new stuff or mechanic that you encounter throughout the whole play through. The game has five (5) different spell categories that you can learn and master which are: Neonmancy, Vegemancy, Sanctumancy, Fulgomancy and Necromancy. These spells, along with the minions that you can summon at your disposal (referred to as "grims") needed to be learned first and requires a certain number of item drops to be crafted before it is usable in combat.\n\nAll in all, there are twenty (20) spells and sixteen (16) grims that you can craft and research, with each spell having their own use and functionality and each grim with their own unique passive and active skills.\n\n\nThe Pros\nUnique Game Concept - Deviating from the whole level-up norm of role-playing games, the unique setting of the game to get "stronger" is through collecting scrolls to craft your different kind of spells and finding and observing the abilities certain minions to turn and summon them as your grims, which are both unique and interesting. In addition to that, the game play of it being acted on real time makes it more engaging and challenging at the same time.\n\nClean Game Graphics - Aside from the game getting the visualization of what the 80s feel like and setting the theme perfectly, what I really like in the graphics is that it shows a really clean interface through-out as well as with the designs of all of the game assets (characters, scenery, effects, etc.).\n\nBeautiful Soundtracks - This is definitely one of the greatest assets that the game can offer, and I can proudly say that I have idled the game a few times while on play just to listed to its soundtracks. It is very captivating, nostalgic, and most of all, it doesn't sound annoying even after long periods of playing.\n\nLocal Co-op Ready - The game features the ability of enabling up to four (4) additional players to control over your "grims" (summoned minions), however their actions are limited only to the actions that the grims are able to do (in which they are only able to do the normal and special attacks).\nThe Cons\nWeak Story Delivery - Don't get this wrong. This doesn't mean that the game doesn't have a backdrop that makes it deeper, as it does execute well in foreshadowing and setting the theme. However, the game suffers on a poor dialogue delivery of the characters, which in turn fails to make it more immersive story-wise. For example, a sacrifice of a certain character when giving up his life for his loved ones should be somewhat dramatic, right? In this game's case, it failed to give that dramatic feeling. Hence, displaying a poor delivery of the story.\n\nLow Replay Value - Aside from the fact that this game could be played co-op locally with your friends or replaying the game through another difficulty, there really isn't anything that could bind you to into playing the game again once you have finished a single play through. Some reasons include the story's linearity (although, there are some few choices that can be made in the game but it doesn't really affect the story that much), as well as the lack of side-quest presence (though some summons and spells might require some grinding to get them all).\n\nThe Verdict\nIn the sum of all the pros and cons, this  game is fun to play and is definitely worth the value it asks.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","May 31","true","43.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","25","25","0","2"

Upon loading up the game for the first time you are met with a flashy ’80s style neon introductory video and the game itself is heavily inspired by and a tribute to ’80s culture, while also blending various different game genres such as RPG and RTG.\n\n-- GAMEPLAY:\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, though. To attack enemies you simply select a spell in your hot bar and right-click on an enemy. You have the typical mana bar that refills over time or, alternatively, you can pick up mana blobs from dead enemies or from dispensers around the world. You can also spawn AI companions known as a “Grims”. This is where the RTS element comes into play. Grims can be told where to go, who to attack and how to attack. You can either highlight or left-click them to manoeuvre them around the map, and you can also carry out heavy attacks on your enemies by holding shift and left-click. It’s like having a companion in your favourite RPG, but in Megamagic you can control where they go and what they attack. However, if you’re more worried about yourself, they can do just fine by themselves – or you can invite co-op partners to control them for you.\n\nThe enemies are a bit odd. In the first place, there’s no real explanation as to why you are attacking all the things that you encounter. They are also quite repetitive with little variety to be had. Blasting these enemies at first was pretty decent fun, but you’ll grow tired of the constant spamming of the mouse after a while.\n\nOutside of blasting enemies with spells, there are puzzles.\nI found these to be one of the best elements in the game,because there's a variety of puzzles that require you to dash past projectiles.\n\n\n-- SOUND:\n\nMusic tracks done by Mitch Murder, suits the game perfectly.\n\n-- GRAPHICS:\n\nVisually, Megamagic is stunning. The art style matches the ’80s theme very well. The colours are bright and the level design varies nicely with bright blue cubic levels, to the dusty desert.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn conclusion, Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is funny and challenging.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","April 29","true","11.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","20","27","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/422650/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is a wonderful RPG/strategy with a fantastic story and hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nStory\nMegamagic is set in a futuristic world where magic flows freely (to those who can master it) and you play young Phoban, a wizard who wants to enroll in the Order. Now i’m not going to give too much away about the story as for me this was the reason I kept playing and playing and I’d hate to spoil any of it. There is great substance and depth to it and I genuinely felt myself wanting to help Phoban and ultimately find out what happens to him and the rest of the people you meet. The dialogue is really well written and very witty with many pop culture references which is fun. The more I played the more I felt myself becoming attached to various characters and hating others which to me is always a sign of fantastic writing. The game follows a linear story across multiple chapters that most conclude with awesome boss fights.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nThe gameplay is fairly easy to grasp and everything is explained in a tutorial for those unfamiliar. Spells are your main attack but you also have grims which are summonable creatures which will fight on your behalf. You start with a single grim and two or three spells but you’ll quickly find new spells throughout the world along with learning how to summon new grims. Spells can be found on scrolls but the grim system is very different and very interesting. Instead of capturing grims or learning how to summon them you must instead ‘research’ them. Grims have passive, active and special abilities and you’ll need to encounter your chosen grims and witness their abilities. Once you’ve seen the required amount of abilities and collected the required elements you can then ‘craft’ that grim for use whenever you want. There are many spells and grims in the game to discover, though some will require a little more looking than others. Your hotbar can only hold five spells and three grims though, so no matter how many you have learn you’ll only have 8 total abilities to choose from at any one time.\n\nThough the story is linear there is a nice sized world which can be explored and MOST areas can be revisited after leaving them so there is a nice optional element of exploration there. This being said there are no side-quests as incentive to explore so it’s entirely up to you to progress directly through the game or veer of the path slightly.\nAlong with combat you’ll also find puzzles dotted around the game world ranging from simple memory puzzles to timing puzzles and even a quick platformer style dodge the object puzzle. Most of these will require you to use your grims and spells to complete and are a nice little break from the usual combat based gameplay you’ll be encountering. I actually enjoyed the puzzles a lot more than the combat and found myself wishing the puzzle/combat ration was reversed.\n\nGraphics and Audio\nThe graphics of Megamagic are nice with a nostalgic retro feel. The isometric feel alongside all the neon lights and awesome soundtrack give the game a great 80’s feel. The graphics options are limited though with a noticeable lack of a windowed mode option which was a little annoying as I tend to play games in windowed when I’m using multi-monitors for other things.\n\nCons\nMy ONLY two negatives about the game is the combat/controls and the lack of a levelling system. The controls are the biggest issue for me  and if i’m honest, it made me quit the game multiple times. Maybe it’s just me but I HATE them, especially in combat and they are UNMAPPABLE. Moving my minions with shift & click WHILST moving myself with WASD WHILST casting with 1-8 WHILST holding shift & click to cast my minions special WHILST using space to dash away (my only defense) is just too much. There’s nothing more to it. Everything would be a lot easier if I could remap my keys because changing shift to my extra mouse buttons would fix this entirely as way I could control myself with one hand and my minions with the other.\nThis is made so much worse by the games stupid spawn rates on enemies. I understand this probably sounds rude but it needs to be fixed and multiple people have complained about it on the discussion and have just been ignored by the developers. Enemies currently respawn in an area the second you move out of sight from them which doesn’t sound too bad until you realise some areas are full of weaving corridors where enemies will spawn behind you the second you defeat them with another mob in front of you killing you where you can’t move (Power Station is the biggest problem right now with this issue).\nThe last thing which in my eyes is a con is the lack of any kind of levelling, be it for yourself, your spells or your grims so that minute amount of damage you do with your first spell in the tutorial is the same damage that spell will do the WHOLE game. It renders 75% of the spells unusable because they just become redundant. It would feel a lot more RPG-y if there was the choice to level stats or spells or grims or just something so you feel a little more in control of your playstyle.\n\nSummary\nOverall Megamagic is a fantastic game with a really, really, really well written story. The characters and lovable the dialogue is witty and clever and the puzzles are awesome. Though i’m not a huge fan of the combat there is a narrative mode if you want to avoid it and the story is well worth every second. A really fantastic buy.","May 24","true","15.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

It has some combat issues, but the story will keep you hooked from the intro cutscene.\n.Story/Premise.\nMegamagic is set in a future where the collision between Earth and a meteor results in the "Neon Age" in which people can use magic. You are Phoban, the son of a great wizard who stole an ancient artefact: a staff that possesses the power to grant the user with a single wish. Within the artefact is a critter you've befriended by the name of Fum who will die once the staff's power is used and you just can't have that. Thus, the race is on to prevent people from using the staff and killing of your blue cloud buddy. You'll fight off members of a powerful magical order, punks, robots, magical summons known as Grims--and then some. All in order to save your friend.\n\nMegamagic spans over a dozen linear chapters, most of which end with a boss fight of sorts, and the story is well-written. You'll find yourself wondering about characters and their motives during your romp through the Megamagic world and each is developed in such a way that you want to know more about this magical world Phoban inhabits.\n\n.Game play.\nYou use the WASD keys to move around and the mouse to attack. Exploration is limited as the only thing you'll find by wandering around is more enemies. Occasionally you'll find breakable objects resembling chests that you can break open for materials in crafting spells, but not frequently enough to warrant breaking away from the beaten path.\n\nEnemies wander the map and will attack you on sight, so keep your wits about you. They won't stop between spawn zones, so running away isn't an option as doing so will usually just result in being overrun by hostiles. Your spells, including Phoban's personal spells and the Grims he summons, are hotkeyed to your numeric buttons 1-9; you select a spell by pressing one of these keys and then you use that spell by clicking the right mouse button. You can control your Grim (or Grims) by holding down the shift key. This becomes incredibly difficult when you're trying to run around with WASD in order to avoid dying while simultaneously attempting to tell your Grims to target something specific.\n\nYou can also steal energy by getting within range of an enemy and hitting the 'f' key.\n\nIn order to learn more spells, you need to craft them using materials you gather upon slaying enemies. The system is intuitive and easy, but pretty shallow from an RPG standpoint. Grims can also be learned through crafting, though obtaining them is a little more complex. In order to do so, you have to have slain a certain number of the Grim in question and will also have to have seen the Grim use its special and passive skills in combat. Once those parameters are fulfilled, it's just a question of having the correct materials and you'll be able to add your new Grim to your hotkey bar no problem.\n\nYou'll also use your Grims to solve puzzles, which I must admit are quite rewarding to figure out. Sometimes you'll manually control them in order to press switches out of Phoban's reach and sometimes you'll use them as cannon fodder in order to figure out the safer path. I quite enjoyed them and, though there were a few head-scratchers, I haven't encountered anything too difficult to solve on my own.\n\n.BGM and Art Style.\nThe soundtrack is catchy and funky. I found myself humming along on more than on occasion. If you even remotely liked the music from the trailer, you'll enjoy the rest of what Megamagic has to offer.\nThe characters and world are brightly coloured, the former being drawn in a cartoon-y style. No two areas look the same, and stylistically every one of the characters from the main cast are radically different. In short, the game looks great. There's a shortage of Grim types, but that's a minor complaint.\n\n.Longevity.\nI'm on the fourth chapter as of writing this review and it's taken me around 4 hours to get here. I'm sure the later chapters will be longer, so it's safe to assume that you'll get 20+ hours if you're taking your time to read the story. There are three difficulties, but there're no achievements tied to the hardest difficulty, so it's likely that only people wanting to test themselves will select it. That being said, I've died plenty of times on normal--to the point where I had to take a five-minute break before reattempting a fight.\n\n.Pros and Cons.\n+Colourful, cartoon-y art style.\n+Catchy soundtrack.\n+Well-written story.\n+Well-rounded character and character dynamics.\n+The ability to summon familiars that act independent (or not) of you.\n+Fun, not-too-difficult puzzles.\n-Combat\nThis is where this game falls short. Not in a huge, game-breaking way, but I'm sure if you've read other reviews for this game you've heard the same complaint: combat is a little awkward and sometimes difficult to the point of cruelty.\n-Spawn rate/enemy spawn zoning\nThe spawn rate of enemy Grims is a little bugged: if you're walking with your own summons toddling behind you, they can reset the respawn timer of the zone you just left--resulting in another mob. If you were already fighting and running around to avoid projectiles when this happens, you can end up having multiple mods swarming you. I'm sure I don't have to tell you why this is a problem. There's currently no fix for the weird spawn rate, but controlling your units and sending them ahead of you works pretty well.\n-Linear maps without many easter eggs or incentive to explore\n\n.Bottom Line.\nIn its current state, I could recommend Megamagic: Wizards of a Neon Age only if you're okay with your action game lacking in the combat department. Everything else--the soundtrack, the story, and the character design--is polished and lovely, so it would be a shame to miss out on the experience because of a few hiccups. Megamagic is a solid adventure that will bring you back to the 80s without any need for a time machine.","May 31","true","5.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is an action RPG in a unique retro 1980s-inspired setting.\n\nThe world in which the game is set is like a magic-infested 1980s, with neon and robotics run wild, and zombies a real problem for any populated areas. It's a crazy setting, but it works, and for the most part is very fun.\n\nAfter a brief cut scene giving some background to the world, you play through a brief interactive introductory segment in which you control a father who has stolen two very powerful magical objects, and delivers his twin boys and these objects to his brother. The game proper then starts, 10 years later, and you play one of the boys, Phoban, now a teenager keen to join the Order, the most powerful group of magicians in the world.\n\nUnfortunately things don't go as planned for Phoban, and you quickly find yourself the Neon Age's most wanted fugitive, on the run from the Order, which wants nothing more than to beat you down and claim the stolen magical objects.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics are for the most part very nice, and portray the unique setting fabulously. Effects, too, are quite fancy and well done. Graphics settings are minimal and comprise resolution, anti-aliasing, and v-sync settings. The game does chug a bit in busy fights on an above minimum, but not quite recommended, graphics card.\n\nThe interface is relatively clean, although icons are a little confusing at first, and for some reason tooltips didn't show up for me on anything until after I'd finished the tutorial section. I'm not sure if this was intended or not.\n\nSound - Sound effects are suitable for the game, with lots of 'lazer'-like zapping and powing, and 80s videogame effect sounds. The voiceover in the introduction and the title screen is hilarious, like a cross between a big-bass radio voice and the old Thundercats introductory voiceover. Great stuff!\n\nThe Steam page makes a fuss about the music, which is apparently by the same creator that did the music for Hotline Miami 2, Mitch Murder. I'd never heard of him before, but the music does fit the setting well, and is mostly pretty good.\n\nGameplay - Megamagic plays a bit like an 80s-themed Diablo, but with quite poor controls and an interface that doesn't quite work sometimes.\n\nYou control Phoban with WASD, moving around the fixed-isometric-view world. The mouse is used to interact with the on-screen interface, pressing buttons and whatnot, as well as to select, aim, fire spells, etc. It should work well, but for some reason I just had trouble with it: interface buttons sometimes wouldn't function, and particularly controlling my pets ('grims') often didn't work properly. For example, I had difficulty getting through the tutorial sections because holding  shift and right-mouse to activate my pet's ability didn't work for about five minutes; I had to minimise and return to the game and then it decided to work.\n\nIt's a real shame a controller can't be used for the main player. Instead the developers included a weird sort-of local multiplayer option where other people can control the main character's pets with controllers, while the main player is forced to use keyboard and mouse. I don't have anyone else to play with so I can't test this out. It seems sort of cool, but not at the expense of being able to use a controller for a single player.\n\nCombat is real time, and with no pause mode that allows you to issue commands or stack spell activations (ala Neverwinter Nights), so it all ends up being a bit hectic and not very strategic for the most part. Which is a shame, because with turn-based or pause-based-real-time combat, this game could really shine!\n\nAs you progress through the game Phoban becomes more powerful, gaining access to more summonable grims and more spells, both of which must be researched and various components collected before they can be created at one of the relatively rare crafting locations. It's a bit contrived, but it works well enough, and the range of spells and creatures available to you as you progress is quite large.\n\nEven with the sometimes-unresponsive interface and slightly disappointing and frustrating combat, Megamagic is still a ton of fun. The setting is outrageous and well realised; the plot is silly, but enjoyable; the characters poke fun at the plot and each other on occasion; and the whole thing mostly just works.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ ridiculous setting that is very well implemented and great fun\n+ great graphics\n+ good music and hilarious voiceovers\n+ achievements\n+ trading cards\n+ the script is well written and not plagued with poor grammar and spelling, like far too many other titles\n+ the setting (it deserves another mention)\n\nCons:\n- combat isn't as fun as it should be; the 'strategy' tag really doesn't apply in most cases here\n- controls don't work as well as they should\n- the interface sometimes doesn't work properly\n- the fixed isometric viewpoint makes some sections frustrating, and sometimes hides the action\n- the on-screen interface sometimes hides the action, including the quest compass (so you can't see where you have to go)\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age is a fun action RPG with a great 80s cartoon vibe to it, which is unfortunately held back by some control and interface issues, and too-frantic real-time combat.\n\nIt's a great title and I'm really enjoying playing it, but it could have been even better.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 21","true","3.9"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","18","31","2","1"

Opting for a retro-futuristic setting, the game pays homage to all things that made the 80's so funky! From the neon lights to the techno beats, Megamagic has it all!\n\nThe story starts with the father of two sons having no choice but to leave his children at their uncle's for their own safety as he is being hunted by entities known only as the "Erasers". Ten years after the event, the two boys, Phoban and Deimon, are all grown up and are naturals in magical arts. Having found their father's magical relics, they strive to become one of the many great wizards in the Order. Little did they know that the relics are actually ancient artifacts of immense power, capable of changing reality as we know it. Confused, hunted and separated, Phoban, along with ghostly companion Fum, must find a way to reunite with his brother and ultimately stop the mischievous plan of the Order.\n\nMegamagic plays a lot like being a Sorcerer class from the Diablo series with the abilities to summon Grims to do your bidding. Phoban moves by using the WASD keys, while the mouse targets the magic used. This game doesn't have any cooldown system so you're free to spam as fast as you can click your mouse. The catch, however, is that initially you have a very limited mana bar and laughable regeneration rate. Without any actual melee capabilities (there is one but is extremely weak and should only be used conditionally as Phoban is pretty much fragile), having zero mana leaves you to the mercy of your enemies and how good can you maneuver Phoban amidst the chaos while waiting for your mana bar to recharge.\n\nThe other important aspect, and where the real time strategy sets in place, is the summoning system. Summoning Grims (various monsters you've encountered, researched and later crafted) are vital to your survival. Grims are generally controlled automatically by the AI (or to my surprised, by your friends too via local co-op!) by either defensive or offensive modes. These however aren't exactly effective when you're dealing with massive hordes, so take control of them as you would in an RTS game! Select your units, hold Shift, and hit Right Click to redirect them to where you precisely wanted them to be or attack. Each Grims also comes with varying active and passive abilities so customization and selection are possible to accommodate your play style.\n\nLet's move on to the Pros & Cons:\n\nPROS\nThe world and character designs are GORGEOUS, staying true to a cartoonish style with an appropriate 80's setting!\nInteresting and captivating story that rolls out quite nicely from the start.\nThe soundtracks are spot on for the game! Mitch Murder's work is brilliant and I'm considering in getting the OSTs if they'd ever released it.\nThe combat system is well thought of and is highly enjoyable. If it weren't for some questionable design mechanics, it would be near to perfect. (More on that later)\nThe dialogues are hilarious, especially the conversations Phoban usually has with Fum! Also, don't forget to check out the funny little details that comes with spells and summons!\nThe game runs great with no technical issue whatsoever. It runs stable with 60 FPS all around, even in intense combat. All of Steam's basic functions are also present and functional.\nThe game offers three difficulty settings right off the bat. Narrative (easy), Standard and Old School (hard) so there's a level appropriate for everyone.\nTo my surprise, this game offers local co-op with up to 4 players! I didn't notice this initially but a quick look at the key layout revealed that multiplayer is possible with controllers. I had my friend test it with me and it works great! The only thing is that the other players can only control your Grims. So, basically the secondary players have only two modes of attack. It's not as fun to the others in the long run but it helps that you don't have to worry about your Grims placement in battle, unless of course, you've unlocked the Destroyer, then oh boy, FIRE AWAY!\nCombat loadouts are flexible so you can choose how many spells, or how many Grims that you wanna take along.\nNEUTRAL\nThe game boasts an open world RPG but I personally felt like it's too shallow as the game doesn't offer any side quests (as of Chapter 4) to justify roaming around the world. Sure, you can backtrack to the previous locations but without any levels, quests or loots, the only reason to backtrack is to look for the spells that you may have missed, farming for crafting materials and to complete the research on a specific Grim.\nThe spawn rate in some area is just ridiculous (Chapter 3's Power Plant, for example) and it's easy to be steamrolled by mobs, especially if you're low on health. Also, approaching save points, healing your party, will also spawn all enemies again a la Dark Souls. This can be frustrating when navigating through a tough section in the game.\nCONS\nFor a game that requires fast and frantic movement, it's mind-boggling to think that they didn't include a default RUN button or animations! You can only dash for a few meters with the Spacebar and even that has quite a delay. So, basically, in the heat of the battle, Phoban just strolls around, waving his staff around and dashes occasionally. I felt like this limitation is what hurts the initially hectic but fun combat pace to sluggish, even frustrating, when you're dodging or fleeing.\nStory-related conversations are initiated automatically when you're near, whether you like it or not.\nKeys are not remappable. Honestly, I'm not really comfortable with the default preset keybindings.\nThere's no maps so navigating the world could be a bit confusing, especially at the outdoors.\nMelee attacks are EXTREMELY weak. I know that the game focuses on using magic but c'mon, this is just embarrassing!\nThe crafting system feels a bit too simple.\nEven with the minor design flaws, Megamagic: Wizards of the Neon Age gets a well-deserved 4/5! It is a solid indie title and one that can stand tall and proud with the other indie giants on the market.\nIf you're a fan of the action RPG genre, fascinated by the 80's aesthetic in the same vein as Blood Dragon and Kung Fury and enjoys a good cartoon once in a while, then I have no trouble recommending it, even at the full $15 price tag. Rest assured you'll get your money's worth!\n\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Took a little while to get adjusted to the battle system ur screwed stuck at 2 summons, 3 is where the fun starts.  80s magic and zombies for the win.  Got into the Chapter 6 and it starts gliching, plz fix.","April 21","true","13.1"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Nice audio throughout the rest of the game also.\nGameplay, Great combat very flexible spells/abilities, very interesting combat, interesting story, also has a nice amount of puzzles spaced throughout the game.\nCo-op, A bit of a gimmick, its nice to have but dont purchase if you are wanting a co-op heavy game.","April 20","true","14.5"," 15 of 38 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","15","38","0","0"

Its very 80s looking - the story is touching, funny, and something new. I like that the main character isn't a traditional hero - trying to keep his "pet" and not listening to the upper people who he was going to join. There are tons of characters to talk to, magic to learn, and monsters to defeat. Its a really well made game so far!","April 20","true","0.8"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","0"

It looks really cool, and the prologue was real fun. But the tutorials were so boring. The load times were awful. There was constant dialogue and "cutscenes" that would take away your control while it slowly pans the camera over, then slowly gives you the dialogue, then the other character slowly walks away. The early level combat was uninteresting as my main attack did very little damage, and I'm stuck watching this giant rat thing slowly chew on a guy who is constantly shooting me with his gun.\n\nPROS:\n+Funky background music\n+Possibly cool high-level combat(?)\n+It's almost as 80's as Blood Dragon\n\nCONS:\n-Load times\n-Slow cutscenes\n-Almost not playing the game at the start\n-Early combat uninteresting\n-Boring tutorial\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t "don't get hit" tutorial\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like this game, but it makes a really poor first impression.","April 20","false","0.7"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","16","54","0","1"

Really, really enjoyed the art, and the story line was good, the dialogue was all really funny at times. It had a really cool game design where as you progress, you learn new spells and some other spells become obsolete, so you're kind of always changing exactly how you play the game. (I noticed some people mentioned this as a bad thing in their reviews, I guess it's just personal preference but I really liked it). Overall, I did like the game, there were definitely a few things that let it down though. There were a few bugs, with really crazy spawn rates in some areas, enemies not attacking, the AI of the grims was a bit out of whack sometimes, and sometimes if you haven't added a certain spell before a fight, it can make the boss almost impossible to beat  (e.g. Hogan & the last boss. I spent like 20 minutes trying to beat Hogan and getting him barely down to half health)  so you might have to reload the game from an earlier point and then do some things all over again. The game also crashed my laptop when I first tried to load it (not sure what that was about).\n\nAlso, major spoiler, but i was confused why Fum sacrificed himself to bring back Deimon, when he could have at least sacrificed himself to bring back... everyone that Merklyn had killed? If the magic was supposed to be that strong? Or at least the uncle guy from the beginning too. Something like that. Just thought it was a little weird, not exactly where I would have gone with the plot\n\nBUT, overall, cool game! :^) Definitely would play a sequel if they make one (hoping they do)","June 4","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
