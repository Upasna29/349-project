Cheap laughs, fun to play, with lots of gore, but after watching crowds of zombies be cut up by a lawn mower blade for the 150th time, the game can lose its charm.\n\nBeing able to pick up anything off the ground and use it as a weapon is definitly fun, but you slowly start to realise really how little of them actually benefit you. You'd think having hundreds of ways to kill a zombie would be good for some mindeless fun, and it is for the first few hours... but soon enough it grows tedious, and soon you find the zombies are just a bunch of traffic cones that you can easily kick over as they constantly get in your way. They add little challenge to the game, and are literally just walking manaquins for you to unleash your boyhood fantasies of drawing dead stick figuers a hundred times on a blank sheet of paper with a red marker. Its fun, but don't expect something perminant, the gimic of zombie killing wears down quickly, and as soon as you run out of objects to play around with, mowing down zombies is about as exciting as mowing down a lawn, tedious and just a lot of work.  Fortunatly when you get to that point, (and believe me you will) There are several unique and challenging boss fights or psychopaths to take on with your aresonal of orange juice and brooms with a machetes duct taped to the ends. Each one shows signs of multiple psychiatric discorders to reflect the grievance of whatever situation they are cought in. These psychopaths easily steal the show, and I found myself attempting to hunt down each one of them, as each of them were unique, varied, with different weapons and personalities.\n\nI can't exactly say the same for the main story though... This time around in contrast to dead rising 2, you play as Frank West in an alternate story line where he is lazily strapped into the same scenes as Chuck Greene was in from the main game. All the side characters basicaly share almost exactly the same diologue, while Frank might change up a few of Chuck Greene's original lines. You'll more then likely play the main story once then blow it off completely in future attempts of the game as its nothing special, and you probably didn't pick this game up for an enthralling story in the first place. Sorry Frank,, but you're little crysis is as lame as your cheezy one liners. At least with this incardnation of Dead Rising 2, it comes with several DLCs free of charge, and a whole section of the map that was previously blocked off in the vanilla game. Other then that, its nearly the exact same game, just with an alternate story line.If you enjoy violance with all the blood and gore to bath yourself with, then you'll enjoy all your common household objects duct tapped to pointy things as you mindlessly slay walking targets in as multiple ways as the game allows. Fun and cheap, you might come back to it every once in a while for some mindless zombie killing, but without real challenge, it' won't be long before the fun of zombie slaying soon becomes a chore and this game drifts back into your library and remains untouched in till that one bored friend comes over and boots it up. 7.5/10","June 17, 2014","true","43.1"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","39","46","0","1"

You will have plenty of content here to play with compared to Dead Rising 2.  With this you will have Sandbox Mode, a new area to explore, and more combo weapons.  The story may not be canon to the main story but it is still amazing and worth your time.  Even with the game's performance and optimization problems you will still have a great time with it.  Although if you have played Dead Rising 2 and beat it already, it may not be the best value.  Also avoid coop at all costs unless you want frustration.\n\n\nPros and Cons\nPros      Great alternative (But non-canon) story with a great twist near the end!  Worth paying attention too.\nStill the same amazing Dead Rising 2 base gameplay, but with a new area to explore and more combo weapons.\nSandbox mode was added for more challenges to do and a unlimited amount of time to slaughter zombies!\nThis feels like a more complete experience than Dead Rising 2, having way more options, taking out the non-popular Terror is Reality gamemode and adding in Sandbox Mode and a more complete story.  You won't need to play any of the side games or even the first game to realize what happens after the story or before.\nCons      Poorly optimized, I lag a LOT in the Platinum and Silver strip, going down to 25-30FPS when indoors I get a solid 60.\nLaughable graphics options, only having the ability to change shadows, atmospheric filtering, and zombie quality.\nCrashes EVERYWHERE.  The game crashes when you have the wrong audio settings on your PC, it crashes if you have a long name or name with weird characters on Steam.\nThis may not even be worth the money to you if you have played Dead Rising 2 to death already.\nTerrible coop.  You will constantly get disconnected and you will be hard pressed to play this game with a friend.\nAlso if you are curious, yes Games for Windows live is gone.","June 4, 2015","true","46.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","1"

No more health ticking down its just a giant world of fun. everything respawns and you just have fun playing whatever you want in the game. Also playable in CO-OP. there are also challenges if you get bored but so far...i don't see it happening. This is worth the 19.99.

It is essentially a response to fans of the series who loved the second game but weren't big fans of the protagonist Chuck Greene and wanted a return of Frank West.\n\nIn Off the Record you play as Frank West, the protagonist of the original Dead Rising. There are a lot of notable differences the two characters have compared to each other. Frank is a lovable charismatic scoundrel who largely looks out for his own self interest above all else. His animations are also different given how he's much pudgier. You go through mostly the same story and missions as the original, just with Frank instead of Chuck. Frank being the protagonist greatly improves the quality of the story to this game, and it feels like a more natural continuation of the original Dead Rising.\n\nThe biggest differences between Off the Record and 2 is in the sidequests. The photography minigame from the original returns, alongside a very much improved endless mode. The endless mode is the biggest reason to pick this game up since Dead Rising 2 lacked it. It allows the player to explore Fortune City with no time limit and additional challenges. The user interface is also much improved.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original Dead Rising 2 I guarantee you'll love Off the Record even more. It's exactly what fans of the series originally wanted and delivers in almost every way. I would even recommend it over the original release due to how similar the two experiences are to each other.\n\nOne last thing to note is that Capcom graciously patched Games For Windows Live out of both this game and the original Dead Rising 2. So I would greatly recommend the Steam release for it is now the definitive version of the game.","March 24","true","3.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

The only thing missing from the other DR2 game is the TIR mode (which allowed for competition in a Zombie arena against other players to earn cash); In exchange, an unlimited time open sandbox mode has been added where you can complete several objectives all over the map or just have fun exploring, collecting, leveling up, completing achievements, etc. I wouldn't pay much attention to the ratings, this version is the best of the two and IMO definitely worth getting.","July 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morishintaru/recommended/45770/","morishintaru","Morishintaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morishintaru/","152 products in account","Should I buy Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising 2: Off The Record?This was the question I asked myself and researched about before purchasing this title.  In short, Off The Record is essentially the original Dead Rising 2 with more content, so if you've yet to play the original Dead Rising 2, or simply wish to enjoy the somewhat altered storyline and additional features, choose this title over the original.\n\nPros:+Zombies. Lots and lots of zombies\n+Loads of weapons and weapon combinations\n+Leveling system that keeps you going and allows for multiple playthroughs\n+A decent sized mall / casino to explore and, you guessed it, kill lots and lots of zombies in\n+Sandbox Mode*\n+A surprisingly good storyline\n\n*Sandbox Mode is a unique feature to the Dead Rising series.  The Storyline timer is removed, allowing for unlimited exploration of Fortune City.  Challenge icons are scattered around Fortune City, rewarding you with either a bronze, silver or gold medal, depending on how well you completed said challenge.  Examples are "Kill as many zombies as you can in 3 minutes!" - "Get from point A to point B as fast as you can!", or, "Drink as much alcohol as you can in 5 minutes!".\n\nSandbox Mode also allows you to carry over your stats to and from Storyline Mode, so if you're having trouble defeating a boss you can simply hop over to Sandbox Mode, level up, and jump back with everything you've gained from Sandbox Mode still intact (other than weapons and items).\n\nMiddle Ground:~Controls: Honestly, I'm not too sure how the keyboard and mouse hold up in this title as I've only played with an official Microsoft Xbox 360 controller (wired).  So as far as I can say, the controls via a controller are pretty decent.  Some unique moves are a little tricky to pull off properly at first, requiring awkward combinations of buttons to be pressed.  But the longer you play around with them the easier they become to execute, so the game does have somewhat of a learning curve as far as that goes.\n\n~Vehicles: The driving in this game was something I could never get used to; cars specifically.  They seem to go 0 to 60 in a split second, which doesn't work very well in an enclosed area.  Also, as far as I could tell, there isn't a handbrake, which makes trying to hit any sharp turns result in just crashing into the wall in front of you.  But seeing that driving isn't a requirement to complete the game, it's not such a big deal (and it is a lot of fun mowing over hordes of zombies in a sports car!).\n\nCons:-Optimization: One of the biggest complaints I see about this game is it's poor optimization from being ported over from consoles, so the one thing I can recommend that you have in order to play this game somewhat smoothly is a decent CPU.  My GPU is garbage, but because I have a pretty decent CPU, I've had almost no problems from start to finish (other than slight frame sutters in areas with tons of zombies).\n\nIf you decide to purchase this title, or you happen to already own it, go over to the guides section and check out my guide on how to remove the DOF effect which might result in better performance.\n\nAdditional Thoughts:There is no doubt that the major complaint in this series is the storyline's timer.  Some people either feel too rushed or make the assumption that the game is meant to be 100% completed in one playthrough - the timer is intended to make you feel rushed; it adds urgency that the Sandbox Mode actually takes away.  It keeps you on your toes and forces you to make quick decisions (i.e., should I save that survivor or that one?  Should I go fight that boss or that one?).  This way, each time you play through the game's storyline it will be altered depending on your choices (the game also has multiple endings).\n\nConclusion:I might be a little bias on this title as I absolutely love George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (the Dead Rising series is heavily based off this movie); not only is it my absolute favorite zombie flick, it's also somewhere on my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  So, the concept of running around a zombie infested mall with dozens of weapons at one's disposal has always intrigued me, even before the original Dead Rising title was released.  If you're a fan of that movie, there is no reason for you not to pick up this game.","April 7","true","42.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","1"

If you like the idea of a slightly overweight middle aged reporter wearing a summer dress and a mask reminiscent of a LEGO piece; you can do that!\n\nThe joys of the game come from how stupid the game is. Unlike almost every other zombie game which seeks to take itself seriously, Dead Rising recognises the humour that you can bring to a dark scenario. They don't bother with morbidity in this variation of the story and instead kick it to the curb in favour of juvenile humour. This game might try to tell you it has a "mature" age rating; but in actuality that would be like saying that alcohol can only be enjoyed by "mature" people. Once you're old enough to buy it, you aren't necessarily wise. The sense of humour is crude and trashy, which is part of the charm.\n\nThat being said, it isn't much of a game for kids either. There is a copious amount of blood, mutilation and things which some people would say are unsafe for children. But it isn't for "adults" either. This is one of those games which isn't overtly mature but isn't something you'd give to a five year old. It's stupid and immature; which is the charm of the series. Dead Rising 1 tried to be serious and was "okay." Dead Rising 2 tried to make you care about characters which honestly didn't work for anyone. Off The Record fixes that problem in the same way that Saints Row 2 did. It stops trying to make things serious and meaningful and just says "why don't we make it fun instead?"\n\nSandbox gives you the ability to just run around indefinitely and without consequence. You don't get forced to give a damn about giving Katie zombrex, you don't have to worry about survivors getting killed. Well, you kind of do but in a whole new way. You get to kill every survivor and you get paid for it. No more "oh damn I lost that survivor so now I have to load the last save." It becomes "sweet, I melted that survivors face off with my god damned laser eyes!"\n\nAnd in my opinion, that's all the series has needed. It NEEDED that stupidity and to stop caring about being meaningful and serious. If I had to recommend this game for one thing, it'd be for getting rid of any seriousness to it. It became stupid and that took away the thing I found most boring in it. So my advice is that if you're sick of Dead Rising being serious, this is the game you buy. If you want a meaningful and sensible zombie game, then look again. There are plenty of games that try to do that.","May 24, 2015","true","13.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Off the Record really has the most going for it. Dead Rising 2 fixed many issues that Dead Rising 1 had, and OtR polishes DR2 even further. It features all of DR2's famous weapons, plus the photography mechanic from DR1. Many dismiss photography as unnecessary to DR's gameplay, and I disagree. It's a comedic and gory game, and being able to take photos of the mayhem you cause and be rewarded for that turns that into a game mechanic. I can't count the times I wished I could have taken a photo of something unapologetically silly in vanilla DR2 and in DR3.\n\nCo-op mode is a lot of fun. Use the Invite button on the friends list from the in-game menu to ensure you get the partner you want, as the Play Online option on the main menu seems to be only for joining random people's games. The host player will be Frank West as in the single-player mode, while the client is Chuck Greene from vanilla DR2. Chuck's unarmed special moves are functionally similar to, but different from, Frank's, but that the only real difference to learn. He has a camera like Frank too, of course, so both players can take photos of each other doing outrageous things. There is no voice chat, however, so be ready to use Skype or something if you don't want to have to communicate by jumping and running around in circles.\n\nIf you haven't played a Dead Rising before, are interested, but are unsure where to begin, I strongly recommend this one over any of the others, including DR3. Should you buy it if you already have DR2? I did, but only because I was buying the PC versions of the games I liked most on 360. For that I am glad it exists, but I wouldn't say there's a point to owning both if you wouldn't already have a reason to own two copies of the same game. It's a lot like when Pokémon comes out with the "third version" like Crystal that is both superior to, and essentially the same as, Gold and Silver.\n\nOne last thing, though: getting it to support controllers is a pain. It has to be a specific version of x360ce. 2.0.2.158 is the one that's working for me and my wired 360 controller, but it doesn't work with my friend's Xbone controller even though it recognizes it.","September 27, 2015","true","57.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has all the things that made Dead Rising great put into this Off the Record. Along with tweaks to animations, combat, and AI from the first. However, I do think this one lacks the charm and feel that the first one had.\n\nThe atmosphere just isn't on par. The boss fights lack the unique characterization from DR1, the music seems to not have the same flair either; some tracks just come off generic sometimes. The combat retained the same kind of problems that one had, and getting stuck in a stun animation from a boss never felt more annoying; and the damage limiter that they implemented to how much bosses can get hurt from constant player attack is not a great thing either. Only about three bosses made me feel invested and not frustrated; and this was at higher player levels too.\n\nI can't help the feeling that anything interesting about this game is just a carry over from the first; but there are some meaningful additions that feel like natural and fit into the whole game. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great game and I had a lot of fun. It's still Dead Rising at heart, and still a unique and fun experience; there is just something missing, but that's just me. If you never got the chance to play Dead Rising on Xbox 360 and really wanna try it, but can't for whatever reason, then I suggest you pick this one up for sure. Sadly this one isn't canon to the story, but rather a "what if" unlike the original Dead Rising 2.

Just accept that you'll never save everyone or do everything in one playthrough and you'll be fine. Some people don't like the time limits, but it adds urgency to the game. If you lose the story due to a timer, you probably deserved it so don't worry about that. They're much more lenient than DR1.\n\nSandbox mode is nice. You can do challenges and earn money and experience that transfers over to your story mode game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himurabr/recommended/45770/","himurabr","-HimuraBR-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himurabr/","424 products in account","Esse jogo pra mim deveria ter sido vendido como uma DLC do Dead Rising 2, porém pouquíssimas mudanças foram feitas nele. Porém, como a empresa que detém os direitos do game é a nossa queridíssima Capcom, é perfeitamente compreensível o por que de Dead Rising 2 Off the Record ter sido vendido como um outro game. Nele, foram acrescentados um modo Sandbox, onde é possível passear sem limite de tempo no shopping grandioso de Dead Rising 2 sem se preocupar em fazer missões. E a mudança principal no game foi na chegada do protagonista do primeiro Dead Rising, o Frank West. Em Off the Record, Frank irá viver tudo o que o Chuck Greene (Protagonista de Dead Rising 2 original) viveu. Ou seja, você terá que fazer absolutamente TUDO denovo, não há quase nada de novo, a não ser um enorme parque que também foi acrescentado chamado de Uranus Zone com um tema de alienígenas e coisas espaciais. Todos os bosses presentes no Dead Rising 2 retornam exatamente no mesmo local onde você os encontra, só que dessa vez você estará no controle do Frank. A Capcom simplesmente mostrou sua enorme preguiça em criar uma sequência para o game, e resolveu pegar um já pronto e acrescentar algumas coisinhas e no final chamar de 'game novo'. Muitos odiaram essa atitude da Capcom, e o jogo acabou ganhando uma fama 'negativa'. Gráficos, jogabilidade e trilhas sonoras também permaneceram nesse Off the Record sem melhoras, exatamente o mesmo. Se você não teve a oportunidade de jogar Dead Rising 2, sugiro que comece jogando o Off the Record, pois vocês não estariam perdendo exatamente NADA. O grande motivo que me fez ter comprado o Off the Record foi o Sandbox Mode que não estava presente no Dead Rising 2 Original, por que é realmente um saco jogar tendo que fazer as missões sem poder aproveitar direito o enorme shopping cheio de coisas para ver.\n\n------------------------------\n~ NOTA: 8,5\n------------------------------","October 15, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings back an option to take photos to gain XP, and many of Frank's wrestling moves from Dead Rising 1 return in OTR. The one area that takes a hit is the seriousness of the plot, but if you're playing Dead Rising for a gritty realistic plot, you're probably doing it wrong. Some of the jokes in this game only work if you're familiar with the plot of DR2, but I wouldn't really advise playing both DR2 and DR2 OTR.\nOTR also has some different boss battles, new combo weapons, new costumes, and a few small new areas.\n\nIf you want to play a DR2, buy this one, not DR2. Of course, while this is an improved DR2, DR3 is leaps and bounds ahead of it in terms of gameplay, storytelling, and overall fun.\n\nAs a sidenote: This got ported from GFWL, for which I applaud Capcom. That made it playable. That said, I don't think the keyboard and mouse configuration is at all playable with the quicktime events in this game, and it failed to recognize my MS Xbox 360 wireless controller (which worked fine with DR3), so... maybe wait until they patch that.","February 22, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Also some keys are bound in the code to specific keys, so even though you may have changed the config file, they still may not work as expected.\n\nThe photo mechanic that was in the original Dead Rising is back, however it seems kind of tacked on as the PP amounts have been nerfed hard vs the original game.\n\nFortunately the volume issue present in the normal Dead Rising 2 has been fixed.\n\nIt has a coop mode that still has the odd person around to play with, although everyone I managed to play with was kind of laggy.\n\nI'm sad that Capcom won't rerelease it without GFWL, but considering how lazy of a port it was, I totally understand their position.\n\nPlay it while you still can!","February 20, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

So, i'm just going to assume that both versions are identical.\n\n-PLOT-\nYou are Frank West, hero and survivor of the infamous Willamette zombie outbrreak.  Having written a book about it, and  getting YOUR OWN FUC**** TV SHOW, just about you, you are very famous. But one day, that fame is lost, your show has had the plug pulled. You are watching TV, when you see a show called ''Terror Is Reality'' in which contestants earn money for killing thousands of zombies. You think to yourself ''This is my chance to get back in the game!''.\nSo, for the very beginning of the game, you are pitted against zombies in a wrestling ring and have to kill as many as you can. Once you have won and collected ''THA BIG MONAYYY'', you decide to grab some Zombrex (a drug that stops you from becoming a zombie, spoilers) and head home. However, when you take the elevator, there is a nasty tumble and you pass out. When you awake from your sleep , there are alarms and sirens going off ,screams, and groans. You attempt to wedge open the lift door with all your strength. You can see... *sarcastic gasp* Zombies! To which Frank replies, ''Oh no.'' Just as a certain zombie comes towards you, a running man fortunately runs in front of the zombie, and dies, saving your life. You run out of the arena, into a shelter, along with other survivors. A woman, Stacey, tells you that there is some Zombrex in a nearby plaza. After teaching some looters a lesson, you find a pharmacist (which you take back to the shelter) and some Zombrex. At about 8pm, you go back to the shelter and watch a news report about the incident. Feeling inspired, you must uncover the truth about the outbreak (while brutally murdering thousands upon thousands of zombies), escort innocent survivors, find Zombrex (or buy it for 25 grand) and (hopefully) get back in the game!\n\n-PRESENTATION-\nThe game looks relatively good. Survivors look like survivors, and Frank looks like, well, Frank West at the age of fourty-one. Where the graphics are mixed, though are the zombies. They look okay at first, but when you play the game more and more, it seems like you've killed a zombie's 119th COMPLETELY IDENTICAL twin. But where the zombies shine, though, are the amount there are. I mean, JESUS, if you have a powerful pc, you can have a thousand zombies on screen before it even drops 1 frame. Even the console ports look good, but i'm saying ''good'' becuz #pcmasterrace :B1: .\n\n-GAMEPLAY-\nThere are two modes: Story Mode, the mode where ♥♥♥♥ actually happens, and Sandbox Mode, which has no plot (kinda), complete freedom,and NO ♥♥♥♥ING DRAINING HEALTH BAR FROM INFINITY MODE MY GOD THAT WAS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T IN THE FIRST GAM- *cough* and no draining health bar.\nNew to the mix, are combo weapons. Rather simple, but COMPLETELY NECCESSARY. Examples: Baseball bat+ box o' nails = Spikey bat, Torch + Gems= HOLY ♥♥♥♥ A LIGHTSABER.\nSimple. Other than that, it's the same run of the mill as the first game: escort idiotic (but slightly better in this game) survivors to a safehouse, get PP, woohoo, do a case mission, get progression in the capcom-tier story, woohoo.\nLike the first game, there are Psychopaths, which are the game's bosses. Some are easy, some are hard, some are required, some are optional, some are disgusting, some you want a statue of, lar lar lar, lar.\nThere's one thing that bugs me though. The same as the first game. THE DIFFICULTY. While it's the complete opposite of  the first game, it's still a problem. Dead Rising 1: OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS THE 2006 VERSION OF SUPER MEAT BOY ON STEROIDS. Dead Rising 2: Off the Record: *grooooooooooooooooooooooooooooan* tooooooooooo easyyyyyyyy. psychopaths are ok though.\n\n-CONCLUSION-\nLook past the incredibly easy difficulty, and you have a great game. Don't like plots and time limits like me? There's Sandbox Mode, the godsend from Capcom's usually faulty brain. Want something to do?  There's challenges and the normal story mode. I'll also note that I wouldn't buy this if you have the original DR2.\n\nOn a scale of one to ten, this gets a well deserved eight out of ten.  Get it if you have a great PC, it'll be worth the money. Don't have a powerful pc? Get the console port for PS3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review, and it  made you make up your mind about purchasing the game or not.\n-pixar900","April 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjatony5/recommended/45770/","ninjatony5","basketballforlife2005","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjatony5/","198 products in account","So, I have been a fan of the series for quite some time. When I was younger, I had a PS3 and really wanted to get an Xbox 360 just to play Dead Rising 1. Dead Rising 1 was absolutely amazing and I loved everything about it. I also pre-ordered Dead Rising 2 for the PS3 when it came out. Dead Rising 2 was good and added a larger mall, combo weapons, and many more secrets and hidden items. And it all comes down to this game, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record. This has improved a bit from Dead Rising 2 by including even more combo weapons, a new vehicle, and my favorite feature, the protagonist as Frank West. Frank actually put on a few pounds after the 5-6 years between the Willamette outbreak and the second Fortune City outbreak. But, this game is a great game to get even for its old release date. If you want to get a good idea about the story, you should maybe start out with Dead Rising 1 or 2. But buy this game if you want to have a lot of fun killing zombies and playing co-op. What is also a great reason to purchase this game is that yesterday it got Steamworks!!!! So you can just join your friends through Steam instead of GFWL (Games for Windows Live). Overall, this is amazing game to get started on the series with, and I will give it a 9/10 because of how much it improved switching to Steamworks. Buy this game whenever it goes on sale and you will have A LOT of fun.","March 18, 2015","true","59.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetvan/recommended/45770/","sweetvan","Candy Van","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetvan/","511 products in account","Dead Rising 2: OTR (SP Only) *** Combining DR2 and DR2:OTR ***\n\nStory (5/10):\nDR2: OTR's story is largely the same as the other two DR installments. A somewhat bland story, sometimes perked by Capcom's characteristically silly character interactions. Overall, not a strong point of the game.\n\nGameplay (7/10):\nDR2: OTR delivers the same Dead Rising experience that fans of the series have come to know, and sometimes love. Hordes of zombies flood the screen, and as usual, your job is to smite them using a variety of crazy weapons, ranging from laser shooting masks to chainsaw-tipped kayak paddles. DR2 and DR2:OTR really picked up from DR in the sense that they added a LOT of new weapons, which helps the game keep fresh throughout its duration. It personally never got old to smash through piles of enemies using an ever-expanding arsenal of ridiculous armaments. The added infinite mode is worth looking into, since you are unbound by the time constraints of the normal game, and given challenges to complete for money and xp, which carries over into the main game. This can be helpful if you are stuck in the main storyline.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the fun ends. As with previous DR installments, boss fights are tedious and cheap, escorts are constant and frustrating, and many parts of the game feel drawn out and devoid of content or direction. If you are not satisfied with killing zombies, you will find little else of value in this game.\n\nMechanics (6/10):\nDR2/DR2:OTR's new mechanic is the weapon combination mechanic, which allows you to combine weapons into new devastating combinations. This system is unfortunately limited by your need to find/unlock blueprints to use combo weapons to their full potentional, as well as the need to find specific "maintenance rooms" where the combos can be made. A more on-the-fly system may have been easier. Otherwise, mechanics remain somewhat unchanged from DR1, and are as usual, buggy and unforgiving.\n\nVisuals (7/10): DR2:OTR looks decent, probably mediocre, by today's standards. Edges are clean, textures are not obviously stretched out or degraded, and lighting effects are present to some degree. The technical prowess of the game comes from its ability to maintain hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same time, which still remains impressive, and a trademark of the series.\n\nSound (7/10):\nThe only comment I have about the sound is the game's tendency to have the constant moan of zombies drown out all other noise. It gets tiresome. Otherwise, the game does not have any noticeable sound achievements or problems.\n\nReplayability (9/10):\nDR2:OTR are both strong contenders in the "Replayability" category. There are a lot of weapons to unlock, skills to upgrade, and powerful costumes to unlock (especially the famous Zero armor, from Megaman). After beating the main game, I went through a second time, in order to beat down my opponents using a souped-up Frank West, complete with overpowered weapon combinations. Very satisfying.\n\nOVERALL:\nDR2:OTR is a fun, satisfying game, held back by poorly implemented mechanics, a buggy nature (see: Capcom games), and perhaps a lack of foresight.\n\nDo you like zombies? Do you like killing them? Tons of them? PILES of them? Yes? Then you'll love this game.\n\n7/10\n\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then I played the third one... and that was one of the most hardcore gaming experiences ever... so I came and bought this one since 3 will sadly be xbox exclusive (I cant blame em either)\n\nNow, this one is not in anyway as good as the third one... but it's still a pretty good game...\nIt's really how you let yourself experience the game. There is some system that determines what kinda weapons you unlock, maybe how you play, idk... the multiplayer is touchy (maybe because of the off the record part of it less people own it) I have yet to be able to join a game, but if I'm playing for an hour or so someone usually joins my game... which is such a sweet suprise when your playing and suddenly someone else is there. It's kinda neat that way... This one's story is a little wonky but its basically a DLC add content... but its still pretty good. The story is good, just sometimes during a cutscene or something some survivor made you strip all your clothes off to save them and of course youre at the serious moment of a cutscene when that happens... soo... that always happens...\n\nI'll let you know what the best experience is in this game. You find some awesome mask, some kool shirt... you look like some zombie apocolypse ninja dude... you got a weapon made out of two fireaxes and a sledgehammer... a bunch of other insane things... youre standing on top of a flipped over truck surrounded by hundreds of zombies... you got an online buddy dropping in wearing a tux... and you guys go to town. You fight and fight and fight... you end up having to scournge for food on your last leg... get back out and fight and fight... ah man...\n\nThe goofyness is what deterred me before but it needs to be there simply because of the insanity and violence of the game... for the entire series... the overall story is actually really good. Probably better than resident evil has been in a long time.\n\nIf you get a chance tho... play the third one... that game is amazing.","May 8, 2014","true","21.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What? how exactly does that make a lick of sense, I don't know. Second, once I actually got it to finally run on my laptop, it seemed to be okay and a pretty decent game, and then while I was in the menu, and wanted to exit out by using the Games set key (which was ESC btw) it would decide to tab out of the ENTIRE game; and if I Just so happened to be playing it Co-operatively (which I was) I would have my connection to the game be lost and I would have to get re-invited to that game and then have to find the spot in a Zombie, looter, Mercenary, and Psychotic filled Mall/Casino, and then have to pick everything back up.\n\nAnother issue I had, was when Myself and my Co-op Partner *SPOILER ALERT* fighting Chuck Greene on his motorcycle and then lost, when the previous checkpoint loaded, somehow we were seperated  into two games while still somehow in a co-op game, in my instance, the host's character model AND Chuck's(The Boss, not the second player's model) stood completely still, in which I was able to just run over and beat the snot out of the Boss Chuck, which granted me the achievement, but Chuck just sat there in the bike and his "death cutscene" didn't play. and when I had to leave the game to try that whole section again. I lost 5 whole levels of EXP.\n\nAnother major issue I had to deal with in-game was for whatever reason, if you looked up at the ceiling, or down at the floor, your character would actually run slightly faster with a perfect frame rate, I don't know why looking at the zombies slowed the game down (might have to do with the amount maybe?) but it was quite bothersome when you're on a short time limit to get your missions done.\n\n\nAnd that's not all, Steam itself doesn't even recognize that I own the game outside of my personal Library, look up my games through my profile, and this game doesn't show up, nor am I allowed to check my progress of Achievements, nor see the ones I've earned so far. I can still unlock them, but outside of that, I can't do anything. What I've listed is by far NOT ALL of the problems I've had, but were the biggest issues that I hate to frustratedly deal with while playing the game.\n\nhowever, despite the heavy glitches and huge bugs that infuriated my beyond end, I will say that the gameplay and story were alot of fun. graphics were okay, but I had to turn them lower for my laptop. if I were to recommend this game just on gameplay and story, then yes, go buy it. but honestly, buy the console version, it doesn't have terrible port issues and  until Capcom fixes the issues, I say don't get it here.","May 16, 2015","false","51.9"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

Game is a mess and the DLC won't always work!\n\nSo first off, let me say that I absolutely loved and enjoyed my time with Dead Rising 2. Dead Rising 2 is a stable, well-running, non-crashing game that I have played for over 100 hours and counting with ZERO issues. It can easily run at 1080p/60fps and is a great port. Go ahead and buy it right now. It is worth it and so is the DLC. Get it on a sale, have fun with it!\n\nWhatever you do, stay as far away from this game as possible. Off the Record has given me nothing but headaches and in addition it has practically stolen my money. Let me just go ahead and list the issues I have encountered in my time with this game, and I repeat, none of these things occur in Dead Rising 2:\n\nGame runs at least 20 frames below DR2 in open areas.\nRandom crashes during the game. Just random. It's a mess.\nNew weapons can cause glitches and crashes (Alien Helmet + Gems Combo -> Hold X attack can crash the game)\nPC Settings -> Blur Effects option is glitched and no longer turns off what it should.\nAlt Tabbing can crash the game\nDLC may appear as CORRUPTED and cannot be accessed. IF YOU BUY THE DLC YOUR MONEY MAY BE GONE AND YOU MIGHT GET NOTHING\nNew glitches in picking up items, especially near a crafting table. Its annoying.\nSwords, katanas and other blade weapons have glitches now. The jump + x attack can randomly not work anymore and always miss by 45 degrees.\nEssential items are locked out of Sandbox mode\nThe save sound effect is way louder than any other sounds and makes me jump every time\nSaving takes forever now, since the game needs 10 seconds to 'Check for saves'.\nGlitches weapons can randomly appear in the game, like a non-functioning AK-47 that was never finished.\n\nI could go on but you get the point. It's not worth it, the developers are NEVER going to fix all of these issues so stick to Dead Rising 2, enjoy it for the great game that it is and skip Off The Record. They took a fantastic, stable, well-running game and turned it into a pile of garbage with nothing but issues after issues.\n\nI hope I saved you some money. Instead, spend that money on the original, well-made Dead RIsing 2.","May 24","false","20.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

I therefore lost all my character progression, which was very annoying.\n\nI also didn't like the timer we've got on all our missions. I really like to walk around exploring the stores and ambient, but this caused us til eventually save the game, and not having time to finish the mission. We basically ended in an evil loop.\n\nThe mechanics feels like, as way too many games today are, that it's portet from console.\n\nI didn't finish the game and don't feel like the story was good enough to make me want to try the game again.","September 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

It's something like a B Sci Fi made for TV movie. It's intention is to be wacky and gruesome at the same time. This is not a bad thing. It's just campy. At some moments it's funny at others it can be trying to hard. It all depends on how campy you enjoy things to be.\n\nThe real issue I take with the game is that it's become formulaic and dumbed down since Dead Rising 1. The challenge of the series is gone and it's become more about flash and spectacle. It feels empty like the franchise has lost it's heart and is now meant to be one more franchise that can be churned out every couple years.\n\nThe gameplay is simple just pick up an item in the mall and start hitting things. Find survivors on the way and fight bosses who are caricatures of one form or another with a disgusting or psychotic twist to their personality. Very rarely will you be in a situation where you can't handle yourself. As soon as you get out of the prologue area you get powerful enough weapons that you shouldn't have much issue with bosses or large hordes of enemies.\n","June 3, 2015","false","40.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I would end up getting over 30 million PP. Unfortunately, the PC versions of DR2 and OTR use Games For Window Live, but I won't take points off for that. The Arkham games had used them for so long and just recently have been released with clean versions.\n\nDead Rising 2 improves on all fronts where Dead Rising 1 left off. It introduces combo weapons, which are a more efficient way to get PP to level up than saving survivors alone. The AI of the survivors is no longer frustrating, they can defend themselves better than ever and follow directions. Granted they're not quite AS smart in Off The Record on PC compared to DR2 vanilla on PC, but OTR has check points. There are a few psychopath bosses, they adjusted the survivor roster, there's more combo cards and a whole new section of the map called Uranus Zone. That whole part of the map was under construction in DR2 vanilla.... so lead it to Capcom to make you buy the game twice to play the full game just like Street Fighter IV. There's a lot to hate about Capcom since Resident Evil 5 came out, but I love DR2 and Off The Record in the definitive version here on PC. I love the time management, the frantic decisions and scheduling you have to do to rescue as many people as possible. The PP (Prestige Point) gives it arcade fun and I find myself still playing DR2 after reaching the max level of 50. I can't get bored of this game. If I start playing I gotta keep going until I reach a point where after I save it'll be a book marked time in the story of a playthrough.\n\nDead Rising gets my vote for the most improved series since 2005. DR1 was a frustrating game, a 360 exclusive with an antiquated save system. DR2 improved everything and added so much more, then Off The Record raised it as if the Chuck Greene game was incomplete. I really wish DR3 wasn't an XB1 exclusive. I'm done with consoles, love live Steam! You should've have to buy extra hardware for segregated limited platforms. Resident Evil series get's worst fall from grace since Resident Evil 4 topped off the series in 2005.\n\nThrough whatever flaws Dead Rising 2 Off The Record has, I give it a 5/5. It's not for everyone, especially if you have ADD and blame the game for your short comings in attention. You gotta play the game like a speed run as much as you can and take every advantage with you including combo weapons, skill books and mixed drinks. Don't play it dumb and you'll be alright.\nAfter playing the hell out of DR2 on 360, I completed OTR on PC within 3 days without having to restart the story. I went from level 1-42 in my first playthrough.\n\n5/5","December 19, 2013","true","105.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zzombie13/recommended/45770/","zzombie13","zzombie13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zzombie13/","233 products in account","Disclaimer: This is a review I wrote when the game was new, copied from another site. It was based off my time with the Xbox 360 version and I've only put in a short time on the PC version. So issues with GFWL or it's removal are NOT taken into account. From 2011.\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\nOK let me preface this by saying that I am a Dead Rising fanboy. A major one. I am well aware of all the games flaws and issues and I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the first Dead Rising like no game before it. As a huge fan of Romero films and zombie fiction of all kinds, Dead Rising was the first game I felt truly captured the feeling of an oppressive "Zombie Event". And of course the parallels to Dawn of the Dead didn't hurt it either. The original Dawn is a timeless classic that has been a high water mark for decades and it's remake holds the unique position of being just as good as the film that it's based on.\n\nFast Forward from 2006 to 2010 and Dead Rising 2. I was initially shocked that Frank was not planned for the sequel of Dead Rising. But with time and some gameplay I warmed up to Chuck Green. The Combo Weapon system was great and the irreverant humor from the original was well intact. For my money, it was another success. But I never did stop missing Frank despite putting upwards of 30 hours into DR2 and even more into Case Zero and Case West.\n\nNow on to the reason for this write up, Off the Record (hereafter; 'OtR'). OtR is a curious title, even for me. Being the big fan of zombie games, of Dead Rising 1, and of Frank West, I was on board with this one from the word GO. The problem though, is who other than me would even consider this game a valid purchase? And releasing in one of the most cluttered fall release schedules since 2007? This game just doesn't seem to have an audience outside of the insane DR fans like myself, and even for us it's starting to feel like Capcom is pulling another Street FIghter 2 here with constant reiterations instead of moving on. And all in the span of 13 months.\n\nThe game itself is pretty great. The same formula that made the other Dead Rising products enjoyable is still here with some nice new additions. Serious fans will enjoy the subtle changes to make the protagonist swap fit and there have been adjustments to the looters and the zombies seem more aggressive than in the other DR games. New combo weapons and the return of the camera mechanic round out a pretty impressive list of "Pros" for this game.\n\nThe issue at hand though, is the list of "Cons". No matter how fun it may be, if you played DR2 proper, this is just not enough of an upgrade for the casual fan to embrace. The hardcore DR nut will love OtR but I wonder just how many of us there are and if we number high enough to make this game profitable?\n\nI've been a big supporter of this series. And I've always done my best to try and steer people to playing it. Forum posts asking "What 360 games should I play?" always see me trumpetting Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2's greatness. This game though, I just don't think I can be it's emmisary. I cannot "sell" this game to people. If you're on board, you were already on board and if you're on the fence, I'm not going to be trying to push you over. It is a good game. And on paper it's probably the best Dead Rising to date. But even with all the good stuff it has to offer (not the least of which is finally adding the checkpoint system fans have been wanting since 2006!), I just can't push a game like this. While it's a 5 star for me personally, I can't even imagine that anyone else would share that view of this one.\n\nTo Bottom Line it, it's a great fun romp though a zombie outbreak with a charasmatic protagonist. It's just that the romp is basically the same one you took last year with DR2 proper. OtR can only truly be recommended to either those who never played DR2, or who are major Frank West fans who are willing to overlook the fact that they already played this game a year ago. It's definately a curious animal, but I doubt most people will feel the need to have it on their mantle.","November 29, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the world you play in is plauged by zombies, the real threat is the people, and battling these psychos prove to be very difficult when you are not prepared to take them on.\n\nCompared to Dead Rising 2, the main difference is the story; instead of playing as Chuck Greene, who needs to find zombrex for his daughter and trying to clear his name from being framed during the outbreak, you play as Frank West who tries to uncover the incident behind the outbreak.  Gameplay wise, the two games are mostly the same, but OTR pulls it off somewhat better, as it has a sandbox mode that replaces DR2's TIR (Terror is Reality) Contests, fine-tuned game mechanics and a photography mode that originates from the first Dead Rising game.  If you've already played Dead Rising 2 you won't find yourself playing a completely new game.  If you haven't though, then this version is the better version.  Both versions support co-op, but the two games cannot intercommunicate with eachother, so if you're planning to play with a friend, make sure he owns the same version as you do or plan to get.  The only reasons you would own both DR2 and OTR is that you are interested in the changed game mechanics and story, manage to pick up DR2 complete for a great price, or simply because you know Frank West has covered wars, you know.","December 1, 2013","true","58.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review, but then, this is one of the games I know intimately well. I may only have about 16 hours on record here, but I've logged far more on the 360 version.\n\nThe Dead Rising series seems a bit schlocky, and that's not surprising. It's meant to be a tongue-in-cheek take on zombie outbreaks. It remains serious enough to have a cohesive plot, but not so serious that a lot of the bosses and scenarios you encounter seem far-fetched or histrionic.\n\nThe fun very much comes from having a whole playground of casinos, mall shops, and an added amusement park to formulate weapons and combat them. In addition to that, you'll encounter a lot of survivors who need to be brought back to the safehouse.\n\nThen there's the sandbox mode. It takes out the merciless clock and timer that often impeded your missions in Dead Rising 2 and the original Dead Rising. That really allows for it to be your playground.\n\nThere's a bit of humor, a bit of sexy, a 'reality' TV show that glorifies zombie-killing in a WWE-type format. And what's more: Frank West returns in the Off the Record rendition.\n\nSome of its reviews both here and elsewhere tend to be a bit negatory because DR2:OTR took so very much from DR2... so much that, heck, a lot of it's exactly the same. But what OTR really does is fine-tune, improve, and give a little more freedom. It makes it a lot more fun. It's what kept me coming back. I've probably played through the story twenty to thirty times now... and I expect to keep going. The ride's that fun.\n\nGrab a weapon. Get creative. Explore. You'll find plenty of crazies along the way.","May 7, 2015","true","39.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zzombie13/recommended/45770/","zzombie13","zzombie13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zzombie13/","233 products in account","Disclaimer: This is a review I wrote when the game was new, copied from another site. It was based off my time with the Xbox 360 version and I've only put in a short time on the PC version. So issues with GFWL or it's removal are NOT taken into account. From 2011.\n*****************************************************************************************************************\n\nOK let me preface this by saying that I am a Dead Rising fanboy. A major one. I am well aware of all the games flaws and issues and I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the first Dead Rising like no game before it. As a huge fan of Romero films and zombie fiction of all kinds, Dead Rising was the first game I felt truly captured the feeling of an oppressive "Zombie Event". And of course the parallels to Dawn of the Dead didn't hurt it either. The original Dawn is a timeless classic that has been a high water mark for decades and it's remake holds the unique position of being just as good as the film that it's based on.\n\nFast Forward from 2006 to 2010 and Dead Rising 2. I was initially shocked that Frank was not planned for the sequel of Dead Rising. But with time and some gameplay I warmed up to Chuck Green. The Combo Weapon system was great and the irreverant humor from the original was well intact. For my money, it was another success. But I never did stop missing Frank despite putting upwards of 30 hours into DR2 and even more into Case Zero and Case West.\n\nNow on to the reason for this write up, Off the Record (hereafter; 'OtR'). OtR is a curious title, even for me. Being the big fan of zombie games, of Dead Rising 1, and of Frank West, I was on board with this one from the word GO. The problem though, is who other than me would even consider this game a valid purchase? And releasing in one of the most cluttered fall release schedules since 2007? This game just doesn't seem to have an audience outside of the insane DR fans like myself, and even for us it's starting to feel like Capcom is pulling another Street FIghter 2 here with constant reiterations instead of moving on. And all in the span of 13 months.\n\nThe game itself is pretty great. The same formula that made the other Dead Rising products enjoyable is still here with some nice new additions. Serious fans will enjoy the subtle changes to make the protagonist swap fit and there have been adjustments to the looters and the zombies seem more aggressive than in the other DR games. New combo weapons and the return of the camera mechanic round out a pretty impressive list of "Pros" for this game.\n\nThe issue at hand though, is the list of "Cons". No matter how fun it may be, if you played DR2 proper, this is just not enough of an upgrade for the casual fan to embrace. The hardcore DR nut will love OtR but I wonder just how many of us there are and if we number high enough to make this game profitable?\n\nI've been a big supporter of this series. And I've always done my best to try and steer people to playing it. Forum posts asking "What 360 games should I play?" always see me trumpetting Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2's greatness. This game though, I just don't think I can be it's emmisary. I cannot "sell" this game to people. If you're on board, you were already on board and if you're on the fence, I'm not going to be trying to push you over. It is a good game. And on paper it's probably the best Dead Rising to date. But even with all the good stuff it has to offer (not the least of which is finally adding the checkpoint system fans have been wanting since 2006!), I just can't push a game like this. While it's a 5 star for me personally, I can't even imagine that anyone else would share that view of this one.\n\nTo Bottom Line it, it's a great fun romp though a zombie outbreak with a charasmatic protagonist. It's just that the romp is basically the same one you took last year with DR2 proper. OtR can only truly be recommended to either those who never played DR2, or who are major Frank West fans who are willing to overlook the fact that they already played this game a year ago. It's definately a curious animal, but I doubt most people will feel the need to have it on their mantle.","November 29, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a game on it's own, it is very fun and engaging as it allows you to unravel the story in the game or simply mess around with anything that surrounds you.  During your time in the game you encounter bosses known as psychopathes every now and then.  While the world you play in is plauged by zombies, the real threat is the people, and battling these psychos prove to be very difficult when you are not prepared to take them on.\n\nCompared to Dead Rising 2, the main difference is the story; instead of playing as Chuck Greene, who needs to find zombrex for his daughter and trying to clear his name from being framed during the outbreak, you play as Frank West who tries to uncover the incident behind the outbreak.  Gameplay wise, the two games are mostly the same, but OTR pulls it off somewhat better, as it has a sandbox mode that replaces DR2's TIR (Terror is Reality) Contests, fine-tuned game mechanics and a photography mode that originates from the first Dead Rising game.  If you've already played Dead Rising 2 you won't find yourself playing a completely new game.  If you haven't though, then this version is the better version.  Both versions support co-op, but the two games cannot intercommunicate with eachother, so if you're planning to play with a friend, make sure he owns the same version as you do or plan to get.  The only reasons you would own both DR2 and OTR is that you are interested in the changed game mechanics and story, manage to pick up DR2 complete for a great price, or simply because you know Frank West has covered wars, you know.","December 1, 2013","true","58.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the game started, it ran at about 15 FPS. My PC can run games like Devil May Cry 4 and Metal Gear Rising at 60 FPS. Do not buy this game.

As a game on it's own, it is very fun and engaging as it allows you to unravel the story in the game or simply mess around with anything that surrounds you.  During your time in the game you encounter bosses known as psychopathes every now and then.  While the world you play in is plauged by zombies, the real threat is the people, and battling these psychos prove to be very difficult when you are not prepared to take them on.\n\nCompared to Dead Rising 2, the main difference is the story; instead of playing as Chuck Greene, who needs to find zombrex for his daughter and trying to clear his name from being framed during the outbreak, you play as Frank West who tries to uncover the incident behind the outbreak.  Gameplay wise, the two games are mostly the same, but OTR pulls it off somewhat better, as it has a sandbox mode that replaces DR2's TIR (Terror is Reality) Contests, fine-tuned game mechanics and a photography mode that originates from the first Dead Rising game.  If you've already played Dead Rising 2 you won't find yourself playing a completely new game.  If you haven't though, then this version is the better version.  Both versions support co-op, but the two games cannot intercommunicate with eachother, so if you're planning to play with a friend, make sure he owns the same version as you do or plan to get.  The only reasons you would own both DR2 and OTR is that you are interested in the changed game mechanics and story, manage to pick up DR2 complete for a great price, or simply because you know Frank West has covered wars, you know.","December 1, 2013","true","58.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you want to drive around on a bike with chainsaws strapped to the handlebars? You can! Do you want to do bad cosplay as a "superhero" and suplex zombies? You can!\n\nThe missions are entertaining, the story is pretty far fetched for the most part and it does have multiple endings with lots of side missions, some of which require special steps to even activate. This gives the game a higher amount of replay value if you want to discover more of what the game has to offer. In addition to this it has boss battles in some missions, which are incredibly entertaining. (Look for some of them if you aren't convinced)\n\nOne of the major downsides of the game is that if you played Dead Rising 2, this game doesn't have much to offer besides an alternate take on the story. Unless you are a fan or a newcomer, this may not be worth investing in, as it doesn't do enough differently to make it a completely new experience compared to Dead Rising 2.\n\nOverall, I would reccommend the title because of how fun it is, and the co-op mode makes it an even greater experience with friends. The game also contains a sandbox mode similar to Dead Rising, and gives some challenges to make the game last longer. I loved spending time just doing silly things or completing missions, as it never really felt dull or repetitive compared to some other zombie games. It also has a fairly unique sense of humour compared to other zombie titles these days.\n\nSIDE NOTE: At the time of writing this review, the title is still using Games for Windows Live, this may be something to consider when purchasing due to the service being fairly close to shutting down. As far as I know there has been no word on Capcom removing/changing the system in place within Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.","November 27, 2013","true","55.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's also a couple of new weapons (including combo weapons), a couple of new bosses, and a handful of gameplay changes, the things I remember the most being:\n\n- Frank is infected and needs Zombrex every 24 hours, but he can inject himself no matter where he is, which removes the element of rushing back to the safehouse every day for Katey\n- Frank's picture-taking mechanic returns\n- If you're lightly damaged while holding a weapon you can't store in your inventory (say, a Gem Blower), you won't always drop it. You'll still drop it if you get knocked down, though.\n\nThe co-op is even better than before, because Player 2 still plays as Chuck Greene (still using his own move set and attack animations) and him and Frank have a fair amount of dialogue for shouting at one another. They're really rude to each other for no reason at all, which is really funny.\n"Hey, zombie boy! I've got your drug!" -Chuck\n\n(the actual reason being the dialogue was recorded for DR2: Case West - an X360-exclusive expansion (thanks capcom) - where the two of them start off on the wrong foot)\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the Sandbox mode! In this mode, you're free to just goof off with no time limits to worry about. You're free to carry over levels, PP and money you earn in Sandbox to the 72-hour mode and vice versa. Most of the bosses will spawn in their usual places at certain times, but the friendly survivors are now hostile and will spawn in set places and attack you. There's also challenges around the map, with objectives like earning large numbers of PP, luring zombies to a specific area, racing to a finish point, or just plain killing zombies, so that gives you something to do besides just mucking around and exploring, which is still always fun.\n\nIt's not as good of a port as the original DR2, which in itself was only an okay port, but it's still not too bad. The most notable thing is that you can't turn depth of field off without hex editing, but it runs a little better after you disable that.\n\n+ It's still DR2 - Still fun and funny, music's still good, the city still looks nice, co-op is still incredibly fun\n+ The new additions and subtractions are generally welcome, most notably Sandbox mode\n\n- It's still DR2 - Still kind of buggy and rickety and immature, having to earn speed upgrades by leveling up is still a huge pain\n- It really didn't need to be a seperate, full-priced game\n- DOF\n\n8/10\n\nThis game (and the base game) have some of the most hilarious co-op action I've ever experienced. The single player experience is great, too.","January 10, 2012","true","134.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dunno why but it has a note on it's page to not install using a German IP.\n\nWhat this game does right:\n\n- The Story may stay the same but since it's YOU that needs Zombrex you can take it while out so you don't have to backtrack all the way to the safehouse (thank god).\n- Frank has a camera so you can take pictures for extra PP and even take selfies with zombies.\n- The game has a wider variety of items to combine making it more open and funny.\n- You play as Frank West. He's covered wars y'know.\n- As you level up Frank loses weight.\n- Sandbox mode so you don't have to follow the story.\n\nWhat this game does wrong:\n\n- On lower Zombie Textures their models stretch and expand making it look like a horrible mesh of flesh.\n- The story is exactly the same. Not much difference except for the end.\n- You kill Chuck Greene.\n- The 4 special outfits are all just DLC from the original DR2\n- The best special outfit (The Sports Fan) is easier the get than the worst (Military)\n\nI do recommend this game due to its Dead Rising charm but if you want the ACTUAL story of DR2 and the extra story DLC you should stick with the default DR2.","June 29, 2015","true","144.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/45770/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Essentially the same game...\n\nOriginally posted by DR2 review:Dumb & simple zombie killing fun.\n\nLike the first game, weapons and health are generally all around you only this time around you can combine two specific items to make another weapon that's possibly cooler, sillier, practical, or a combination of a number of those. You can find out what item goes with what via Combo Cards which are unlocked through general progression of the game such as examining certain posters, leveling, defeating psychopaths, etc. You can combine items without the specific card however the item produced won't be as effective and rewarding. It's highly encouraging to produce the Combo Weapons because using them generally nets you PP for leveling and curiosity in how they'll work will become pretty high.\n\nYou're free to run around the world as you please (aside from some areas that can only unlocked from doing certain missions) though its criticized time limit makes a return so you only have so much time to get to doing the missions. If you stick to doing missions, not be as distracted, and perhaps if you're at a decent level it won't feel like it's rushing you to go do something so much. Even if you fail a task no matter how important and until the timer runs out or you choose to restart the story you're free to run around freely doing whatever. Restarting the specific save file's story allows you to keep your level, money, and Combo Cards for that next playthrough.\n\nThe plot & dialogue is full of cheese, especially with the psychopaths. I think it's for the better that that's the case.\n\nThere isn't much depth to the actual zombie killing aside from just having good weapons for the situation and the psychopath fights. The psychopaths can be extremely cheap in their own special way but at least for most of the fights you're free to leave and return to the area in case you don't feel ready for the boss fight.\n\nThe co-op's overall doable. A bit easier (if no lag is present) but adds enjoyment to the game. The money and level you've earned anywhere in a save file can be used in both single player and co-op where the only thing that doesn't carry over for either is the story if you're not hosting the game. The entire thing could have probably used an implemented in-game chat and give-item-to-partner feature as opposed to dropping or chucking the item for them to pick it up.\n\nFetch quests, escorts, and just messing around. Probably better with a controller since keys are unrebindable.\n...but now it's slightly not as optimized, there's a new area for you to explore, some new items & Combo Weapons, some new survivors, many familiar items and survivors have been relocated for better or worse, the story's a teensy bit altered, there's a "Sandbox Mode" for you to run amok in without fear of a timer where your progress in it carries over to the story mode and vice versa, and now you take control of a photojournalist who's covered wars.","July 8, 2015","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead you give it to yourself at any place on the map.\n\n-You're Frank West, he has more personality than Chuck Greene and he has a camera which you can use to help level up.\n\n-Bosses in OTR have damage peaks meaning that you can't just keep wailing away at a boss and have them die quickly. The damage you do now goes down by half every hit after the first one.\n\n-More combo weapons and a new area "Uranus Zone" also 2 new bosses which are pretty cool.\n\n-The story is different, especially around the end of the game.\n\n-Looking at your watch now pauses the game which it didn't do in DR2, and the map is on the same screen as your watch and you can now set waypoints, which makes things more convenient.\n\n-Money has more of a purpose now, not going to spoil why, but grab as much as you can!\n\nOther stuff to note:\n\n-From my experience, controllers do not work with OTR.\n\n-Runs good even on max settings.\n\n-Some people can't get co-op to work but I have never tried it so do some research on it if you plan on playing with a friend.\n\nOverall: great game, I would give it a 9/10","November 4, 2015","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If anything, buy this AND Dead Rising 2 (if you can). Dead Rising 2 is the canon one, so just play that first and then this. What makes Dead Rising 2: OTR a worthy recommendation, however, is, well, Frank West. He adds just that right amount of sass to every bit of story that makes it a little more enjoyable than mr. perfect scowly-face Chuck (who is a psycho in this one). There are more combo weapons, a new area to explore, a different narrative (that hits most of the same beats, but every cutscene has been redone for Frank and his dry humour), a SANDBOX MODE (which we had been clamoring for since the bonus of infinite mode in Dead Rising 1 was not present in 2), new Psychos, and the return of Frank's camera. With the return of photos is the ability to snap selfies with zombies (which, somehow, kills them... which is glorious).\n\nOverall, it's a worthy purchase. As worthy as Dead Rising 2.","September 14, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(That will say 50 euro)\n\nWith only some added weapons, some new features and completely having broken and porely edited some boss fights that obviously tried to kill you because you were before Chuck Greene who was believed to have started the zombie outbreak. Since you aren't Chuck Greene and neither you or him started the outbreak this time you'll get some horribly edited boss fights.\n\nSome pros with the game though is that they've fixed alot of things, such as\n-Checkpoints when you leave to a new area\n-More weapons and items\n-Free roam mode - Go free in fortune city with no timer, no quests, no need for zombrex and just kill alot of zombies and complete challenges for medal, money and PP earned in Free roam will also be shared with your story character.\n-Doesn't run on that ♥♥♥♥ing horrible Microsoft Live crap that some games used.\n\nIf you have to pick from one of the two Dead Rising 2 games, pick this one.","August 25, 2015","true","103.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scorpion1855/recommended/45770/","scorpion1855","Salad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scorpion1855/","192 products in account","It's Dead Rising 2 again, except Frank West returns along with his own original move set and attack animations, the story is shuffled around a little and there's a whole new area in the city - a space-themed amusement park. There's also a couple of new weapons (including combo weapons), a couple of new bosses, and a handful of gameplay changes, the things I remember the most being:\n\n- Frank is infected and needs Zombrex every 24 hours, but he can inject himself no matter where he is, which removes the element of rushing back to the safehouse every day for Katey\n- Frank's picture-taking mechanic returns\n- If you're lightly damaged while holding a weapon you can't store in your inventory (say, a Gem Blower), you won't always drop it. You'll still drop it if you get knocked down, though.\n\nThe co-op is even better than before, because Player 2 still plays as Chuck Greene (still using his own move set and attack animations) and him and Frank have a fair amount of dialogue for shouting at one another. They're really rude to each other for no reason at all, which is really funny.\n"Hey, zombie boy! I've got your drug!" -Chuck\n\n(the actual reason being the dialogue was recorded for DR2: Case West - an X360-exclusive expansion (thanks capcom) - where the two of them start off on the wrong foot)\n\nOh, and let's not forget about the Sandbox mode! In this mode, you're free to just goof off with no time limits to worry about. You're free to carry over levels, PP and money you earn in Sandbox to the 72-hour mode and vice versa. Most of the bosses will spawn in their usual places at certain times, but the friendly survivors are now hostile and will spawn in set places and attack you. There's also challenges around the map, with objectives like earning large numbers of PP, luring zombies to a specific area, racing to a finish point, or just plain killing zombies, so that gives you something to do besides just mucking around and exploring, which is still always fun.\n\nIt's not as good of a port as the original DR2, which in itself was only an okay port, but it's still not too bad. The most notable thing is that you can't turn depth of field off without hex editing, but it runs a little better after you disable that.\n\n+ It's still DR2 - Still fun and funny, music's still good, the city still looks nice, co-op is still incredibly fun\n+ The new additions and subtractions are generally welcome, most notably Sandbox mode\n\n- It's still DR2 - Still kind of buggy and rickety and immature, having to earn speed upgrades by leveling up is still a huge pain\n- It really didn't need to be a seperate, full-priced game\n- DOF\n\n8/10\n\nThis game (and the base game) have some of the most hilarious co-op action I've ever experienced. The single player experience is great, too.","January 10, 2012","true","134.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The transition didn't do much aside from add achievements and break multiplayer (me and many others haven't gotten it to work at all since the update). The save transfer tool (which took Capcom months to actually release) doesn't work either.\n\n\nBasically it's an alright game to get if you dont have Dead Rising 2 already. The added sandbox mode with no time limit is a great option to have if you just wanna mess around killing stuff and leveling up. Not really too much to say to be honest, but it's quite fun.","July 18, 2012","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dead Rising 2 Off The Record takes a what if story viewpoint of number 2. Basically Off The Record is the story of Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the main character. Personally in my opinion this is far more better then the original Dead Rising 2, don't get me wrong I like Chuck Greene and his story in the original number 2 but Frank West is still my favorite character in the Dead Rising series and I really did enjoy the small little changes to the story line to make it Frank's own unique story. For most of the game the storyline is pretty similiar to number 2 just with Frank of course like I mentioned along with small little changes. There is now a really enjoyable sandbox mode where you can run around Fortune City and do whatever you want along with killing all the pyschopaths as well. Everything else is still the same basically like co-op mode and what not but there are a few new psychopaths and survivors in Off The Record along with Uranus Zone the newest add on to Fortune City. Overall this game is a hell lot of fun especially with a friend me personally went through the storyline with my girlfriend who never played Dead Rising so it was quite the adventure. Personally I think it's worth the $20 hell I would pay even more for it but if you are a cheap type of person I'd wait till it goes on sale.","May 10","true","153.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like one big gimmick, and since all of the buildup for Dead Rising 2's twist boss is unchanged, the new boss just comes off as forced. Whereas the other new boss is just lame and annoying with bland music.\nMore bugs, ranging from helpful (infinite paddlesaw) to irritating (Weapons clipping through the floor) to even horrendous (getting stuck on things)\nOnline is worse\nNo graphics options\nRemoval of Terror is Reality (far from a dealbreaker imo)\n\nOverall, I prefer Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record from pure content is a better game. I prefer 2's storytelling, though Off the Record does have it's moments of great narrative (working Brandon into the main story was cool). If you just want story and some fun get 2, but if you want more ways to kill zombies and more time to kill zombies(or just even if you enjoyed 2) I recommend Off the Record.","May 17","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
