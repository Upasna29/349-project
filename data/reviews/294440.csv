Friends and I would sit in Biology class drawing maps and comparing notes, then spending the evenings on the phone doing the same.  This lasted until the end of the game; it was pretty great.\n\nNaturally, when I heard that there was a remake of Shadowgate coming to Steam, my curiosity was piqued immediately.  It was easy to worry though that my fondness of the game only existed in the rose colored glasses of nostalgia.  Thankfully, once I got my hands on the remake, I discovered that Shadowgate was in fact a great game and the remake was pretty great in its own right.\n\nI've never been one much for modern adventure games, but Shadowgate seems to be a shining example of the genre.  Its packed with some great graphics updates and a great score.  The game play proves to be fun too.  I was worried that a point and click style adventure game wouldn't hold my attention.  Since this game has a good story that gets unveiled the further you journey with hints and clues scattered about the castle, it manages to be pretty engrossing.  It's common finding myself coming back to the game sooner than expected just to find out more story.  This is a strong trait for a strong adventure game!\n\nIf my words don't convince you, check out my ongoing Let's Play series of the game over on my youtube channel!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc2ULPOctS7qOot8P3lGOxvEVhy3vfr-S","November 22, 2014","true","7.0"," 115 of 126 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","115","126","5","4"

If you loved the computer and NES origins of this game, you absolutely have to pick this up.

The new puzzles are fresh, complex and satisfying to solve.\n\nBeing able to toggle retro music was a blast.  Some of my favorite video game music was from this and Rich Douglas did a magnificent job translating those songs to current times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/294440/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Shadowgate is a point and click/adventure puzzle game developed by Zojoi and published by Reverb Triple XP. Until recently, I had never heard of this title but apparently Shadowgate is one of the most well known point and click adventure titles in history. It was one of the original titles in the popular MacVenture series that went on to be celebrated on the NES, GBC, and Nintendo 64 so this game has alot of history behind it. This version of Shadowgate has been completely remastered by the original developement team from the ground up adding tons of new content to the game. The title thrusts you into the role of "The Seed Of Prophecy", a somewhat novice but "chosen" mage tasked with traveling to the living castle Shadowgate in hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within...the dreaded warlock lord.\n\nGameplay-wise, the title is presented in the first person perspective with a very minimal heads up display. Your character moves throughout the bowels of castle Shadowgate room by room searching for clues to aid you in your quest while also collecting items and trying to avoid death at the hands of traps, creatures and just plain stupidity. The various puzzles that you have to solve during your questing are the true high point of this game. You have to be keen to figure out many of these puzzles in order to advance the story and some of them will have you wanting to toss your keyboard through the nearest plate glass window. Beware as there will be some frustrating moments to be had in this game but that just makes the reward of solving the puzzles that much more enjoyable once you finally figure them out. Remember that sense of accomplishment that you felt in Dark Souls when you finally defeated that boss after the 103rd try? Kinda like that...kinda.\n\nGraphically, this game is very beautiful. As I stated earlier, this is a remastered version with all new stunningly gorgeous handpainted artwork from beggining to end. The game interface is easy to use and highly customizable. The sound effects are extremely well done, very crisp and fit the title perfectly. The musical score is amazing. It changes depending on the situation and the place that you are inside of castle Shadowgate and does a wonderful job of immersing you within the title.\n\nI was able to complete the game in just under 14 hours but of course I like to explore and backtrack so the typical gamer should be able to finish it in 10-12 hours. It's a short title but very enjoyable especially if you like this genre of games. This was my first dive into this category of gaming and it was a terrific experience that has me looking forward to playing more titles like this one. In fact, there is an available option that let's you turn on the retro version of the game so I definitely plan to go back and replay it in it's original form as soon as possible. When the next game, Beyond Shadowgate due in 2016, comes out I plan to be first in line to get my copy. This title is highly recommended to the puzzle solving adventure gamer or even someone just looking for a different gaming experience. Give it a try I don't think you'll be dissapointed.","August 29, 2015","true","13.6"," 81 of 89 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","81","89","3","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/294440/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Shadowgate is a re-imagining of the point-and-click adventure game released almost three decades ago, under the same name, on NES and Mac. Given these origins, your motivations for venturing into Castle Shadowgate are about what you would expect: you are a hero who must defeat an evil warlock. The graphics, music and the majority of puzzles have been reworked; new, voice-acted cutscenes and story elements have been peppered throughout; while the mysterious atmosphere and memorable locations of the original remain intact, along with the option to use the retro soundtrack.\n\nWhile most of the information needed to reach puzzle solutions does lie somewhere within the game, it is not explicit in its detail: clues are often cryptic, making experimentation necessary—experimentation that results in death just as often as a satisfying solution. Shadowgate is a game in which the reaper is literally waiting around every corner for you to make your next mistake. The only difference is that, this time, it’s almost as if you’re collecting the various deaths since you’re rewarded with achievements for experiencing them and special cutscenes for discovering the hidden ones.\n\nOn Master difficulty, the puzzles are as challenging as the name implies but often in a manner just as obtuse as in the original Shadowgate; fortunately, the developers included two lesser difficulties that make the game more approachable and groom you for your playthrough of Master—if you’re still interested by then. An optional tutorial and a talking skull companion that gives hints upon request, the equivalent of the “hint” command from the original, also help to alleviate the difficulty.\n\nDependent upon how you like your point-and-clicks, Shadowgate is potentially flawed: Turns are limited because the torches that keep you alive are limited in both number and duration, complicated by the fact that you’re unavoidably afflicted with a curse very early on, which will kill you if not cured in time. This is fairly forgiving on lower difficulty settings but, on Master, it’s very easy to waste enough time searching for the cure that you damn yourself in the process and must either go back to an earlier save or restart the entire game. The facts that many items aren’t necessary to progress and anything that isn’t a simple inspection of your surroundings will consume a turn, combined with the experimentation-based puzzle solving, where items must frequently be combined with each other or the environment, could make this adventure an exercise in frustration for some.\n\nIf you enjoyed the original Shadowgate, this is a no-brainer. If you hated the original Shadowgate, this isn’t likely to change your mind, though the lesser difficulties will undoubtedly be less offensive. For those who haven’t played the game, nostalgia aside and despite its difficulty, it is a very memorable game that is full of mystery and your enjoyment will largely depend on how much trial and error you are willing to endure in an adventure game.","August 23, 2014","true","37.5"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","57","61","0","6"

I was content at the fact Zojoi were reimaging the game with new hand drawn rooms and music, but to my surprise, what the developers have actually done is taken Shadowgate to a whole new level.\n\nIf you thought you knew how to conquer Shadowgate, think again. It is still the same nostalgic Shadowgate you once knew, with the same thematic puzzles, though now with a modern twist and level of complexity requiring a greater level of thinking and problem solving. Zojoi have also expanded Castle Shadowgate to introduce new areas of the game that were not accessbile or included in the original. The Steam achievement are also nice touch. Curing the curse in under 200 turns was a challanging achievement.\n\nIf you are not a thinker or problem solver then this game may not be for you. If you do get stuck (and you will) take a break to think about the puzzles. If you are still stuck the forum is very active and helpful, often providing you clues to solve the puzzles without actually providing you the spoiler.\n\nWords cannot describe the feelings I get playing this. No modern game has kept me this entertained. At the price Zojoi are offering this, it is a steal!\n\nRe-experience the mystery of Castle Shadowgate!","June 30, 2014","true","29.6"," 82 of 100 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","82","100","0","2"

I use the term "turn-based" here because every single step you take and every action you make brings you one step closer to your doom.\n\nStory may seem a bit cliche, but considering that's it's a remake of a game that is almost 30 years old, I think that it's pretty much forgivable since this remake makes the game much more approachable to a wider audience.\n\nGraphics feels top notched, and it's possibly my own computer issue or just me, but in retro graphics I can't seem to see anything that resembles anything. It's just a mish-mash of coloured pixels when trying to play in that mode.\n\nMusic can sometimes feel a bit eerie, giving you the "all-alone" feel which suits this theme and setting well.\n\nUI feels a bit clunky if you use solely mouse to play, but fares better combining mouse and keyboard.\n\nDifficulty is a welcome feature in this game as it makes it more approachable to people new to this kind of game especially where death looms at every step. It changes the amount of time (turns) you have left to complete tasks, especially the game in terms of torch life. It also changes the location of items as well as how much more complicated item combinations and puzzles will be.","December 4, 2015","true","79.4"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","35","35","0","7"

Old riddles may not always be what they seem and familiarity can lend itself to misdirection.  It will take a fresh perspective from the player to prepare for the fresh traps, trials, and tribulations of this new castle shaped the guise of the old.\n\nI must admit I had a skeptical approach to the title myself before being part of its testing; but have been pleasantly surprised by the respect to the original and the careful balance of nostalgia vs new content paid by the development team.\n\nIf you enjoyed the previous generations of the Living Castle, Shadowgate, then you will most certainly find quite a lot to love about its newest incarnation.  And if you are new to this genre of gameplay or this franchise, then Shadowgate is an apt place to start.\n\nSo if you're still interested: grab a torch, a weapon of choice, and pluck up a touch of courage and take on the new challenge of the newest Castle Shadowgate -- the Reaper is waiting to see just where your adventure may chance to end...and he can wait far longer than you can.\n","August 21, 2014","true","26.4"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/294440/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The castle of Shadowgate is a puzzle box, a sinister stronghold of secrets, challenges, and obstacles which ultimately provides the opportunity to become a hero of legend. The central character in Zojoi’s remake of the cult-classic Shadowgate, this living keep offers a treasure trove of puzzles and riddles which will confound, confuse, and likely dishearten even the most seasoned adventure gamer at times. It’s a game that is meant for a very particular audience – a patient and persistent one undaunted by the prospect of teeth-clenching frustration – but if you count yourself among those willing to venture into Shadowgate’s deadly spires, you’ll find a grand challenge waiting for you.\nLike many games these days, the updated Shadowgate is a product of crowdfunding. So far, Kickstarter has been hit-or-miss for the adventure genre. For every success, we’ve also seen our fair share of disappointments, delayed games, and even controversies. This makes Shadowgate’s success all the more refreshing and inspirational – even more so considering its approach to gameplay remains uncompromisingly old-school. Of course, there is a reason that games like Shadowgate don’t exist anymore: it is definitely not designed for a mass market.\nThe game begins with you standing in front of a hidden entrance to the titular castle. Shadowgate is played in the first-person perspective, with players taking on the role of Jair Cathegar, an adventuring soldier briefly introduced in the opening cinematic. Jair has been called to the castle of Shadowgate by the enigmatic wizard Lakmir – although the reason he has been called only becomes apparent as you unravel the mystery of the keep.\nThe opening cinematic also introduces Shadowgate’s revamped art style. The original game was released in 1987 for the nascent Macintosh platform, and was played through windows featuring minimalist black and white illustrations of the castle’s rooms. An NES version followed in 1989, but still featured graphics restricted by the 8-bit system. In this 2014 remake, the game opens with spoken expository dialogue from Lakmir set against an abstract, impressionist-style series of landscape paintings depicting Jair’s approach to the keep. This visual style, both atmospheric and suggestive, continues to be used throughout the game, providing an immersive aesthetic for the dark medieval atmosphere. The castle of Shadowgate is a forbidding place, and the visual world that Zojoi has created deftly creates the impression that there is something to fear around each corridor.\nOnce you set foot inside the castle, the game’s plot begins slowly revealing itself, and it’s mostly standard fantasy material. An evil warlock is attempting to gain control of arcane powers hidden deep within, and it is up to Jair to stop his scheme. A “living castle,” Shadowgate has been trapped, tricked, and populated with a number of monsters that you will have to overcome to eventually face the evil warlock, Talimar.\nWhile the set-up and traditional environment feel derivative now, what Shadowgate gets right is verisimilitude. It might be a fantasy world based on established tropes, but the game does an excellent job of making it seem like the castle and all its inhabitants – antagonists and protagonists, evil warlocks and slain wizards – are all important players in a very real place. From dialogue to room descriptions to the forgotten scrolls and journals found throughout the keep, the game is committed to creating a living, breathing world.\nThe sound in Shadowgate is used very well. The orchestral soundtrack provides a perfect complement to the sinister mood of your journey through the castle, and there’s a number of musical cues, such as the staccato suspense theme that plays when a torch is about to run out, which augment the haunting atmosphere. As a tribute to its origins, Shadowgate also allows you to play the game with the original Nintendo soundtrack.\nDuring a few cutscenes, the game features spoken dialogue from the Gandalfian Lakmir and the evil Talimar. Both are performed splendidly, hitting the perfect notes for a game in a dark fantasy world. Jair is almost completely silent – the only time he speaks is at the conclusion of a battle or during a strenuous activity. This is sadly played a little more for comedic relief, but it’s too infrequent to negatively affect the game.\nAnd riddles there be aplenty in this accurs’d place. The interface needs to be intuitive and simple, because the puzzles you will face while exploring are anything but. Overcoming each puzzle allows you to continue advancing deeper into the castle and learning more about what has happened to Shadowgate, its previous keepers, and how to defeat Talimar. There are three difficulty levels, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master, which you can choose from before beginning the adventure, but all three are a challenge.\nPuzzles come in a number of forms. In addition to the ubiquitous inventory obstacles, you will also need to overcome mechanical challenges and face a number of fantastic monsters. The castle is stocked full of items, both magical and mundane, and Jair can pocket almost all of them. This adds to the difficulty because only a handful are actually useful. In addition, you can learn new spells by reading from arcane scrolls, which provide Jair with new avenues of interaction with the castle.\nMy biggest criticism of the game is that too many of the game’s puzzle solutions, even after giving them considerable thought, simply don’t make sense or are hopelessly unintuitive. There are spells that work in some locations but not others, castle mechanisms are found in some truly bizarre locations, and combat against the keep’s denizens is an exercise in trial and error. It exacts a price on the impression that the castle is a real, living place when so many of its challenges feel arbitrary.\nEven worse, I sometimes had the right idea to solve a puzzle but used the incorrect button or didn’t choose the correct location in the scene to use an item or spell on. There’s a particular encounter with a riddling Djinn where I knew the answer, but had to consult a walkthrough to understand how to communicate it – and I still don’t understand the reasoning behind how I eventually did it.\nDespite being a fairly linear game, the Shadowgate remake does offer some replay value which the original did not. There are a number of achievements you can strive for, such as finding the cure in a certain number of turns or overcoming a few obstacles in alternate ways, as well as an additional side quest to find the fabled “Black Axe,” which was cut from the original game but has been restored here.\nGamers who aren’t interested in an adventure that interrupts its narrative frequently and sometimes arbitrarily, or adventurers who don’t have the time or inclination to struggle through Shadowgate’s brutal challenge level probably won’t find a lot of enjoyment within the keep’s haunted halls. This game requires a commitment. In fact, if you forgo relying on any outside assistance, it could easily take up to a month to solve the keep’s many confounding mysteries. However, if you’re up to the challenge; if the dark, foreboding corridors of a forgotten castle on the edge of a fantastic world don’t frighten you; if traps, tricks, and fiendish monsters in the dark don’t make you turn away in fear; and the prospect of mind-numbing, diabolic puzzles doesn’t deter you, then Shadowgate will offer you a journey into darkness, and an adventure unlike anything you have experienced in a long time.","August 12, 2015","true","11.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

Fans of the original Shadowgate will love the remake of this game and the feeling of retro nostalgia.\n\nThe game starts with an animated opening accompanied by a  great soundtrack and voice narration that will give you the immersion and overhwelming feeling of  epicness to your adventure to conquer the castle and stop an evil warlock.\n\nThough not everything is voiced in the game except for major plotline cutscenes for the story. The game still does a great job with the  text dialogue. The graphics will remind you of a really well done animated  graphic novel if you've ever experienced any of those. The gameplay itself a click adventure puzzle game and might not be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nUpon playing the game and starting off your adventure you'll be greeted with 3 different difficulty mode to the game, each of which changes up the solution to the puzzles to the game and stop players from thinking they know the puzzles after playing the first time. Along with starting the adventure you'll be given a well detailed tutorial that explains how the mechanics, and how the game works. This isn't your usual point and click adventure but a retro gameplay style with the player having to use hotkeys and clicking on top for buttons to execute commands such as use, speak, or even to open doors and move forward etc. So an example is  in order to get in through a door to the next area  to progress you'll have to first open the door or you'll run headlfirst into it.\n\nThe game will feature puzzles that are pretty complex and feels VERY satisfying when you actually solve it. The game does give you hints hidden in well written riddles and text on spells, items, and scroll you find in order to progress.  Upon being stuck however, players  do have the ability to talk to your only sidekick skull partner Yorick who at times talk alot but does give you hints also in riddles  but unless you paid attention to certain surrondings and the riddles, you'll be stuck at certain areas for quite a bit.\nThe way to solve certain situations sometimes is trial and error sometimes and  be warned however that making a mistake at certain locations and it's death for you in many ways. There are creatures in this castle to stop you along the way such as krakens and dragons.  Luckily the game does offer saving and  quicksave to keep on playing. To add on to this the game has a mechanic that everything you do is considered a move except for looking. So each time you are using a move your torch is slowly diminishing. If you run out of torches you'll have no choice but to restart a previous save becuase leaving  will make you fall in the dark and break your neck. Along with the torch there will be another element later in the game that will be more brutal on you forcing you to quicken your pace a bit.\n\nThe one thing about the game is when you do die you'll die in a gruesome way. Along with death flying along and giving you a speech about your misery sometimes in a humorous manner. So try not to die and do your best at the puzzles, Read, look, and tread carefully in this castle of doom.\n\n+ Animated graphics\n+ Well written dialogue\n+ Voice over and cutscenes are nicely done\n+ Immersive Music\n+ Complex puzzle with 3 different difficulty and change up\n+ includes retro voice, music, and audio from the nes version that you can switch to\n\n\n- When you get stuck its pretty brutal don't give up\n- The retrostyle interface might not be everyones thing\n- The only downside is once you know the solutions then thats pretty much it for the game.","August 21, 2014","true","4.5"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","53","74","0","4"

Ever since I played this game on a NES system a few decades ago, I recall all the frustration I had when going through some tedious puzzles, yet the joy when solving a problem made it more the worthwhile.\n\nThose who have played the game will likely recall a skull ornament door at the very start of the game. Once inside, the warlock lord makes his first appearance (his eyes anyway) dismissing your quest to stop him and confidently remarks about your imminent death. Alas your journey and the puzzles start immediately. At times you attempt to methodically evaluate and make sense of a problem ahead. In other times, you may resort to trying random actions. Actions which may cause you to progress, cause your death – or even witty remarks to things you wouldn’t do in real life!\n\nIts 2014, a remake of Shadowgate arrives. I really didn’t know what to anticipate until the game started. Unlike the previous game, this remake has three different modes with master being the most difficult. After choosing a difficulty mode, I was met with a familiar setting to the original classic. There was an air of nostalgia in the opening sequence, yet it was original and fresh - the design was fabulous. The background music was nicely adapted from the classic Shadowgate. A nice feature of the game is to switch the soundtracks to the original MIDI composition! A major difference at the start is you are met with a companion named Yorick, who not only guides you through your quest, but throws a few jokes and remarks to put you at ease in some frustrating situations. This was all before I entered the door - from here on I just knew this was going to be a master piece of a game. Boy was I right! The art work for the cut scenes later on were simply fantastic and suited well the nature of this point-and-click adventure game. The puzzles were similar to the classic though with more mind-boggling twist. They were that much better to solve. I couldn’t put the game down and even today, decades later, with the similarities from the previous game, the frustrations still arose.

One that you were completely obsessed with, spent tons of time with played over and over again, gathered every bit of information on it that you could? For some people, the games that they find themselves so devoted to end up becoming big series, with numerous sequels. For others, those games get periodic sequels and live on. And for yet others those games just sort of fade away, becoming forgotten in time.\n\nFor a while, it seemed that Shadowgate would be one of those games in that last group. Certainly, it was much-loved by a number of people who experienced the original adventure on NES, Macintosh, and PC. And, the series did get some sequels - a side-scrolling adventure game for the TurboDuo, and a 3D exploration game for N64, as well as a port of the original game to the Gameboy Color. But, the series never seemed to receive quite the appreciation that it deserved, and, after those N64 and GBC versions in 1999, the series seemed to slip away. While the series, or mentions of the series, would pop up occasionally, it was never anything significant. And, after a while, it seemed all hope was gone, and the legend of Shadowgate would be lost to the passage of time.\n\nSometimes, however, all it takes is a few dedicated people to make something happen. And fortunately for the Shadowgate series, it had two extremely dedicated people - Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs - who had been with the series since the beginning, who still maintained that love for the series after all those years, who wanted to see the series live and thrive again. They surrounded themselves with a great group of talented people at Zojoi, acquired the rights to the Shadowgate franchise, and set out to find if there was still a desire to see Shadowgate live again. And, through the relatively new (especially at the time in 2012) format of Kickstarter, soon found out that there were nearly 3500 people were still passionate about Shadowgate, and wanted to see it brought back to life. And, after over a year and a half of work, that dream finally become a reality, with the new Shadowgate game!\n\nThe first thing that should be clarified/emphasized with regards to the new Shadowgate game is that it is not simply a port/remake of the original Shadowgate. While it is based off of the original Shadowgate, and shares similarities with it, there is a significant amount of new content - rooms, items, descriptions, everything that goes into making the game. So, anyone who has played the original who is expecting to simply blow through this game in short order is in for a big surprise.\n\nThat said, the new Shadowgate shares much in common with the original, where it is a near certainty that anyone who enjoyed the original will enjoy the new Shadowgate as well. All of the core aspects of a good Adventure game are here. In your journey through the castle Shadowgate and surrounding areas, you will be exploring through a wide variety of locations, gathering hints, clues and information, discovering items and putting them to use, solving puzzles, uncovering mysteries, all while working toward your end goal. The challenge and adventure of Shadowgate is alive and well, and fans of the series will be thrilled to see all of this brought into a new game so well.\n\nFor people who are new to the series, or to the genre entirely, the new Shadowgate also provides as an excellent entry point. There are three different difficulties - allowing one to experience the adventure while working through different amounts of puzzles, different challenges, and more forgiving circumstances. There is also an optional hint system in place, where one can make use of a companion to receive information about situations and guidance toward solutions. So, one can start on a level where one is comfortable, and work up through the difficulties and help with those difficulties, until one is a master of the castle.\n\nIn bringing Shadowgate to a new generation, new expectations, and new groups of fans, Zojoi have brought the game up-to-speed not only with regards to the puzzles and adventure, but in the graphics and music as well. Each area - old and new - is beautifully illustrated, to make each room come alive. In addition, a wonderful soundtrack has been created for this game, each piece of which which perfectly fits and sets the mood for the rooms and the entire game.\n\nFor those with a fondness for the original soundtrack and style of the original game, however, there are a set of options - for audio, text, and transitions - which can be toggled on or off individually, to provide for a more "retro" style of play. The audio allows one to experience either the new soundtrack, or the NES one. The text option causes text to appear letter by letter, drawn by a quill. And, the transition option causes the more blocky style of moving from room to room, as opposed to more blurred option of the newer version. Each of these, depending on one's preference, can either provide for a more "retro" feel on a newer adventure, or allow one to experience an entirely new adventure altogether.\n\nBetween the different difficulties, different challenges, new things to explore and discover and overcome on each difficulty, new details to notice, and an intricate story to uncover, as well as the various options for display and experience of the game, there are many reasons to play through Shadowgate multiple times. While it's easy enough to do a quick playthrough of the game on the easiest difficulty with hints, it's a very rewarding experience to play through at the hardest difficulty without any hints. That may be a bit much to tackle the first time through the game, however, even for seasoned Shadowgate veterans, and so going through the game multiple times on different difficulties to uncover increasingly more of the game is highly recommended. Even beyond that, however, the world of Shadowgate is so rich and rewarding that it will continually draw one back into its world, to explore and experience it time and again.\n\nThe new Shadowgate game takes as a starting point the original Shadowgate, and builds off of it to bring forth a game which is similar in style, while still modern and up-to-date; a game which has a similar feel, yet doesn't feel archaic; a game which stays true to the roots of the original, while providing a significantly new experience; and which takes a franchise that at one time, and for so long, had seemed lost to the ages and tales of the past, and brings it once more to the forefront of gaming. The new Shadowgate is not meant to merely be a one-off thing either. Having seen the passion and love that still exist for the franchise, Zojoi have plans to bring Shadowgate as a franchise back to life, continuing to combine old and new as old adventures are revived, forgotten tales are brought to the fore, hidden information is revealed, and bright future is once more in sight.\n\nIt's not very often that a game like the new Shadowgate comes along. A beautiful blend of old and new, a game which will appeal to fans of the series, fans of the genre, and people new to both of them. A game in a series which for so long had seemed lost and without hope, brought back to life, not in just a simple port or in a cheap use of the name, but in a lovingly-crafted game, both a tribute to what has come before, and a promise of what is to come. Dave Marsh, Karl Roelofs, and everyone at Zojoi, have created a masterpiece with Shadowgate. The series is once more in good hands, and the future is brighter than it has ever been.\n\nJourney once more into the castle Shadowgate!","September 20, 2014","true","142.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"

The game is faithful to the original, but expands greatly upon it.\n+Fans of the original (and later re-releases, including the popular NES version) will absolutely love the option to choose either the new transitions and music or the original 1987 music and transitions.\n+The new music pieces are not simply remixes of the original pieces, but rather hauntingly-beautiful retellings.\n+Game difficulty determines how hard and how long the game is. A puzzle that requires backtracking or multiple steps on Hard will either be simplified or outright removed on Easy.\n+The game's many causes of death reinforces the idea that you don't need your hand held to have fun.\n\nCons:\n\n-Whoever thought of the idea for retro graphics mode needs to be fired. The "retro" option simply places a filter over the screen, pixelating everything. Imagine playing a game that runs at a native 1920x1080, then changing the resolution to 320x200. That's how bad it is. Unlike the transitions and the music, it is in no way faithful to the original game.\n-Unlike the original, the game gives you no indication that your torch is about to go out, leading to an untimely and unexpected death. The NES version had its own music piece to warn you when your torch was about to go out.\n-Newcomers to the game may be put off by all the trial-and-error they will have to do, as many of the puzzle solutions seem counter-intuitive.\n\nFull disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter.","November 22, 2014","true","2.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

Now I get to have that chance, with much nicer eye candy. And... I must say it didn't disappoint, but it clearly is not a game for everybody.\n\nYou take on the role of Jair. You want to beat the Warlock Lord. From there the story doesn't really get more complicated that that. It's pretty much your standard good-vs-evil tale. I would have liked some character development through dialogue. For example, there's a lady in a tower who would have been a good choice to converse with, but, well, that becomes moot pretty fast. Sure you become more powerful throughout the course of the game, but Jair never says anything short of grunts and tricks or treats.\n\nShadowgate comes from an era where dead-ends are both possible and common. I'm still against this design philosophy, but I can't totally blame them for wanting to keep the spirit of the original. Just be forewarned that it's quite possible to screw yourself over, so save often and in different slots. Speaking of which, I would have much liked the ability to name my save files. It gets kind of hard to tell which save is which..\n\nShadowgate boasts some very nice artwork, and is easy on the eyes. There's a fair amount of clutter in each scene, but I didn't have much difficulty picking out interactable objects, even without the use of F2. Retro graphics on the other hand is very harsh on the eyes. I recommend against using that, as it makes everything difficult to discern. I thought it would replicate the NES look, but instead it's like they took a mosaic filter and applied it to the screen. The music is pleasant, and fits the game quite nicely. It's never out of place and never obtrusive. Even better, the retro music works pretty well.\n\nThe interface is a tad on the clunky side. The inventory menu has a brief delay before you can interact with it, which is problematic when you need to access it so frequently. Thankfully you can set bindings, but that's more of a band-aid fix than a proper solution. The ability to use scroll wheel to go through items would have been nice. I suggest learning the keyboard shortcuts, as they will help speed up your progress in subsequent playthroughs. If you play the game entirely with the mouse, certain things feel remarkably slow.\n\nThere's 4 difficulty levels as of the time of this writing - Normal, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. I ended up playing through all of them in order, and I will say there's a pretty good progression. What worked once before might work differently in a higher difficulty.  I had the most fun with Journeyman difficulty which provides a generous time frame, but lacks puzzles exclusive to Master, which hampered the enjoyment a bit. Master difficulty on the other hand is overkill. I nearly failed both curing myself and beating it by less than 20 turns each. I thought I had a firm grasp on what I needed to do to win, but apparently not!\n\nFrom Apprentice difficulty and higher (all the "Classic" modes), the game starts to institute hard time limits, primarily in the way of torches. You only have so many turns before your torch flickers out and die. Torches aren't too difficult to find, even on Master difficulty. In all liklihood, you will probably die to the other natural time limits set by the game, especially on Master difficulty.\n\nCompounding the time limit problem is the abundance of items that do absolutely nothing. At least in Bethesda games you can sell all that junk you acquire. In here, the items serve to waste your time and nothing more. Unused items just makes the game feel unfinished. Yes I know they're red herrings, but they feel like an oversight, especially for the adventure game genre.\n\nThe game tries its darnedest to be as cryptic as possible sometimes. Most obvious case is in regard to spells. There's no way anyone would know what the spells do, as the game provides vague descriptions when you examine and cast them. And on Master difficulty you really can't spend turns casting spells willy-nilly.\n\nMost of the puzzles in the game make... some amount of sense. The early difficulties are easy enough to figure out on your own, at least with the help of Yorick. The later difficulties I admit to using a guide. Many altered puzzles have solutions I didn't see clues for. When have I ever needed to make a green fire or get a wet cloak?\n\nOverall I found Shadowgate to be enjoyable enough to sit through it through all difficulties. While I can't fault it for trying to be faithful to the original, I can fault the original for its curious design choices. If there's one thing I would have liked, it's the ability to play on Master mode without time limits, because I enjoyed the sheer number of things to see in there, but had no time to see all of it. I think Shadowgate falls into a 7/10.\n\nEDIT: Bunch of spelling errors and grammar.","September 16, 2015","true","17.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

The original was released in 1989 on the NES, and was a lot of fun (though very difficult) when I played it as a kid.\n\nThe new one is just as tough, and has a new and very beautiful art style.  A nice soundtrack was made for this as well, though after exploring the options menu I saw there were options to make this game feel more like the original, "retro" Shadowgate.  One of those options was to have the old soundtrack play instead!  There's other options as well to make it feel more like the old version.  They did good there.\n\nSo what is this game...well it's an old school point-and-click adventure game.  Extremely heavy puzzle elements that will get you killed and/or confused.  A lot.  There are ways for you to fail this game, without you even knowing it right away too.  You'll be unlocking new areas, as well as a fair amount of backtracking.  There are also a lot of items to be had, you'll want to get most of them because you never know when they might be of use.\n\nThey've introduced some different difficulty settings, and the ability to either play the game with no saves or with the ability to save.

There are quiet a few things you should consider if you plan to buy this, though:\n\n- It's not an RPG in any way regarding skilling, equipping or upgrading your character. You don't have skills, attributes or whatsoever you could manage or upgrade. You can't buy or sell items and all items you find in the game are basically "use item x for adventure element y (e.g. use the only arrow you'll find in the whole game against precisely one specific enemy).\n- There are no fights in the classical sense. You don't aim or use skills or the like against enemies. You use item x, which is specifically designed to be used in this "fight" on the enemy or another item to win the fight.\n- There are some clues about what to do, but like in most adventures, you'll end up several times with spamming item x or ability y on everything you can to see if it has any effect. I felt really lost during the late game when I was just running around and trying to figure out where's the chance to progress with the game.\n- There are NO, I repeat, NO possibilities for alternative ways to get around a challenge. You either stick to the scripted plan of using item a on element b in situation c after you've accomplished event d or you are srewed. That's actually the reason why adventures died out some time ago.\n- I needed 6 hours to finish the game. That's a pretty short time to play through a game.

Playing out the game it seems to be very similar to the original with subtle differences to the layout and puzzles, making it a new challenge to play. I recommend playing it on the hardest difficulty to get the most rewarding experience for those who are familiar with the original game.\n\nNormally rebooted games are something you would approach with caution, but this game did a good job of keeping the story intact, while making it a more modern playthough. Still fun, I think new generations will like it and older generations will enjoy the subtle differences and challenges.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Patware/recommended/294440/","Patware","The Patware","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Patware/","275 products in account","Gameplay: Shadowgate is not reinventing any wheels here - it plays exactly like its predecessor and exactly like any other point-and-click adventure game, a set of pre-defined commands used to interact with the world and solve hella puzzles. The game deftly avoids making you actually pixel-hunt, most interactable items fairly easy to spot.\n\nThe game is an adventure of the old-school, with red herrings everywhere and huge amount of items you can grab that you will never actually use. Nearly every puzzle has good, if sometimes somewhat obtuse hints, with very little ♥♥♥-pull adventure logic. The difficulty levels are also very serious, massively simplifying things on the easiest level as compared to the hardest. You /can/, on all difficulties, screw yourself into an unwinnable position - the game will allow you to destroy necessary items (though not casually) and it's extremely possible to just run out of time (though not very likely).\n\nThe biggest flaw in the gameplay is some UI related clumsiness, as using items on the environment can get very clunky very quickly when you're experimenting on a puzzle. Items can be bound to number keys for things you use a lot, but I don't think that ended up particularly useful near the end.\n\nStory: Shadowgate has never, on its own, had a particularly deep mythology. The Shadowgate remake drops a lot more lore on you, completely resetting the world and freely changing some very major details. It does some interesting things once you get to the end.\n\nI did personally find it to largely suffer from being written by 50-year old men whose greatest influences are clearly in the Lord of the Rings vein, naming conventions clearly suffering from a lack of... I want to say modern creativity. It's all a bit out of date.\n\nArt: Here's where Shadowgate really shines - which is important, since the game is little more than a series of paintings you flail at with a mouse. Shadowgate is not a colorful place, with most scenes generally only having two or three different colors at any time, and Chris Cold does an excellent job making a dreary Shadowgate that seriously looks like it wants to kill you.\n\nJair in particular is excellently rendered - the classic portrayal of the game's protagonist was a standard square-jawed manly hero in full armor and a beautiful head of hair. New Shadowgate portrays Jair as a man dragged out of his life and sent on a journey without ever really being allowed to understand why - his hair is long and filthy, his cloak is tattered, and his shadowed face imparts the idea that Shadowgate is destroying him even as he triumphs over it.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the art is /clear./ Despite everything being dirty, dull, and cracked, mostly in greys and browns, nothing looks maddeningly ambiguous. An item on the ground is clearly an item on the ground, a doorway is clearly a doorway, and if you at any point get fooled it's because the game is actively trying to fool you.\n\nMusic: I have a clear bias here - New Shadowgate's score is an orchestral treatment of the original music, the old songs appearing as almost etherial strains inside some deeply atmospheric stuff. Compared to the original, this score is much darker, much more ominous, and much more effective (which shouldn't be too difficult, considering the original was on an 8-bit system). There is an appreciated option to set the music to the classic beeply bops.\n\nShadowgate: Yeah, it's Shadowgate. You can die on almost every screen, you watch your torches steadily dwindle down, and the Warlock Lord pops in from time to time just to talk ♥♥♥♥. Most sadistically, the game is explicitly /not/ the previous Shadowgate. Very few puzzles are solved the same way, and the game will often directly punish you for having the unmitigated gall to underestimate it in this fashion. Much like the original, the game (on Master difficulty) is not here to be your friend. It is here to laugh at you as you stare blankly at its legitimately hard puzzles and then brutally kill you for blinking.\n\n--\n\nAll told, I give the game high marks. The UI's clunkiness just takes a little getting used to, and if you enjoy adventure games that kind of slap you around, you can't get much more slappy than this. If you're a fan of the original and you haven't picked this up yet, you should absolutely do so.","August 27, 2014","true","7.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Only people who have played the original get to fully enjoy some of the nods in the redux. How you proceed in the remake has changed greatly from the original and infact what were solutions to problems in the original now kill you in somewhat humorous ways and even offer secret death endings which I greatly enjoyed.\n\n"point and click adventure" is a name that has been slightly tarnished with games that have you find 10 objects on a still screen while a timer ticks down (you know what I am talking about) but shadowgate tells a story and makes you think. Also if you want to just want to enjoy a story theres always guides, so you never feel stuck if you want to just enjoy a tale.

I'm satisfied witht the graphics and audio and gameplay was good up til (for me) about 4 hours into the game playing on normal (not classic). To that point I had played withtout the need for looking anything up on the internet and solving everything myself (maybe using the hint system a couple times to move things along). I had figured the developers had learned their lesson about annoying garbage that plagued adventure games of the past. Then I encountered this game's Achilles heal: you get to a puzzle and can't proceed because you missed something you never even knew existed, don't know exactly what it is or where it is, and the only choice is having to go through every room in the game again until you hopefully find it. Very minor spoiler here of where this started for me: there's a crystal puzzle in this game and after solving it you're supposed to cast a spell on it to activate a bridge. Problem was, I never encountered this particular spell. It would be somewhat tolerable though annoying to then look at an online guide, though most guides out there seem be written for classic mode. And since the game isn't so linear, you'll have to read through those guides pretty well before noticing the solution. That wasn't the only time something like this happened (another instance  for example is the rune puzzle) and when the annoyances started piling up I found myself mostly just sticking to the guides to speed things up and get it over with. So that's when the game starts feeling more like work than play. So bottom line is that although I enjoyed it at first, I felt barely compelled to complete Shadowgate and ultimately can't recommend it. That being said, I got it as part of a bundle and more than got my money's worth and will be be paying the $2.99 summer sale special edition upgrade price so I can get the soundtrack.","June 14, 2015","false","13.0"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","1"

If you do remember it, there are several possible versions across different platforms that you may remember. The version of Shadowgate that I remember is the NES version. I never owned the game, but I rented it a few times and enjoyed it. When I saw that someone was remaking it, I had to check it out.\n\nFor the most part, the 2014 remake of Shadowgate is faithful, while also being respectful in its adaptation. This isn't a 100% translation. While some things you may remember from the past are still present in this version of the game, others may be absent or changed, while new puzzles and features have been added. The spirit of what made Shadowgate great is intact however and that's what's most important.\n\nIt would be easy to quibble over the changes and additions made to this version of the game, but ultimately they are no better or worse than what was in the game to begin with. Certain puzzles still require odd leaps of logic and certain connections sometimes feel a bit stretched, but I've experienced worse and in the context of the game world it's forgivable. Ultimately I enjoyed Shadowgate and the addition of difficulty levels (with differing puzzles and win conditions) and achievements for time and turn limits, mean that there's decent replayability here. It's a classic game remade well and worth checking out. I'm looking forward to the next offering from this team.","January 2, 2015","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

After a certain amount of clicks, you will die. This means you can mess your save game up if you don't complete the objectives that instigated the time-limit on time.\n\nI also thought it was rather difficult to figure out what the spells do, their description is vague and the whole game kind of boils down to just trying to combine every object in your inventory with the objects you see strewn about (and those are rather numerous as there are also objects which are only present as filler)\n\nThe time-limit really bummed me out, the sluggish interface annoyed me and the interactive story-like combat made me want to play a real dungeon crawler instead.","January 5","false","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The inventory when pulled up covers the entire screen, so the selection process is (pull up inventory, select "USE", select item in inventory, close inventory, click what to use item on) and it slows down the pace and makes trying different solutions VERY frustrating. Also, to interact with an object, you have to "USE" yourself on it, so again, (USE, click your portrait, click item to interact with) it's incredibly clunky and makes the mediocre puzzles even worse to deal with. At the very least, the hotkeys can be rebound.\n\nThe auto-save in the NES version is better than this one. You should manually "quick-save" by hitting F5 in every room, and then when you do have to restart you have to go through a load menu and select your file, it's just bad.\n\nOh P.S. I hope you enjoy a long-term game over timer w/o good indicators on top of the perfectly fine torch system. You get a mandatory curse fairly early on, and eventually, you will just lose. For me this was 2 hours into the game. 2 hours after getting the curse, I had to restart the game. That's poor game design and a relic of an era that they even got rid of after Uninvited because they realized it was ♥♥♥♥ back in 1987.\n\nThe charm of the original game is completely gone, no longer will you die 30 times in the first 5 rooms in amusing ways. They actively make it difficult to die, which is just so so so wrong.\n\nEven if you loved Shadowgate, I would recommend not picking this up, or at least waiting for it to be <$5.","August 22, 2014","false","5.2"," 66 of 125 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","66","125","0","21"

A childhood, consumed by puzzle solving, thought provoking death.\n\nShadowgate is- and is always will be a wonderful game. The original has always been challenging for me, it took me nearly 7 YEARS to beat the original.  I had given up many times, but in the end, I persisted, and succeeded. When I first started, I was young, the complex approaches, or even the most simplest thoughts, hadn't occurred. Getting stuck is the part of the game that will destroy you.\n\nEven today the game on Master mode is a challenge, it stresses to the finest detail, that every aspect is important. For a veteran, every solution is the same, perhaps some have been changed. But the problem is different. The answer is the same, but you still need to solve the problem, understand the question.\n\nYou may need to backtrack, and  play much more cautiously. You may find torches to be limited on supply. The game will continue to challenge you, and make you question things, and answers. They're there, sometimes puzzles have more than one sollution. Which often ends to be a pleasant surprise, and quite gratifying, when you learn of it.\n\nI've only managed to get past  the room of mirrors, and into the courtyard on Master Mode.\n\nBut the game is .. a good challenge, for a mind, a veteran. The game remains refreshing, and enjoyable just like the original, for the newcomer, it offers multiple difficulties, to help you warm up to the game.

Master hotkeying, and using the controls.\n\nl to look\ni for inventory\no for open\nu to use\nh to hit\ng to go\nc to close\n\nAnd so on, this will save a lot of mouse movement, and pains in such developments.

For old fans wondering if it recaptures the old shadowgate experience, yes it does, but don't expect to be faced with the same old puzzles we've seen again and again in the previous shadowgate ports. The essence of what makes shadowgate what it once was is still there, but puzzles, map even the story have been rewritten and expanded to make this revival a grander new experience to recapture the attention of old fans and delight the new.\n\nOld fans, as you can see from the screen shots, many iconic rooms from the original are back touched up and modernised in a striking art style. Don't expect them to serve the same purpose they once did though or you will probably get stuck. While the new puzzles are quite challenging the game now has many new modes to curb the difficulty for new players and still provide the hardcore experience for old fans. Achievements unique to different modes and the new unlockable hidden deaths mode which will have you searching for old a new creative ways to kill your character (a homage to old adventure games like kings quest and the original shadowgate) provide an modicum of replayability this genre usually lacks.\nRace against the clock as each mode gives you only a limited amount of time and resources to reach the end before the world ends or your life is snuffed out, also note the attention given to the new narrative. The plot is much the same as the original but now told in much more detail with written lore, voice acting and stylised cutscenes to give a sense of epicness to your quest to save the world from the dark wizard.\nWhether you are a fan of the original or just point and click adventure games in general you owe it to yourself to experience this lovingly crafted remake of this much adored classic. The industry needs more remakes like this and the monkey island special editions to offset the influx of shovel ware hidden object games polluting the genre.","September 18, 2014","true","61.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The art is fantastic first and foremost, with the UI being relatively easy to navigate.  While the rooms have a similar look to their 1987 counterparts, the puzzles have been changed slightly.  To top that off, there are three difficulties that change how quickly the torches run out, the frequency/difficulty of puzzles, and etc.  There's also a retro mode, allowing you to listen to the old music and experience the transitions we've come to know and love.  A hint system exists to help you somewhat, though it won't give you the answer flat out like BTTF: The Game did.\n\nBottom line: if you're a retro-gamer like myself, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.

It's not a straight port with new graphics, it's a complete reimagining.\n\nOne thing my nostalgia wants to nitpick is that the atmosphere doesn't quite feel the same as the NES version, but I think that just might be difficult to recapture. It does, in many ways, feel like a hidden object game, only without the hidden object scenes. However, there are four difficulty settings, which add increasingly more rooms to explore and more complex puzzles to solve, and even the easiest one is harder than the hardest hidden object game I've completed. So, it is definitely a challenge for those familiar with the original, but many features (such as a new hint system provided by a talking skull named Yorick) make it accessible to newcomers. The multiple difficulty settings, plus the myriad achievements, also solve the "lack of replay value" that the original game had.\n\nWhile the game wears its roots on its sleeve, which is good for hardcore fans, it also contains numerous pop culture references, some of them more appropriate than others. This also accounts for some of the difference in atmosphere between this and the original: The original seemed very much like it took place in its own world - the descriptions of lands beyond the castle itself created a great sense of the bigger picture. But all the references here project a mixed sense of being in a game world that somehow knows about things from unrelated properties. At least it has a lot of monsters , unlike Shadowgate 64, which had almost none.\n\nProbably more important than the references are some of the story changes, particularly those involving the final boss, that longtime fans may or may not approve of. I'm not entirely sure of what to think of them, myself, and I was wondering if the final puzzle or ending would change at all on the harder settings to be more true to the original, but neither does. The remake also leans far more heavily into the horror genre. While the original had some gory death descriptions, the remake has some that are played out in cutscenes and are even far more disturbing than the worst ones in Uninvited. Not necessarily a negative point, just something you might want to be aware of.\n\nThe orchestral soundtrack is based on the melodies of the NES version, but there is also an option to use the actual NES chiptunes, which works surprisingly well.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a pretty strong recommendation, whether you're new to Shadowgate or not. Hardcore fans may not approve of all the changes, but there is still plenty of challenge and fun to be had. Even that elusive Goblin Room makes an appearance.\n\nRating: 4/5","May 3, 2015","true","38.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shadowgate is back! I am a HUGE fan of the NES version. I have logged dozens of hours into this new version and I think it is pretty awesome! I'm excited to see what Zojoi's has in store next! (I know, but no spoilers for you!)\n\n+   Great in game art style and an awesome soundtrack (based mostly on the NES compositions!)\n+   3 difficulty settings that change up puzzles, adding some replay value\n+   Nostalgia trip back to the castle that I got so many nightmares from when I was young\n+   Lots of 'Hidden Death' cut scenes that are really fun to discover and watch\n\n\n-   The puzzle structure is firmly rooted in old school style gaming-- (for good or bad) so that means some puzzles can be confusing at times-- even on easy, Puzzles can get very confusing on hard! (First timers- I HIGHLY recommend NOT starting on hard mode. Even veterans of the original-- the puzzles are 95% different in this new one)\n\n-   So many items! Not everything has a use either. First time though you will have a massive amount of things to pick up and keep track of. I've seen people get stuck on Hard mode and then try using everything, on everything trying to brute force their way through.\n\n\n\nFinal verdict : 7.5 / 10\n===============\nReally fun and old school goodness that is relatively short, but sweet. First time through will take you probably 8-14hrs and likely a restart or two, and once you know where everything is you can rip through it in about an hour or less if you don't read anything and skip all the cut scenes.  (But why do that? The cut scenes and colorful descriptions are awesome!) I recommend you start on easy mode and work your way up to hard to get more replay value from the added layers for the puzzles. Its a tough game that will give your brain a work out instead of your twitch gaming reflexes and its soooooo nice to play something different than another generic shooter.

I always remembered that haunting tune when you died and seeing the reaper!\n\nAnyways, I have put a few hours into the new version... and I am still struggling as I did many years ago when I was kid. It's like a whole new experience again including the added difficulty levels! I am playing on the hardest difficulty to get the most out of the game.

The art is beautiful, the music is great, and the vamped and new puzzles offer a great experience even for those who have beaten the original game.\n\nMy rating is 10/10! Good job Team.

If you like classic dungeon crawl that makes you think rather then just hit stuff with a big stick here you go this one is well worth it.","August 21, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You start off with just a nudge out the door, a torch and a dirk and are charged with the quest of vanquishing evil in the living castle of Shadowgate.\n\nThe game is loaded with puzzles, traps, and head-scratching moments depending on your chosen difficulty.  Having said that, I distinctly remember the NES version being far easier.  Perhaps the hardest difficulty wasn't the best idea...\n\nThe menu options are pretty much the same as they were, but the full-screen approach to the UI is a nice change away from the classic version.  You get to see far more of the environment and the amount of detail that went into the hand-painted imagery.\n\nAs I delve further and further into the game, I find some of the puzzles famliar but often with new twists (also thanks to the difficulty).  It's tough, at times, and potentiallly frustrating as all good puzzle games should be.\n\nThe music is atmospheric and adaptive, laced with familiar nostalgic themes from the classic. The artwork is nice and crisp and the added storyline so far makes it far more immersive than its original form.\n\nFor exta nostalgia, they have options to utilize some of the classic NES features such as the music and room transitions.\n\nI would recommend it to fans of the original and fans of point-and-click adventures (like Myst and its ilk).  Beyond that, if you don't like this genre of game, Shadowgate doesn't really offer anything outside of what's safely within the niche of the genre.","August 21, 2014","true","8.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

With how much you end up moving around and trying different things, the inventory system is very slow and moving from point A to point B means a black load time and 2 clicks for each room in between. Small things, but it makes playing the game feel very tedious to me as you're just repeating the same few things and waiting to simply move about.\n\nThe story and art seem pretty good, though, so if you're into this type of game and don't mind the poor UI, you can probably safely buy this and have a good time.","October 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm actually so glad they re-made it and if you can appreciate this game for what it is, you should be able to appreciate what Kemco had to work with back in 1987 as a point and click Adventure game! The game now has a more in-depth storyline, tricky puzzles and animations that were once still pixelated images of rooms in the Castle Shadowgate. If you enjoy point and click puzzle game apps on your smart phone, you'll definitely enjoy this game. If you are indeed new to this game, stop reading right here and ignore my critique of the pros and cons of the game else you'll forever curse yourself with many spoilers! I don't mean to spoil this game too much, but I'd like to share my concerns and thoughts with the community that have been waiting for this game to be re-made for so very long.\n\n**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nIf you are already familiar with the 1987 Kemco Shadowgate realm, continue reading this scroll as it will disappear once you finished reading it! You won't learn any new spells, but you may either want to agree or disagree with some of the points I have to make about the re-make of the already awesome Shadowgate game by Kemco.\n\nNow First off, I've got to say, I was a little disaappointed with some of the many things they left out of the game. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the Classic game and I pay alot of attention to detail. So much, in fact, that I fashioned an entire map on Minecraft of a Shadowgate Replica with working traps and exact(: as much as Minecraft can provide) room structure. It took me a HELL of a long time to make. Now on to the pros and cons.\n\nThe Pros: (Simple and Sweet)\n-Great Artwork and Animation (Beautiful done)\n-Interesting use of Puzzles and New ones added (Alot the same as the classic but some new ones that boggled my mind)\n-Beautiful Story telling (Got more out of the story than just being placed in a world where I have to kill a warlock lord)\n-Improved versions of Songs used in the original (Feelings of Nostalgia once I played)\n-Great new tip system (helped me out alot in situations compared to the original)\n\nThe Cons: (Now I know it's not the same game but I was expecting certain similarities and some were frustrating because it didn't make sense, but others are minor)\n-Not all the rooms were re-worked (we're missing a few rooms from the original which were key to storyline)\n-Enemies were placed in different locations (as well as some being left out or changed, it was exciting but also, I was expecting sharks instead of an octopus/squid. Also, the Goblin had to be punched instead of hit with a rock and slingshot)\n-Alot of the story was changed (such as the Behemoth being attacked would result in death, the warlock lord being attacked would also result in death. I would like someone to explain to me, why the Elemental Spirits are "Evil" according to the hint given? Doesn't make much sense... Would have been alright if you used the staff of ages on the warlock Lord instead.\n-Some music was left out (There were plenty of GREAT tracks in the classic Shadowgate, almost one for each room. Some of the rooms had the same track of the first room playing. I just think they should have kept the music of each room after re-working it, I bought the DLC with the soundtrack and I only admired one song which is the end credits due to it going through every track Shadowgate had in a guitar rock style. Other than that, the rest of the music is the same style, slow and creepy. Still good but I think they really could have done so many more orchestrations and I'm not sure what their reason is for not making more for the game.\n\nSo there, that's my thoughts on such a great game! Most of my cons were more towards a critical point of view but it still should not deter anyone (new or veteran) from buying and playing this game. Regardless of the Cons I give it a 5/5 for being re-worked and bringing this overly critical guy some Nostalgia. I beat the game in normal mode, I'm going to try the harder modes to see if maybe i missed something. I'll check back and possibly re-tract some of my Cons in the future. Enjoy this game!!! :)","July 3, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Here comes the breakdown:\n\nGraphics: Not too bad at all, but any time there is an intense animation on my screen, I get a very noticable framerate drop in the animation itself. The good looking scenery is actually a little bit of a hindrance, because the environment doesn't offer a lot of context clues on items to be picked up or alternate rooms to go into. Everything blends together a little too well.\n\nSound: AMAZING. Orchestral arrangements of the classic music, decent sound effects.\n\nControls: The UI is clunky beyond belief. SCUMM worked back in the day, but In the modern era, not so much. Not tweaking the interface (and actually making it worse at times with what changes were made) for the sake of nostalgia is a bad design choice. The inventory system is horrible. Click command. Open inventory. Click on item. Close inventory. Click on environment.\n\nGameplay: I  remember the old NES version well enough to remember most of the puzzles, but when the devs added in their new content, everything falls apart. They provide little to no context as to what you need to do, and the in-game hint system is a joke. They also put in a "banshee curse" in the beginning section which will eventually kill you, and if you take too long getting through the game and can't complete it in time, you will have to start over from the very beginning. These two elements together ruin it for me.\n\nA good adventure game should make you have an "Ah-HA!" moment when you get to the next section, not cause you to punch a hole through your monitor out of frustration when you hit the next barrier of progression.\n\nOverall score: 5/10","October 23, 2014","false","1.6"," 25 of 50 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","25","50","0","2"

And of course, that iconic unpassable slime when you open the incorrect coffin.\n\nThen much things that does not belong to shadowgate was added, for example those statues you can use the invokain spell on, and the sphere that is aquired by putting the white gem into the slot (in the old gameboy version) is changed in a heavy way that requires it to be "charged" with different elementals.\n\nSo basically:\nIf you never played the original classic Shadowgate, then this game can be seen as a new adventure game.\nIf you however played the original classic Shadowgate, you will be very disappointed by this game.","April 13","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I've played plenty of point-and-click adventure games in the past and, with few exceptions, you're never really in any danger at all.\n\nThe basic setup is that you are a guy named Jair and you are the Seed of Prophecy, you're contacted by a mage named Lakmir who tells you to go to a castle called Shadowgate armed with only a torch, a dirk, and courage and defeat the evil Warlock Lord. It's not the most original premise in the world but it's a remake of a game that came out in the 80s, so I'll forgive the lack of originality.\nAs Lord Jair, your job is to navigate through the castle, room by room, grabbing items and stuffing them into your satchel  You explore the castle by using various menu commands: look, hit, use, eat, etc. At first I found it a bit clunky, having to "use" myself (or "hit") when pulling a lever when other games would just let me use the lever by clicking on it, but I think the clunky interface is part of the charm. While you're exploring, you need to keep an eye on your torch and keep picking up new ones that you come across. If your torch burns out, well, let's just say the game warns you that bad things happen....\n\nBesides exploring, the other thing you'll do in Shadowgate is die a lot. Taking the wrong item, using the wrong item, not wearing certain equipment (via using them on your portrait), and a myriad other things can prove fatal. There's even an achievement for uncovering all the hidden ways that you can die in the game. The funny thing is that as frustrating as dying is, in Shadowgate it's actually fun provided you save often. I found the autosave feature saved pretty frequently but I always saved as soon as I entered a room, just in case.\n\nGraphically, Shadowgate mostly has static pictures and some animations, but I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever played a prettier adventure game. The artwork could have come straight out of a D&D manual. Shadowgate definitely has the look and feel of an RPG but it's an adventure game, through and through. The music is also great. The main theme is my favourite but the tense track that plays when your torch is running low had me frantically scrambling to light a new one every time, even though I knew I had plenty of them.\n\nOne aspect of adventure games that I often have trouble with is the puzzles, particularly puzzles that require something I call Adventure Game Logic, that is, puzzle solutions that involve combining items in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Shadowgate takes a subtle approach to puzzles, dropping hints here and there and letting the player figure things out on their own. If you get stuck, you can always ask Yorick the skull for help. Since this was my first time playing Shadowgate, I decided to play on Apprentice (the lowest difficulty setting) and oftentimes Yorick would pretty much tell me the answer to a puzzle. However, sometimes he seemed to be jumping the gun a bit, like when he told me I needed to cross a certain bridge when I actually had to do a few more things to get the means to get across. Other times I was simply stuck with a bunch of items and no idea where to go next. This is one of those games that requires a ton of trial and error (or a walkthrough at the ready) which is compounded by the fact that the inventory is very disorganized. I lost track of how many times I remembered a passage in a book that was hinting about the puzzle I was working on and then not being able to find it in the archives. At times it seemed as if some information that would have been useful in other difficulties (the game closes off certain areas and puzzles are much easier on Apprentice, giving you some incentive to play again on harder difficulty levels) was just a bit confusing.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games and you're willing to put up with a lot of trial and error (and dying a lot). I wouldn't recommend Shadowgate as someone's first experience with the genre but it is an interesting look at a piece of adventure gaming history. I will definitely be going back and playing it again on a harder difficulty level and I can't wait to see if they come out with more games in this series.","August 26, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Used to LucasArts' philosophy of "try everything", the harsh punishment of "death for trying everything" of the original Shadowgate did not quite click with me. However, the classic sword & sworcery style of the game did fascinate me a fair bit as a child.\n\nNow, with a remake you get the chance to take out some of the more annoying features of a game and maybe make it more enjoyable. Originally, that wasn't what had happened in Shadowgate 2014. However, the guys behind this have been improving the game to a point where, despite being still downright archaic gameplay-wise, the game has now finally been tweaked enough so that one can slowly slip into the world of Shadowgate and learn it's (cruel and unforgiving) ways.\n\nFrom what I can tell there is no more need to "rush" through the game due to limited torch-time and Yorrick, your helpful skull-sidekick actually explains what is going on and what might be a smart idea to look for / try out next. At it's core it is pretty much still a game from the late 80ies, but the new "normal mode" helps you ease your way in and get a vaque idea of what you got to do in the first place. For all you veterans out there, it is still as brutal and unforgiving as it used to be - basically offering the ultimate package for anybody that is kinda interested as well as people who know exactly what they are getting themselves into.\n\nShadowgate 2014 offers a few changes (autosave before you die, dramatic music before the torch goes out) and in its current version actually irons out some of the problems I had earlier with items that I sometimes didn't even recognize or simply missed on the much more busy backgrounds. I still think the current UI could be further improved - it is still kind of clunky and relies too much on clicking everything. You see, back then you had all the info on one screen, in this version you gotta switch to submenus to check on your items or select your spells and the map is in a separate screen altogether. (Still) forcing me to click a lot MORE than ever before - I guess that is the tablet/smartphone legacy showing.\n\nUltimately, there is still a lot of trial and error or plain luck required to stumble upon the right rooms or items. But at least it is a lot clearer what the game wants you to look out for now - and seeing all hotspots helps a lot in figuring stuff out. Though, back then I had more patience for this kind of thing (and a lot less games), these days I really gotta be in that "old man gaming"-mood. The excellent music does a great job of helping with the mood-thing but this rough and unfinished concept art look the game got going that doesn't exactly work for me. It's not particularly ugly, but I prefer my 80ies high fantasy in a more refined style.\n\nSecretly, I was hoping ZOJOI would somehow manage to turn Shadowgate into one of those fantastic Legend Entertainment titles (Death Gate and Shannara, go look 'em up if you don't know 'em - they are AWESOME!) but at the core Shadowgate is just Shadowgate. An acquired taste for sure - but at least not as harshly punishing and unforgiving as it used to be (unless you want exactly that).\n\nIf you loved the original, I don't see any reason not to get this. However, if you didn't like it or never heard of the game before now recent changes make it enjoyable enough to ease your way into the world of Shadowgate. Which I really appreciate. One thing you need to remember though: it wants (you) to party like it's 1987 and that might just be too oldschool in 2014.","August 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovehammer/recommended/294440/","lovehammer","DORAMATIC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovehammer/","314 products in account","I did not enjoy the adventure/puzzle aspect of the game I just did not find it interesting or fun, it's not as hard as it is obtuse its more about exploration than anything else. I didn't like that there is just a ton of going back and forth and the game has 100+ rooms if you think about it the game is just a corridor of rooms you go up and down over and over. Then with the pick-ups the vast majority of them do nothing and are just there for flavor. Surprisingly there are not a lot of items needed to beat the game. I suppose the difficulty is primarily based on your time limit more than puzzles but I find that just makes the game more annoying because then you have to restart completely if you run out of time.\n\nWhat I do consider good about this game is that they built a world because there is just so much stuff that has nothing to do with the solution there are even side-quests and many things that you will not see if you only stick to the path. There is still a problem with that though because its a time limited game I don't feel that the exploration aspect really fits though I do applaud the fact that it is there.\n\nThe extra difficulties are nice as well, especially since they made the puzzles different, so playing on higher difficulties changes the game slightly. Unfortunately I don't find the lower difficulties to be necessary. They are too easy and master difficulty is not any harder just "longer" by a few steps here and there. I think there's a stigma that this game is super hard and they tried to reinforce this with the difficulty levels but starting at anything below master is really just a waste of time.\n\nIn closing I also want to say I was a bit disappointed in that there were not as many deaths as I thought there would be because I thought that was a big part of the game. I might have fallen from a few things or gotten shanked by some goblins but nothing I didn't see coming. From what I understand most of the deaths, or at least the good ones, you have to actually try to find. If you stick to solving the game though you will not die very often or at all which is the opposite of what I was expecting.","January 5, 2015","false","10.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Using items together and solving puzzles are at the core of the gameplay, and help to make this a very challenging, yet rewarding game. Think of this as Dark Souls, but in point-and-click form.

Not only does this game still have that timer, but worse, they enforce a mandatory curse that will end your game every time unless you can solve it. I don't know what they were thinking, but it was not an intelligent design decision.\n\nLet me tell you something, when your biggest selling point is the nostalgia your game generates, the last thing you want to do is change the game so much it is no longer recognizable.\n\nThis isn't Shadowgate and frankly I am offended by what the developers did here. They ruined this game. I hope they NEVER get around to working on any of the other classic titles or they'll most likely just ruin that as well.","January 13, 2015","false","6.1"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"

A perfect example of how puzzle/adventure games SHOULD NOT be done. In too many locations it is impossible to think about the right thing to do, and it results clicking every pixel on the screen, trying every item and spell in your inventory combined with several "actions" and "thyself" resulting in dozens of gruesome combinations that you have to try. (I played on the hardest difficulty)\n\nAfter all this I have to say that there are two good things that worth mentioning about this game - visuals and the music.\n\nIn conclusion I wouldn't recommend it, not for this price at least.","August 27, 2014","false","7.4"," 8 of 44 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","8","44","0","7"

I didn't buy the game expecting a total speed run, but I expected the game to basically be more or less the same with a graphic overhual. Not the case, rooms are totally different, puzzles are different, and setting the game to retro graphics is nothing but a pixelated mess. Save your $20...

Those who want the achievements and use the internet, and 2.) Those dedicated to discern the different ways to proceed/fail and skewer a dragon or become shish-kabobbed and flambéed by a fire drake. This game will test your mettle in wit, not how fast you can dodge, jump, twist and/or somersault. This is pure gameplay in terms of survival using your intelligence, not your elite gaming skills al a Mario, Sonic, Master Chief or Samus Aran. This game will confuse you. Corner you. Disuade you from pushing forward. And you will die. A lot. But that is okay, because what you will also do is relish in your achievements as you figure things out for yourself and not rely on the internet for the answer. This game is not so hard you will break a keyboard, but it worth every penny for what it is priced.\n\nI am also one who grew up Atari/Nintendo and still own this title on my 8-bit NES and this game pays true homage to the way it was. The retro sound is awesome, and they even kept the retro controls although I have finally adapted to the newer controls with the right-clicking; but they are not mandatory, the controls of old are still there, just not in the NES format to a T...just slightly modified but work the same. The retro graphics look a little off to me, but then again, we are in the day of 1080p-4K and there is only so much you can do to make it look good, yet old. So props to the developer for a great job on both aspects.\n\nI still love to play the original and my Shadowgate 64 every couple of years to keep my wits about me and it never gets old. I hope they go to the newer edition from here, but if not, I cannot justify any negativity for the game this is and I am proud for how this turned out in the end.\n\nThis is a must-own title.

I enjoyed the callbacks to the classic soundtrack, and the artwork is gorgeous.  If I had one gripe, it's that you can get cursed with a time limit death that doesn't reset - when you resume your game you can die and die over again if you haven't crafted a cure.  That was annoying.  It forces you to restart and blaze through it at superfast speeds in order to have time to figure out the puzzles later.  We only really heed one time limit - the torches.  Adding a second is kind of a pain in the butt.\n\nStill, I recommend it for nostalgia's sake, and it really is a well made adventure with lots of humorous callbacks to the 1987 original.","September 2, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definately a challenge worth of the original.  I had to restart the game several times after getting myself in a corner where I could not proceed forward due to either taking too long or fumbling around a missing something important.  The only thing I would say against this game, and to some it's not really a con, is that SOME of the puzzles require some very creative thinking.  Either there aren't any hints to what you are trying to do or they are very obscure, that sometimes includes Yorrick.

I'm also not a veteran of point-and-click adventure games. I gave this game a shot because I enjoyed Shadowgate 64 and I'm a sucker for the great artwork of Shadowgate.\n\nWhat makes Shadowgate feel unique from the few adventure games I've played is the persistent threat of time. You become cursed very early in the game. If uncured, this blight will kill you after a certain number of actions. At first I felt that this discouraged exploration. Indeed it does, but it fits perfectly with the tone of this game, which is one of urgency. From a gameplay perspective, this is somewhat similar to the constant deaths faced in rogue-likes. With each death, the player gains more knowledge to progress through the game with greater efficiency, so the curse no longer becomes a threat after a few playthroughs. But even when the curse is cured, there is always the threat of darkness in the form of your torch. Each turn dims the torch until it is eventually snuffed, resulting in a quick death. I found that on the medium difficulty, there were plenty of torches, but there aren't an infinite supply. Thus, even when one becomes adept at the game, there is still the lingering pressure to move ever onward.\n\nThe puzzles in this game cover a range of difficulty from "modern" easy to logic-defyingly challenging. In some regard, the harder puzzles may feel like trial and error, especially if the hint is located in a scroll that you missed but cannot waste the turns to find. Perhaps in these situations, it is best to restart. There are a few situations in which it would be nearly impossible to know what item to use on what object to move forward, but a quick glance at a walkthrough can help.\n\nThe three difficulty settings and many achievements add a great degree of replayability to this game. The biggest difference between the difficulty settings is in the difficulty and the number of puzzles. I played on the medium difficulty at first, but I look forward to trying the game on the hardest difficulty to experience all of the puzzles the game has to offer. The achievements also encourage the player to try different play styles, such as being extremely efficient or avoiding killing any goblins. Of course, it helps that the sound, music, and graphics are all good enough to keep the player interested through multiple playthroughs.\n\nAfter completing the game, I went back and read reviews of the original Shadowgate ports, especially the NES version. Most of the reviews were lukewarm at best and I'm not sure why. Shadowgate has few glaring weaknesses compared to other adventure games (it seems all adventure games have a few puzzles that require strange logic). I'm also seeing mostly lukewarm professional reviews of this remake. My opinion is that anyone interested in a challenging puzzle game with great graphics, music, and lore ought to give Shadowgate a try.","August 24, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I own copies of the NES original, n64 version, and TurboGrafx CD version (Beyond Shadowgate).   So, being a fan I must had to buy the special edition with the OST. Now, I have not played the remake much as of yet...but playing through the first screens It became quite obvious that it was done with care and homage to the original versions. The new art is very nicely done and sets the tone. The game is true to the original and has familiar settings and puzzles.  I really enjoyed how you have the ability to change things to back to retro.  I personally enjoy turning on the retro music, screen transitions, and text.  Fantastic remake.  If you enjoyed the originals, do yourself a favor and play this.  Well worth it.\n\nA side note about the sound track:\nThe Vanstratho metal mix is absolutely kick ♥♥♥. All the original NES music metalified. I think I loved it the most when I first heard the death music chime in at 3 min 35 sec of the song and then go from acoustic to distortion until the song ended.","November 22, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems quite long, and it is very overwhelming, but since I enjoyed it so much so far and intend to go on until the end, I thought making it some justice by saying how good it is.\n- very old school: it's a remake of a 87 classic reminding me of my journeys on Atari ST)\n- very rich: items inventory is huge, gameplay is not only point n click based, but the more complex style "point n choose your action", like take open look use etc.\n- pretty: although I say this criteria in an objective way, because personally I thought it looks a bit too amateurish, sometimes awkward, and much too much "photoshop layer A photoshop layer B photoshop layer C"... but the work on it is quite honorable, whether you personally like it or not (don't get me wrong, I do not particularly like it, but it is not unpleasant to look at in gaming terms- aesthetically speaking now that's another story\n- the story seems simple and traditional so far, nor surprising nor boring, but I suppose that's the remake thing\n- many places to go, many things to click, many items to pick and use, many spells to try out...\n- the music is fine, nothing spectacular\n\nI can not remember how much I paid for it, and one could argue it looks a bit like these casual games on tablets, but all in all, I think at a reasonable fee this game is really worth it.

I was only 4 years old at the time, playing it with my dad, but I remember it quite vividly.  My dad and I had a great time with all of the MacVenture games when I was a kid, and I was very excited when I heard about the remake more than 25 years later.\n\nThe new version does not disappoint.   It has everything that was fun about the old ones, with much nicer graphics(though still definitely not AAA level, they are quite charming in their own way)  and new puzzles.  While it definitely pays homage to its predecessor this is not just a nostalgia trip; This is a very solid adventure game that stands on its own merit.  I would recommend it to any fans of the point and click genre, irrespective of age or whether you've played the old versions.\n\nOne nice thing about this game compared to many other point and click games is that there are four distinct difficulty levels that  make major changes to what puzzles you will face.  This option makes the game accessible for novice/casual player while still providing a challenge for the most hardcore players.  Also, if you start on one of the lower difficulty levels, you can play again on a harder level and its almost like a whole new game, with all sorts of new items and puzzles.\n\nIf you are not into point and click adventures you probably won't be into this, but if you do like this kind of game this is definitely one of the better ones.","May 30, 2015","true","48.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only imagine the puzzles getting harder and sometimes very cryptic, but its a very enjoyable game. I got it on sale for $3, but I would definitely say the normal price is still well worth buying this. I recommend you at least check this game out and give it a chance because it is very fun.","July 6, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was only 4 years old at the time, playing it with my dad, but I remember it quite vividly.  My dad and I had a great time with all of the MacVenture games when I was a kid, and I was very excited when I heard about the remake more than 25 years later.\n\nThe new version does not disappoint.   It has everything that was fun about the old ones, with much nicer graphics(though still definitely not AAA level, they are quite charming in their own way)  and new puzzles.  While it definitely pays homage to its predecessor this is not just a nostalgia trip; This is a very solid adventure game that stands on its own merit.  I would recommend it to any fans of the point and click genre, irrespective of age or whether you've played the old versions.\n\nOne nice thing about this game compared to many other point and click games is that there are four distinct difficulty levels that  make major changes to what puzzles you will face.  This option makes the game accessible for novice/casual player while still providing a challenge for the most hardcore players.  Also, if you start on one of the lower difficulty levels, you can play again on a harder level and its almost like a whole new game, with all sorts of new items and puzzles.\n\nIf you are not into point and click adventures you probably won't be into this, but if you do like this kind of game this is definitely one of the better ones.","May 30, 2015","true","48.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK...if you like that sort of thing. For me, this was a bit of a nostalgic jaunt.\n\nThis is a nice little remake of the original Shadowgate mystery/puzzle game and probably would be a good game for those who miss the Myst style of gaming experience as this game requires a logic, all too often all its own, to solve the numerous puzzles of which this game is comprised. The graphics consist of mostly still or partially animated pictures which you click on with a mouse pointer while using different menu options to modify the effect of your clicks (you can also use hotkeys on the keyboard). Unlike the first iteration of Shadowgate the creators of this game have attempted to make the game feel less arbitrary and frustrating. The inclusion of multiple difficulty levels helps decrease frustration and increase replayability also. Unfortunately, this game has only 2 possible endings. 1) You die somehow and 2) You defeat the dread warlock lord and live unhappily ever after (due to the presence of an advertisement for a sequel).\n\n+Good, relatively logical puzzles (so far as this type of game is concerned).\n+Adequate controls for such a point-and-click style of game.\n+Adequate writing.\n+Will heavily remind you of the original without being as frustrating as the original.\n+Multiple difficulty levels.\n+No bugs.\n\n+/-Mediocre sound with adequate voice acting.\n\n-Not a great sense of mystery for such a puzzle type game.\n-Mediocre (at best) graphics in a odd storyboard/storybook style.\n-Fairly sedate music which can become repetitive over time.\n-The ending is severely hampered by an advertisement for a sequel.\n-Fairly generic story.\n-Some obtuse puzzles may require you to read a game walkthrough to figure them out.","December 27, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At a certain point, I just had no idea what I was supposed to be doing or where I can go to possibly make progress. If you're up for a challenging game, then look no further. I even played it on the easiest, wussy setting. Essentially this is a first-person point & click adventure game set in a dark fantasy world. The story is pretty generic.The animation in the game is limited and it's mainly static pictures that move within the screen. The art style is all hand painted pictures and they look decent. The game took me around five hours to finish, but keep in mind I cheated my way through a lot of it.

The fact that i can (and do) switch to the NES-style music instead of the beautiful orchestral version is a gigantic plus. The game isn't simply a remake of the classic, it adds new dimensions to the game and gameplay. The puzzles are just as well crafted, and require you to fumble about a bit before the lightbulb goes off and you are left beating your head on your desk for not noticing the answer sooner. The added content from DLC is also a nice touch, and seamless integrates into the world. If you loved the NES original, or if you hate yourself and feel you need to be punished for some crime you were never caught for, get this game immediatly.","December 18, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
