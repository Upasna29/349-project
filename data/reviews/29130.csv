Tetris-like blocks contain bits of a musical score and are colored according to what instrument you'll hear when clicked upon. Fit them all together in the correct way to play famous songs. Out of all of them, there were only two I didn't know by heart. But even if you don't recognize a single one, a bar on the bottom of the screen will play the whole tune for you, as many times as you like. The catch is, you'll only hear each score from ONE instrument. That instrument normally plays the main tune so it's usually not too difficult to figure out what order those blocks go in. But then you have to place all the other instruments and make sure the blocks fit together correctly. For those who love both puzzles and music, Musaic Box is a real gem. My only gripe is that the game isn't long enough. I could have happily played for many more hours.","January 5","true","3.2"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","3"

You wander through mansion rooms, looking for note sheet parts, completing music mosaics when you have gathered enough of the former and learn some history behind the music pieces. Plus, like myself, you might get to know names of some melodies, which you knew since childhood, but didn't know where they come from.\nPlay a room per day after work/uni/school, and it will provide just a bit of comfort and relaxation you may need.","January 19, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I say mostly because not only did you have to sus out which notes go where from listening to the preview, but you have to think logically about how to make the Tetris style blocks fit into the outline you are given and them still be in the right order.\n\nThe music is fun, it takes classic and well known songs and adds instruments into the background. Some sound really odd, seeing as you end up with something like Mozart with drums and a little tambourine going off in the background, but it‚Äôs still fun and inventive.\n\nThe game is a little short, but it‚Äôs unique and I like the more unique kind of puzzle games.\n\nIf you enjoy music (especially classical) or puzzle games in general, I think this one is a good way to kill a few hours. It took me 8 hours to complete it entirely, but admittedly I did get stuck a few times and wondered away from my PC a few times. A normal human being probably wouldn‚Äôt take as long.\n\nAll in all, I like it. It‚Äôs not the best puzzle game I have ever played, but it‚Äôs not the worst either. Not by a long shot.\n\n\nTL;DR : A fun puzzle game based around music. Mostly classical stuff, with a modern twist of instruments added into the back for depth. It‚Äôs a little short, but worth a try in my opinion.\n","December 30, 2015","true","8.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The goal is to solve a series of musical puzzles, but to do so you have to find pieces first.  That first part seems like a standard "find the hidden object" kind of game to me (and it will give hints automatically over time, so you shouldn't get too stuck), so it's the second part that's interesting.  In the musical puzzles, you have to arrange a series of blocks in a grid so that the grid is completely filled and the blocks allow the given piece of music to be played properly (in the correct order).  Most puzzles offer some guidance by providing the main melody for you to listen to, and there's a hint system you can use if needed that will tell you which blocks are incorrectly placed in a full grid.  It may be a little hard to explain in words, but I think it's easy enough to learn and fun to play, so if you like these sorts of games, this one is worth a try.","September 15, 2013","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finding enough objects takes you to a puzzle screen where you arrange blocks of different shapes that have parts of the melody, harmony, or rhythm on them, so that they form the whole song when played beginning to end. This game only uses classical, public domain songs, but the tracks are definitely pleasant to listen to if you can enjoy orchestral music (with a few exceptions, most of which are at the start).\n\nThe puzzle quality is decent. Most puzzles aren't hard. Some are a little tricky, but the hard ones are only tough because the harmony sections will repeat a few times and you won't have enough info to know which is which. That said, there's a hint button that will reveal misplaced blocks, which makes that a bit easier.\n\nI finished it 100% in 2.5 hours.

I expected some sort of old school point and click adventure, but got a nice music/rhythm puzzle game instead, with point and click elements. The goal is to search rooms for parts of music sheets and combine these together to create a full sheet. You then have to recreate the music by forming a puzzle. You do this with several blocks, each with their own instrument(s). The example is listed in the lower center so you continually have to listen to the example and try and fit the puzzle together. It starts off easy but gets more difficult in a matter of minutes. It's a nice challenge, and I enjoyed it very much, because I'm an avid music listener. It's, so far, all classical music though, but most of them are well known.\nEven though the music fits the style, it would've been nice if there was a game around (sequel maybe, someday ?) with more modern music or where you could load your own music.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","December 24, 2011","true","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This game requires the ability to hear tone/pitch.\n\nWhat an incredible treat - a fun and clever puzzle game that teaches and enlightens the gamer about music. I can't recommend this game enough. A good price at $4, a steal for anything less. I would recommend this for any age of gamer.\n\nPros: Intuitive interface, easily learned. Finding the pieces to begin a puzzle is easy as clicking around the screen. Solving the puzzles is a little more challenging and requires an ear for audio. A good hint function is available during puzzles that gives you clues so you can figure out where you're wrong.\n\nCons: The hint function is only for the phase where you solve a puzzle. It doesn't help your find the puzzle pieces in a room. Short game play - it took me all of two hours to complete all the puzzles and there is no replayability.","December 28, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
