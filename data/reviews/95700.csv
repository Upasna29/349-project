It keeps you engaged with the story of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh with its surreal art. You "help" the doctor plod along his path to his inevitable fate and in doing so may feel as if you are either betraying him or punishing him. That depends on your politics.\n\nIf you're an art and history fan, I'd give it a play.","November 26, 2013","true","0.2"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","0"

I like history and I love all animals, and I really love games where you get to play as animals. I first got interested in it when I saw the art, which is this really cool style that looks kind of like a scrap book. I was further interested when I saw that you get to play as a cat. It took me 20 minutes to play through it because there aren't any real directions and a couple of the rooms were really confusing for me, in regards to what you had to do to progress. In order to get further into the brief history lesson, you have to interact with the environment in such a way that leads the human to fall out of the room you're in and into the next room. The music in the game, paired with the art and photos, gives it a great atmosphere. I am definitely having my history buff friend play this, just because it was an interesting game. I got to have fun while learning something new. Now if only all history classes were taught like this, I think more kids might pay attention.\n\nDid I mention Nine Inch Nails is on the soundtrack? Because Nine Inch Nails is on the Sondtrack.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that the mechanics of the game remind me of The Bridge, so if you played and liked The Bridge, you'll probably enjoy this game.","October 19, 2014","true","0.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Half edutainment, half bizarre art project, it's an entirely unique and wonderfully creative 15 minute fall down an abstract rabbit hole, reinforced with the snippets of real world events that somehow only make it all the more unusual. Personally I found it a brilliant experimental experience, though for as odd as it is I can just as easily imagine a dozen entirely different opinions about it, which perhaps says something to how weird a game it is. Thankfully I don't have to decide for you whether to give The Cat and the Coup a look, as it's entirely free and will take just a small portion of your day to complete. At the very least it's almost certainly the oddest use of a Nine Inch Nails song I've ever found, which in itself I find strangely compelling.","August 29, 2014","true","0.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I really liked it. I wasn't sure what to think when I saw the advertising and also that this was on the "Video Games as Art" article on Wikipedia (which they also included "Tempest 2000" and "Vib Ribbon"... for some reason), but needless to say I was very impressed.\n\nI really like the storybook aesthetics of the game, like you're seeing this history unfold across tapestries, old photographs, and pictures cut out of magazines. Along with this, the animations on Mossadegh and the Cat look very blocky but still well-animated, like they belong with the rest of the scattered images in the game. And the game mechanics and story are influenced by you as a little, black cat pushing around the unfortunate Mossadegh, which is incredibly symbolic.\n\nSee, throughout the game, a lot of the puzzles involve balance, almost as if saying that the Prime Minister was trying to find a balance between his people and the other countries looking to get that oil, but because of bad fortune in his path, he just happened to be a stepping stone for the U.S. to grind their feet into, and a door for the Iranian people to knock down, and move onto a better life. He's constantly falling and being messed with by the cat, which really makes you feel sorry for the poor chum. He was just trying to do what any man would do in his position, and he keeps getting sh** on.\n\nI can't think of any issues I had with the game, personally. The over-realiance on text here and there bothered me a little (but that's more of a personal gripe). Beyond that though, it uses intuitive puzzles to tell a story in a unique and intriguing manner. I can see some people throwing a fit for the game being 15 minutes, but it tells the story it aims to tell in that amount of time, and does it damn well.\n\nI'm gonna give "The Cat and the Coup" a 9/10. If you like what video games can do as an artform, and how they can effect people emotionally in their own unique manner, this game is definitely the game for you.","February 15","true","0.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Not as a game you play to pass the time, but as a game you play to learn something.\nThe game is simplistic, the puzzles are simple, you don't spend too much time on it, it's not intended to be a challenge in and of itself, it's intended to provide a light challenge so you're motivated in going forward.\nThis is the sort of "project game" universities should discuss, even if only for one or two meetings. There is value in the simple story-telling which summarizes Iran's coup between 1950-1965. This is interdisciplinarity, it provides a brief history lesson in 10-odd minutes, opening up room for further discussion on the subject.\nIf you're someone interestedi in education as a whole, this game is a prime example of how many subjects we can place inside one simple game.\n\nThis list is what I compiled by thinking about education and the game while writing this review, it's not a well-thought and not even near well-developed, but it is a starting point of possible topics to discuss with students, friends, family, dealer, bro you met at the party last night, whoever you want to:\n- History (clearly);\n- Art - too broad and too much to even try to specify, so I'll leave it at that (there are many artistic examples worth noticing);\n- Game development;\n- Learning processes.\n\nAnd these are topics that would require further development, but also very much possible to discuss:\n- Geopolitics;\n- Language teaching/learning (my area);\n- Programming/Coding;\n- Other coups in the world (with iran being a unique case);\n- Law studies/processes (also my area);\n- I'm absolutely sure you can think of much, much more, especially if you're a professor.\n\nIt is a very short game, quite fun and interesting, I have to admit I felt really bad when I finished it, that empathy you feel for people/situations that you could not change, but you know they could have gone completely differently if not for the interest of one involved party. It's an existential dread, but one of those that are good for anyone interested in politics, that one that brings out a sort of rush that makes you act, that takes you out of the comfort zone in some way.\n\nI will finish this by saying this is a very good game, and being free, there's no real reason not to play it. Just do it when you're actually free for 20 minutes and your head is quite clear, not stressed out, and you'll enjoy it.\n\nBut what I really want to say is this: games like this are awesome for a brief reflection and introduction to topics, I urge people (especially from universities) to try and develop more games like this one, because, as I listed before, you can express creativity and approach countless topics through this. This is an awesome example of what a few people can achieve with some weeks to a few months of work, if you join funded projects from people at universities, you can assemble tons of creative people giving insight, and develop far greater projects that reach even broader scopes.","May 11","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A perusal of the Wikipedia page regarding the coup might be a good idea before playing.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a bit like walking through a picture book, with a few simple environmental puzzles to solve along the way. The game is very short (I finished it in 15 minutes without rushing) and boasts a unique art style: a mash-up of Persian motifs and Western surrealism, with a few agitprop touches along the way. I've never seen anything like it in a game before.\n\nIs it fun to play? I guess so. Given how short it is, it definitely doesn't outstay its welcome. And seeing as it's free-to-play, there's no risk of suffering buyer's remorse. Unless you have a pathological aversion to anything that could even remotely be construed as an "art" game, I would recommend giving it a whirl.\n\nOn a personal level, I was very struck by the opening image of Mossadegh as an old man, lying on his deathbed more than a decade after his overthrow. A sound recording of one of Mossadegh's speeches (announcing the nationalization of Iran's oil industry -- an act that galvanized the West to plot his downfall) also struck a nerve. Before playing this game, I was already familiar with the history of the coup and its awful aftermath (the reign of the Shah and his secret police), but I had never given much thought to Mossadegh the  man  before. It was also the first time I had ever heard his voice, despite having read much about him. In other words,  The Cat and the Coup  not only succeeds in bringing to life an essential piece of 20th-century history, but it also humanizes the individual at the center of that story. In so doing, it conveys the sadness and cynicism of the coup in a visceral and memorable way.","April 10","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then, it reverses, and you see the events play out in the proper order in context, with the disguised elements revealed for what they really are.\n\nIt's free, so if "a 5-minute game telling the story of the rise of the Shah of Iran" sounds like it might possibly be interesting, there's no reason not to play it.","December 21, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As the Prime Minister's politically backed puss, you are responsible for making sure that the Prime Minister is dethroned through means of knocking stuff off counters, clawing certain people and whatnot. While I definitely like the concept and the graphics and the setup, I felt the complete package was a let down considering how short it was. It took me 5-10 minutes tops to beat this game, and that was only because I was trying to take my time and explore the environment. After you get past the 7 or so puzzles it gives you the conclusion and ends. While I appreciate how this was a finalist in an indie game competition, I feel that they should make this into a series of "political cat" gaming episodes. Otherwise, it's really nothing more than flash game.","February 20, 2012","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can barely put its beauty into words.\nHowever this isn't really a game, it's more of a history that you have some interactive parts in.

It's a hypnotic, almost fantastic sounding tune, but with great foreshadowing and a confident but sad mood to it. I can barely put its beauty into words.\nHowever this isn't really a game, it's more of a history that you have some interactive parts in. Nothing wrong with that, it keeps the history authentic, unlike some people who would have the cat suddenly become the prime minister.\nOverall, fantastic piece of artwork here, lovely to spend a few minutes in.","October 2, 2011","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I liked the way the story was told, and the music (some of it from Nine Inch Nails, released under a Creative Commons license) complements the artsy visuals really well.  I was actually a little surprised, given the "documentary" nature, that it didn't have some kind of interactive bibliography at the end; that's not a complaint, just an observation.\n\nAs a puzzle platformer (which, from a mind-numbingly pedantic genre classification standpoint, this is), this game is a solid 1/10.  :)  Technically, there is platforming.  Technically, there are puzzles.  Neither of the above will present more than a minor speed bump to all but the most absolutely novice gamer.  You can also see "clues" for most of the "puzzles" in the Steam video trailer.\n\nIf you've ever wondered whether you might be interested in computer-based visual novels, this is a title to check out since it's free; not to mention, you'll learn a little history along the way!\n\nIf you like this game, check out...   The 39 StepsBe aware that I'm stretching a bit on that recommendation; I really don't know anything else in the "visual novel documentary with a bit of gaming" sub-genre.

It's quite short, but doesn't need to be long to get its point across.  It is part history lesson and part surrealistic visual story, and although the game play is sparse, it's still there.  This game wasn't 'fun' in the traditional sense, but rather it was more intriguing, as well as somewhat haunting with it's bizarre imagery coupled with the sad lingering soundtrack.\n\nFor those who didn't understand the metaphors in this game, I will explain below.\nScroll down or 'read more' for spoilers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou play as the black cat, traditionally established as a symbol of misfortune, who manipulates the various items and situations in a series of rooms.  By doing so, you move Dr. Mossadegh through those different rooms as he struggles to adapt to the changes you are indirectly creating.  Note that at no time is it stated that the cat belongs to Dr. Mossadegh, but rather it is a cat that incessantly follows him around.\n\nThe rooms are a double-metaphor serving as both the various political/social occurrences at the time, and as stages of Dr. Mossadegh's life.  The cat is a metaphor for the CIA.  The cat's behavior is the covert tampering that CIA agents performed to maneuver Dr. Mossadegh into the situation where he would be removed from power.  The bulldog represents British interests who, behind closed doors, asked the Americans for undercover aid to depose Dr. Mossadegh from power.  The reasons for Britain doing this are spelled out at the end of the game in the vertical assent back through the imagery the cat initially fell downward through.  So, long story short, when you play this game, you play as the CIA covertly creating a social/political environment necessary to bring about a coup in Iran in the 1950's.\n\nWhy was the story told in reverse?  I assume that is just artistic license in story telling, but I could be wrong.","December 16, 2014","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Objectives are presented as dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to control the aircraft.\n\nBeside the campaign the game also features several multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players.","June 24, 2011","false",""," 0 of 14 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","14","0","2"

The concept is brilliant, and I applaud the idea of bringing attention to causes, plights, opinions, politics and philosophy through the gaming medium. This game is also actually a game on a technical level, as it has challenges to solve through manipulating a character, although it really just barely qualifies as a game. The animation and art is really wonderfully done, and is stylized in a way that has aristic value and restraint not usually seen in gaming. The downside is that it is boring, as a story, and that the gameplay is essentially a frustrating element designed to keep the story from being told in a rapid series of clicks. So in the end it is worth looking at the concept, as it is entirely brilliant; the content, however, is hit-and-miss, with the art as the major notable hit and most everything else a near- or far- miss.

The concept is brilliant, and I applaud the idea of bringing attention to causes, plights, opinions, politics and philosophy through the gaming medium. This game is also actually a game on a technical level, as it has challenges to solve through manipulating a character, although it really just barely qualifies as a game. The animation and art is really wonderfully done, and is stylized in a way that has aristic value and restraint not usually seen in gaming. The downside is that it is boring, as a story, and that the gameplay is essentially a frustrating element designed to keep the story from being told in a rapid series of clicks. So in the end it is worth looking at the concept, as it is entirely brilliant; the content, however, is hit-and-miss, with the art as the major notable hit and most everything else a near- or far- miss.

You didn't know exactly who he was but as you play the game you see more and more about his life. I was intrigued at the game because I was hoping it would do something more than just move a screen so I could read more text; some narration could have helped the game be more tolerable.\n\nWhy am I giving this game a "Not Recommend" someone may ask. It's because the game doesn't really offer any way to remember it. It's an educational game but doesn't present the information in any new way or in any effective way to recollect any of the information presented. I felt that reading a textbook would have been more effective and more entertaining.\n\nThe game isn't really much of a game.

You didn't know exactly who he was but as you play the game you see more and more about his life. I was intrigued at the game because I was hoping it would do something more than just move a screen so I could read more text; some narration could have helped the game be more tolerable.\n\nWhy am I giving this game a "Not Recommend" someone may ask. It's because the game doesn't really offer any way to remember it. It's an educational game but doesn't present the information in any new way or in any effective way to recollect any of the information presented. I felt that reading a textbook would have been more effective and more entertaining.\n\nThe game isn't really much of a game. It's short and could have presented the same amount of information in a one minute blurb but is convinced that you should stay around for 10 minutes and move around a cat that seemingly has no point to exist in the game.","October 16, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is brilliant, and I applaud the idea of bringing attention to causes, plights, opinions, politics and philosophy through the gaming medium. This game is also actually a game on a technical level, as it has challenges to solve through manipulating a character, although it really just barely qualifies as a game. The animation and art is really wonderfully done, and is stylized in a way that has aristic value and restraint not usually seen in gaming. The downside is that it is boring, as a story, and that the gameplay is essentially a frustrating element designed to keep the story from being told in a rapid series of clicks. So in the end it is worth looking at the concept, as it is entirely brilliant; the content, however, is hit-and-miss, with the art as the major notable hit and most everything else a near- or far- miss.

The gameplay is not exactly great.\nI don't want to spoil its content, but the game is about history and certain historical figures are depicted in a one-sided negative way. I am not saying that the assesment is necessarily wrong, because I don't know history well enough, but I would say that things are probably a bit more complicated than depicted in the game. Never the less, the actions of these people affect the world today and I suspect after playing this game, some players will want to research the topic for themselves.","January 17","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
