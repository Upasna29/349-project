Arguably two of the most memorable titles for each system were Ducktales for the NES and Castle of Illusion for the SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis. Ducktales had the edge - being more fiendishly difficult than Mickey Mouse's SEGA outing but both exuded charm and were bestsellers on either system.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=285326866\nCut forward 25+ years to the year 2013 as both popular titles re-emerged in full HD glory for a new generation of gamers and for the first time ever - debuting on the PC. I can see that the more modern gamer will probably find the gameplay on display here a bit antiquated and Castle of Illusion will possibly hold very little appeal for them (outside of the Mickey Mouse and Disney connection) but it's clear the intention here - Castle of Illusion is a love letter to the gamer that cut his/her teeth on these kind of games in the past. While Ducktales: Remasterd is a scene by scene remake (with newly implemented graphical cut-scenes), Castle of Illusion is more of a re-imagining taking the five levels of illusion Mickey must traverse in order to save his dearly beloved, Minnie Mouse, from the clutches of the evil witch Mizrabel and giving each of them a modern spin and a completely new lick of paint. Each of these worlds, like the original, are split into two relatively short levels with the third housing a boss battle for Mickey to overcome.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=285328277\nI had great fun playing this game as a child back in the early nineties so it was pure nostalgic delight exploring these redesigned levels that pay due homage to the levels from the old SEGA classic. While I never found the game on the Mega Drive to be particularly challenging it was certainly a fun romp for my childlike sensibilities back then and this remake of Castle of Illusion fits the bill quite nicely. Most experienced platform gamers will breeze through Castle of Illusion in a jiffy but the controls are tight (except for the swimming sections where it feels like one is trying to maneuver a tank through a mouse hole) and for the most part the game plays and looks beautiful on modern systems.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=284863991\nCastle of Illusion is a simple platformer and when put under scrutiny one can see how mechanically game development has moved along in leaps and bounds - you just have to compare this title with the recently released Rayman Legends to see that Castle of Illusion is nothing more than a nostalgic time-capsule that embraces an age when games were far more simpler and innocent without all the moral grey areas that encapsulates modern gaming today.\n\nIf you have fond memories of playing through Castle of Illusion as a child, I wouldn't hesitate to encourage you to pick it up. Chances are you will probably have families and kids of your own now so this is a great way to introduce them to the kinds of games you used to play as a kid. At $14.99 it's priced just about right for the amount of adventure time held and its a great way to spend an afternoon with an old friend from the past.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 12, 2014","true","5.5"," 88 of 101 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","88","101","0","9"

Great gameplay and music, levels and bosses reworked enough to keep it fresh, and beautiful, fluid, cartoon-like graphics.\n\nThere are, however, issues with this game being a sloppy port stuck at 720p/30fps. Luckily the resolution and framerate have been fixed/hacked by the community. It's also been updated a couple times since I last played, so the issues might have been fixed by now. Regardless, the PC Gaming Wiki page should have any info you need to get it running right and it looks incredible at 1080p/60fps.

Instead of the delightfully imaginative works of their glory years, we've been "treated" to an abundance of derivative shovel-ware and cash grabs, all relying on their branding and marketing instead of actual quality to make them a success. A remake of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive classic, Castle of Illusion could have very well been just another mediocre licensed game, but to my absolute surprise and delight it is anything but; a whimsical joy of a platformer that pays homage to Mickey's past, while bringing him into the modern day just as enjoyable as we remember him.\n\nOpening like the typical fairy tale it is, Mickey and Minnie are just setting out for a picnic when the witch Mizrabel spies the pair and gets jealous, swooping in and kidnapping Minnie, with the goal of using the damsel's youth and beauty to rejuvenate herself from the old hag she is. Mickey will have none of this however, and thus enters the titular Castle of Illusion to obtain the seven magic gems, cross the rainbow bridge, and get his girl back!\n\nLike the 1990 original, CoI is a basic platformer whose strength lies in its imaginative levels and environments. Each stage is unique and bustling with creativity, from a giant library full of bouncing letters and slinking bookworms, to a world made entirely out of sweets that has you swimming through jello and bouncing on cookies floating in a milkshake river. There are so many charming little touches in every location you traverse that I couldn't begin to name them all (and doubt I saw even half of them). Sega perfectly captured the happy-go-lucky mannerisms of Mickey, right down to the trademark hop in his step and chip of his voice, an attention to detail which extends to every secret area and extra path, and makes for an immensely enjoyable game. I gleefully made my way through every level never once tiring of the seemingly endless stream of fantastical places I was sent to, but alas every good thing must come to an end and CoI does so all too soon.\n\nFor all its wonder and the many things it gets so very right, CoI is over in a heartbeat (around 2-3 hours to be exact). This short-live adventure seems to end even more abruptly, do to how easy it is to jump from one level to the next and how quickly and seamlessly they flow together. In a sense it's about as long as the average animated movie (which almost seems intentional, opening and ending with the camera panning out to a theater), but for a $15 game it had me wanting more.\n\nI say that however with the caveat of wanting more because I loved my brief time with Mickey so much. Castle of Illusion is a pleasure and has given me hope that Disney is still capable of creating something with as much heart and wonder as what made them a household name in the first place. If Mickey Mouse has ever meant anything to you, you owe it to yourself to play this lively tribute that does as much for giving the icon a proper video game outing, as it does a starting point for what could (and hopefully does) come out in the near future. It's pure childish fun that capitalizes on its goal of being a lighthearted game that almost anyone can enjoy, recapturing the magic of yesteryear for the new and old generation alike.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 8, 2014","true","2.0"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","56","62","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/recommended/227600/","chairmankao","chairmankao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/","1195 products in account","Let me start by saying that the old school Castle of Illusion on Genesis / Mega Drive remains one of my favorite platformers today.\n\nLet me also say that I was hugely, hugely, hugely disappoint by DuckTales Remastered, which I found boring and lazily done.\n\nSo I went into this with low expectations ... I mean, how do you live up to a classic? Not sure it's possible, but I was extremely please with the updated Castle of Illusion on Steam. Great game. It does an excellent job taking the source material as inspiration and trying to update it without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over it.\n\nStoryline\nSome witch kidnaps Minnie while she and Mickey are having a picnic. Typical hero save damsel in distress. It works. My only minor complaint is that the intro kind of dragged. The story is so generic that it really seemed a waste of time to draw it out.\n\nGraphics\nWow. The developers did a great job with this. Whereas with DuckTales Remastered, where the characters looked great but everything else looked like crap ... I was dazzled by Castle of Illusion at ever step. In particular, the second level with the toys ... everything was beautiful.\n\nGameplay\nHere's where I had one of those ooh ahh moments. The old Castle of Illusion is purely a side scrolling platformer, and for the most part, so is the update. However, the developers cleverly integrated some 3D parts into the level design. Not too much. I'd compare it with a great movie director using just enough 3D elements without going overboard.\n\nLevel design\nGood variety. There's swimming, jumping, swinging, running-to-avoid. And again, all levels are beautiful. That said, the best levels in my opinion are the first two. After that, it's okay, but not as great as the first two levels.\n\nCollectibles\nIn each level you can pick up a card, model and / or chili. And these get you concept art, statutes and costumes (which you can switch into by jumping into the mirror on the third floor). I didn't bother much with completion. I'm not a collectibles or achievements ♥♥♥♥♥. But playing through once normally, I got one outfit and one statute.\n\nPlaytime\nI got through this in four hours, without chasing collectibles and achievements. It was short and sweet, which is how platformers should be. The unskippable credits were annoying, especially as it's just names scrolling on a black screen, but I don't care too much about these things.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10. Probably loses a point or two for level design not being consistently great throughout.","May 25, 2014","true","5.0"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"

Yes, if you enjoy platformers and a Disney storyline. The actual story was a bit corny, but the game itself was pretty entertaining and well-made, with half a dozen semi-interesting boss-fights. The game is however only a few hours worth of gameplay (to 100% it even), so it serves as a nice game to play when you feel like playing something casual.\n\nCastle of Illusion is first and foremost a remake of the old SEGA Genesis game by the same title. The game is in essence the exact same as the original, in the sense that it features the same maps, the same boss-fights, the same enemies (mostly), but it does so in what is literally a future version of the game.\n\nBack in 1990 when the original was made, the majority of the mechanics they made use of in the remake (2013) were simply impossible to achieve, such as making use of 3D gameplay. While the 2013 remake is mostly a 2D sidescroller (staying true to the original), it does on occassion let you run freely in a 3D space, and it does so very seamlessly while entering and leaving those spaces.\n\nThe remake's art is basically based on the same art that the original had, but with a major overhaul in actual graphics and style, as in, you will find the same type of forest, the same kind of castle, the same kind of various areas throughout the remake that you found in the original, just with a modernized style (aka the remake is not a 16-bit game :p)","April 24, 2014","true","5.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","11","12","6","0"

It's a short but memorable journey through five unique worlds as Mickey tries to rescue Minne from a witch. Not quite a classic but thoroughly competent and entertaining.\n\nAs far as remakes go this is one of the better titles I've played. Instead of going for a shot by shot remake, this edition focuses on taking the setpieces of the original and re-imagining them. Bosses have more ornate patterns, there are optional areas to explore, and fans of the original will see familiar areas filled with different challenges.\n\nActually challenge probably isn't a word I can throw around when I talk about this game. This version is quite a bit easier than the original. The difficulty curve is more balanced, and doesn't have absolutely brutal enemies or force Mickey to survive long stretches while having only two or three hitpoints to work with.\n\nWhile Castle of Illusion is a short game, I actually don't mind. This is probably due to the era I grew up in but platformers with dozens upon dozens of stages tend to just wear me out. The developer behind this game took what was available in the original and stretched it out just enough. You're not going to see a bunch of stages with only slight differences or a couple gimmicks between them. The pacing is reasonable. Whenever you have an afternoon free, you can run through this game in its entirety and get the full experience.\n\nThe controls and mechanics - the life-blood of any decent platformer - are very well-done. As far as complaints go I only have one, the soundtrack. The best Castle of Illusion tunes are the arranged versions of the original. There are a couple songs exclusive to this remake but they're bland and uninteresting. An option exists to use the Genesis music in the game, which is nice although it tends to clash with the voice-work(expect to hear Mickey and a narrator talk fairly often).\n\nAll in all this is a solid title.","April 7, 2014","true","2.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Not only will you enjoy this game for the nostalgia factor if you played the original back in 1990, but it's a solid "collect-the-items platformer" as well.  Short, yes, and nothing "rogue-like" about it (and that's a good thing, just like the original!),  but absolutely charming and entertaining, improving upon all the reasons why the original game was so great: pleasing soundtrack (same tunes-- thankfully, nicely re-arranged and re-done), surreal graphics, solid character control, and the newly-added option of being able to return to any level to grab up those items you might have missed on your first (or fifth) run.\n\nBottom line: only the most jaded hipster rogue-lover would not find this game fun.  Do yourself a favor and pick this game up before you buy "Super Indie Hamster Runner" or "Sandwich Simulator 2014".  You'll be glad you did.

I love platformers, and I wanted to love this game. But I can't. It could have been great but it feels unfinished.\n\nCons\nMy biggest complaint is that it is not fun to play. The enemies are designed almost exclusivly as gotchas so that you have to replay the levels until you remember where they all are. The character controller (the controls) is total garbage. Virtually every other platformer you have played have better controls. Rayman, Guacameele, Mario, SMB, you name it. The controls here are floaty, the hitboxes are bad, the enemy positions deliberatly mean. There are plenty of other niggles mostly related to polish, but those are the main ones.

It's all out running, jumping, stomping your enemies, swinging, swimming, the usual. You collect diamonds along the way to unlock the subsequent levels. You don't need anywhere near the 800 possible diamonds to proceed, however. More diamonds, chili peppers, statues, and playing cards unlock costumes and really bland concept art as paintings in the castle.\n\nThe story is a traditional Disney fairy tale. Mickey and Minnie are in love. The witch captures Minnie. Mickey goes to save the day. The narration reads like it's from a child's storybook. It's nothing that will blow your mind, but if you love Disney, you'll enjoy the story. Mickey and the other characters sound great, exactly like you'd expect them to, though their dialogue is limited.\n\nThe graphics update for this game is phenomenal. It's gorgeous artwork in the traditional Disney style.\n\nLevel design is exceptional, reminding me of the charm of games on the original Nintendo and Genesis systems. Each level has a theme and all the obstacles fit well within the theme.\n\nAt times the game makes you move quickly as platformers traditionally do and you need to make quick reactions as the floors fall out from under you. It does feel like a bit of a memorize and repeat formula at times and can be a bit frustrating if the checkpoint is a bit further back.\n\nBoss battles are unique each time, as the various monsters have different themed attack patterns. The forest tree boss rolls like a log, the toy world boss is a jack in the box that jumps around and tosses a spring-loaded boxing glove your way, etc.\n\nThe controls are very simple and worked perfectly on the XBOX controller for Windows. I would have liked an option to pan the camera to look around the immediate area for hidden collectables (as that is a significant part of the game), but it's not that big of a deal. Sometimes I would just make a jump to see what I could find. A few times it paid off. Other times, I fell into the abyss. Once I couldn't see what was on a platform I needed to jump to and a bookworm bit me. I think that was just a random glitch though because that area didn't have the same problem again. I never had any other technical concerns about the game. It's a rock-solid game.\n\nSometimes, the game switches to more of a 3D perspective instead of side-scrolling. It's rarely used. You can play an entire level with one camera style and suddenly the boss is in 3D mode, so that can be a bit counter-intuitive. It's slightly challenging to judge the depth of your jumps in this mode, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI would recommend this game, but not at the $15 price point. It only takes about 2 hours to complete the story. Then you can repeat the levels of your choosing any time you want as time trials. Combined with a small system of collectibles, the game does present some replay value, though the collectible rewards aren't really that exciting.","January 1, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Armed only with his plucky attitude, dogged determination and a mean throwing arm, Mickey immediately sets out to rescue the love of his life from Mizrabel's lair, the titular Castle of Illusion.\n\nCastle of Illusion takes the 1990 Sega Genesis title and spiffs it up with some voice-acting and sharp graphics, but at its core it remains a side-scrolling, two-dimensional platformer.\n\nIt looks like Sega Studios Australia enjoyed twisting the concept of "side-scrolling", though. The linear stages mix up the traditional "go right" design by taking advantage of the new three-dimensional engine. Paths weave into the background or curve along cylindrical towers in twisting, circuitous routes that double back on each other at unexpected moments. Some stages even shift to a top-down perspective, allowing Mickey free, unfettered access to all three dimensions of movement.\n\nAlso new in this remake is a hub area where Mickey can roam around, viewing anything he's unlocked and can select levels to journey to, provided he has enough gems to unlock them.\n\nThe levels are whimsical affairs - Mickey travels through exotic locales like haunted forests, undersea ruins, and a world of sugar and candy found within a cup of tea. Accompanied by the ever-present narrator, Mickey navigates these fantastical lands in pursuit of Mizrabel's henchmen and the seven rainbow gems they carry. These gems will open a path to the boss witch herself at the top of the Castle.\n\nOf course, with new dimensions comes a change in controls. Mickey's jumping skills are serviceable, but feel weightless. This shift makes leaping difficult to control, and the top-down segments can aggravate the problem with the lack of depth perception—it's sometimes hard to know if Mickey has jumped high enough to clear his jump.\n\nSwimming segments are where the controls suffer the most. Mickey has all the maneuverability of a steamboat, and requires constant buttonmashing to travel with any speed. Mercifully, these swimming sections are both infrequent and brief.\n\nOther than the somewhat floaty controls, there are no real flaws in Castle of Illusion. It's a short game that's easy to complete in a night or two, and it offers collectibles for those who want some replay. It's charming and well-polished, but players craving challenge might be disappointed. On the other hand, people wanting to relax with something that doesn't require a huge investment of time or effort should consider joining Mickey on his newest mousecapade.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","April 10, 2015","true","4.5"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","0"

I'm playing it on a laptop ( i3, 4GB ram and gt540m) and it runs so slow to be unplayable. Even without post processing and anti-aliasing, and at low resolution. It' so frustrating that a few times I almost thrown the pad against the wall.\nFor what i saw, the game looks nice. It is not a port from the old genesis version (and I would have preferred it was ) and sometimes you have to walk around the 3d environment. It would be fun if you shouldn't have to struggle with the crappy controls. Some levels are very inspired, some not but this can be said for many other games.\nBy now, I don't feel to reccomend this game, especially if like me You loved the original game.

Ever want to be in a living story book? Well this game gives you that chance. It starts out very easy, but slowly increases in difficulty with a good pace.

It does have a short play through time, so you might want to catch it durring a sale if that kind of thing matters to you.

The game was beautiful, the gameplay was fun albeit basic, the music and sounds were awesome, but I beat the entire game in an hour.  The first time I got 2 gems in one "world" I was confused about how they would extend the gametime, but they never tried.  The only thing that would make me go back is to try time attack (and it gives you an achievement if you complete a single level that way, or go back trying to find the rest of the "hidden" items or gems.

There is a good variety in the boss fights, with each of them feeling truly different from the others. The difficulty peaks for boss fights feel quite appropriate, too.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the 2.5D platforming is largely smooth, but the 3D platforming parts can be a bit of a pain - as is usually the case. Thankfully, the latter is not overused, and transition between the two always feels natural.\n\nThe story is about as original and enthralling as you'd expect, but at least the narration is well written and well performed. Through narration, the game continually gives an impression of progress, as well as an idea of how far into the game you've made it.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this is a good, entertaining platformer.","May 24, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reasons being that it was very easy and extremely short. I beat it in 2 hours so it barely was worth the $3.60 I paid for it on sale. It actually probably took me about an hour and a half not including the time it took to retry parts. The only part that was even slightly challenging was the last part of the last boss fight. It took me four or five tries to get the pattern down to beat the last boss.

It's an early nineties video game for the Sega Genesis. Most children that are into video games now weren't even born when it was released. I remember going into an A and Z video store and seeing the title always rented out, but they always had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy of paperboy, I digress. Castle Of Illusion Remake is a short sweet game that captures the sprite of the original. In terms of length it should take no more than one hour to complete, again, this hearkens back to the original 8bit/16bit days in terms of completion. The only thing with this port of the game, is that you cannot turn off fxaa, so the game has a slight blur to it, and it's not really optimized, I was getting slight frame drops on a 980ti. I bought this game for $4 bucks, and it was worth every penny.

I've got a little more to do before it's 100% clear, but it's yet another candidate for my Game of the Year.\n\nCastle of Illusion (the Master System version) is a game I counted as my favourite since I was around five or six years old until recently when The Binding of Isaac challenged it, but Castle of Illusion is rock-solid and Binding is buggy as heck; it's still great, but Castle pips it by virtue of being faultless, basically.\n\nSo this remake was a long time coming and something I had a lot of nostalgic and, frankly, emotional stake in. The remake is actually of the Mega Drive version of the game (which I don't like as much but is still a good crack), but the principle is thus; the "...of Illusion" series is very dear to me, and this remake is more than worthy. It take the basic elements of both versions of the original game and expands upon them sensibly and non-intrusively. The spirit, the feel of the game is bang on. It's incredible just how charming this remake is, and how perfectly it nails the Illusion magic. It makes the recent 3DS Epic Mickey: The Power of Illusion look even more like the insult it was. Screw Dreamrift for daring to put the word "Illusion" on their piece of ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nThis remake is perfect. Sure, it's taken me just shy of two hours to finish it, but those were two hours where at no point did I say "for ♥♥♥♥'s sake", two hours I spent grinning like a loon, completely enraptured by the sheer friendliness of the game. Ten out of ten, everyone should play this. The studio have disbanded so there will not be a sequel and if there is it's a risky proposition. This was a once-in-a-lifetime thing and Sega Studios Australia pulled it off with incredible ♥♥♥♥ing skill. Props to them and I hope their staff all find success at whatever they do.\n\nCastle of Illusion (2013) reminded me that video games can be as fun, charming and engaging as they were when I was ten, playing cartridges my uncle brought me home from the market.

I basically finished the story of it in around 2 hours, dunno how long it would take to collect everything but I am not sure you would have the patience to unless you are a child.\n\nAltough not hard or difficult, there are spots in the game where you will die and retry alot. Considering it is aimed at kids, I feel it would have been better being longer with more content rather than having so many spots you will have to repeat alot. Especially considering the $17.99 price tag I can't say it's worth it.\n\nAll in all, can't recommend it if you pay full price for it, glad I got it dirt cheap.\nBut it is okay.

The storytelling aspect, narrator and all, is pretty good.  The level and enemy visuals are appropriately creative and "magical", evoking that early "Harry Potter" feeling of wonder.  But the gameplay itself is "merely ok".\n\nCastle of Illusion is pretty easy for the most part, though the difficulty does ramp up toward the end.  I died a few times to almost every boss while figuring out the patterns (I'm a bit slow when it comes to this), and had to use a continue on the final boss.\n\nI had some strange drops in performance in most levels - strange because while my system doesn't quality as a "modern gaming rig", an i7-920 w/HD4850 shouldn't have had any trouble running a game with these graphics - which while rather nice looking, aren't exactly complex.   And this was with Anti-Aliasing disabled.\n\nIt should also be noted that this really is a very short game - it took me just under 3 hours to beat.   It would obviously take longer to 100% it (get all the gems and other collectibles in each level) but if you're like me, you don't care about that kind of stuff.\n\nAs such, I'd recommend waiting for at least a 75% off sale.  I think I got my $3.74 playfire reward's worth out of CoL, but I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that.","July 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's also helped along by only giving you three keyboard control presets (and they're all sub-optimum, and it's incredibly lazy considering you have two actions plus direction keys). Yeah, you won't need analog movement controls for this game either, so the controller advertising is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (At least the few movement tests I did with keyboard felt like giving me enough control. Analog controller movement results in either run or stroll.)\n\n- Said message is part of the ♥♥♥♥ing 25 seconds of unskippable game launch intro! (More if you don't press Enter and then Esc at the right times.) And even returning from in-game to the main menu (e.g. for quitting) wastes several seconds with unnecessary transitions. You're better off just pressing Alt+F4, but hell, who knows whether that might screw up your probably only savestate in this autosaving piece of console crap.\n\n- Menu navigation is slooooow. You cannot press an arrow key and expect the menu to switch to the next point with that. No, you have to do things slowly, the way the game wants you to do it. It wants to complete its fancy text animation first before going to the next point.\n\n- Game disregards Windows version locale, general Steam language setting and game-individual Steam language setting and runs in the location set in Windows system config, which is idiotic, because what's relevant is the language the user understands, not where he is located. I tried finding config files and couldn't, except one with two useless entries. I searched the Windows registry and couldn't find settings there either. Command line parameters? Who knows? Very likely not, since this is just another piece of crap carryover from consoles. I eventually, using a frickin hex editor like a code hacker, found all the available variables and the registry key for the config, which is "SSA\COI", which explains why my keyword search earlier remained unsuccessful. And, well, ... there is no language setting at all in this game. It is hardcoded to take the Windows locale setting, so you'd have to change that every time you play the game if it's not the desired language. And as you can derive from the game forums on Steam (which you should always consult before buying a game, after you've read some of the negative reviews), some people have no choice, their game being in Japanese.\n\nThis is the second game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off in one day, the other one being Half-Life 2 with its botched update from Valve that caused a launch error for many people. I don't actually get to play games that much, because by the time I get one to run properly, the little motivation I had is gone. I feel like an IT support guy again, but in my free time, and with the difference that I'm actually paying money for the opportunity to deal with crap like this.\n\nI'd demand a refund if I didn't know how annoying THAT would be with Valve, on top of all the hassle I already had.\nOne has to ask: Why does Valve, with a platform like Steam, even allow the games sold on it to violate its functional guidelines/principles?\n\nThe only game I feel like playing right now is Sniper Elite: Corporate Business Cleanup.\n\n\nP.S.: Oh and the story of the game is the usual ancient-Christian-hate-propaganda-fueled evil-ugly-witch theme, but hey, this is a mickeymouse game after all, so that's to be expected.\n\n\nTL;DR: Dis?! ... Ney!\n\n\nUPDATE: Played it a bit now.\nAchievements are either damn easy or too difficult to be motivating, since getting 100% of some items can mean searching for hidden stuff, and in some levels you might skip items because there are multiple paths and once you take one, the other one is locked. So some achievements would require tedious repetition of content. The same type of 100%-completion-achievements in Giana Sisters - Twisted Dreams were much more motivating and fun.\nDifficulty is not trivial. It provides some challenge. Bosses for example might need one failed run in order to learn how the fight works. And 3D platform jumping is very error-prone unless you train your muscle memory. Can also be unprecise when you miss a ledge although it looked like you'd catch it.\nThere are pits that look like you can jump down and nothing tells you you die when you plunge down there, so it can lead to frustrating loss of lives.\nLevel design is done in an interesting way, with lots of variety and intermission scenes and such. Game also has a narrator.","October 5, 2014","false","3.6"," 7 of 48 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","7","48","0","0"

It is a good game for a quick playthrough from the original game. You dont get the nostalgica feeling, but it is ok for a quick platformer game. Dough I must say it is not an easy game. The controls are sensitive and the jumping is a bit out of control sometimes.\n\nThe main downer must be not able to skip through some points in the game. The last boss is hard and you need to know what do do in every event, meaning afew attemps of replays to get it right.

Finding all Crystal was hard in the original game, but here it is even harder. There are areas you cant go back, and if you miss some crystals or worse (card or throphy) you have to replay the whole map collecting all over again. And as always there are 30-40 very hidden crystals in each map making it really hard to collect all. Most of the times i ended up missing 2-3 crystals. So annoying. Should be able to play the map again with all the crystals except those missed.\n\nThe pro is the gameplay really. The maps are great and it is alot of fun playing through the game 1 time. Replay value.... not so much.\n\nI recommend this game if you want to play a semi hard platformer for a few hours. But i do not recommend this game if you want to have a pressent to give to your little brother/sister or looking for a new game to play for 20-30 hours.

O jogo é bastante simples e infantil, lembra bastante o jogo original principalmente nas primeiras fases, mas como esperado dificilmente  a emoção consegue se igualar a dos anos 90 jogando o Castle of Illusion clássico, o jogo atrai principalmente  o público Old School e talvez algumas crianças mais "modernas".

The addition of costuems is pretty cool, one of which you earn through collectibles.\n\nThe bosses ramp up in difficulty very nicely and some of the latter bosses, are even decently challenging. If you're a platformer vet you won't necessarily die to them very often, but you'll respect the challenge they present.\n\nThe whimsical animation and dialogue is very nice, very much what you should expect of a Disney title. The only downer, I would say, is the intro story and the outro story. Corny is a restrained word I'd use to describe both of them.\n\nAll and all, a pretty good game for the price, do reccomend.","August 18, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've never played it before it's a linear 2.5D platformer with some 3D sections, starring Mickey Mouse in all his cartoon glory. This update sticks fairly faithfully to the original, there are a few minor additions and re-imaginings of sections which make use of the 3D environment (the final boss is a good example of this). The controls are smooth, the music is great and the graphics are beautiful - the levels look like scenes painted in a particularly well-illustrated storybook, which is very much what the game is. It's not a long or particularly difficult game, bear in mind the original can be completed in about 20 minutes and I played this to 100% completion in a few hours. The replay value is the same as the original, this is the sort of game you pull off the shelf from time to time to while away an hour or two.

Ok, this could be more a bit of subjetive opinion, but I really found harder the classic version, maybe bc I was a kid back in the 90's and found some parts of the game really frustrating  to go through, even though it had the right amount of difficulty to get back at it and make you want to play all over and over again. Although with this one, well is easy, I admit that a the candy dragon boss and mizrabel gave me some tough time but once I figured out their pattern attack, it was easier. Aside from that, there's no real challenge, I think they set the difficulty of this game for nowadays kids as they use to complain for high difficulty in games. This one is a very big con bc I excepted more challenge.\n\npros:\n\n+ AWESOME music! the BGM and SE of this game are very very good,  the old songs are all remasterized  and recomposed and they did a good work at updating them with digital music and sounds, this was a bull's eye!\n+ Graphics: what can I say? just stunning! they're beautiful, If the original japanese sega crew could have access to nowadays technology to create such graphics back in the 90's , they surely could had came up with something similar to this. The redesign of the levels are very well excecuted as well, they keep the spirit of the original version. Just Bravo!\n\nAs a conclusion, I might say that I'm aware that the studio that did this game wanted to keep the spirit of the orinigal COI, and didn't want to change much elements in order to do so, but really, this game could have been a bit longer, with more levels (and bosses). A true shame! but it's still enjoyable and fun to play. If you didn't play the sega genesis version, then go ahead and play! but if you're a fanatic of the classic version  like me, you' ll be dessapointing of it when you'll beat it as there's no real challenge.\n\nIf you want a real challenge, then you can download a sega genesis emulator along with the COI rom or undust your old sega genesis and original COI and beat it! bc with this one, you won't get any.","December 3, 2013","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this game was definitely done right.  The spirit of the original Genesis version is captured very well.  The graphics and platforming have been updated enough to fit modern ideas of what a game should be, but you can easily identifiy every part of the game with the original, and the added content isn't overbearing.\n\nThe addition of the Mario 64-like lobby for level selection was a nice touch, and I really appreciate that most of the original Genesis music is recognizable in its remade form.  The game is a bit short, but I think lengthening the actual platforming sections might have taken something away from its integrity.  They did add the collectables and a few unlocks to length it a bit, but some may not care for such things.  If that's the case, just wait to pick up the game when it hits a price point you are comfortable with.\n\nThat clown boss is still scary as hell, even 20+ years later.","February 11, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played the original Castle of Illusion, so my nostalgia doesn't come from that. It does come from being a fan of Disney and their cartoons for many years. I had not seen Mickey in a entertainment medium since Kingdom Hearts so it hit me in a good way. It also made me feel old. Now technically, the game has pretty good controls for a platformer. The jump is solid if a tad bit floaty. The game is kind of simple and easy, but it definetly is fun. The game is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves. It is short though, so take that for what it's worth. At regular price it does offer enough gameplay, but price and it's worth is subjective to everyone, so that is something you will have to come up with. If it's on a steam sale definetly pick it up, it's worth it!\n\nFOR: People who love Disney, platformers, or games in general. It's a good 5 hours that are ultimately pretty great.\nNOT FOR: People who have an extremely specifice taste in games.

When I was a kid I owned and played this game and loved every minute of it, and today that hasn't changed much. This game is still an amazing game but now it looks even better.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as it was when it came out on the Genesis/Mega Drive, sometimes punishing, but as fair as all difficult games in the old days.\n\nYou begin by running through a level of whackiness until you get to the castle, there you can save and start new levels of whackiness. There is something magical about this game that comes from the nostalgia factor combined with it being a really good platformer. It is a semi 3d/2d experience that reminds me a little of mario 64 at times. (a little I said.)\n\nPros:\n\n+It may be a shorter game than you are used to, but its quite challenging at times. Because its gameplay comes from a time when games were much more difficult, there are times when you may end up repeating the same thing over and over trying to make a jump or get a crystal or apple or something. It's forgiving but not by much.\n\n+It looks quite good, remembing its based on a game that came out in 1990, that's 25 years ago at the time of writing this. They took all that gameplay and redid all the graphics creating a contemporary platformer that still feels like a classic.\n\n+ It can be hard, but not overly hard. It's not a remake of battletoads or anything, and I imagine compared to games of its time it was not considered hard, however games today are quite easy in comparison so kids playing this today may find it a little difficult.\n\n+The music and sound is really good, and they give you the option to choose the contemporary updated music or the classic stuff from the game, something they didn't have to do but is really appreciated.\n\nCons:\n\n- The controls may take a few to get used to. Like I missed several jumps because I didn't get the timing correctly, or I thought it didn't jump when I pressed it, however after about 15 minutes it was all good for me and I corrected whatever issue I seemed to be having.\n\nAnd let me be clear this isn't really a problem, but I thought I'd list it to give warning if someone played and thought "What the heck?"\n\n\nOriginally I thought I'm not sure this game is worth $15 but having tried it I can say they put a lot of work into making this game look like a contemporary game, and its definitely worth the price tag.\n\nFor kids who like everything explained or a big sign telling them where to go, they may not like some of this game. At times I wondered if I was going in the right direction, but I realized it doesn't matter, the game won't let you really make a mistake in that way, however you find yourself doing the same thing over and over until you realize, "no I'm supposed to go down here or up there instead."\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\n7/10. It's a really nice, relaxing, fun, trip down memory lane, and for kids who have never seen it, it will surely delight. This is for all ages and don't be fooled by having Mickey, even adults will enjoy the challenge.","December 11, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodythumbs/recommended/227600/","bloodythumbs","Bloody Thumbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodythumbs/","81 products in account","The game is fairly easy but I find the platforming is enjoyable due to the creative level design. While there is generally only one path, it goes in all directions and never feels like you're just going in a straight path from left to right. I never played the original Genesis version so I don't know how closely it follows it but I understand this is more a reimagining than a remake. I know that I do like the variety of platforming and contrasting styles and designs of each level. The transitions from 2D to 3D gameplay generally flow well and it's easy to re-orient yourself to play the short 3D segments. Missing a jump usually does not lead to instant death but is often just a setback as you land in an earlier part of the level. I personally appreciate this as someone who hates bottomless pits. The bosses are also fairly fun to beat if again a bit easy. There is a bit of a challenge in getting all the gems as some are carefully hidden and require exploring off the obvious path. I generally dislike collect-a-thons but since the game is not too long and there are not too many gems, it was actually interesting to try and get all the gems without looking up a walkthrough.\n\nGraphics and music are very well done. The graphics do not obscure any platforms but give life and personality to each level. I particularly like the overall relaxing tone of the music, which gives a whimsical fairy tale feel while still being interesting to listen to. The occasional narration that occurs due to certain actions is also a nice touch.\n\nAs a fan of 2D platformers, I found this to be a very enjoyable and imaginative game. Maybe it could have used another world with a few levels but what we got was high quality where replaying levels is not a chore.","December 9, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are gorgeous and almost every scene is filled with nice little details that really gives it polish.  The new overworld, while small, really ties the levels together.\nIt is short, I finished it in under 3 hours but those where a very enjoyable 3 hours and if I didn't have a billion other games to play I would glady spend more time going back through the levels discovering all the secrets.\n\nThere is one major flaw to the game which will affect you more or less depending on your skill level with these types of games.  It wasn't until the final boss I happened upon it but, the game criminally resets you back to the cutscene prior to fighting the boss.  I believe it to be the case for all the bosses.  By the time I finally beat the boss on my 5th attempt  I was incredibly frustrated at watching that cut scene over and over.  It really soured me on the game.\n\nThese cutscenes are unskippable and could honestly make you give up on the game.  Why this still happens in games is just baffling and the designers on the team that fight for their work to be unskippable as they worked so hard on it need to be put to task on their awful decisions.  This hurts games so much and in this case could ruin the game competely for some people.\n\nJust something to be aware of.","February 15","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there is generally only one path, it goes in all directions and never feels like you're just going in a straight path from left to right. I never played the original Genesis version so I don't know how closely it follows it but I understand this is more a reimagining than a remake. I know that I do like the variety of platforming and contrasting styles and designs of each level. The transitions from 2D to 3D gameplay generally flow well and it's easy to re-orient yourself to play the short 3D segments. Missing a jump usually does not lead to instant death but is often just a setback as you land in an earlier part of the level. I personally appreciate this as someone who hates bottomless pits. The bosses are also fairly fun to beat if again a bit easy. There is a bit of a challenge in getting all the gems as some are carefully hidden and require exploring off the obvious path.

Everything that was great about the original, the locations, the sense of whimsy had been successfully carried across to this new version along with a fully orchestral soundtrack and a friendly sounding narrator adding the level of Disney gloss that just wasn't possible in the cartridge era.  As much as I enjoyed this game however, there is a feeling of sadness when you realise that the developers where planning to do similar remakes of a lot of Sega properties from that era including Streets of Rage and Golden Axe which will alas never be as Sega shuttered ther studio.

Everything that was great about the original, the locations, the sense of whimsy had been successfully carried across to this new version along with a fully orchestral soundtrack and a friendly sounding narrator adding the level of Disney gloss that just wasn't possible in the cartridge era.  As much as I enjoyed this game however, there is a feeling of sadness when you realise that the developers where planning to do similar remakes of a lot of Sega properties from that era including Streets of Rage and Golden Axe which will alas never be as Sega shuttered ther studio.  Still, if your looking for a pleasantly challenging old-school platformer with a modern look, this could be ideal.","April 11","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So your goal is as basic as it gets.\nYou wander through various worlds inside the Castle of Illusion (like a giant library, a magical forest or a toy world) in order to collect seven gems that will make a bridge to the witch and Minnie.\n\nThis is a 2013 reboot of the 1990 Sega Genesis classic of the same name (which I like btw).\nHow does it hold up, as a game in general and as a reboot?\n\nAs a game in general it is pretty good. It is mostly a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, which means that you mostly jump and run from left to right or the other way round. In special parts of the game you have use all key arrows in order to jump on platforms around you or just to run to every corner of a room or bigger platform (like in boss fights).\nYou need to end three acts of a level and collect diamonds and other items as well as you can (certain amounts of diamonds are needed to get access to future levels).\nYou defeat enemies by jumping on them or by throwing stuff at them.\n\nSo as you can see it is pretty basic and it can be fun for adult players as well as for children. The gameplay also is basic and easy to learn.\nHowever, prepare yourself for a few frustrating moments, especially for quite tricky jumping parts (a good example: the milk shake river and cookies or the final boss fight) and for cutscenes that cannot be skipped (not even the long end credits).\n\nAs a reboot it is alright, not something like the "Ducktales" reboot that amazed and entertained me very much but it is still noticeable that the SEGA team put some work and love for details into this. This also goes for the soundtrack and the lovely voice acting (like when Mickey comments the levels from time to time).\n\nAll in all I would call "Castle of Illusion" alright. Not quite awesome - and some flaws really could have been avoided - but good enough to try out. It's definitely something for Disney/Mickey fans.","May 5","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me 5 hrs to complete the lot, including all collectibles and achievements, and I am certainly no speed demon with games. Those 5 hours were fun though, which is what counts surely.\nThe platforming works, the graphics are nice enough, and the whole thing feels like a trip down memory lane with natty 3D thrown in. The bosses are the only real (fairly light) challenge, but each are defeatable with a little memorising (hey, this is old school remember). Despite the easiness, the repetition of redoing levels to find the collectibles is what evokes feelings of days gone by. Sail through without a care for those and it'll be over sooner, and with less of the impact. You make your own choice.","May 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's wonderful to look at, especially if you're a big Disney fan, but the slick looks can make platforming difficult. Sometimes it's hard to see what is and isn't a platform, and the controls are a little too loose for accuracy. It's also a very short game that I 100%'d in less than six hours. Get it during a sale and have a little fun, but expect to get a little frustrated along the way.","May 21","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
