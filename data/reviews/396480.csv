As a very passional FTL veteran (well over 1000 hours played), I would agree with this relationship - it's clear that elements of this game are inspired by FTL: the sector-hopping map, asteroid & nebula sectors, friendly & enemy battlestations (at least in the advanced edition of FTL), scrap as a commodity - and most importantly, the overall story arc of attempting to save a galaxy by "making-it" to the end of a series of maps and defeating a final enemy (although here, with less of a predictable cast of characters).\n\nHowever, the perspective is certainly different. While in FTL, I commanded a single ship through various comical hurdles, becoming quite attached to my mighty mantis raiders and my lone zoltan who never got to leave the engine room. they leveled up, my ship gained dynamically altering augmentations, and I was responsible for everything from the timing of my glaive beam shot to ordering my stoic rockman to get out of a room that had been vented to open space.\n\nHere, I am no longer a captain - I am the admiral of a triumvirate of starfaring vessels, built up painstakingly from skirmishes and pitched battles. I can't control individual crew members, because my responsibility is so much greater - I command squadrons of fighters, damn it, and the lives of tens of thousands of human crew surge forth and fall back on my word. FTL was the voyage of the USS Enterprise across regions of brave unknown; in Battlestation, I am the Grand Admiral Thrawn, falling like the fist of an angry god upon an enemy battlestation who dares to encroach upon the domain of Man. When my Capital Ship Armada fires the first salvo of death rays (yes, a Master of Orion inspired element) , and twin Esquishal-class heavy assault carriers burst through the firery cataclysm that remains of the first enemy vessel to rain waves of elite bombers and laser cannon drones upon the enemy starbase, I contain the awesome power of a fully operational starfleet!\n\nSo... in short. I like to think of FTL and BS:H as, in a way, sister games. Each complements the other in ways that they can't fulfill alone.

In B: H you play as a new Human commander and you’ll be given missions which will see you venture deep into enemy space to destroy enemy installations, explore undocumented regions of Space, escort allied ships and more. While on your mission you’ll be faced with several different factions/races, each with their own ships and weapons. You’re not alone though, once you have enough scrap you’ll be able to hire mercenaries and even build your own fleet.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nThe first thing to mention is the fact that B: H started its life as a mobile game, a very successful one at that. B: H does differ on the PC and it has benefitted from a few improvements, which can be found listed on the store page. I haven’t played the mobile version, so I can’t compare the two, but what I can say is that B: H doesn’t feel like the kind of game which has been ported just to port it, it feels like it fits in on the PC market. The UI does look like the kind of thing you’d see on a mobile game but it works well with the M&KB and the actual visuals of the game are good.\n\nOn to gameplay, each run of the game consists of four procedurally generated levels made up of around twenty to thirty sectors. The first three levels have a different enemy for you to face and you’ll never see two factions in the same level. The fourth level always has the same faction and you’ll never see this faction (or its weapons) in the other levels, I won’t say any more than that so I don’t spoil it. What you actually find in the sectors varies, it may be one small ship, it could be an asteroid field or even an enemy fleet factory. There are other things to find in the different sectors and usually most of them will appear in any given level though, being procedurally generated, it is possible to go through a level without seeing some of the rarer sectors, such as the fleet factory sector.\n\nSpeaking of fleet factories, they’re the only kind of spacecraft/installation which is only ever used by enemies. While the different factions, including the humans, all have different ship and weapon designs to each other they are for the most part just variations rather than completely different. The different weapons of course vary in stats and while human weapons are generally well-rounded there are usually benefits to choosing an alien weapon instead. Enemy weapons are sometimes dropped when you take out a larger enemy ship.\n\nAlthough there are twenty-six human ships, you only start with one unlocked. The rest of the ships are unlocked by earning experience points in runs which will then level you up, one ship for each time you level up. Here lies my main issue with the game, the default ship and the first unlocked ship are so weak that the first hour or so of gameplay isn’t very enjoyable. Learning to play B: H simply isn’t enjoyable. Once I unlocked more powerful ships and I understood what I was doing a bit better I began to really enjoy the game but it’s just worth keeping in mind that you may not enjoy the first forty-five minutes to an hour. Anyway, back to the ships themselves, as well as differing in appearance they all have different stats (Hull points, Shield Capacity etc.) and different facility slot placements.\n\nThere are three kinds of facilities in the game, colour coded to make things easy. Red facility slots are for your main weapons or the really beefy support facilities, these are what you’re going to rely on in combat for taking down the big ships and battlestations. Blue slots are for support facilities, these are less powerful weapons or a shield booster which are going to defend against smaller enemies and in the case of the weapons, missiles. Lastly we have green slots, ship hangars. While not all ships have them, these hangars will house small squadrons of smaller ships or drones which can either fill a combat or support role. They may seem negligible but actually having a lot of these smaller ships can sometimes be better than having a bigger, more cumbersome ship (ships with hangars are generally smaller and more nimble).\n\nSo what are these battlestations I keep mentioning? Battlestations are effectively huge outpost/city type things which serve as way stations on your journey, or a serious challenge in the case of enemy battlestations. Human battlestations will provide free repair services as well as offering you a mission (with scrap and upgrade point rewards) as well a shop where you can buy or sell any equipment you don’t want or need. These missions are usually easier objectives such as go to X location, collect object Y and then return here but they are the best way to earn more scrap and upgrade points in the game and you’ll be needing a lot of those. Enemy battlestations themselves aren’t much of a risk, they usually only have blue slots and one or two hangars, but they’re always found in sectors filled with small and large enemy ships and so they’re tough to beat. It’s in situations like these where having your own fleet can come in really handy.\n\nAccessed via the formation tab at the top of the screen, the formation menu allows you to purchase up to two ships to accompany you and aid you in your mission. Not all of the ships you can use can be purchased here and they do need to be unlocked by you first but there are a couple of extra ships here which are helpful early on. Purchasing other ships isn’t exactly cheap and once you’ve bought them you’ll need to equip them too with weapons bought using the main currency of scrap and upgraded using upgrade points (unless you picked up some weapons from enemies). The upgrade system in the game is pretty straightforward but instead of simply improving the weapons or support facilities, depending on what you’re upgrading, you may actually worsen one of the other stats for example increasing damage may increase cooldown time. The upgrades all become more expensive as you put more points into that weapon.\n\nLast of all, but by no means least, I’ll talk about how combat and moving through the levels actually works. Combat itself is real-time, though you can decide what to do when the game is paused (there is also a 2x speed option). Your ships will automatically target enemies close to them but you can also manually target enemy ships too, you can even choose what weapons you want to fire at what enemy or what enemy you want your drones to target. Most of the strategy in combat comes from deciding if you need to jump away or what enemy to target but you’ll also need to think carefully about how your ship is positioned as blue slot facilities have short ranges and narrow cones of vision. The level map is turn-based. When you make a move your enemies will also make a move and while enemies stay put a lot of the time, they can jump to different sectors (apart from battlestations and factories) and this can be problematic if you’ve been stuck due to an EMP and a bunch of enemies jump into your sector.\n\nI also recorded an informal review video, if you’d like to check that out you can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpXesvgkJM\n\nVerdict\nAn incredibly enjoyable space strategy game, Battlestation: Harbinger offers players great gameplay combined with plenty of unlocks to keep things interesting for a long while. If you’re a fan of strategy games and/or you’re a big fan of all things space, like myself, then you’re definitely going to have fun with this game.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 24","true","13.5"," 107 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","107","144","3","7"

Having put a few hours into the game I do not think those comparisons are warranted. Unless I am missing something there is nothing that keeps you from simply retreating and returning to any conflict as many times as you like so it is not really all that rougelike and the most strategic decision I make in most battles is how to maximize my starting distance from the enemies. It is not a braindrain and the need to precisely target enemies is just not there, So not like FTL, but I still really like it.\n\nMost games I feel like I can get into the developer's heads and figure out what I am supposed to do, but this game is not one of them. I do not understand the ship progression at all. I feel like the number 11-13 ships are way better than the number 21 ship for example. When you jump to a new sector you cannot neccessarily see if anyone else is jumping into it and this can result in massive ambushes that you have to run away from, so there are plenty of situations that I assume are just unwinnable. Also the experience system is not balanced in terms of time invested and the whole thing is very grindy and slow to start. These are minor complaints though because I really love the core of the game.\n\nI particularly like the end-game. Once you get your three ships and you have filled all the slots you can upgrade some guns, but if you lose the ship you lose those upgrade points which are much scarcer than the regular currency. Instead I have been buying the super advanced weapons at the top of the purchable weapon list that are just brutal. I expect there could be some expansions in the future that would allow some custumization as well. I would recommend this game, but understand that its nowhere near as full and intricate as FTL. It is a 3 ship fleet simulator with some RNG elements and very little customization or variation between the ships.","February 27","true","49.7"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","39","45","2","0"

Easily get submerged in the involving battles, until a mischosen jump ends your game, well, not entirely. Each game you gain exp and will get more choices of your starter ship or ships(3 at most in a fleet) with higher lvls, and also depending on how much you had in last game, sets your starting credits and upgrade points.\n\nThe mix of type of ship and typical and random choices for placement of defensive and offensive equiptment is a venture hopefully well done..  even where on a ship you place it, because distance is very important,such as when you are trying to manouver a short range shot on a moving object.\nMeteor fields, shield and armor killing environments, or emp clouds, will have to be moved through, or fought in.  The random mix of events will have your imagination and choices kindled, as well as your nerves racked. I actually circled in a cloudy nebula trying to close in on an equally weakend enemy, hoping another emp pulse would not happen before I could jump out.\nGreat game, very easy to pick up, may seem casual, but its not easy and its entirely addictive.","February 28","true","22.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

The graphics and sounds are not as good as GSB, and the rogue-like, perfectly balanced micromanaging of FTL is not present. However, it has elements of both of those games, combining two enjoyable things into one, though not being as highly proficient at either. This is not a knock on the game, it's just where it lands on the spectrum.\n\nI like how the game handles the tactical combat interface. Your ships act how you want them to act. They go where you tell them and attack in the desired order. The only problem is that there is almost no depth to combat. Yeah, you can change where your ships land in the sector, or position them in a minorly superior way, but it does not make much difference. It operates such that you optimize your ships while traversing a map (FTL), but then order them around precisely in real time battles (like GSB). The game consists of 4 procedurally generated sectors (FTL), though each particular sector is wide open for combat (like GSB).\n\nThe game becomes far too grindy at times due to poor pacing. There are major spikes and valleys in the opponents difficulty even in neighboring sectors. One second you are destroying face, and the next you are scurrying back to your battlestation to repair. This would be fine, but it is often expensive to upgrade or purchase additional firepower. This sends you grinding around safe parts of the map when you should be getting rewarded for exploring more. This problem worsens as you go on.\n\nThe deeper you get into the game, the more boring it gets. I often have my fleet at maximum capabilities in the first map. What this means is that I have no way of improving my ships, and if the enemies keep getting strong, there is no possibility of victory. The game needs tweaks. It's not horrible as it is, but it could be a lot more. This feels more like an early release, at least from a PC standpoint. It is obvious that the game is a port from a mobile platform, that's its ideal niche.","February 26","false","16.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","1"

Bigger ships are always better.\n\n\nIf you want a taste of how mind-numbingly boring the combat is, go play the developer's mobile games (Battlestation: Classic).","March 4","false","12.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

The game is slower even in the real time battles giving you time to make a more strategic choice of placement rather than twitch ability.  There is a decent variety of turrets for ships, all of which can be upgraded in a variety of stats throughout the game, including some support-only turrets.  You gain experience throughout the game, whether you win or lose the scenario, which in turn potentially unlocks new starting ships.  There are three main difficulties, but I have yet to actually beat easy, though I have seen the final sector.  It is roguelike in the sense that if your ship is destroyed the game ends regardless of how much of your fleet remains.  Really nice for essentially being an upgraded port of a mobile game.\n\nAlso, you get carriers.  I love having a carrier with drones.\n\nUPDATE: I've played enough to beat normal a couple of times and even finished hard once.  I have unlocked all but four ships.  Still quite enjoyable if you prefer a slower paced game and the ship combinations give it a decent amount of replayability if you don't just want to min/max.","February 26","true","45.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has been and still is among my favorites.  The port to Steam seems to have sucked nearly all of the enjoyment from the game.\n\n1)  Selecting a target in the mobile version is  a single click.  Here it takes two clicks.  A LftClick on the firing ship then a RtClick on the target.  If the player can indeed click on the target.  Click targeting is touchy to say the least.  Which brings us to:\n\n2)  RtClick command is overloaded.  Not only does RtClick  tell a ship where to shoot it RtClick also tells the ship where to move.  So a missed click can send that ship precisely where you don't want it to go.  Coupling that with a somewhat small click target  ships frequently are headed to the wrong place.\n\n3)  Controls are scattered about the edges of the screen resulting in a lot of wasted & unnecessary pointer movement.   There are many good reasons to cluster game controls. There most obvious being that it allows the player to keep his focus on the action. There are few good reasons to spread them across the entire real estate of the screen.   Perhaps none.\n\n4)  Ship speeds are a bit slow on a mobile.  On a 27" monitor they are excruciatingly slow.\n\n5)  Game balance is poor; even worse than the mobile version where game balance is precarious to say the least.  The worst balance issue is the ship speed.  All enemy ships are faster than all player ships.  All of them. This is especially annoying with regard to Carriers.  Historically naval carriers have been, and are, amond the fastest ships in the fleet.  The earliest carriers were in fact converted fast cruisers.  The job of the carrier is to get there"the fastest with the mostest"\n\n6)  Formation following doesn't work well but then it doesn't work well on the mobile version either.\n\nThe devs have a new project that is taking most , if not all, of their attention.  They said that they have no interest in putting more work into BH.  That's too bad because the best advertisment for a game is a history of prior successes.  The worst is a weak port.\n\nI'll continue playing & enjoying BH on my iPad and highly reccommend it.  I cannot say the same for the Steam version.","May 6","false","4.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The controls are limited and your options are small. You are stuck picking this or that weapon and anything short ranged is useless unless you jump in ontop of them. Difficulty is completely random. One moment you could be fighting a ship who can barely protect it's self, the next you end up against three war ships with weapons far outmatching your own. No damage per second model is displayed, forcing you to mathimaticly figure out if getting bursts is worth the huge amount of nerfs. The only 'story' you get is one little paragraph on who you are going out to kill this time! Because aperently humanity has nothing better to do then wander around space and make enemies.\n\nTo make things worse you are stuck traveling around forever in order to build up your forces...not exactly very military when I'm stuck looting scrap buckets while these high and mighty stations sit there and give very little help. You can't even use the alien ships...but by the look of them they're just copies of what is in your own rouster. There just dosen't seem to be enough depth... Sure, for 10 dollers it's a nice game, but I've had tons more fun on Out There, the game where you don't fight at all compaired to this 'fighting' game where you sit and watch your slow guns cross space...

However not all ships have access to the Hangers witch offer a variety of defensive and offensive fighter/drones to aid you.\n\nApon entering a new sector you will encounter a combo any of the following; Enimy ships, Enimy Starbase, Hidden Cashe, Ally ship or an Ally Starbase. On top of that, there are 4 types of sector; Normal sector that has no effects, Asteriod Belt with asteriods that crash into ships causing hull damage, Electrical Storm that drains shields and can cause you to be stuck there for a turn, or Black Hole that does a low amount of constant hull damage.\n\nOnce you clear a sector you will be rewarded with Scrap that is used to buy ships and equipment, and maybe an upgrade point for upgrading your current equipment, and a chance to get a new piece of equipment.\n\nAfter a while you may end up with enough scrap to buy a ship to add to your fleet, with a maximum of 3 ships total.

In essence is a rogue space RTS based game, (Turn based per map space you move to), this gives you some breather room so you dont get completely slammed. Compared to its mobile variant, their are some SERIOUS improvements. Personally, i like the addition of extra ships and modules.\n\nAlso hacking the game, is proving a challenge to cheat the system, i like that. Making it hard for those script kitties to cheat the game (i just ran CE and hacked away at it till i got what i wanted), but the whole point is, its pretty robust, and hard to beat. Even on easy it offers a reasonable challenge. A few bugs here and their which are obvious (compared to the mobile variant) which these bugs are resolved, but otherwise, non the less a amazing game.\n\nReally your running through 1-3 stages, in normal mode you face off against randomized maps with different factions, different enemies, and difficulties may vary based on level setting (easy, normal, hard), each variety only seems to change the enemy spawning times, scrap gain, and initial starting as well as how hard the game is overall.\n\nAll in all, i give this game a 5/5 if you dont have the mobile edition, get it. This is identical to it in every way, except rebuilt for the pc platform. God i CANNOT wait till they push the updates from this build to the mobile platform, dear god will i enjoy the mobile platform even more than ever before.","February 25","true","25.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However there is much more to this game than meets the eye.\n\nThere are plenty of ships to choose from and also unlock at the beginning of the game.  Although at the time of this writing the Carrier ships are far better than the starships that cannot hold fighter planes and/or drones.\n\nLoads of replayability as each and every time you play, the map is much different than the last.  Believe me when I say this is a good thing because you will be ending up dying horribly more often than not.\n\nPosition matters!!  Where you jump into the sector and how you have your formation could mean the difference between a bad or a good battle.\n\nHuge variety of weapons.  This actually plays an important part of your strategy since some turrets shoot farther than others.   You could even place shorter range burst fire guns on your ship to destroy your opponents as you warp in right on top of them to gain the advantage!\n\nThere is only one bad thing that I can note:\n\nOnce in a while, there are times where you will die no matter what you do.  Example:  I got caught in an EMP storm right before the tough boss battle and I could not move and had to wait 4 times straight in the same sector  before being overwhelmed by enemy ship battles.\n\nHere is my gameplay video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aFKv7mQmPdQ\n\nOver 20 hours played as of this writing and I still haven't beaten the "easy" mode difficulty.

It's amazing how uninteresting and plain this game about spaceships fighting in space is.\n\nShip customization is very limited, and unlocking new ships is quite a grind.\nThe combat is mundane, feels more like a chore more than anything with very little tactical depth besides the basic "Move X to Y behind Z to shield X from damage".\n\nAlmost all systems are identical, with "hazard" systems (Black holes/asteroids/nebulae) appearing from time to time. You could be forgiven to not even notice, as they don't add all that much to the gameplay.\nThe game boils down to you bunny hopping between systems with little motivation besides the "game says I have to" from point A to point B with little interesting action in-between, perhaps buying a max of two, painfully slow, additional ships for that impressive "meh" effect on the gameplay. Maybe you get some random item drop in your adventures, to make some numbers that pop up in "combat" slightly bigger. Unless its missiles, those things are borderline useless because everything shoots them.\n\nI played my fair share of SPAZ, FTL and a couple other similar top-down space games and I loved the experience, sadly this title kept me interested for about 60 minutes before I started wondering whether it's really worth ~£6.\nI mean, £6 is a small kebab.\n","March 1","false","1.6"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

Is there a clever IA? No, sir. Is the map well designed? No, sir. Is it possible to implement good strategic thinking? No at first, neither later.

The second possibility is when you are thinking you´re doing really well and reach the third fase, suddenly and with no clue about what the f*** is going on Two massive ships cleverly named "Nemesis" pops up just in front your ships saying you "You gonna die!".

I was very much surprised to know Battlestation: Harbinger is a port from a mobile game because in all my time with it I never ever noticed any sign of how it must have been a mobile game (I only got to know it after playing it). It's a roguelike space battles game, it's Convoy in space if you ever played that game. You pick up an initial spaceship, you explore the galaxy with a main mission at hand (these variate whenever you start a new game), improve your ship, buy new ships for your fleet and defeat the opponents. After that collect the experience and go in again maybe with a different ship you unlocked by playing previously. The replay value is considerable if you intend to unlock all the available ships in the game.\n\nI made a laid back review video, you're welcome to watch it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbvdN-jcNug&list=PLBqXrq67D6ooHk9drYSFDxURYRMCCUc-v&index=1","February 24","true","3.3"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

The downside is that you have to level up which takes time but it still allows for you to have a sense of acomplishment. Once you get to be a high enough level wherein you get carriers the game gets pretty easy because bolter ships are OP at protecting you against any kind of hit minus lazers. Its a pretty good game with basic balanceing (with excpetion to the 1 race that seems to be OP as hell) and you can adapt your prefered playstyle pretty easily depending on the ships you want to have with you.\n\nMy only 3 complaints.\n\n-My first complaint is that even when transitioning to systems and you choose where you pop out can vary widely. More often then not I find that I spawn right on top of or in VERY close proximity to everything around the center of the map. The reason it sucks is becasue once you hit stage 4 the 2-4 starbases with 1-4 ships quickly melt your fleet like there is no tomorow.\n\n-My second complaint is that you can only have 3 ships with you at a time. I understand why when it comes to balancing but It was also a pretty big let down especially since you tend to stack scrap and it quickly becomes nothing but bonus points used to help level you up.\n\n-My third complaint is that the ships dont stick to the formation you set them at when you move them. It would be nice to have them stick to the formation and maybe be able to choose what direction they hault motion at. When you change maps your first ship will be stationed in the center of the circle and will nudge any other ship out of position. Your ship also tends to place itself on the outskirts when moving them as a group which will make it vulnerable and in later levels easily end your game. Though you could always micro manage them which can be very annoying though nessasary at times.\n\nIf you like roguelike space travel with sort of RPG elementsv and the ability to customize your ships loadouts its a pretty easy buy especially if you can get it on sale.

The downside is that you have to level up which takes time but it still allows for you to have a sense of acomplishment. Once you get to be a high enough level wherein you get carriers the game gets pretty easy because bolter ships are OP at protecting you against any kind of hit minus lazers. Its a pretty good game with basic balanceing (with excpetion to the 1 race that seems to be OP as hell) and you can adapt your prefered playstyle pretty easily depending on the ships you want to have with you.\n\nMy only 3 complaints.\n\n-My first complaint is that even when transitioning to systems and you choose where you pop out can vary widely. More often then not I find that I spawn right on top of or in VERY close proximity to everything around the center of the map. The reason it sucks is becasue once you hit stage 4 the 2-4 starbases with 1-4 ships quickly melt your fleet like there is no tomorow.\n\n-My second complaint is that you can only have 3 ships with you at a time. I understand why when it comes to balancing but It was also a pretty big let down especially since you tend to stack scrap and it quickly becomes nothing but bonus points used to help level you up.\n\n-My third complaint is that the ships dont stick to the formation you set them at when you move them. It would be nice to have them stick to the formation and maybe be able to choose what direction they hault motion at. When you change maps your first ship will be stationed in the center of the circle and will nudge any other ship out of position. Your ship also tends to place itself on the outskirts when moving them as a group which will make it vulnerable and in later levels easily end your game. Though you could always micro manage them which can be very annoying though nessasary at times.\n\nIf you like roguelike space travel with sort of RPG elementsv and the ability to customize your ships loadouts its a pretty easy buy especially if you can get it on sale. I look forward to future updates where they add some features to the formation aspect, more ship, increased fleet size, more weapons (its pretty limited atm) and something that you can use your scrap for in the late game (kinda useless once youve unlocked all the ships) because managing to get 200k scrap banked away for points is annoying to say the least.","March 10","true","52.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is built on pretty simple mechanics - a turn-based strategic map to move around the galaxy coupled with real-time battles in any sector where you run into enemies.  There are also some anomalies, like black holes and asteroids, that make traversing the galaxy a little more challenging.  It's easy to pick a ship and equip it but there's a lot to learn to get good at the game.  Each ship has a set number of up to three different types of mount points for weapons and equipment.  Learning the strengths and weaknesses of each ship and weapon takes some time but the process is really fun.\n\nYou continue by fighting battles, completing missions, and collecting scrap and upgrade parts to buy new or upgrade existing items, and to add support ships to your fleet (which you also have to equip/upgrade).  As you gain experience, you unlock better ships, allowing you to survive into more difficult stages of the game.  There's a variety of alien races, each of which has a variety of ships and battlestations, so the gameplay doesn't get boring.\n\nMy overall conclusion: this is an incredibly fun game and I highly recommend it.  However, it's important to note that it requiress a bit of an investment of time and commitment to learning curve to get the most out of the game.  Anyone looking for an arcade-style space game like a twin-stick shooter should pass on this one.  However, if you're looking for a game that's relatively simple to get started yet offers a great deal of depth in learning to play well, this game is definitely for you.

You get 1000 points automatically just for choosing hard mode. Once you get Carriers will lots of weapon mounts, the game becomes a lot easier.\n\n---\n\nGreat little 2D space action game for fans of S.P.A.Z. or Gratuitous Space Battles. The combat is simple but has some depth, and the ship customization is deeper than you'd expect. Each ship has a unique combination of firepower, speed, and toughness that makes the choice a bit meaningful.\n\nThere are a few enemy types to encounter and nothing is more satisfying that watching a barrage of your own guns wallop an enemy fleet; battles usually last less than a minute but are kind of thrilling while they do.

A little hollow as a game, but may satisfy your needs, so could be worth a try (if not necessarily the asking price). Details below.\n\nI like space a lot, and what I need is a worry-free casual singleplayer game with persistent progress and some challenge. A simple rogue-like/lite should fit the bill.\n\nBattlestation: Harbinger promises to be just that, and it has been okay so far. I tried Endless Sky and Destination Sol first (both free, check 'em out), but in those you are the pilot, not a captain/commander, so they get more involved. I prefer to command, unless we're talking Elite/Freelancer.\n\nWhat this game offers Very basic graphics ("pixel graphics" is a valid art style, but check out the competition; it can be difficult to tell what you and the enemy ships have mounted).\nSimple shipbuilding with hardpoints (weapons and shields (and tp) ONLY) and different ship frames.\nBasic tactical combat (range, vectors, damage types, fleet composition, targeting, pausing, etc.).\nBarebones questing and looting, "vending machine" type.\nA pleasantly loose feel; you can micro but you don't have to, losses are regrettable but not a tragedy.\nRogue-lite levels of challenge. Death is not the end, but it is frequent and unpredictable.\nWhat the game lacks Writing. What little there is does not count as plot or dialogue (see FTL for reference).\nPunch. Bland BGM loop, somehwat unsatisfying GFX (capital ship explosions are pretty sweet, the rest is forgettable).\nExploration. Even randomised grinders benefit from player-world interaction and random encounters beyond pure combat and trading.\nSpeed options faster than "Lazy" and "Leisurely".\nEngine, Sensor and Cloak options for hardpoints. The first especially feels like a big problem.\nIf you have ¤10 and want a serious game like this, I would try FTL first. It has decent writing and humour to back up the rogue-lite random questing and looting. The only caveat is that you must micromanage, which somewhat precludes casual play - unless you don't care about succeeding or enjoy microing immensely. http://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/","March 1","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, obviously I enjoy this game. I've played quite a few hours, and I've gotten my money's worth...\n\nThat said, there's a lot of room for improvement. The balance is way off, for starters. You'll occasionally be so completely outclassed in the early to mid game that it's almost silly. This is even more true at Normal difficulty, which feels crazy difficult. I haven't bothered with "hard" yet. Then, in the late game, you'll find yourself so absurdly overpowered that the enemies don't even have a chance.\n\nThe environmental hazards are either boring or annoying, but never really interesting.\n\nThe ship types aren't diverse enough, There's really no difference to the way the different ships play, aside from starting with hangars and fighters or not. And once you've bought your first formation ship, you'll have covered all your bases.\n\nThe story is barely, barely there, and while it suggests some interesting ideas, it's basically just a few totally ignorable text boxes at the beginning and end of each map.\n\nThe enemies, also, really aren't all that different. Knowing the difference in what weapons they favor is only relevant for the first map, and by then you have the start of a fleet and it doesn't matter at all what weapons your enemies use.\n\nThere is zero element of choice anywhere in this game. The quests are meaninglessly generic.\n\nAlso, why can't I just right-click on enemies to call up the selector wheel that lets me target them with all my ships? Why do I have to click on my ship, then on the enemies?\n\nI feel like the creators came up with an engaging and easy to use set of basic systems. Then they built half a game around those systems. I think this game has a lot of promise, and I'm still enjoying it, but my interest is definitely going to wane way faster than with some of the other games in this genre. I really hope we get to see a sequel that keeps what works about this game and builds a richer world and experience on top of it.","May 7","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Btw, you don't have save points in game (except when you exit the game and come back), so if you die in a sequence, you have to start another sequence, with a new ship of base stat.  Personnally, I like this design, because it makes every decision matters, and is part of the challenge of the game.  Or if you are maso, you will love it when the game tears apart your fleet, ... again and again ... until you git gud. In that regard, it is kind of like dark soul, but at least, you earn experience through each game sequence that you complete, either by dying or succesfully completing the main objective. With more exp and level, you can start a new game sequence on a randomly generated map starting with a better initial spaceship, and repeat the process.  So dying isn't exactly time wasted.\n\nI would really like to see the developper increase the scale of the space battles, that is, giving players more than just 3 ships and adjust the enemy fleet size accordingly to balance things out.  The space battles are already pretty fun, but they can become very epic if only we have more space ships... I mean, more pews, the better\n\nBut Overall, this is a surprisingly deep (as in layers of complexity) space battle simulator (from its simple appearance), as you will have to carefully prepare your fleet, make carefuly space jumps, carefully choosing your battles, make careful battle formation, careful not to die inside as hours long progress went to waste because a single bad space jump landed you too near to a close quarter barrage enemy gunship in the middle of emp storm where your shield is dissabled and you cannot perform an exit jump ... Anyway, careful not to die in space, and still die, cause the game still kills you even if you got gud, cause its challenging like that.  FUN GAME, serious, no sarcasm.\n","April 30","true","90.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good content for the price. However. If this game would have a sequel I would want a deeper weapons variety with more complex ship building and customization. I felt that I had to stick some particular weapons early game and then rush for more ships and few OP weapon for late game. I was hoping that there would be a possibility to establish some mining stations that could be defended and would generate resources. The basic weapons range felt too small and I think should be increased to 300-400ish. Overall I really enjoyed this game and probably get back to it a few times.

Though the game has a variety of guns... that's really all it has. Also, some guns, such as rocket cannons, are far more versatile and powerful than others. There are no other tactical advantages to utilize. All ships move the speed of refrigerated gravy, and there is no way to increase said speed, or bolster the starting hulls to create true assault ships or fast flanking craft. Your fleet is also limited to three ships, the other two of which are drawn from a limited list of support vessels. People keep saying this game is hard, but after you unlock the destroyer, learn the guns and thier functions, and realize that carriers are OP with their bombers and fighter craft, an experienced tactical mind will win this game in about their fifth or sixth playthrough.\n\nReccomended for a quick Rougelike space shooter if you don't have a lot of time to kill, but don't expect Sins of a Solar Empire, or Battlefleet Gothic, level of combat.","May 18","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, obviously I enjoy this game. I've played quite a few hours, and I've gotten my money's worth...\n\nThat said, there's a lot of room for improvement. The balance is way off, for starters. You'll occasionally be so completely outclassed in the early to mid game that it's almost silly. This is even more true at Normal difficulty, which feels crazy difficult. I haven't bothered with "hard" yet. Then, in the late game, you'll find yourself so absurdly overpowered that the enemies don't even have a chance.\n\nThe environmental hazards are either boring or annoying, but never really interesting.\n\nThe ship types aren't diverse enough, There's really no difference to the way the different ships play, aside from starting with hangars and fighters or not. And once you've bought your first formation ship, you'll have covered all your bases.\n\nThe story is barely, barely there, and while it suggests some interesting ideas, it's basically just a few totally ignorable text boxes at the beginning and end of each map.\n\nThe enemies, also, really aren't all that different. Knowing the difference in what weapons they favor is only relevant for the first map, and by then you have the start of a fleet and it doesn't matter at all what weapons your enemies use.\n\nThere is zero element of choice anywhere in this game. The quests are meaninglessly generic.\n\nAlso, why can't I just right-click on enemies to call up the selector wheel that lets me target them with all my ships? Why do I have to click on my ship, then on the enemies?\n\nI feel like the creators came up with an engaging and easy to use set of basic systems. Then they built half a game around those systems. I think this game has a lot of promise, and I'm still enjoying it, but my interest is definitely going to wane way faster than with some of the other games in this genre. I really hope we get to see a sequel that keeps what works about this game and builds a richer world and experience on top of it.","May 7","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Carrier-type ships seem to be the key to winning, or making it past the 3 different galaxies, then to the boss galaxy.\n\nThis game is best described as learning by trial and error. There are certainly lots of helpful forum posts, if you take the time to dig through them, though. It's also quite unforgiving. Once your main ship blows up, that's it. End of game.

My recommendation: Do not start playing on "Easy", but go for at least "Normal" or "Hard". Don't be afraid to die. You get way more XP this way, and start leveling up.\n\nOnce you've got the feel for the different weapons and guerilla tactics (attack, retreat back to a Battlestation where you can repair for free, use distress calls to lure enemies away), it's a relaxing and fun to try to beat the game.\n\nOverall a full buying recommendation!

It's great for a plane/train ride and i enjoy watching ships that outnumber me being destroyed piecemeal with a little prior planning. But don't forget the mouse as this game can be more difficult with just a touchpad.\n\nAnd there is a pause button, if that's something you're worried about.\n\nThis game requires careful planning but still retains a fast pace as most battles are over in 30 seconds. Strategic use of distress signals (a wonderful touch to the game) can finally make an area possible to conquer or end in your defeat as nine capital ships turn in your direction.\n\nYou have the ability to run from battles once your jumpdrive recharges and some levels have solar storms and asteroids that can cripples your shields/ship or your ability to run from battles. However, these can be known ahead of time so it's never like it is in FTL where it's luck of the draw.\n\nAnother great feature that this game does right is you can tell straight out if your rounds are going to connect with the enemy ships rather than FTL's missles and such just passing over the ship. This allows you to change your strategy more fluidly but don't expect it to save you as your ships move like snails.\n\nMy biggest compliment for this game is the ability to see what number of capital ships and fighters inhabit a sector before you jump there as well as where they're located. This is compounded with the ability to choose from nine different areas you can jump to so you can heavily strategize and rearrange your weapons and fleet before you jump.\n\nMy complaints for the game are:\n> Really just two. I wish there was a pansy difficulty that permits save scumming so the loss of a ship (or fleet) after several hours isnt a 'game over.' Sometimes it's fun to just keep destroying, even if it means you arent rewarded. However, this is EASILY overlooked as the game permits leveling which unlocks (occasionally) better ships. Meaning you are rewarded for your efforts even when you lose.\n> I also wish there were more varried enemies or even a way to gain a little intel on enemy fleets within a sector, possibly by buying such information from a mercenary or starport.\n\n-\n\nIf you liked FTL, this game may work for you as it's more rewarding and less random chance but loosely the same formula. If you liked that about FTL then you may find this game too predictable but i still encourage you to give it a two hour chance.","June 5","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
