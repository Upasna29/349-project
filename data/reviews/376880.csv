Within 30 minutes I had a reasonable mastery of controlling my ship and because of the HUD helping me aim, combat is both fast and stupid satisfying.\n\nI need to emphasize this, so please excuse my reptition.  ASTROKILL delivers that feeling of Space Combat in movies but with only the tiniest hint of helping you succeed.  Especially the explosions.  Feels like it's straight out of a movie.\n\nThe only negative thing I could say is the difficulty curve was like a hockey stick.  The difference between the first mission and the second was night and day.  Though this was the case when I played awhile ago.\n\nBottom Line: If I could imagine a Space Combat game, ASTROKILL is my fantasies realized.  It's really fugging satisfying.","May 27","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

This game is amazing but when I found out that it was created by only three people, I realized how truly awesome it is! These graphics blow many games out of the water, which is a fresh change from those developers that pixelate their models and call it done. Gameplay is fun and to the point; which consists of gritty space combat without tedious missions. Sound effects gives the space environment lots of depth and immerses you into the combat. The AI is constantly a challenge to combat with and makes every fight unique and interesting that keeps you on your toes.","May 27","true","10.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is still in early access but I'm excited for its direction so far!\n\nGame Details:\nPilot spacecraft ranging from small, nimble interceptors to heavily armed gunships. In ASTROKILL, you will engage in combat against enemy fighters, capital ships, outposts, freighters, turrets, and even space mines. To succeed in this unforgiving zero-G battlefield, you must master your ship and its weapons. You will blow away spaceships with machine guns, flak cannons, homing missiles, and rail guns. Your Gravity Shield will protect you from enemy fire and even turn their weapons against them.","May 29","true","5.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most space-shooters feel cheapened when they use silly sounding and sillier looking lasers zap and feel weak (looking at you star citizen). Not so with ASTROKILL. The weapons feel "punchy" and and the projectile effects look amazing. Nothing about them feels wasted.\n\nI eagerly away further updates to the game.","May 29","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The flight system will be something that will need practice and time to get used to, but other than that everything seems pretty good so far; especially the graphics!\n\nI'm hoping in the future there will be a lot of new additions to the game.","June 3","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
