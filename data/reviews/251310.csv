Or when you tiptoed along a dimly lit hallway, hoping the monster ahead wouldn't see you in Outlast?  You won't be able to find anything of the sort here.  Eleusis attempts to emulate the successful horror formula of its' predecessors, but falls flat on its' face.  The game manages to take the most annoying tropes of the adventure and horror genres and mash them together to create this mess of a game.\n\nWhen I say "adventure", I use the term very loosely.  The puzzles themselves are few and far between, sandwiched between hours upon hours of endless backtracking between different points in the village.  You find a key in a drawer?  Better check every single door on the map, because you have no clue which building is what.  Oh, you have to collect the ingredients to make a mysterious potion?  They are located at points A, B, C and D, at different corners of the map.  Have fun walking around at an excruciatingly slow pace.  The next stage then makes you visit all of the areas all over again.  Even with the additional, and completely unnecessary, padding, I only managed to squeeze about 4 hours of playtime out of the game (Steam says 2 hours, but I first played on Desura).\n\nOf course, backtracking in itself does not destroy a game.  I've certainly played other titles that were overly reliant on this concept (Dreamfall, anyone?), but most manage to make up the shortcomings with an excellent storyline or logical and engaging puzzles.  Eleusis isn't able to cover either category well.  The storyline is nothing special - some mysterious cult trying to raise an evil god - and the twists and turns can be seen from a mile away.  The puzzles are drab and uninspiring.  Most of them involve searching for keys and the doors they go to.  Those scavenger hunts aren't entirely too bad, but there are far too many logical shortcoming throughout.  Near the start of the game, the protagonist picks up a wood axe.  You'd think the axe would be able to chop through all of the locked wooden doors, wouldn't you?  Nope, it's only used for shimmying a hose off a faucet.  Eventually, the main character creates a pair of lockpicks, using on the simple tools at hand.   The problem?  You guessed it.  The lockpicks only work on a single door in the entire game.  The game is also plagued with knee-high gates, but, being locked, somehow create a infinitely tall boundaries that magically prevents the protagonist from even thinking about walking over.\n\nI have to admit that not everything about Eleusis is terrible.  The overall lighting, with the exception of the overly reflective rocks in several areas (thanks to the UDK engine), is certainly reminiscent of other survival horror games.  The spooky ambient noises are fitting and the great graphics in general work well to establish a creepy atmosphere.  Unfortunately, those two points are essentially the only highlights to this dull and predictable adventure,\n\nI agree with one of the other reviewers here.  This game just feels like some kind of tech demo or portfolio project.  It just doesn't feel like the developer made an honest effort to create a full fledged game.  As such, I would advise to stay far, far away from this game.","December 8, 2013","false","1.8"," 224 of 260 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","224","260","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heolYEAH/recommended/251310/","heolYEAH","Queenie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heolYEAH/","903 products in account","I was really excited to play this game, long time ago I read about the Eleusinian Mysteries, and seeing this is based on that, it peaked my interest.\n\nOnce I started the game, I thought 'wow, this actually looks good, compared to other games in this genre'. And it does, the graphics are really nice and detailed. Same goes for the sound and music, there's not too much distracting music playing, on the few occasions it does, it is very fitting. Other than that you hear your footsteps and the enviroment around you, i.e. water, etc., big plus on atmosphere.\nHowever, once I advanced a bit in Chapter one, I started to get annoyed. The fov is horrible. Paths are barely visible, even with a flashlight.\nAfter solving my first puzzle, I thought it can't get much worse. Wrong. Throughout the game there's no innovative new puzzles, it's always the same. The most annoying part is the running around back and forth (yes, through the whole map) you HAVE to do. It gets really, really frustrating after a while. Imagine finding a key and having to try pretty much every single door to find the lock it fits in.\n\nWhen I started I checked the NPC thread option, the first time something pops up, sure it was a bit freaky, but that's it. After that the ecounters became predictable and annoying. Now comes one of the worst things about Eleusis: no manual saves, so enjoy running back and forth again if you go game over.\n\nThe game lenght is decent, it takes about four hours to finish it. Without the useless backtracking you could easily complete it in less than half of that time. So keep that in mind. There's nothing exciting about 'exploring', in Eleusis it feels like your wife or mother telling you to take out the trash a hundred times a day.\n\nSo, in the end the story didn't intrigue me in the way I was expecting. Eleusis was predictable, boring and very, very annoying. I am glad I didn't buy this full price, and neither should you.","December 21, 2013","false","6.4"," 122 of 145 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","122","145","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/251310/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I hate walking.\n\nNo I don't mean that in the lazy, "I'd rather sit on my bum and play video games all day" sort of way, but the act of slowly moving your legs instead of opting to run when the situation demands it. So it would stand to reason that I sort of hate Eleusis, a game that consists of 80% mundanely walking at the speed of a crippled elderly person to various points on your map, with the rest being filled in with so many terrible design decisions that I struggled to remember them all.\n\nEleusis opens with your character being summoned by his mother to visit his hometown. On the way there his car is struck by a cascading boulder, and he has no choice but to leave his vehicle and explore the area around him, which soon leads him to a creepy abandoned village, where everything is miles apart and key objects scattered around in the most convoluted of places.\n\nAnd this is where you come in, being the newly appointed hidden object finder, tasked with searching what remains of the village to find various tools and keys and use them to make your way past so many locked doors in order to find more doodads and unlock more doors. It's essentially an adventure game, but the puzzles are so obtuse and confusing that it feels like little more than one tedious fetch quest. Only minutes into the game I was already reaching for a guide, as absolutely nothing is done to direct the player, and progression often depends on clicking on the one item out of a dozen that is usable as opposed to needlessly moved around (which even then is restricted to certain items, making it an even more baffling inclusion that is never used for anything meaningful). And of course, all of this sends you walking back and forth across the map, often requiring repeat trips and trial and error as so little is labeled meaningfully, and getting lost is incredibly easy with how little you can see and how tangled the maze of trails becomes.\n\nThis might not be nearly as dull as it is though if Eleusis's world wasn't at least three times larger than it needs to be and filled so sparingly with anything consequential. The size of the map might also be connected to the horrendous performance I received on a PC that is more than capable of running the game, which graphically consists of little more than bland textures, pop-in prone foliage, and embarrassing particle effects. There are moments when the darkness almost makes everything look decent, but it's merely an illusion quickly discarded when a light is passed over whatever you may be viewing.\n\nI don't feel the need to delve much into the narrative, as it's so sparse and comprised of so many disconnected strands that you'd almost forget it was there, if not for the requirement to read through long passages of text in find the clue not so subtlety hidden among the rambles. Your character's motivations are never explained, the plot is paper thin, and the ending notable only for the reprieve it gives you from such a horrendous experience.\n\nIf you are expecting a horror game, clever puzzles, a decent narrative, or even just some decent eye candy, you will find none of it here. Eleusis is a failure of a game that I can only recommend as an example for aspiring developers at how badly you can screw up a first person adventure game. For everyone else, be glad you have yet to take part in this experience, and for those who already have you have my sympathy.","August 22, 2014","false","4.5"," 58 of 73 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","58","73","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hackeddontcontact/recommended/251310/","hackeddontcontact","kiz038","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hackeddontcontact/","607 products in account","The most boring game ever.\n\nEverything is slow and there is no excitement to anything. Make sure to turn "NPC Threats" off, because the only enemies are wolves that spawn when you pick up key items, and walking away from these wolves is pretty much the game forcing you to backtrack in order to despawn them which makes them just a waste of time. The setting is really dull too and moving around in it is clunky due to the bad controls. The worst part about the game is the gameplay itself, which is nothing but walking around in a large but empty world at a very slow pace. This makes finding items for puzzles and then bringing them to where you think they would work a major pain.\n\nAbout the puzzles: They are garbage. The game's progression is tied to you picking up one specific item after another, you pick an item up just to use it on the next item which will then let you do something to get another item. Missed an item? Better search everywhere while moving like a snail. Most of your time will be spent walking around an empty area clicking on everything to find that one item you need. Also, good luck finding the matches. Putting them inside a 80% opacity glass case on top of a grave was not the best idea.\n\nBy the way, the game is not scary.\n\nEDIT: I read the Steam Store page for this game and got angry, so I'm gonna pick apart each point.\n\n--High detailed realistic graphics.\nNot really. The village itself is very boring and weird-looking (many of the houses are one room for some reason), and the forest area is plagued by bad pop-in problems with shadows. The same 3 moveable rocks are repeated throughout the whole game. The lighting is alright.\n\n--Explore open environment with realistic physics in the Greek countryside.\n"Realistic physics"? You mean like how you can put a chair through a solid wall if you move quick enough? How about whenever something moves along the floor or touches the floor, it makes the same sound at the same volume like 20 times in a row really fast and sounds like ♥♥♥♥? The rocks are easier to throw than a glass jar in this game. Also, can you really call it an "open environment" when 90% of all the houses and buildings are locked?\n\n--Use stealth tactics and agility to survive.\n"Stealth tactics" is wrong, it is a blatant lie. There is no stealth in this game, enemies show up out of nowhere and you'll never see them before they see you and start chasing you. And there is no running in this game, you walk and enemies walk at about the same speed. They chase you at a walking pace until the game decides to give up and despawn the enemy.\n\n--Use physics-based objects to defend yourself.\nThis statement is solely meant to cover for the lies of the previous statement since running away and stealth are not an option to anyone who doesn't want to backtrack even more than they have to.\n\n--Challenging item–based Puzzles with simple interface.\nI already discussed the puzzles and why they suck, but the interface is also bad. You get like 12 item slots but you'll never come close to filling that since you use items after getting them. It looks and feels ugly and rushed.\n\n--Dark atmosphere with eerie sounds.\nWhat "eerie sounds"? That doesn't even make sense because there are no eerie sounds at all, or anything close to that description. Also the dark atmosphere is not something to be proud of since it makes no sense either. The moonlight is so strong that it creates lightrays around every object, but  everything on the ground is still pitch-black???\n\n--Original storyline\nSonic fanfictions are also "original storylines", this is yet another meaningless statement.\n\nDon't buy it, not even on sale.","May 16, 2014","false","2.0"," 66 of 86 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","66","86","2","1"

The story was pretty promising, as someone who's into Mythology, and it game would revolve around it.\nSo, le'ts get on with it! I\nt's advertised as "a story-driven game with emphasis on exploration, information gathering and also includes horror-survival elements". Let's just get the "horror-survival elements" out of the way. It is in no way, a survival horror game, that must have been what they've stuck to it since every youtuber and their dog screamed whenever they stepped on a stick. They give you a flashlight. With batteries. Hmmm, surely, I must scavenge for more batteries after these are over. Well... not really. They feel like it's a good idea to give you an unlimited lantern, that lights waaaay more than the said "essential" flashlight. Seriously, if you're going to give us a better lighting tool, don't give us the flashlight at all, it makes no freaking sense! Oh, and I've only found one pack of flashlight batteries anyway, which, of course, I didn't use... it's pointless, really.\n\nOnwards to the "exploration, information gathering": Well, since the whole game is set at night, you can't really see much, which makes for a monotous walk through the forest, and that's your exploration. I'll admit I liked the artstyle, and the village, but there's virtually nothing to explore in the game. You have a semi open-world, but it's essentially a forest, and there's no point to explore on your own, since you'll go everywhere along with the story. I'd have loved to do some exploration, but there was no point, there was nothing to explore.\n\n"story-driven"... this one hurts, I'm sorry to say, but it really does. There's almost no story presented through gameplay... which, well, find it on youtube. As you go from place to place looking for items (I'll get there in a minute), there's no story to be told. Until you reach an house, that is, in which you'll get the feel for the story through some notes, and that alone. Almost every bit of story in this games, is given to you through text. It just feels out of place, and that text is always next to the item you need to progress the game, so there goes exploration, right? Look at Bioshock! The world itself tells the overall story, and those audiologs, just give us the background and some interesting details to complete the world.\nNow... the gameplay. This is essentially a First Person Point n' Click game! The puzzles are just "Go there a get this, then come back and use that with this..." and so on and so forth. And they feel like they're designed to extend the game's longevity, since you're constantly walking back and forth from one place to the one on the other edge of the map. And it's not fun. It's simply NOT fun... and neither is it scary, there's nothing scary about the game, unless you're afraid of the dark.\nI could say a lot about how senseless some "puzzles" were, but I feel like I'm going too hard at the game.\nThe supposedly scary/stealthy part would be when you have to run from wolves (which appear out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere whenever you pick a piece of the final puzzle) or from a patroling cultist. Aaaand it's awkward. Painfully so.\n\nNow, the only praise I can give to this game, is its looks, and the story potential (maybe?). To the developpers: if you're making a game and you CAN'T do something right, don't do it at all. Do something else. Because, what we get here, is a game that could be so much better than what it is, but it falls flat on its face because of badly implemented features!\n\nMaybe in future titles Nocturnal Nights will shine, and I'll give them another chance. It's just that this game in particular was really bad in my opinion. Full of bad design choices, seemingly to jump on the "survival horror" bandwagon that's been going on lately.\n\n","November 30, 2013","false","3.7"," 65 of 90 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","65","90","0","0"

Lets stay there for a night, shall we?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nEleusis was developed and published by Nocturnal Works in October 2013. It is a puzzle based 3D adventure indie game for Windows and runs on the Unreal Engine.\n\nThe story twirls around a nameless protagonist who got a letter from his mother, living in a village called "Eleusis" -the eponym for the game- in Greece. She wishes to speak to him in person to talk about his father and so the character sets out for visiting his mother by car. On the long way at the road a huge stone rolls down the scarp, crashing into the vehicle and then... nothing but darkness. After a while the character comes back to his senses and has unfortunately to realise that his car is demolished and that he has to continue his way afoot. Arriving at his destination through a near shortcut, the protagonist seems to be all by himself, not a single living soul to be seen, not even his mother. But things never turn out the way somebody would expect and so the character finds himself in the middle of a long forgotten cult, which wants to summon something more sinister than earth could imagine.\nThis village exists also in reallife near Athen, now called Elefsina and is known for the Mysteries of Eleusis, one of the many cults in the greek religion. Eleusis makes use of this fact and also implements parts of the actual mythology in its story.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are similar to games like Amnesia or Penumbra. The player has to discover everything in order to find more clues about what could have happen in the village. While doing so, there are also puzzles to solve. Either through finding keys or combining items. This is not possible in the inventory itself unfortunately, but if the player equips for example a shovel, he can use it on piles of dirt around the map. This works with every other item in the inventory. A lantern and flashlight will light the way in the darkness, but only the flashlight needs resources in form of batteries.\nThreats such as wolfes and priests, are lurking around the corner, ready to kill the protagonist. Stones and other objects are most of the time physic-based and can be thrown at the creatures to keep them at distance, while finding a place to hide. Stealth tactics are mentioned but not particularly needed. Running away and hiding in one of the houses is mostly the solution to the problem behind the back, especially when wolfes chase the player. Mentionable is the option to turn off enemies in the options, which simplifies the games but bores it likewise, So it is recommended to keep it on for the own enjoyment and to experience the full atmosphere of Eleusis.\nTo keep track of what the player is doing, Eleusis offers a journal and later on a map. Mostly everything found on the journey will be written down in the book, including important things which can be read in other books and letters. However, sometimes it is not clear what could be the possible next step and is the reason for most of the negative reviews. It is absolutely necessary to be focused all the time and also to keep an eye and ear open for more hints. Yet, Eleusis promotes itself as a challenge and at some point it will be proved right. The idea to emphasis the player on exploration and information gathering is not new and always welcome in games of this genre, but letting the player stumble in the dark for too long without any hints can destroy the fun and take away the patience to search any further for unknown information and ways.\n\nGraphicwise Eleusis cuts out a fine figure and starts out to be very atmospheric. Everything on the map is very detailed and pleasant to look at, as expected from the Unreal Engine. Ambient lighting from both, flashlight and lantern, contribute their own feature to the atmosphere. The flashlight has a smaller area it can illuminate, but adds some more fear factor while the lantern gives a cozy feeling through the huge area it warmly illuminates. Nothing incredible stunning and also nothing that gamers have not seen but still, the stifling atmosphere and greatly designed surrounding speaks for itself and has the possiblity to mesmerize the player.\n\nEleusis maintains a low profile in terms of sound, which is not particularly bad. Footsteps of the character follows wherever he goes, sound of cicades, some creaking here, a windblow there but overall it underlines the dead atmosphere of the village. Threats like the wolfes growl, but the stalking and chasing priests are more or less silent, what throws a potential fear factor just over board. Yet, the voice acting in cutscenes is greatly done. Why Nocturnal Works did not took this completely over into the actual gameplay remains a mysterie. Overall, the sound does its job and it is surely nothing to sneeze at.\n\nThe controls remind a lot of similar adventure games like Amnesia or Layer of Fear. By holding the left mouse button on certain objects or doors the character grabs it, moving the mouse forward or backward opens and closes doors /drawers/chests and when holding an item and pressing the right mouse button the protagonist throws the object away. It is fun to mess around with objects and also necessary to throw for example stones or bottles at threats to keep them at distance.\n\nTo cut a long story short; Eleusis will not always hold the hand of the player and can get tricky at some point, but overall the gameplay mechanics, great atmosphere and mythology based story compensates this problem. For everyone, who is still unsure if he will enjoy this game can also wait for a sale or a bundle deal.\n\nRecommended!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAs a lover of this genre I can not recommend this game enough. Sure, it is short and tricky as already mentioned in the review, but the atmosphere alone was worth for me to beat the hell out of this game. In the end, I finished Eleusis in around 3.5 hours and was overall happy with both endings. Sadly, it has no replay value but maybe I will come back to it to replay it in the future, just to enjoy the story again.\n\nFor fans of games like Amnesia, Penumbra or Layer of Fear absolutely worth the purchase!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Storyline based on reallife facts/greece mythology\n[✔] Phsyic based objects to use against enemies\n[✔] Very detailed graphics and stifling atmosphere\n[✔] Threads can be turned off in the option menu\n\n[✖] Only two kind of threats (wolf and priests)\n[✖] Puzzles itself too easy\n[✖] Hard to find the next objective, when journal is not updated\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR7J0rpJSR8\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

The game was a bit too linear for an adventure and the clues left in game, made it almost too easy to progress through.  It could have been better with more content in it, some of which could have made the main story line a bit less easy to follow to quickly through.

At first I thought I might have grabbed it during the Halloween Sale, but no... no I hadn't. Instead, I purchased this game in the Be Mine 8 Indy Bundle several months ago.\n\nSeemingly they added Steam keys to that bundle, and I had redeemed it blidnly and totally forgot about the game until Steam Roulette picked it for the next game in the Backlog Blitz. So, that's the backstory into why I have this in my Steam Library. It also helps set the scene for the review.\n\nThis game is pretty awful.\n\nI don't want to be harsh, but there's no real positive to this game. The story is disjointed and paper thin - and you'll see whatever surprise it suggets it might have coming a mile away.\nThe controls are OK, but they're basic WSAD controls and mouse look. I guess it uses the Unreal Development Kit nicely, as at times the game does look nice. However, that's probably it.\n\nEverything about this game screams 'portfolio project' - a game that was made in an attempt to showcase talent in an attempt to get a job with a studio in the future.

It's just not engaging enough.\n\nYou'd probably be able to finish this game in 2 hours, if it wasn't for the horrible back and forth backtracking the game MAKES you do, and the frustratingly placed enemies that suddenly appear out of nowhere and hunt you down.\n\nOverall just avoid this game, don't even buy it as a temptation to see how terrible it is.

It is totally a waste of your precious time.","May 14, 2014","false","2.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","0"

The story is decent and original, and the game is pretty being built with the Unreal Development Kit. Everything else is horrible though. The controls are tank controls. The movement speed of the main character needs to be fixed; running actually feels like walking, and walking actually feels like crawling. NPCs in this game are just there to annoy you and really don't feel like a threat. If you don't have a rock on you at all times, expect to die alot, so just turn NPC combat off. Puzzles are either clear and easy or unclear and just difficult. It would have been nice if they would have put more thought into them.\n\nOverall, avoid buying this game. Save your money, go download a decent Amenesia mod and have fun with that.","May 15, 2014","false","2.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

Looks great. It is a straight up adventure game, with some "scares" during cutscenes. It kind of seemed like it would be more of a survival horror thing, but it really isn't-- you're alone on the map.\n\nIt's mostly environment exploration, the puzzles are very basic, but the hard part is actually finding or identifying the items you need most of the time, or where what door and what house the keys go to. It's a little bad at this, and especially all the backtracking, or walking back and forth between the locations to find and use items, as mostly all the items in the game are at like opposite ends of the game world than where you need to use it. You get a map towards the very end of the game, just when you really don't need it anymore because you've just about figured out where all the paths take you and explored all the locations. So that's a bit dumb.\n\nThere is a final five piece "fetch puzzle" towards the very end where you got five locations on the map, and that's really the usage of the map, to point to those five places in all the very ends of the map. It's not for navigating or familiarizing yourself with the game world. That part was really annoying and kind of soured me on the game right as the ending was coming up.\n\nBut overall I really enjoyed this.

Everything can be figured out without the use of any walkthrough unlike alot of these kinds of games.  BUT, the end was beyond disappointing.

I'm gonna go back in there and look again to make sure, but I really did not see where my other "choices" were.\n\nAnd another thing I really did not like about this game....  Save points.  Why in the world would you make a game like this and not allow a player to save the game when they need to?\n\nBottom line is, I would recommend it if its on sale for very cheap.

I don't mind slow paced exploration in this game that many people have adressed in their reviews. What is annoying is the lack of guidance (not even the books you might find in the game help you find those buried missing pieces). Trying to throw rocks at the enemies didn't feel rewarding part of the game. Because of these flaws, after a frustrating couple hours, I ended up playing the game through using a walkthrough NPC enemies turned off (excellent decision to have a button for that in launcher). Graphics are mostly well done and create eerie atmosphere, on the other hand awful character animation and skinning totally destroy it. In sound design there seems to be many glitches left (try to open a cupboard with spoons inside and you know what I mean). Level design could have been improved by highlighting points of interests with different textures and lighting. The mythology used in the game is interesting but could have been explored more thoroughly.","May 18, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a project with potential, but I sadly cannot recommend it. I completed the game in six hours, and a good portion of that was spent wandering around trying to figure out what to do next. A lack of hand holding is one thing, but providing little to no direction is quite another. But the big thing is that for me at least, Eleusis just isn't scary. And that's a pretty big failing for a horror game. Nearly all hostile encounters are scripted and you can clearly tell when you're in danger and when you're not. The plot is pretty thin and I saw the big twist at the end coming from a mile away. Maybe if the devs had had more time, money and/or staff, this could have been better, but as is I can't give it my seal of approval.","March 19","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The enemies in this game are incredibly annoying these encounters end up like slowed down versions of a Benny Hill sketch, until you just give up and accept your death. However there is the option to turn off the enemies which is an improvement but at that point the game just become a 1st person point and click adventure. There is a reason that point and click adventures are not usually 1st person, it is one thing attempting to use every item in your inventory with every object in a couple of screens it is quite another to do the same wandering through an entire village and surrounding forest. That is the defining characteristic of this game: the aimlessly wandering about. Oh and if you get bored of wandering about and want to take a break there is no manual save. The amount of playtime you will get out of this game will very upon on how much tolerance you have for this aimlessly meandering about before you look for a walkthrough; I had little patience for this game so only got 2 and a half hours out of this game.","April 5, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I tried playing it on a laptop that's around minimum spec (2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo, nVidia G210m, 4 GB RAM), had to turn all FX off and set the resolution to 800x600 to get it to run smoothly, and it still overheated my hardware.  I could continue on my desktop, but I don't believe it'd be worth it.  Gameplay (up to half an hour in) consists largely of scavenging for tools in a needlessly large and dismally lit environment, which grew tedious even in the brief time I spent on it.  It didn't help that the scenery is fairly repetitive, or that the command to interact with items often produces no response.

You survived, but now you're alone in a dark eerie forest with only a flashlight and a journal.\n\nThe creepy looking visuals and ambient atmosphere gave off a nice unsettling mood that looked very promising.\n\nAnd as you wander through the forest, you come across a seemingly empty village. And find a woman locked into a small cabin and asked you to let her out. You decide to help her and as you explore the village after something of use, mysterious people in robes, belonging to some cult, seemed to inhabit the village. They even managed to capture you and was about to bury you alive in a coffin, until you lifted off the lid and scared off the little guy.\n\nThe rest of the story pretty much involves you chasing after the mysterious woman and uncovering the story behind the village.\n\nToo bad the developers thought that it would be a good idea to give us a HUGE area with random items scattered around, that happens to be vital for progressing the game, without no sense of direction.\n\nThe first problem you will come across is that you find a dark room and your flashlight doesn't work because it ran out of batteries after 5-10 minutes of use. Fortunatley, you find a generator... with no gas in it.\n\nSo in order to refill it, you need to find:\n\nA small hose stuck on a tap, that can easily be overlooked. And a jerrycan, that is stuck on a branch in a small river.\nIn order to extract the gas from a parked Vespa that is parked next to a staircase, that could also be easily overlooked.\n\nRemember that, these items are scattered in this big forest and you have no idea were to find these items. And did i mention that you also run VERY slow. Discuraging any kind of exploration, which is something that you have to do constantly.\n\nAnd after you've progressed through a certain point, f..king wolfs will start chasing you and kill you as soon as they touch you. They are also extremely hard to avoid because your character is as slow as a turtle. And they also appear in the worst possible occasion, like blocking a small path from a dead end. And even if you manage to pass it, the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keeps chasing you until you reach a safe heaven like in a house or village.\n\nSomething that also bothers me is that there is no appearent motive as to why we're able to pick up random items that doesn't seem to contain any appearent purpose. I mean, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO PICK UP SOME ASHES!?!??!\n\nThe story is also bland and unfulfilling. Although the little voice-acting that we got from from all the characters is also quite descent.\n\nThis game had potential, but wasn't executed very well.\nIf you are looking for a descent horror game, then this game is not for you.\nI would recommend you to buy either Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast or a "free to play" game called Spookys House of Jumpscares.","January 8","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Eleusis just felt like more of the same in regards to first person horror, albeit reasonably crafted more of the same. Car breakdown? Check. Disempowerment early on? Check. Mysterious supernatural weirdness going on? Check and double check.\n\nTo its credit, Eleusis looks pretty good visually. The environments feel natural enough as well, if a bit spread out. Thing is, the aimlessness of a lot of your searching, coupled with the cheapness of the things that -can- end your run once they start showing up, makes the whole struggle feel not all that worthwhile.  And struggle you will, as it takes a bit to get a feel for the map, and again, those cheap spawns of critters (and at least one dude) who feel like they have way more reach than they should.\n\nOnce you get used to running like hell and whatnot, however, it's not too much of a hassle aside from finding some of the last items you need in the game. Expect to look down a lot, and have fun randomly slamming items together to get to that point in the first place. Things start getting unclear once you're in the second chapter, to put it kindly.\n\nIf you've got a few bucks and want a slightly interesting story, maybe give Eleusis a chance, but it's not something very high-priority, whether or not you're a horror fan.","January 20","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They appear to have vanished into the void, beyond the realms of my PC's feeble human mind. Clearly, that was the real conspiracy in this village -a bunch of cultists who just aren't very good at killing trespassers and covering up the evidence (the coffin wasn't even NAILED SHUT PROPERLY, guys!) trying to figure out where om earth this mythical blacksmith was supposed to be.\n\nThis game has the rather dubious honour of being the first one I've ever refunded on steam. It had potential  -a horror game based in Europe, on an urban legend? Yes please, that sounds right up my alley! But this fell unfortunately short.\n\nSeveral of the games primary mechanics glitched for me -the torch never appeared in my trunk or inventory and the oil can got jammed in the river. I was unable to locate certain areas that should have been easy to find -specifically, the infamous blacksmith- my character continually got stuck on the geometry, puzzles were unintuitive, and the story, what little of it I saw, felt hackneyed.\n\nFor the positives, the game did have a good atmosphere when it worked. The character models were not particularly stunning, but the setting was creepy and moody.  The game looks fine -the graphics are decent, if rather samey, and the experience is somewhat improved if you play with NPC encounters turned on. Though that said, these NPC's are ugly, badly animated, and encounters rarely add to the horror of the situation. They are more of an annoyance than a credible threat\n\nUnder other circumstances, and with fewer bugs, this could've been a game I found entertaining, if not memorable, but the bugs simply pushed it over the edge for me.\n","January 28","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will give it a positive though... The controls felt pretty nice. I can see where the developers wanted this game to go. Sadly, it missed.. By a long shot.

The areas are all so similar when you find yourself realizing you need to go back to an earlier area (and this will happen very often) you will end up scratching your head and wondering where exactly it was.

There was an unhealthy amount of backtracking and some of the items (the box of matches and the lockpick wire) were hidden in stupidly obscure areas.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nConcerning the ending, if the cultists needed the protagonist to channel Typhoeus, why were there cultists trying to kill him for most of the game? I don't buy the 'test' excuse as having the main character dead would prevent the resurecction. This means that for the game to make sence, the NPC threats option in the menu has to be turned off, which is not the way the game is supposed to be played!\n\nWith the indie market flooded with cheap horror titles, it's starting to get very difficult to choose which ones are worth your time. This unfortunately isn't one that will scare and enthrall players and I feel bad that I contributed towards getting this greenlit when it clearly wasn't something that gamers wanted or needed.

Of course, it's not nearly as difficult or long as Myst, but it makes it up with atmosphere and nice(-ish) graphics quite enough.\n\nIt certainly cannot be called "horror" if by that word one means gore, jump-scares and constant hiding from monstrous enemies. Nothing like that here. There are actually only two enemies in Eleusis - a cultist, patrolling the main path, and a wolf, stalking the wilds. Moreover, there is an option to disable them altogether so that they don't annoy you while you run around searching for clues and such. Surely, you can always turn them back on in case the gameplay starts feeling dull.\n\nPlotwise it's pretty much okay with a twist at the very end.
