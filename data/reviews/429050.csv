I have been in games where the Raptor Fish and Bilbos just decimate the whole ecosystem because of their sheer numbers. Crab Madness certainly made a twist on the game as you took on the role of the lowest hunter in the ecosystem, just to become royalty if you managed to survive what the Ocean Map has to throw at you, including the big shark who hunts whatever it wants whenever it wants.\n\nThe game is Difficult, but what is there to expect from a Deathmatch/FFA game? The FFA comes into play when you become a larger fish, since the bigger fish don't have as many predators and therefore don't have as much to worry about much like the smaller fish, who are easier pickings for the big fish.\n\nThe game could use more balances because of how Overpowered the Catfish can be, as a level 5 can eat almost anything without having to tear the fish to pieces.","May 2","true","10.9"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","24","25","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/429050/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Note: Feed and Grow: Fish is currently in Early Access. The version as at time of this review was 0.4.1.\n\nFeed and Grow: Fish is unique: part TPS, part fish simulation, and part just weird!\n\nYou play a small fish and your goal is simple: survive and grow. Other fish are your prey, and you are theirs. You start out small and can only hope to eat the smallest of your companions, while many fish larger than you will chase you down and eat you at every opportunity. Play it safe and smart, though, and you will grow stronger, as well as unlock other fish to play.\n\nYou start with one available fish, but it won't be long until you unlock the next model up, by earning coins through eating and levelling up. Unfortunately, you lose your current fish's level when you are eaten, restarting back at level one on your next respawn. Levelling up increases your HP and bite damage. It would be good if there were a way to save progress to protect any gains you make from an unlucky encounter. At the moment, coins you earn are discarded when you quit the game, too, so there's no long-term progress to be made either.\n\nThere's also no campaign mode or any sort of goal other than the implicit one of surviving and getting bigger through eating other fish. It's fun for a short time, but becomes repetitive fairly quickly. The game includes multiplayer, but I haven't had a chance to play this mode. From reading the Steam discussions I believe it is only LAN-based at the moment, but the developers have mentioned that Internet play is on the cards.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics are bright and colorful. The stars of the game, the fish, are cute and cartoon-like, and are generally well modelled and animated.\n\nThe game currently only includes two levels, but they are quite large and pretty, if a little sparse. The game's graphics convey a good sense of swimming around under water on the tropical level, but the freshwater level doesn't seem quite right; I'd think it should be more of a murky brown than the sparkling clear blue. Also, the environment models and fish are the same on both levels.\n\nSound - At the moment, sound is pretty lacking. There are no GUI sounds while navigating menus and no music whatsoever, including the main menu. In-game sounds are limited to ever-present water sounds, which are okay, but could do with more variation, and an unconvincing bite sound. There's room for improvement here as the game moves through Early Access.\n\nGameplay - Feed and Grow plays like a cross between a 3D first/third-person shooter, such as Descent, and some sort of weird racing game. Gameplay alternates between casually swimming about picking at scattered anemones, to chasing a smaller fish for a tasty bite to eat, to swimming away as fast as you can, 'sprinting' for your very life when a monster of the deep has you in its sights.\n\nSo far there's no in-game tutorial, so once you start the game, you're on your own. Your fish has two actions apart from swimming: bite, to cause damage or grab on to your prey, and eat, to consume something once you've killed it. You can also 'sprint', which lowers your stamina for a short time, and the controls menu hints at further actions that might become available in time. Mouse controls feel a little sluggish, even on the highest sensitivity, and I had a little trouble aiming my bite against the small fish that are your only suitable live prey when you begin; a first-person view when biting might be a useful addition.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Unique and original premise.\n+ Colorful, fun graphics; personable fish.\n+ Stable: I didn't experience any crashing or obvious bugs, which is great, especially for an Early Access game.\n+ Devs are active in Steam discussions and have a number of good ideas for the game. It definitely has potential.\n\nCons:\n- Sounds are lacking.\n- Not enough variation between levels.\n- There's not much to do yet.\n\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================\nFeed and Grow: Fish is unique and I believe it has a lot of potential. I haven't given it a great score at the moment, given that what is here now is a bit limited, but I'm looking forward to future updates and I expect my score to increase as the game develops. I recommend it if you want to play something a bit different, and you're not afraid of Early Access.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 23","true","1.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

This game is very bare bones right now, but I'm super excited about this title.\n\nThis game shows promise. The developers are in communication with the community and are releasing patches and updates.\n\nAs I stated above at this current build you will run out of things to do fairly quickly and probably get bored. But honestly the idea behind this game is pretty awesome. Especially when you start thinking about incorporating multiplayer aspects and various game modes. I can see it now. Different possibilities for this game. I have plenty of my own ideas.\n\nWith a concept so unique and interesting like this I gladly support the devs with my contribution. Can't you see it now? In a huge lake with hundreds of fish and you're competing against real people to become a predator that people run from... Er.. Swim from. I've played 8 or so hours and I've had a blast. While there isn't much to do yet, I can't help myself from looking up things about this game and thinking about the possibilities. This game is very fun. The mechanics are pretty smooth and the graphics are very pleasing. The fish are colorful and unique. It's fun playing as different fish and seeing their unique abilities. I like the leveling system even at its core basic. Just seeing your fish grow into a huge lunker is an amazing feeling.\n\nBuy this game if you like the idea and concept. Just know it's very early in development and the game shows great promise with devs that pay attention to the fan base and take in all sorts of community ideas. They are working on plenty of things and I'm excited about it.\n\n10/10 no regrets would eat starfish again.","February 21","true","19.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","1"

It's one of those games that, if you've grown up with other games like feeding frenzy or the like will appeal to you.  If not, and if you want a fun time-waster then by all means buy this, I found myself letting a hour slip by just having fun chasing and in some cases being chased and finally getting payback on those larger fish later on.\n\nAll in all, don't follow the negative reviews.  This game [outside of any computer issues that they may have themselves] is fine, ran smooth and didn't notice any frame drops.  My computer is about 4 years old, running windows 7, with 8gb ram, 4 vram.  Just a bit of basic info, I believe almost any computer nowadays could run something like this as long as it isn't a toaster.\n\nSo...

The catfish is the main problem, it needs a little better AI for the river map, as it sits under a rock pretty much the whole game refuses to leave. Then when i get a big enough pike or something else to farm the catfish, it gets knocked out of the water and doesn't respawn. One possibility to fish this is to create a timer where entities that have been out of water for over 1 minute die so they can respawn. Apart from that a great addicting game.

You play as a fish and go around eating other fish, and you grow by doing so, eventually being able to play as other, more powerful kinds of fish. You can get REALLY big REALLY fast, which I guess is a product of there being no savegame, one downside. Another thing: I finally got myself on an actual real live multiplayer match, and, drumroll please: it sucked. The lag was horrendous and the game was pretty much unplayable aside from moving around and eating things from time to time, but most times you would just glitch over somewhere within a few seconds of you doing something and get eaten by a fish from the past or something, because while you think one thing is happening, and your environment is frozen, those frozen sardines probably will have eaten you, and once reality stops tearing at the seams you're gonna have a bad time. But when you play feed and grow on your own it's a really fun experience as long as you stay determined. I hope they fix the multiplayer soon. And for all you toddlers who saw your favorite minecraaf youtubers play crab madness and freaked out cause it was so crabby, stop writing reviews based on the fact that an APRIL FOOLS ONLY event ended. It will come back next year, and maybe then you can actually unlock it so you can play it whenever you want. (I'm also aware that crab madness became unavailable to people who got the achievement, but still, quit being a baby about it, and get some better grammar.)

This game is a enclosed area where you (as a fish) have to run around and chew up food and swallow it (right click) then if you become strong enough then the hunt begins... you need to search for a BIG prey and latch onto their side, HONESTLY this game is hilarious if you die then repeat, if not keep doing that! I made it to a level 431 Raptor. ;)\n\nNext of all they re-added crab madness which is amazing. if you don't know what crab madness is it's basically where you are a little red crab at the start and must reach level 10 to unlock THE KING CRAB, then as soon as you are the KING CRAB you can get some xps and level then use your E button and it will lay eggs, those eggs will hatch into little baby crabs and you can have 257 babies...

I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up this title, other than the whispers I'd heard from some of my buddies regarding the game's recent popularity on YouTube. I've been looking for a game I can build a new series around, so I decided to pick it up and give it a shot. Now, at this moment, I haven't spent a great deal of time with FAGF, so this review is more of a first impressions than anything else so please, don't take it as gospel, as there is still a lot about the game that I don't know.\n\nWith that out of the way, FAGF is essentially an educational game that teaches people about the food chain. The objective is basically to eat anything and everything smaller than you (and sometimes bigger) until you level up and grow, at which point you can then start eating bigger and more nutritious sea creatures! The possibilities are endless! By eating other fish, you level up and gain coins, which are then used to temporarily unlock other fish. Depending on the fish you choose, you have different abilities and attributes that either make the game easier or harder. Think Twisted Metal, but with fish.\n\nThere are also a three different maps that you can play in, though I have only tried the river and the ocean. The ocean was a very narrow, straight forward map that gave nowhere near as much flexibility as the ocean. The ocean was ENORMOUS, and there were plenty more fish and plants around to help you level up, though the number of hostile high level browerags, tiger sharks and eels is borderline insane. Good luck surviving more than a few minutes! I know I couldn't.\n\nAll in all, FAGF is a fun, beautiful looking and mechanically simple game, though the game itself can be quite challenging and I'm starting to understand why it's recently gained the popularity that it has. I believe there is a free version that you can get on Gamejolt, but it doesn't have the multiplayer capabilities that the Steam version has, so if you're into MP and want to support the devs (which are two young brothers), then this is the way to go.\n\nHope you enjoy Feed and Grow: Fish as much as I have been!\n\nCheers dudes!","June 2","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The devs created a gamemode called Crab Madness and decided to make it a limited time event even though the game only has a survival mode. But with all its popularity on youtube I think it will continue to grow.","May 10","false","11.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","2","9","2","1"

If you want to buy this game so that you can play what it would be as something fully polished, playing it now would dissapoint you. The only other reason would be to buy it at a reduced price but even then there is pretty much nothing here with no dedicated multiplayer servers. Good luck devs.","January 8","false","2.5"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","3","15","0","3"

But then they decide to make it so sharks can instantly swallow you no matter what level you are. you can only not be swallowed when you're have their size. That didnt bother me as much as what they just added though. They decided it would be fun to make it so when you just buy a shark for 50 coins and it instatally spawns you near a great white you no longer have that shark. In my opinion this made the game terrible.\nI do not reccommend to buy it.","May 12","false","3.0"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","15","2","13","4","0"

And gameplay is straightforward and easy to understand, albiet with a few differences. Such as smaller fishes teaming up, and being able to take down lone predatory fish, special abilities, and currents of water that cause insta kills.\n\nPros\n\nCurrently around 10 types of fish, which provide a variety of play styles.\nBright, colourful and detailed levels.\nSpecial abilities.\nEasy to use controls.\n\nCons\n\nOnce a fish is unlocked, if you die, you need to spend your points again to play as it.\nSlow movement speed for a short time when spawning.\nNot enough playable fishies, come on, add crabs, octopus, crayfish, lobsters and all that.\nOnly one classic type game mode (crab king is a yearly event). A few more could liven it up.\nNo public multiplayer.\nSmall levels, and only 3 to choose from.\nNo main menu music, and very little actual ingame music at all, apart from chomping noises, and water sounds.\n\nGranted, it's early access, but it needs A LOT more improvement in the months to come.","May 22","false","1.7"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","8","1","12","2","2"

It's in Early Access, so you can actually wait until its in a state you would pay this amount of money for.\n\nI came into this game with a good impression. Just by looking at the screenshots and the videos. Then I was in the Options, nah Early-Access, no fullscreen?\n\nBy the way you could just add a note in the options.\n"Fullscreen option is not implemented yet, use Alt+Enter to enter and leave fullscreen mode."\n\nThen I went into the game and it was not as "exciting" as i thought it would be, having watched the videos before. A tutorial in form of a short info page on how to get started, probably as the loading screen could really help this, as I felt lost. However I quickly figured out the controls, but the mouse still feels a but weird... I couldnt eat anything for some reason, probably im just too bad at hitting it.\n\nAnyways... there are alot of trash games on Steam at the moment (through the power of Greenlight) and i did not want to risk losing my ability to refund, so I will probably check back a bit further in development.\n\nI refunded.\n8.99€ (sale) for this?\nAtleast in the current state, it is too much, but we will see how it develops.\n\nSteam Refunds let me buy this in the first place actually.\n\nGood luck in the further development  and dont lose your enthusiasm for your game, because then you will lose it ... and your users. :happy_creep:","January 8","false","0.1"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","5","23","0","5"
