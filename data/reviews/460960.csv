"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/460960/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","This is the sequel to the hugely overlooked, obscure mystery detective 'The Deed', RPG made by Pilgrim Adventures; who are slowly climbing up my ladder of favourite indie developers. Dynasty expands on the original's concept and foundation with deeper storytelling, more and diverse characters, who strangely seem to be incredibly memorable despite their generic appearance and names. This could be due to the fact this game's art style, whilst looking plain and brown, strikes a resemblance of old school mixed with modern sprite work.\n\nOf course, the meat of this and the prequel game is the "choices matter" mechanic. Does it work? In short, yes. Yes yes yes yes yes yes! Whilst the game is limited in scope due to its short, linear nature and small world to explore, which isn't a bad thing I might add, the idea that you will be judged for your actions and un-actions is a satisfying, tense experience. Knowing that if you talk to him, or her, and collect this or that, will definitely effect the outcome is immersive and thrilling, and graphics be damned. Without specific spoilers, here's an example. To have the murder look like somebody else committed it, you'll be required to talk to a certain character and ask them about the character you want to frame to learn more about their past, which you'll use against them in the chain of evidence you have setup against them. I would say it's more about finding the "correct" choices to make to win the game than having absolute freedom to do anything and get away with it, which again, I actually find to be a logical game design choice.\n\nAudio wise... meh, it could be better, but it isn't explicitly terrible or unpleasant. I like the BGMs, but I would like to see things like footsteps and ambience added just to put the cherry on the cake. But please, keep the no voice acting. I love to read and I love reading the dialogue with my own voice that I allocate to these characters, much like a novel. In this game, the lack of voice acting, I think, enhances the atmosphere and enjoyment.\n\nI'll re-iterate the character portraits and art style again. Somehow, for some reason, I really love them. Yes, they are just plain blank faces, but the way they are styled and portrayed is... cool...? I would like to see this style return for a potential sequel, among all the other compliments as above.\n\nFor the negatives, I think the inherit bias towards the player character should be dropped and less alibis for the NPCs to be limited to only 1 or 2 and not all of them. It's quite annoying to have a sheriff turn up and immediately suspect you just because he hasn't heard your name before. Also the sound design complaint as above.\n\nTo finish this review, and if the developer bothers to read this far down, I would like to say I love The Deed and this game, but I would LOOVVEEE to see a game made by them where YOU are the detective, and YOU solve a murder mystery - where the killer is random per playthrough, in the style of The Deed games.\n\nAgain, great sequel this is bar some personal gripes, well worth the asking price and more!","May 11","true","4.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It isn't at all necessary to have played that game first though, as both games have storylines that are completely independent of each other. In this game, the objective remains the same - find a way to kill someone you hate, and get away with it! Compared to the first title, Dynasty has 3 different stories (instead of just 1), set in 3 different time periods, involving 3 different main characters. The stories are not linked in any way, except that the character you play comes from the Bruce family.\n\nYay!+ This game offers 3 stories instead of 1, at the same kind of price point as its predecessor.\n+ All the stories are fairly interesting.\n+ 3 different locations and settings to explore.\n+ Each location is nicely designed and period-appropriate.\n+ Music and ambience are not bad.\n+ Reasonable range of murder weapons to choose from.\n+ Murder methods are fairly interesting and some yield amusing results.\n+ You can use either the mouse or keyboard to play.\n+ More difficult/challenging than its predecessor.\n+ Much more gameplay time compared to before.\n+ High replayability, especially if you want to try out all murder weapons and get all possible endings.\n+ Loads of achievements.\n\nNay.- You can't really "win" on the very first try because there's no way you can predict what characters will say in response to your questions, and the questions are vital to producing evidence for a frame-up.\n- A few spelling/grammar errors here and there.\n- BUG: Pressing F12 to exit the game at any point causes a crash.\n\nVerdictI grabbed this at S$0.90 during sale. At that price I would highly recommend giving this a try, especially if the premise enthralls you at all in any way. Also check out the first title in this series, The Deed.","May 18","true","16.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

It feels to me like a good old fashioned puzzle or story-driven adventure game. You need to a pay a lot of attention to what characters say through the conversations, and you need to choose your responses very carefully. Its not just enough to try and frame somebody else by planting their weapons on the body and a bit of evidence in their room - you need to have engineered as many conversations as possible to make it look like they have motives and reasons for the deed. At the same time, you need to be careful and consistent in your own responses. You don't want to say anything that might make you look like a didgey character, or somebody raking up dirt on everyone else. Plus, whatever you say to any of the npc's will come out in front of the local law later, so be consistent in whatever story you spin about yourself!\n\nAll in all I found this more in depth than I expected, and a good deal of though is required to succeed. I suspect it is possible to frame any of the npc's (or make the murder look like suicide) in any of the three scenarios, and here is where the games replay value lies. While all the weapons and evidence are the same each time you play, the conversations (ie, the most important part) may not be (although there are a finite number of possibilities). Hence, it is possible to see many different endings to each scenario.\n\nMore information and some gameplay in my review of it on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__9hyT594s\n\nBut overall I enjoyed the game, and for the price you will get a lot of hours of puzzlement out of it.","May 25","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The main objective is to seek vengence to the person who hurt the character you play as. There are 3 character that you can play as. Each Character is from a differen't time period and has their own unique story. Each character is about a 20 minutte gameplay. Lots of dialogue. The game is worth the 2 dollars you're spending. The graphic is decent at most considering that the character you play as looks nothing close to what is suppose to look like. The game has great music(It has that sinister feeling to it). The game has a few jokes. Overall, i do recommend this game because to me it's unique and it has a STORY! Something these cheap game LACKS. :) Here is a quick gameplay if you're interested. Also I forgot to mention you have to be very strategic when you play this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEc129QapTA","May 11","true","1.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I've tried quite a bit of RPGMaker games, and almost all of them seems to be carbon copies of one another.\n\nMy impression changed after I tried the first scenario. This is an entirely different approach on using RPGMaker to create games. Instead of RPG, what I got is a "Create your own story (of murders)". Truly different than other RPGMaker games.\n\nVisual Novel fans and/or mystery lovers should give this game a chance.","May 15","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you enjoy the idea of making the perfect kill, evading and fooling the police and getting away scott free, then you should take a closer look at this game.\n\nThis release was a quite a suprise to me, I enjoyed the first game, but never expected a sequel. Fortunately its a good suprise, and anyone who enjoyed the first game will enjoy this game, with more refined gameplay and three scenarios to play instead of one.\n\nThe core gameplay involves finding an item and weapon that incriminates your patsy (or an item that leaves the impression the target took their own life), then planting that item in the right place so the police find it, and using the weapon to kill your target. If all goes well then the police will find the item in their search and that combined with the weapon you used makes your patsy look suspicious enough for them to be arrested. You will also need to minimise suspicion against yourself, for example in one scenario bringing up an argument with the victim makes the police suspect you more, but changing the subject allows you to avoid the suspicion.\n\nEnvironments are small, but this allows you to really understand the environment and people in it, allowing you to easily execute your devious plan and control the way events proceed. The only real flaws this game has are repeated dialogue getting tedious as you replay scenarios and cases where the your own plan isn't one the game designers thought of (however I haven't run into this situation yet).\n\nThere are three scenarios in this release, and I've only played one and still I can wholeheartedly reccomend this game, its a unique experiance worth playing especially for such a low asking price. If you're still skeptical then I can reccomend the first game in the series which is only $1 so you have little to lose.","May 17","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its not going to 'wow' you with visuals, or have you on the edge of your seat. Its a slow burn effect where you slowly see your actions come to fruition. It really forces you to think before speaking (or, choosing a dialogue option hehe)  The evidence and planting techniques don't feel forced like they sometimes did with the first game (The Deed) its not as simple as 'bloody knife > put bloody knife in person's bed' "they did it!" you're forced to really think through fully the situation, who is this person you're framing? what was thier relationship with the victim?\n\nI started to really feel quite sinister as I hunted through dialogue looking for things to help incriminate others, while also being careful not to raise too much suspicion about myself.\n\nIf anything this game has taught me I'd be a terrible murderer.\n\nAnd, for this low of a price, c'mon, totally worth it.","May 11","true","5.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","3"
