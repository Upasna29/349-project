Was Waldo at a political rally, a circus, a camping ground, sea world or heck even just lounging outside his house, cooking some hot dogs and hamburgers, Ms. Waldo and little Waldo nearby with their own red and white striped shirts.  I can't remember, I just remember spending hours at a time pouring over the books, gritting my teeth and mapping out a grid of the page, searching each sector just waiting for him to pop out before my eyes..\n\nFast forward 20 - 30 years later and I'm still enamored with hidden objects, while I've outgrown my Where's waldo book reading days, I can and very much do enjoy playing hidden object games.  Finding various items scattered about a trunk, a chest, a crashed airplane, a Tibetan temple, it's all good...   Thanks to the publisher Artifex Mundi I have no shortage of hidden object games to choose from, whether it's clowns, carnivals, murder mysteries, I know seeing the name Artifex Mundi next to publisher I can be certain I'll be in for a real treat.\n\nThe Story\nWhen you were seeing off your beloved niece three weeks ago as she embarked on an archaeological trip to Tibet, nothing could have foreshadowed the dramatic events that were about to unfold. Only yesterday you received a mysterious letter from which you learned that Larisa and her crew had gotten lost in a snow storm.  When you arrive in Tibet you quickly discover your Niece has set out about 2 weeks ago and has yet to return.  Will you find Larisa, will you discover what happened at Shangri-La or will you become another missing person.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is your typical hidden object fare, hidden object, puzzles, collectibles.  The hidden object comes in two forms, either words or shapes, they aren't overly complicated, and if you do find yourself trapped you can use a hint.  If that isn't enough you can choose to play a game of Mojong instead of solving the puzzle.   You also have a mix up puzzle to solve occasionally, a picture is broken up into numerous shapes, you need to twist and move the shapes until the picture is clear.   As you progress along in the story more areas unlock for you to search through.  The game also has several sets of collectibles, swords, coins, stars and apples.\n\nRecommendation\nIf you're a fan of HOG's, you'll love this game, it's got everything a HOG game lover would want and need...  An interesting well told story, casual hidden object puzzles and crisp graphics and sound, I really don't see any reason for people to avoid buying this game, you should buy it now and start searching, start finding and enjoy this amazingly fun casual game.  Artifex Mundi has yet again brought HOG game lovers another masterpiece..  I certainly can't wait to see what game these guys release next, if it's as good as Tibetan Quest then i'll be a really happy camper.","April 15","true","2.9"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/427550/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3124 products in account","An OK hidden-object game all in all, but suffers from sloppy game design, and so I can't recommend it to fans of the genre.\n\nThe graphics and design are impressive. The hidden-object scenes are easy but plentiful.\n\nThe big disappointment, however, is the point-and-click adventuring: it's illogical and even idiotic. At one point I had to melt ice and was carrying a magical staff that could melt it ... but, no, I was not allowed to use this staff and had to find a magnifying glass instead. At another point, I tried to take one item, and got a message telling me that I shouldn't take it before finding out if it belongs to someone. Uhm, taking stuff is exactly what what I've been doing the whole game until then! A hermit asks me for a “rare plant” that I immediately see growing right outside his house. Early on I think I found 5 axes in a row, and kept using them only to find new ones to use again. Can't our protagonist just keep the axe? Or how about thinking of a puzzle that requires a new kind of item? Too many puzzles involve an item being stuck and you have to pry it out. One of the hidden objects -- I kid you not -- is a “reset icon.” Etc. etc. It's just insulting.\n\nFinally, the story: the Tibetan flavor seems to be window dressing only. The legend of Shangri-La seems quite Westernized, the main and even most side characters are all Western, and in any case nothing of the history and religion of Tibet gets involved. I even think one of the puzzles involved Meso-American runes!\n\nSo, though the gameplay is generally OK, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. You hired excellent graphic artists, why not hire some capable writers, too? Or at least insist that they don't smoke up while on the job?\n\nStill, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!","April 8","false","6.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/427550/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Your niece Larissa embarked on a journey to the mythical Shangri-La, however, her party goes missing during a snowstorm. Not caring at all for your life, you follow her footsteps to rescue her...\n\nThat's the plot of the game: as usual, Artifex Mundi knows to choose the games with interesting stories. I really liked the beginning, though the ending was a little less well-written: it cuts abruptly and it's clear that it needs at least some more explanations or a sequel. Also, I'm wondering how the heroin, which must middle-aged and with a lot of money, ended up with nothing to advance a little more faster and fly a plane. It means that she was at least an adventurer in her youth.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard: find items, solve puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes (list or shaped). There is a little minor problem: the balance between the list of words and the list of shapes isn't great as you have more of the former than the latter. The puzzles are as usual easy to finish. You even have some passages (like the repair of the plane) where you're guided step-by-step and where you'll need to use objects you found earlier (or that you will find after when you can't advance anymore). You have also a game of mahjong (not really developped as there are only 2 or 3 different patterns and you can't be stuck, as it's shuffling automatically) if you don't want to play the hidden object scenes.\n\nHowever, some actions aren't making sense: I've a staff that can melt ice and I need a magnifying glass at one moment for that specific act. Or also, a giant lizard is blocking the way and you have a sleeping potion in your inventory. My first move was to give it to it. Well, no. I needed to give it first a rake, so that I can get a pole, then use it as an harpoon to get a fish and to give it to the animal. And the sleeping potion. Well, apparently, it's better to use it on a spider than on the lizard...\n\nWhile I loved the graphics and the beauty of the temples or of the mountain, there are two problems: I didn't like how the characters were animated. It's not fitting really well with the rest of the game and besides, I don't know why the faces were weird. The second little minor problem is probably how the developers are seeing Tibet as I was more under the impression to be in another province of China than Tibet itself. Besides, given the era where the story is set, I don't think that Tibet was already ruled by China at that moment. I suppose that they let their imagination (and their own view/stereotypes) instead of using a little more documentation and to avoid some clichés.\n\nI liked the soundtrack, that's a real strong point here. It was very enjoyable all along and fitting to the ambiance.\n\nTibetan Quest isn't perhaps the best in terms of gameplay but I've been hooked into that magical world (even if it's not really Tibetan in itself). I liked it a lot. As usual, Artifex Mundi chose well. However, the next time, if they can at least choose a game with a better ending or publish the first The Secret Order and the others Vampire Legends if they managed to get the rights for Steam, I would be very happy.","April 11","true","5.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/427550/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3532 products in account","Tibetan Quest: Beyond the World's End is a hidden object game style game with nice visuals and an enjoyable storyline to adventure through.  You journey to Tibet to find out what has happened to your niece when she travelled there several weeks beforehand.  You will then begin collecting items and using them to unlock and continue forward through frigid and snowy landscapes of Tibet, and along with intricately designed and stylized Buddhist temples that align the high mountainous in the area.\n\n\nPros\nI like the art work of the people as well as the graphic style of the landscapes.  The animations are nice, and I think they add a lot to the overall game experience.\n\nThe sequence of events doesn't feel broken, and I like the continuity in the overall gameplay experience.\n\nThere was a large variety of puzzles throughout the game, and I enjoyed solving them.  This has been a pleasure for me to play through.\n\nThe voices in the game are well done for the most part, which is a nice thing.  The mouth movements are right on par with the voices.  Nice to see this, but I cannot say how this may be if there are other languages to possibly try, since I did not mess with this to see.  Nothing interfered with my overall concentration or mood while playing.  Everything felt in place with the story.\n\nI thought all of the sound effects were very enjoyable and how they should be, and it all fit well with what was going on.\n\nCollecting the extra items is fun for bonus achievements.  I like having the side things to look for in almost every room that creates a sort of side collection as you are going.  Like a mini-game within the game.\n\nExtras menu has some neat stuff, and I guess you can unlock other things in it as you go.\n\nSteam cloud functionality often goes unnoticed by me, but this would be nice carrying saves over if I played small bits on my laptop before going to sleep or something.\n\n\nCons\nThis is sort of a gripe for most all of these I have played, and it's that things you have in your inventory will not work when they should in theory, and the solution is too linear.  You could use your one scepter item to solve many of the things you end up going out of your way for to get an item similar that works instead.  I do enjoy the extra stuff, but it's just something inside me that is a realist, so I kind of get frustrated about some of these kinds of things.  No reflection on the particular game.  Just thinking how I would be in the same situation...  Also the fact that many items that would be of use later are simply dropped and never used again.  If you kept the item the whole time, or simply went back for it over and over, it could come in handy for several other areas where you need an item to get another item, for example.\n\nOther than the above, which is more of a universal thought about hidden object games and many point and clicks in general, I don't have anything to say here really.  There isn't much I can complain about for a hidden object game.  This one is very well done.  If I could nitpick, I suppose some of the facial animations look funny when they are speaking to you, in some cases, but I kind of like this, honestly.\n\n\nGlitches\nI found one strange glitch near the end near a certain statue you have to alter.  Going two rooms back, then moving into that room makes duplicate scepters.  I think this might only trigger after a conversation in the mausoleum, and the need to grab a gem in that room to charge the scepter, but it was strange to hear the noise and see the number continue to increase.  The noise and increase stopped once I picked up the appropriate item to continue on.\n\n**********    GAME-BREAKING BUG!!    **********\n\nI completely broke my first playthrough by using the teleport feature after going through the portal near the end.  I couldn't use the portal anymore, and I just got a white screen when I entered the room to teleport, so there is no way back.  Maybe there will be an eventual fix for this, so I can finish the game on my original playthrough, but at the current time, there is no real fix for this at the time of writing, and the only solution is starting a new game!\n\nOther Thoughts\nThis is a terrific game, and for anyone who likes hidden object games, I highly recommend this.  It's a lot of fun and everything about it exemplifies the genre, from the art to the music to the overall continuity in story.  The puzzles and the finding of objects is great and they do a nice job changing it up a bit with the puzzles, as well as the situational use of objects to find other ones.  This makes me want to play more of the games I already have by Artifex Mundi, since I'm so impressed with this title.  I will not hesitate to grab more of these in the future!  Completely all around great hidden object game.\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/427550/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Note: I'll be referring to "HOGs", also known as "hidden object games" throughout this review. More on that later.\n\nSo, by now it's fairly clear that Artifex Mundi is the king of HOGs, or hidden object games, on Steam. Well, how does their most recent title fare? Let's find out!\n\nThe BreakdownTibetan Quest is the newest title from Artifex Mundi, the Polish developers (and publishers) of dozens of HOGs, many of which are on Steam. From my personal experience, I've really enjoyed most of the games I've played from them (Time Mysteries 1 was an exception, but it was also one of their first games so that's a bit excusable), so I was looking forward to trying out this new one. Thankfully, it delivered!\n\nThe gameplay of Tibetan Quest consists of what you'd expect from a HOG: visit a bunch of areas, solve puzzles using items to progress, complete some minigames, and most importantly, play some hidden object scenes! Now, you may or may not know what those consist of; if you don't, they're essentially the "I Spy" books in video game form. You're given a list of objects to find in a picture/scene, and all you need to do is find, or rather, click on them. The hidden object scenes generally looked great in Tibetan Quest, and the objects were quite hard to find sometimes. However, one small complaint that I do have with these scenes is that many of the objects are reused multiple times, like "stars", "hearts", etc.\n\nThe story of the game consists of you, a middle-aged woman, traveling to Tibet to rescue your niece after she mysteriously disappears during a trip there. As the game progresses, you slowly discover what the villain's motive is through some of the minigames, which I thought was pretty clever. The game doesn't dump exposition on you either; the focus is definitely on the gameplay, which is quite nice. Sure, the story may not be anything particularly special, but it gets the job done. There was also an extra bonus chapter that I didn't really check out much, though I believe it explains what happens after the game's initial ending, so that's pretty neat to see as most games don't expand upon their endings.\n\nVisually, it's an Artifex Mundi game for sure, even if this one isn't developed by them. By it being an Artifex Mundi game, I mean that it looks great! They somehow never cease to impress me with the high quality, polish, and general attention to detail given to both areas and hidden object scenes in their games. On top of that, Tibetan Quest even features some fairly action-packed cutscenes involving a dragon trying to stop our heroine from rescuing her daughter. Sure, some of the effects (like the explosions) are a little silly and perhaps not the best quality, but overall it was still quite nice to see that the game tried to add some variety to its visuals.\n\nThough, that does lead me to another minor complaint I have with the game - the facial animations. There's only a few times when talking to characters is necessary to progress, but whenever I had to talk to someone I couldn't help but laugh when I watched their faces move. The faces look fairly realistic, so when the only thing that moves is their mouths it looks a bit silly. I kind of found it charming though, so it wasn't too big of a deal for me, and thus, only a minor complaint.\n\nBy this point, you may have realized that I'm not criticizing the game much, and that's because it's simply hard to criticize! If you're not a fan of HOGs, this may not be the game for you, though if you enjoy adventure games, puzzle games, or just casual games in general I think you may really enjoy Tibetan Quest. It's not perfect, but it's certainly a great game!\n\nProsCreative, varied puzzles, minigames, and hidden object scenes\nAn unusual setting for a hidden object game: Tibet!\nFairly lengthy - 3-6 hours long depending on personal puzzle-solving skills and if you decide to tackle the extra bonus chapter or not\nSteam achievements, trading cards, and Steam cloud support (always nice to have!)\nBeautifully detailed areas and hidden object scenes\nA fairly interesting story is told through a mix of dialogue, action-packed cutscenes, and even through minigames\nConsMultiple hidden objects are reused across multiple scenes\nSome of the puzzles use items in illogical ways (why do I need a magnifying glass to melt a block of ice when I already have a staff that shoots out fire? :/)\nFacial animations look odd, even if they're kind of charming\nConclusionIf you're an Artifex Mundi fan, Tibetan Quest is another excellent game from them that is definitely worth picking up. If you're not yet a fan, what are you waiting for?\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10","April 24","true","3.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This game has points going for it and then it has also quite a few against it. Overall I really can't say that I disliked it, but that's about as positive as I feel about it.\n\nThe presentation is good. The graphics are colourful and well done, the animations are awkward as in most hidden object games, the music is nice and the voice acting isn't awful. Some locations feel 'shoehorned' into the Tibetian setting though, but overall it doesn't break the immersion.\n\nThere are quite a few hidden object scenes, so if you like those this game is definately for you. The inventory puzzles are rather weak with quite a few feeling really forced. A few examples: You have a magical staff that can shoot fire, but in order to melt some block of ice you have to use a magnifying glass. There is a huge lizard blocking your way and you have a bucket full of sleeping potion, but you rather use the bucket of sleeping potion on the ground under a spider in order to make the spider fall asleep. You need to put a lantern next to a rock and use a flint to light it up even if there are lit candles very near. The list goes on and it really gets on your nerves after a while. The minigames aren't bad, but they are either really easy (match the shape/colour) or quite difficult.\n\nOverall the game offers a couple of hours of hidden object game play, but if you are more into casual adventures that make at least some sense then this game might disappoint you. Certainly one of the weaker Artifex Mundi games and I can only recommend it in a sale or a bundle.","April 9","true","10.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game had me gripped from start to finish. So much so, I ended up playing it through twice which I like to do for most HOG games. The artwork and the music fitted well with the game and the story and I found the monsters and creatures along the way very refreshing. There are alot of hidden object scenes which I don't mind at all but I would prefer there to be not so many in the game. That said, they fitted in perfectly with the puzzles and this balanced it all out for me. The only drawback I have with the game is the lack of people and voice acting. I love games where I am put into something and have to work my way out of it so although there was a map and hints, I found it quite challenging at times to know what to do next.\n\nThe game is a good length and it kept my attention and I would recommend it to any HOG fans out there or for people who enjoy doing puzzles. Artifex Mundi always have a variety of interesting puzzles in their games and although they can't take all the credit as only being publishers of this game, you could see that they put their stamp on it.\n\nA very enjoyable game which is very good value for the price with it being a collector's edition.

What may seem like a simple endeavor soon becomes very complicated as you are dragged into the battle for Shangri-La. Discover hidden mysteries and explore ancient ruins as you battle angry ghosts of the past. Tibetan Quest Beyond the World's End is a beautiful hidden item game that offers a great casual experience with an engaging story and hours of gameplay.\n\nDespite your misgivings your niece has gone on an exploration mission to Tibet with her lover which soon turns out poorly when you receive a letter saying that they’ve gone missing. The only way to do something right is to do it yourself so you head out in search of them. You soon find yourself in a world of magic as you race after the villain responsible for the current mess and end up uncovering the mysteries of Shangri-La. The story mixes ancient mythologies with regular people making it easy to step into the shoes of the main character. However, the story barely has anything to do with Tibet and seems very Westernized. I would go so far as to say the location of the game actual means nothing as the game doesn’t capitalize at all on Tibetan culture or its people as most characters in the game aren’t even Tibetan. I found that the story of the game was the weakest aspect of this title.\n\nThe game plays as a point and click game with hidden object scenes and puzzles as well. The mouse is used to move around as well as interact with objects, some of which you can collect for your inventory to be used later. The game is filled with hidden object scenes, however most offer a list of objects to find in the scene. The tutorial says that there will be other types, like a list of shadows offered only, however these don’t show up at all. Only in the bonus chapter were any different types of hidden item scenes provided. I didn’t mind this, however, it felt a bit misleading that game said there would be variety but there was little there. The puzzles are good; Though their difficulty ranges from very easy to just frustrating, most were pretty simple.\n\nThe artwork in the game is beautiful, with vibrant colors and lovely depictions of Tibet. So lovely that at times I felt bad that the character you play seemed to just destroy things to progress in the story, namely statues. However, that is a minor issue, what I disliked the most were the character models. Their bodies were fine however all of their faces were very weird. It almost seemed like they tried to use real life references of people but they all ended up very warped. The speaking animation also seemed weird and all of the characters has soulless eyes. The music on the other hand was lovely and very fitting of the story.\n\nTibetan Quest Beyond the World's End is a good hidden object game, it does pretty much everything right. I personally wasn’t a huge fan of the story and didn’t find it very engaging however everything else about the game is fine. It has plenty of hidden object scenes and only some are revisited twice, the puzzles were fine and visually it was a good game. Despite not being very much into the story I enjoyed playing it and recommend it to fans of the genre. It also has Steam achievements, trading cards, and a bonus chapter to play in the game.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]","April 22","true","4.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There's even a kind of Sokoban puzzle. :)\n\nThe collectibles would be fun to collect if the map would indicate scenes that had any still.

An astonishing art concept, full of colors and a jewel for the eyes. I really loved this game, not only but the magnificent art but the amazing music accomplishing a great mixture. And the best of all, the story. An immersive  narrative where you have to be Lady Pearson herself and discover unpredictable things about the hidden secrets of Tibet.\n\nThe cutscenes animations are just great, something I really liked, adding an extra to this game and its story wich is awesome. I don't want to spoil anything, but you'll discover a unique version of Shangri-La.\n\nGameplay\nYou will enjoy playing Tibetan Quest: Beyond the World's End. Here you have here different modes of gaming, with the chance of unlocking many achievements. Sometimes you'll notice the difficulty of the game, I did not use the hints. Be sharp, you won't regret to finishing the game without using them. Also, you will enjoy playing the mini games and puzzles to collect items to continue playing and know more abut's going on in that distant region.\n\nAnd if you like unlockables, you will like this game. Also, you can play it again to find all the hidden objects. There are stars, apples, coins and swords just there to find them. You can skip some of the mini games playing Mahjong, a game I always liked.\n\nIf you finish the game, don't forget to play the extra story and know what happens at last! Also, you'll have access to extra content like the game's music and wallpapers for your PC.\n\nPros+ Amazing graphics\n+ Great cutscenes\n+ Good music\n+ Hidden objects\n\nCons- Point & click adventure, if you don't like them you are advised\n- A little bit linear the use of objects\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI highly recommend Tibetan Quest: Beyond the World's End game if you like a good story and point & click adventures, this is your game. Also, if you enjoy old legends of exotics places you will find this a great example of them. I hope to see soon more adventures of Artifex Mundi.\n\nThanks for this great adventure!\n\nRating:9/10","April 18","true","6.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I am not  major league gamerr by any stretch of the imagination. My only criticism is that it was far too short.

Three blocks of ice, one pickaxe. Only one of those blocks can be broken with the pickaxe. One cannot, for reasons it explains, and the third cannot... simply because. i.e. arbitrary. You've got to get a near-identical tool to break _that_ ice. WTF?\n\nb) it won't let me melt ice using non-boiling water (whereas physics allows me to just fine - try pouring cold water over ice and see what happens). WTF?\n\nc) one of the early-on HO scenes wants you to find a ring. The ring is placed almost directly next to a glove. The ring is big enough to fit around at least 3 fingers of that glove. i.e. it's the size of a bracelet, not a ring (except that that HO calls it a ring). WTF?\n\ni far prefer a mediocre but internally consistent HOPA, like the Queen's Quest or Demon Hunter, to a HOPA with any notable amount of arbitrariness (which this one is full of).\n\nMaybe someday i'll get over these offense to my sensibilities and give this another try, but i can only assume that i'll be faced with more "WTF!?!?!?" moments than i care to encounter.\n\nNext, please...","April 11","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
