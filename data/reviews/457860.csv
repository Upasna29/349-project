This might only be my second. However I felt compelled to write about this experience.\n\nIt is....breathtaking. I never dreamt that I would one day know what it felt like to sit in the capsule. Listening to the countdown and commentry. Heart rate increasing. Tension building. Sat with a Rift on in a living room in England and yet transported to Cape Canaveral on that bright July morning.\n\nWhen you hear those main engines start, I swear you can feel them. That immense power, held in place by the clamps. Then zero is reached and the clamps release. Through the window, a cloud slowly moves past, followed by another one, only faster. White wisps flash by the window now and suddenly, you can see the Earth, slowly falling away.\n\nYou realise you haven't breathed for 20 seconds and when you exhale, a big fat tear runs down your cheek. Man, this is emotional. -and then you stage. The main engines cut off, leaving you in a breathless silence. You are in Earth orbit. A quick glance around the cabin leaves you in no doubt. It was then that the full emotional impact of what I'd just experienced hit me like the business end of a Saturn V. I literally cried like a baby. I had experienced spaceflight.\n\nThe rest of the experince takes you to further stages of the flight. Leaving Earth orbit, docking with the LEM, moon orbit, insertion and finally landing. Oh boy. Looking out of the window of the Eagle and seeing the Moon's surface getting closer, having a slight panic at the 1202 alarm and finally, touching down in the Sea of Tranquility. All priceless moments.\n\nHistory will remember Neil's first steps as the defining moment of the Apollo mission, but for this VR experience, the flights were the best parts. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTLDR: Buy it. Support it. It's the best educational use of VR so far and if it doesn't move you to tears, then maybe  you don't cry at stuff. :)\n\n10/10 Would be an astronaut again.\n\nFroobyone","April 11","true","1.7"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

For single purpose, limited scope experiences like this, I expect higher quality assets. Textures are lacking, especially orbital and ascent views of the Earth and Moon. The feeling of presence inside the spacecraft is excellent, but just when you want to reach out and flip a switch you realize you can't. The lunar surface is lacking in detail - this is only marginally better than any random spot on the Mun in Kerbal. Don't get me wrong, this has great moments. The Saturn V assembled for launch is great just for the scale of the thing. But as a paid VR experience, focusing on less than an hour's worth of content, I think the bar should be higher. The lunar surface needs footprints and regolith that gives way. There needs to something to do for ascent and docking with the command module for return.","May 5","true","2.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

If you have any interest in space flight, or the Apollo program, and/or you have the system and VR capabilities, then this is an absolute must.\n\nSeveral intersting parts of the first lunar landing flight are represented in short sequences, from launchpad to splashdown, they are all enjoyable, but all are over far sooner than you would like (no fault of the software, just greed on my part). You will find your favourite sequences too, and have the ability to go back and watch them again at your leisure.\n\nThe liftoff sequence alone is worth every penny in my opinion, and may never get boring to be part of; this is proper "hair on the back of your neck standing up" material.

I was misty-eyed by the end of it. The coolest virtual field trip I've ever taken.\n\nLanding on the moon took a lot of tries, but I eventually made it down. A few things to note: you're initially off-center to the left, so you need to immediately start thrusting to the right to get lined up, or you'll fail because you "flew too far away". Your lander is automatically thrusting upwards at a steady amount; your job is to control the angle to adjust your forward speed and descent. The thrust (up on the analog stick) is to help slow your descent, but thrusting kills your vertical velocity fairly quickly, so don't use it too much initially or you won't descend quickly enough - however, it also increases the power of your pitch and translate.\n\nDon't use the "angle" markers on the window as absolutes - they're probably going to be innaccurate if you're trying to figure out if you're level or not, because they depend on your head position. Instead, use the attitude gauge in the cockpit just to the right of the angle markers on the window: each grid on it is about 10 degrees. Finally, pitching forward will increase your ground speed and your rate of descent. Pitching backwards will decrease your ground speed and increase your rate of descent. Pitching so you're straight up and down will keep your forward speed steady and will give you the slowest descent. There's no vertical speed indicator to match the ground speed indicator, but the altitude indicator changes every second, so you can get a pretty good idea of how quickly you're descending. You can also look up videos of the Apollo descents on youtube to get a feel for their trajectory: how fast they were descending, what angle they were at, etc. Happy landings!","April 3","true","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The game while not being awful did nothing for me.\nIt was not as breathtaking as I thought, gave no awe inspiring brain attack where your mind tries to come to terms with the difference in planet size. It was mere snippets and clips of days into minutes, without even the feeling that you were in space.\nI'm not sure what your affiliation is to the states but for me after seeing the intiual nationalist speech, and then the continual reminder that that the US owns the heavens and earth, I was feeling slightly empty and likely felt like the astronaughts did, and couldn't wait for it to be over. It's a steep price at 15$ and in all honesty not as good as the image and story sounds in your head.

The sense of scale in VR really makes you understand the magnitude of the moon landing.\n\nI used the word experience with a purpose, because calling it a game would be misleading. All in all there are 3 parts where you can actively control what is going on, one of them the exploration of the moons surface. But most of the time you are spectating as a part of the Apollo 11 crew. In fact I recommend choosing the "cinematic mode" when starting the first time (see what i did there ;)), and using the interactive mode for further expeditions.\n\nAnd if you have any interest in the exploration of space you will come back, despite the sometimes sub-par graphics and animations. This is because, as mentioned above, the sheer magnitude of the events unfolding and the really great soundtrack create an uplifting experience (did it again) that is just astonishing.

It's quite clear that this demo was not put together with the best VR practices in mind. For example, the camera accelerates at random which produces an involuntary weird feeling in your stomach and knees. It's distracting. The movement does not use the HTC Vive controllers but your look angle, it's gross. The whole things is just akwardly staped together.\n\nThe interactive sections were boring and also half baked. Nothing about this demo is really interactive.\n\nThe trying-to-be-impressive shots of earth felt fake in their low resolutionness and their very obvious planarity. It was really hard to get into it.\n\nI kindof somewhat liked the part on the moon as they do tell you a bit about what the mission was like and what the experiments did, and also the part where you are inside the launch and the lander were kind of fun. But again there is absolutely no attention given to any detail. Buzz Aldrin jumps around and doesn't care to jump through rocks, because they are all just fake props. It's all wrong and no visible efforts are made beyond the bare minimum. The whole thing lasted around an hour.

Being a history, space, NASA, Apollo, science and or flight nerd helps; but even that is not required. Better than Apollo exhibits at most museums, this gives you a chance to feel like you are part of the Apollo mission from the Astronaut's perspective. No point in getting too detailed, but the experience is set up nicely with a very inspirational opening, puts you on the pad and then inserts you into one of the most dangerous and awe inspiring missions ever undertaken by NASA. Witness and PARTICIPATE in man's first steps on the Moon.\n\nVisually very pleasing, the sense of presence in the modules is fantastic. The use of REAL Apollo 11 mission audio, along with some input from JFK and the astronauts themselves only deepens the entire thing. I continue to be amazed and inspired every time I replay it (and I do that often).\n\nIf you want a high level of interactivity and a true game, this may not be for you. If you want to feel like you were among the first men to travel to our moon and otherwise be astounded by some scenic vistas and immersive environments, don't hesitate to jump in.","May 9","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it lacks any AI or animation of Armstrong, Aldrin, or Collins while in the command module; the detail of the model is well done. For almost the entirety of the experience things seem very stiff due to the lifelessness of the crew. The only exception to this is when you exit the LEM and can walk/teleport around while Neil hops around on the moons surface. The sense of presence that SteamVR provides is amazing and being able to feel like you are actually standing on the moon looking up at the LEM is absolutly mesmerizing.\n\nEven with its shortcomings, and the thousand yard stare of the astronauts, the overall experience is great. If you have a VR system and have any interest in Space this is definitely a must buy experience. The begining camera flyin around the rocket is another highlight that will leave your jaw firmly affixed to the ground.

Have to say I'm quite underwhelmed by the full experience. It's just very uncomfortable to be in. The outside of the rocket shots where you are floating in space and being pulled around with the camera moving is horribly sickness inducing. In fact I'm trying to still get over it as I type this review.\n\nAlso there needed to be better loading screens than what was  implemented. You just get kicked out of the experience and see the steam compositor with a bit of text saying LOADING. This really takes you out and it happens often. Loading scenes needed to have been done better as this is quite immersion breaking.\n\nThe best part was the shuttle launch, the rest was pretty boring and lack of interaction. Specially on the Vive makes for a dull experience. The moon itself looked awful, as did the landing module and the American flag. Really lacking polish and woe factor.\n\nThe audio and radio chatter is quite nice but looking around the moon, i didn't feel immersed in the whole experience.\n\nGraphics could have been a lot better, audio doesn't always sound too good and it's like it was heavily compressed even in good headphones it didn't sound all that crisp and clear.\n\nI'd say try and grab it when it's on sale but not really worth full price. More care and time was needed to add polish to this experience. It is informative and educational and for that I have to commend the team, but it was underwhelming and could have been far better.","May 21","false","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's accuarte, provides a really good sense of the scale of everything (especially the size of the Saturn V), and is an enjoyable hour long experience.\n\nThis game could use some better textures, more first-person experiences, and some room-scale moonwalking (though that may be disorienting). I would also have liked to be able to move around in the spaceships and get to interact with the controls more directly. As it was, I couldn't read all of the labels in the cockpit.\n\nGranted, a lot of these flaws are because this was developed more for the Oculus which doesn't have room scale but it would have been nice to take advantage of that.","May 25","true","0.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Recommended to everyone as a reminder of the real heroes of the 20th century and a story that needs to be regularly shared. NASA and the broader space community should embrace this new technology to inspire the next generation to do more than just play games.","May 28","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As ride alongs on rockets go it's somewhat lackluster and definately lacks any replayability of it's compitors. Objects in the game are well modelled but often the low quality textures take you out of the experience. As it stands the visuals are okay. The strongest thing it has going for is it's use of music to set the mood. It's also quite short.\n\nOn the one hand, this is one of the first VR experiences of its type and that is applaudable. Additionally the small user base for VR means it's got to be hard to recoop development costs... But even so it feels overpriced. See even as a VR headset user I'm not going to get anything more out of this and I got little it of it as it was. It's a good demo for showing off to friends to give them an idea of where VR experiences are headed... But it's nothing spectacular in it's own right.\n\nUnless of course you know nothing about the Apollo 11 mission, never heard the JFK speech before, generally experienced little of the moon landing media... Then it's a rather impressive introduction to those things. As a one off.\n\nBut for the same money you could buy 3 feature length movies on the topic just as moving and inspiring if not more so. Is it fare to compare the product of a small studio to Hollywood productions? Does that alone justify paying more? That's up to the consumer.\n\nOne area they had the chance to stand out was the interactive sequences. Unfortunately experiences are super simplistic and dumbed down or otherwise limited by the controls, plus few and far between. There are a lot of almost unnecassary drawn out external camera shots which while setup to set the mood, would be much more compelling if the player was given control durin them, to take them at their own pace and explore as they will.\n\nThat's not to say I don't think the developer hasn't put effort in. But while they are showing off some of the strengths of the medium they are drasticly underutilising others. There is some educational value to the product and it does stand up as a "demo" but it's not much more then that. I also definately want the developer to make their money back on it so we can see more such VR experiences and better ones as the medium is explored more.\n\nAs it stands, unless you have a lot of friends you are trying to show VR off to, have teenagers in the household or are really obsessed with the American space program... I'd wait till this product is on sale. Hopefully when it is it will sell well.\n\n\n\n","June 4","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
