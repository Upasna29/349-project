Very comfortable experience.\n• Environment looks great.\n• Motion controllers are solid once you get the hang of it. Throwing the rocks takes some practice, but once I got it then it became second nature\n• Good spatial audio\n• The magic particle effects look awesome in VR\n\nCONS:\n• I wish the game had some more missions. It looks like the developer is planning this, though.\n• I'd like to see the goblins have a hit point system of some sort and they should attack the player.\n\nAll in all this is a solid casual game for the Vive and I'll be checking back a lot to see when they add new features.","April 11","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
