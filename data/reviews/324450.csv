Your strategy build with each run at defending the Earth it is fast paced and you really have to use timing to upgrade and have a build strategy in mind before setting out. Very interested in what the final product will be like, lots of potential and great fun.","January 3, 2015","true","9.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Good combination of strategy and action involved with simple earth alien confrontation defense survival basis. Good job !!","December 28, 2014","true","191.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
