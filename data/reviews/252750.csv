Finding one solution to pass a level is usually trivial, but if you aim to collect every anima shard and get all three mice to the cheese, you might be in for a challenge.\n\nThe first stage is relatively simple and does a good job of introducing you to the gameplay mechanics. By the end of stage two though, I found myself genuinely stumped at some of the puzzles. I probably spent a good ten minutes or more figuring out some of those last challenges.\n\nThe game also has a cutesy story in between stages that I found charming in a quirky way. If you've played these kinds of puzzle games before, you probably know what to expect in terms of exposition. It's never going to win a video game award for best story, but it serves its purpose in providing some small reward for progression.\n\nOverall, the 80 levels should take 6-10 hours to complete, depending on your skills with puzzle solving, and there's enough variation to keep you entertained throughout the game. There is also a very good and intuitive level editor that should provide additional content through Steam Workshop when support for it is added. In the meantime, it's possible to share and download player created levels via a Dropbox account the developer has set up.\n\nIt's a game I don't hesitate to recommend and it is among my absolute favourites in the puzzle genre.","May 22, 2014","true","30.6"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","41","53","0","0"

The puzzles are straighforward, but propose a nice, non-frustrating challenge should you decide to get a "Perfect" rating.\n\nI think the game finds a nice balance in its audience as it can appeal to both the young and the "old." From personal experience, teenagers and overall competitive people will not enjoy the game very much as it is not fast paced and does not rely on skill, but rather your ability to analyze a situation and consider all the elements that are part of it. It does have leaderboards, but the scoring system is a bit obscure, making competition somewhat pointless.\n\nTo me, it is a perfect game to play after a stressful day to unwind. It is colorful, cute, and the cat scientist on the background, Schrödinger, always makes me smile with his reactions to the things you do. So, even if you fail a puzzle, it is still fun to watch him react to it -- you don't feel like you're losing, but that you should try better next time.\n\nI'd also recommend this game to achievement hunters: it is very easy to get all the achievements; the second quickest I ever played. So even if you're not into puzzles, it should be simple to get it to 100% (especially with all the guides already available) and crank up your achievement percentage up a bit. Plus you'll be supporting a really cool indie developer -- they're awesome, hard-working people that have a lot of creativity and good ideas to share.\n\nI've followed this project for quite a long time while it was in development, and I must say they did quite a good job, especially for being their first game. The quality is impressive, and the amount of polish shows they're really enjoying what they are doing. That alone makes them deserve our support. Crunching Koalas is an innovative indie game developer that brings that much-needed breath of fresh air to our gaming community, and I am looking forward to many other great games they might create.","November 25, 2013","true","174.8"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","3"

Taking advantage of the crumbling foundations of the old terrace building I live in, they attempted to take over. Eventually I managed to fight back the mice incursion and block off their access into my territory. I tell you this as I think it’s important to be transparent with the fact that the mice and I have history. So hopefully you can trust that when I say the mice in Mousecraft are adorable and I really wanted to keep them safe, I really mean it.\n\nMousecraft is the new game from the wonderfully named Crunching Koalas. The idea is simple, guide mice through a level to the cheese. Because science. The gameplay is a curious mix of Tetris and Lemmings and I have been utterly charmed by this game. It’s bright and colourful, the music toe tappingly jolly and the fusion of puzzle classics works intuitively and offers some fun mazes to take on.\n\nRight off the bat, the game made me smile by featuring a cat scientist named Schrödinger. Poor old Shrödy has a problem, he desperately wants to continue his animal experiments but he doesn’t have enough dosh to fund them and build his mouse powered pipe dream. Fortunately for him, and indeed the scientific process in general, a mysterious benefactor steps in to offer to fund the experiments in exchange for crystals the mice collect.\n\nEach level gives you a set of obstacles to get across and a few “Tetrominos” blocks to form a path for the mice. Once let out of their mouse wheel, the mice won’t stop until they have the cheese at the end. And who could blame them? While things start very simplistic and a little too obvious with the solutions to each level, the game adds features regularly enough to keep interest up. It’s not long until you are faced with obstacles such as robot rats, exploding blocks, perilous falls or acid baths.\n\nThis leads to some unfortunately ethical quandaries. Just why is this mad scientist cat doing these experiments in the first place? What possible reason could he have had to construct mice hating robot rats, and then to put them together in the same maze? Why does he need mouse activated high explosives as part of his mouse based experimentation. In short, I’m dubious as to whether Dr Schrödinger’s experiments meet the regulations required by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\n\nLuckily, our mysterious benefactor doesn’t appear to care about such things and is happy to allow all sorts of out of control science to go ahead. So the game is free to chuck in more tools for aiding the mice, such as a jelly block to break their fall (mice can only free fall three tiles), block busting bombs to clear the path or crumbling blocks to separate the trio of mice and put them on different paths. It all feels well balanced and thought through, creating fun puzzles that are satisfying to pass but don’t frustrate. It may lack complexity and experienced puzzle gamers may not be too challenged on most levels, but the whole experience is satisfying and presented in such an amusing way that it doesn’t detract from the enjoyment of the game. Some levels can feel too similar to the last and there isn't much variety in the sound effects, but it introduces new elements regularly enough that any hints of repetition are dealt with quickly.\n\nWith four sections of twenty levels each, there are plenty of puzzles to solve. On top of that there is a level creator to build your own fiendish puzzles, although there is not yet any in-game method of sharing levels with the community. User-made levels can be downloaded by getting files from people on the forums, but hopefully a more intuitive sharing system can be implemented in a future update.\n\nI’ve been enjoying my time with Mousecraft. It’s a cute and perfectly paced puzzle game with some great ideas and adorable graphics. It’s currently part of the Indie Piñata promotion (a selection of games on discount with further discounts if you own any of the others in the selection) and offers players around 5-6 hours of charming puzzling for the main game. It’s helped me put the mouse war of 2012/13 behind me and heal old wounds. For that, I am eternally grateful. Mice, all is forgiven.\n\nFrom Coffee Break Gaming[www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk].","December 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

I have to say, it's highly amusing and entertaining. Of course the first levels are simple, as with any game you have to understand the basics. This actually reminds me of the gifted program IQ testing, being able to predict an outcome many steps ahead (except with much less mouse death).  I find some levels incredibly easy and others I rage at and have to walk away from for a few minutes. At one point I was yelling and calling the developers of the game some choice names... all in good fun. I wouldn't exactly compare it to tetris, its about using your pieces wisely, not fitting them together neatly. If you are actually trying to complete all of the goals (all three mice, all the shards) it can be challenging... and I feel for the first mouse, who I have dubbed "bomb squad mouse," for good reason.\n\nSummary:\n\nPROS\n-Adorable graphics\n-Yes, it is actually challeging if you seek perfection\n-No crashes, well made\n-I'd call it a brain game, exercising logic, prediction and cause/effect\n-Mice.

After level 30 or so my game stopped showing "perfect score" at the end of a level, the little TV says 0/3 etc, though the Stats accurately show scores so it's hardly a big deal.

But thankfully, Mousecraft is much better than I first thought.\n\nYou must help mice reach each level's destination and collect crystals along the way. The mice go mindlesly forward and your only way to help them is by using Tetris-like blocks to make them a viable path. It sound basic, but Mousecraft regularly introduces new kinds of blocks (explosive, bouncy, fragile, recyclable...) and hazards. Coupled with some clever level design, it keeps things fresh until the end. I found the general difficulty level perfectly suited to my tastes: it often requires careful thinking and planning, while remaining solvable for non-superhuman beings (I'm looking at you, Spacechem!)\n\nAll is not rosy though. There are some issues, none of them game-breaking, but slightly annoying:\n- Mild bugs\n- While I enjoyed the general difficulty level, the difficulty curve was somewhat random with some levels in the middle much more difficult than those in the end.\n- The visuals and music lack variety.

There's no time limit so you can sit back and carefully consider all the possible ways of achieving that goal.\n\nThe levels start out very easy and get more challenging as you progress. You'll eventually find yourself staring at the screen, running possible permutations through your head until.... "eureka!", you figure it out and feel a right smarty-pants... until you see the next puzzle.\n\nDifferent kinds of Tetromino-shaped blocks are introduced throughout the game to keep it fresh and interesting. These include jelly, explosive and electric blocks. There are also water and acid hazards to add to the challenge.\n\nThe game is addictive. When I finished it I wanted to go back and gold-star every level. And when that's done there are a bunch of Achievements to be had as well. Most of them you'll get playing through the story mode, but there are others to aim for, too, like frying 10 mice!\n\nFor one of the Achievements you have to make your own puzzle in the Level Editor. You know, Nintendo are really pushing level design in games like Pushmo World, Mario vs Donkey Kong, Smash Bros and soon, Mario Maker. Well, you can do it in MouseCraft, too. It would be nice if levels could be shared via Steam Workshop instead of in the forums, but it's a minor gripe.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Mousecraft and wholeheartedly recommend it to puzzle game fans.","March 15, 2015","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And you can't drop 4-pieces for a Tetris.\n\nThere's this mad scientist cat Schrödinger running experiments FOR SCIENCE, all of them involving three mice making their way through a puzzle-maze thingie. It's your job to make sure at least one mouse makes it safely from its little wheel to a faraway piece of cheese.\nThat's the core premise. Your mice are blissfully stupid and just walk in a straight line until they hit an obstacle they can't jump over, which causes them to turn. You're given a couple of "tetris" pieces, and must drop them into the right spot to create a path to the exit. Mice don't jump very high- one block, that's it. Mice also can die from a long drop, or being squished by a tetris piece. It's a dangerous lab for sure.\n\nOne thing that MouseCraft does absolutely great is establishing the puzzle formula and then adding to it. As usual the first few levels are really easy, and once you've got the basics down, more and more elements are added. In order to make it into later levels you need a certain amount of glowing blue crystals, which your mice can pick up on their way. Enemies (robot rats) start to roam the levels. Blocks can be destroyed with pickup bombs, slippery ice blocks and bouncy jello blocks are added to your arsenal. And more often than not there is a simple solution to a level, but in oder to rescue all three mice and collect all the goodies, you'll need to think around corners a bit. At around level 12 I found myself starting to really think, instead of just recognizing a standard challenge "that has been done in other games". It's a solid puzzler and it seems to deploy its collection of blocks, timing, environmental hazards and the greed to score "perfect" to great effect.\n\nIt's also a downright cute game. The 3D models are nicely animated, from the sweet little mice to the downright hilarious Schrödinger, who always keeps an eye on the experiment with gleeful joy or puzzled amazement. The sound effects are okay, but not outstanding; the music however, really can get stuck in your head. It's all really whimsical and cartoonish; my only gripe is that the mice themselves just lack the personality of their Lemmings ancestors.\n\nControls are simple and easy. Blocks are picked and places with a single mouse click, and the interface allows quick restart and even has a "fast forward" button to speed up the slow pace of the rodent odyssey. You also get an "active pause" that freezes time but allows you to still place blocks- all you need is there in the form of friendly large buttons.\n\nDespite the child-friendly presentation (no violence at all, even a dead mouse just turns into... a cartoon mouse ghost) the puzzle difficulty starts to ramp towards the end of the first "map" (20 levels), and the game boasts a total of 80 levels- so I haven't even made it to the halfway mark and can't say how tricky things will be later on. It's probably too hard for children, who may still enjoy watching someone play the game. It has this thick cute charming feel.\n\n80 levels are a good amount of content, too, especially when you're the kind of player who MUST have all the perfect scores. And if 80 levels are NOT enough, you can make your own with an easy-to-use level editor. With Steam integration in place, you can easily make your own contraptions and share them as you see fit.\n\nThe price is probably a bit higher than one expects from a "simple puzzler" these days- but the overall quality of the game easily justifies the price tag. You get a really polished, solid brain-twister here, you can make your own levels, and did I mention how insanely cute the mice are?

Both of those games are classics, everybody should know Tetris and while Lemmings isn't as widely know, it can be considered a cult hit.\n\nFor those that weren't playing games during 90s, in short Lemmings was game where lemmings needed to be lead safely to exit. That was done by assigning different tasks like digging to few of the lemmings. As that has to be done at the same time when lemmings were dumbly walking forward, things could get quite hectic. In more difficult levels that lead quite ofthen to giving up by blowing up all the remaining lemmings.\n\nWhat Mousecraft has taken from Lemmings is that mice have to be lead to cheese.  They're as dumb as lemmings and will keep on walking forward, no matter if they will drop to acid pool for example.\n\nHow those dangers are avoided is that blocks can be dropped and that block will for example cover pool of acid. Or more commonly those blocks can form stairs that mice will climb up to the cheese. Challenge comes from shape of the blocks and fitting them with the obstacles. Blocks have been predefined to suit the level. How they suit the level and help the mice with their objective is up to you to figure out.\n\nRegular blocks are just the beginning as later levels introduce blocks that have new features.\n\nGame can be finished in a weekend, though finishing all the levels perfectly provides additional challenge. To me it felt like most difficult part of the game is somewhere in the middle. Last part of the game has less challenging puzzles, challenge comes more from timing everything right in order not to squash the mice with the blocks.\n\nThere's no Workshop support, so sharing levels created with the level editor is not as easy it could be.\n\nGet it, if you like puzzle games.","January 11, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With Steam integration in place, you can easily make your own contraptions and share them as you see fit.\n\nThe price is probably a bit higher than one expects from a "simple puzzler" these days- but the overall quality of the game easily justifies the price tag. You get a really polished, solid brain-twister here, you can make your own levels, and did I mention how insanely cute the mice are? Really, give it a go!","September 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, I find it amazing how this was early access for steam but yet has the interface of a smartphone app. Something is not right and in any case this game is too expensive so you shouldn't get it unless it's on a sale higher than 50%. To be honest, if i were talking to a friend and he saw this game and asked me if I should recommend him getting it, I would say no, and hence, I wil say no here as well.","February 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The difficulty so far may be not enough for hardcore puzzle players. The graphics, music and effects for a puzzle game is great.\n\nThe game divided into 4 sections and the beta version only available 2 sections and 1 more level from the 3rd section, which means 41 levels. There should be 80 levels in the full game.\nAs the game goes, new features will be unlocked, giving more variety things to the puzzle.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the launch of the game, I played through the whole game in several hours. Most of the remaining 39 levels are not tricky. So if you hope for some hardcore puzzle game, this may not give you satisfactory, and it's a little bit expensive for the game this short.\n\nHopefully there's a level editor. I'm looking forward to release some more difficult puzzles.","June 11, 2014","true","6.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"
