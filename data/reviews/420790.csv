Basically the weirdest combinations of 3 words to describe a game. Starbreak is really different from the games you’re used to playing.\n-Tight controls, although they take some getting used to at first.\n-Great soundtrack.\n-Large scale boss battles. Think Terraria large.\n-Not pay2win\n\nMy thoughts as an ex-player of Realm of the Mad God:\nI think this game expands on the fundamental ideals of rotmg very well.\nThere isn't too much grinding to find equipment, while in realm you need to get lucky to find potions/equipment. In Starbreak, the equivalent of stat potions are dropped frequently.\nBecause of this, the game rewards skill by progressing you quickly, but an unskilled player will be met with permadeath. This challenges players to master the different zones and learn enemy attack patterns, and it challenges new players to reach a higher mark/defeat a higher zone every life.\nHigh end characters are a lot stronger than new ones, but not as much as they were in realm.\n\nVerdict?\nI think this game is great, and it can only get better as more content is added. You should try it, but keep in mind that this type of gameplay isn't for everyone.","May 10","true","14.4"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","50","59","6","1"

When we finally did, it was the best thing ever- and that stands true to this day when it comes to bosses.\n\nThe game is permadeath, so when you die you lose everything. A lot is going on at all times, and no shell really has that much defense. Ironclad may have high health and defense, but it's slow and can't dodge well- you need skill for every single shell to stay alive. This makes every accomplishment all the better, compounded by the fact that Starbreak is a multiplayer game- you can share and brag about the things you've done~\n\nI can't wait too see where this game goes, and I hope it survives. Hopefully we can still be playing years from now :3","May 10","true","33.0"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","33","44","2","0"

When you first start off, it is very easy to figure out what to do and where to go. Later in the game, you find a complex system that is awesome and you learn alot more about the game. This game has a very good way of making simple things into something bigger. With only 16 dungeons in the game, it seems like a lot more and you have a lot of fun exploring these places.

Yes it does take inspiration from multiple games\nbut its does them right !\nI tag this game as a metroidvania , rougelike-ish, ARPG , MMO.\n\nWhy Metroidvania ?\nSImple. Any game like metroid or castlevania involves backtracking and item hunting . This game is just that,\nto the point where you are learning the maps like castlevania , yes there is RNG for maps , but its low and its hardly noticeable until later game.\nAlso loot is very similar to games with progressive items like binding of Isaac and Enter the gungeon.\nBoth passive and active.\n\nWhich brings me to rougelike-ish.\nI say "ish" because its not completely rougelike. Its mixed , to explain better ill use The Binding of Isaac.\nPermadeath is the big "ding" when its comes to the word rougelike. So saying all that , In StarBreak you perform missions, These can be done at anytime at your will, and does not require you to die or restart after completion . Thus allowing total control over building a character!\n\nThat winds in with its overall ARPG tag,\nThis game is a total ARPG aswell, with leveling and item builds , to fighting in various locations fighting massive bosses. Yeah sounds ARPG to me. Your always in the action and that's what makes it great. Never does it draw you to a boring spot in the game for hours!\nThe platforming is spot on with popular platformers and it does a great job changing the playstyle with each shell you play as. "Shells being the class system in the game"\n\nAnd lastly , MMO\nIt is a true MMO , populated zones maxed with players,\nHub worlds packed with spam and 100s of players. Its great.\nThe best feeling is when you have a team of 50 burn though a level and maybe like 1-2 of you died.\nMakes you feel as you were raiding or something along those lines. Total intense action that will keep you coming back\nif you are into that sort of fun!\n\nThere is NO Pay to WIn, the only thing that you'll be spending money on is convenience , that fact that they allow you to buy shell storage is very nice of them and that should be taken as a reward for our dedication to this game. In my honest standing , these guys need the money. Because ones things forsure, this game will keep on progressing into the future of content and more!\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10 overall, For this game to be this stable and fun at this stage is exciting and makes me hope for the future of StarBreak and the devs.","May 15","true","67.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vladissius/recommended/420790/","vladissius","VladiSSius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vladissius/","35 products in account","tl;dr version : I don't like permadeath feature. It's not for me, especially in an ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. Did not recommended it for casual player. This is NOT a casual game. This is a HARD game. A challenging one. You WILL die a lot. So you need to learn all the aspect. But for people who enjoy this kind of gameplay, go ahead try it! I recommend this game for hardcore gamers who love hack n slash side scrolling game!\n\n====\n\nLong review =\n\n- Gameplay : Gameplay and concept of the game is pretty fun. It's also hack n slash, side-scroller game. If you are fans of any of these genre, you might love it. If you never played anything that has permadeath and rogue-like, I suggest you watch someone's video first before you try. If you don't mind about permadeath, then go ahead, StarBreak is fine and challenging!\n\n- Control : This game... totally lacks in control department. I can give example of Castevania and Metroid, where you can shoot UP, DOWN and DIAGONAL (left and right is obvious). But here, you can't shot UP and DOWN. So if the enemy happens to be above you, you either take hits OR you move away to get you space to shoot. If this game exist during 1990's I can forgive the control mechanics. But this is 2016, it SHOULD'VE improved ALOT. But nope, not with StarBreak.\n\n- Sound : The music is pretty catchy and awesome! I like the boss battle theme, it feels like you've met something terrible, BUT you are given spiritual support in form of upbeat music that will lift your spirits! I like it. Really Really like it!\n\n- Graphics : Graphics is... well... pretty bad actually. Not because it's pixelated but because your character is small on screen, and background/foreground detail is not differentiated, meaning that it WILL confuse you to locate enemy projectile, small enemy, or even yourself. It should be made like in Contra or several Castlevania games, where background colour is dimmed so that the actual pane where the game takes place is actuated and not confusing. But talking about animation, it's smooth. Feels good to me.\n\n- System : StarBreak size is small, less than 500mb of installation files. And spec requirement is not high. Also I didn't encounter any crashes/bugs/glitch yet. I'm sure it's stable program, nothing to worry.\n\n- Services : StarBreak implements cash shop where you can buy costumes to your liking. But beware, due to permadeath, all of your cash item WILL BE GONE. FOREVER. So, if you don't mind spending money for items that will be disappeared when you die, you go ahead. For me, nah I'm sane person. Won't just throw away my money like that :)\n\n\n- Points that I don't like :\n* I didn't like permadeath, so this game is clearly not for me.\n* Control mechanic is pretty bad. Another major disappointment for a game that should be challenging because of it's design, not of it's horrible control mechanics.\n* Although the concept is ok, but once you play it you will feel "bland". Because ingame, you won't gonna have chit chat with fellow players as chat window is too small, has no feature other than "public chat" and you can't invite friends/group to other. This feels like a singleplayer game, with multiplayer drop-in features. For me, this feels weird.\n* Cash items gone once you died. A big nope for me.\n\n- Points that I like :\n* Challenging gameplay, you will be haunted with "omg pls dont die" feels whenever your character goes below 50% :)  With that, you MUST try to master your classes (Shell) so that you will survive. This game is HARD, so don't expect lenient enemies or easy boss. Even the smallest enemy could kill you fast if you are not careful. Reminds me of my days playing Gradius, it's hard and once you die you basically goes back to level 1 :)) But over time, if you are serious player, you will get better and better.","May 12","false","28.5"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","32","59","2","0"

It amazed me at how many people were actually with me while doing an area! 30 People at once, fighting a boss is absolute MADNESS and thats what rocks about it!  Fight with friends or with randoms in completing certain areas. Its so difficult its fun. Not only that, but this FREE game is actually FREE. The stuff that you can decide to pay for are all simple cosmetics that no one will really notice anyway, so it doesnt matter if you actually get it or not. This game was meant to be played, and played for free. Nothing in this game is any sort of P2W BS that many other free games have these days. I believe thats why this game will explode on steam. We just need to give a few weeks, and by then this game will be one of the best releases on steam.  I really do enjoy this game, I play it every day.\n\nThe games art style and playtype isn't somethign that you see now a days. It is a shooter, but a platform shooter. It is a platform shooter, but you can only shoot in certain directions. There is no free aim mode or anything like that. Sounds pretty lame doesnt it? Thats the difficulty of it! One of the key points in this game though, is that once you die, you lose everything that the character had! All those hours spent on this character? Ha! To bad! He is now dead, and so is your spirit. You may now close the game to rethink your gaming life. You will feel that a few times while playing this game, but I can assure you that is never the end.\n\nWith 4 different classes, each one can become unlocked after a few levels. So if you dont like the beginning class, you are forced to grind on it untill you gain enough account levels to use the next character. One you die, you gain experience based on how well you played that character. It is VERY grindy, but in the end it doesnt really matter ;)\n\nSo dude, like what will make me want to play this game? For starters, this isnt a starter game. It will take time to get into the feel of the game before you can really get into it. You in the beginning you may pick it up from time to time, but once you really start to enjoy the game? You might just pick it up before playing anything else that day. Thats how it was for me atleast.\n\nThe play style and the graphics are very well done for this game type. The animations and such are very well done too, so bravo on that one!\n\nIf you enjoyed Realm Of The Mad God, then you will most likely enjoy this, except this doesnt have all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that ROTMD had.\n\nThe challenge that this game brings is great. Your not able to just pick it up, you have to learn what the game does, how it acts and you have to remember what monsters do what attacks, and what those attacks do. Theres a lot of multi proccessing that your mind has to do while playing this game, and depending on that along with your reaction time will depend on how well you play the game. WIth time comes skill, and with skill comes grind.\n\nBro, theres gotta be something that you dont like about this game The cosmetics that you can buy with real money go away once you die. So, you have wasted money based on your skill. Thats pretty annoying, so if cosmetics could become a perma thing after purchase, that would be great.\n\nThe amount of things happening on the screen at once can sometimes be very hard to know whats going on and where. It does help that there is a circle around your own character, but when there are 20 people in the same area, its hard to keep track of where you are. Maybe if you put in a color system, where the player is allowed to change the color of the circle to whatever pleases and catches there eyes better.\n\nNot a whole lot that I can think of at the moment. But once I do find some more stuff I will be putting it in as it comes up.\n\n\nThanks for sitting through my review! Check out my other reviews and guides!\n","May 13","true","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misutto/recommended/420790/","misutto","Miss Tron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misutto/","292 products in account","Product received for free\n\nStarBreak is a roguelike co-operative platformer that's centered around player progression.\n\nWhen I say "centered around player progression" I say it as opposed to classic in-game character progression, which is what MMO's and most games do these days.\nStarBreak has permadeath. If you die with your character (your shell, as the game calls it), all his stuff is lost, he's gone forever (god bless his soul) and you win experience points that level up your Soul based on how far he got. Having a higher soul level lets you unlock the other characters that have completely different playstyles from the original one you get.\n\nWhat a lot of people don't seem to understand is that the level progression is entirely artificial. They make you wait to play the other characters because they want to player to get more experienced with the game and enemies to be able to know how to react to different situations according to the unlocked character and it's difficulty.\n\nThis game has basically no progression other than the stash, because as mentioned before it's a game about player progression.\nGetting further and further into the game can only be done through first-hand experience with the enemies, which feel consistent and fair given how they're placed strategically on the terrain.\nThis is basically how it goes, in order:\n1.You'll get hit by stuff you see coming.\n2.You'll get hit by stuff you saw coming, but couldnt manage to avoid it.\n3.You'll get hit a lot by stuff you didn't know could do X in X way.\n4.You'll die to situations you couldn't predict other than experiencing them.\n\nNow, all of the above will gradually go away, until you can control your character consistenyl and be constantly aware of the environment, which feels extremely rewarding for the player, complemented by it's MMO aspect:\nWhen racing through a difficult dungeon with others, most of the times only the experienced, skilled and thick-skinned players push on and advance. Not the ones that tediously grinded for days, built their character differently, or whatever the hell other games do: They got there because they faced the challenges and persevered, by dying to them previously over and over and over again.\n\nThere is a cash currency in the game, known as UC. With it, you can buy additional stashes and player slots, coupled with a few vanity hats on rotation.Additional stashes are useful if you're keeping the equipment for the next character, and the hats are lost on death too. What I would argue goes against the main point of the game, are the additional player slots.\nHaving additional player slots means you get more loot efficiency than other players that don't, should you choose to play more characters at once. In a game about not dying and getting as far as possible, being able to change shells sort of kills the feeling of only having one life as, since there's no trading, you're essentially saving the equipment you can't use with the current shell, to yourself. Not your "future" self, but your "now" self. A possibility free players don't have.\n\nIt is however, not a game for everyone. It seems extremely unforgiving in certain aspects and I feel like having to explain the fun of the game to someone else defeats the purpose if the person itself didn't find it fun. Many don't like it for it's permadeath aspect, yet I feel like they're just missing the point entirely.\nWhile it is quite sad to lose all the progress in a simple mistake, a lot of the times, to me, felt justified. Be it a bit of bad luck, bad positioning or a tough enemy: whenever I was about to die, I could feel it in my veins that those were my last moments, and that was exactly how it was meant to be.\nThe game is what it is. There's no point in trying to make it something that it is not. Removing permadeath would remove a lot of the tension which IMO is a huge part of StarBreak.\n\nIf you liked the early days megaman and metroid, you'll probably have a blast with this game. The multiplayer aspect works really well with it, more than i'd initially thought it would. Coupled with the permadeath, it's a game where while in lower levels you just shrug off character deaths, later on you really feel for them, and i've sacrificed myself more than once in hopeless boss fights to let the other players teleport back to base (takes like 10 seconds of standing still) by providing them with cover fire. As another review said: "It felt like ♥♥♥♥ing Starship Troopers."\n\nSome more technical points:\nThe gamepad feel is great. I used and Xbox controller for it and it's already binded, with some emotes custom-bound to the D-pad. What bothers me is the second character's (Duskwing) dash control, since for some reason the special dash is canceled if you let your movement stick go back to neutral position. It can be really ♥♥♥♥ing confusing to see her just stall after doing the dash because you moved your stick to the same direction she's going, but that's minor once you get used to it. (THIS ISSUE WAS FIXED A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS REVIEW, CHEERS DEVS)\n\nNeedless to say, it runs well. The graphics aren't intensive, keeping it in a stable 60 fps, and the design aesthetics never feel off from the visual pacing aswell.\nSound wise, the effects have a pleasant hit-noise and the music's good. It's not that memorable, but it definitely sets the scene for each environment and scenario presented, enough to make cold-blooded people have a decent surge of adrenaline.\n\nAll in all, it's a great free to play time-killer and tons of fun for those that like the jump'n'shoot genre and/or want to fool around with friends. It may feel rewarding to beat enemies you previously died to whilst growing as a player yourself, but it's always more satisfying when you do it with other people.","May 12","true","92.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are some minor annoyances, like leveling up is somewhat pointless other than so that you can gain access to different shells, group instances can become dispersed leaving you all alone, and microtransactions in the game are overpriced for what you get; but overall I am loving the game and can't wait to play some more!\n\nIf you like games like Contra and Mega Man, you will like this game. It is difficult, challenging, frustrating, but at no point have I found it to be unfair.\n\nLike many others, I hope this game lives on and receives the attention and acclaim it rightly deserves!\n\nUPDATE: After playing now for 15+ hours and getting into the mid levels, I am finding that this game being fun is now solely based on getting a good group together, which is completely dependent on people actually playing the game. I played for about 2 hours last night and for about 40 minutes I found the game to be pretty much unplayable because no one else was wanting to play the same level that I was working on.\n\nI still find this game to be fun, but it is becoming increasingly more dependent on getting a good group together which can be difficult at times.","May 16","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have died, a lot.\n\nThere is quite a bit of content, there are 7 normal dungeons, and 7 elite versions of said dungeons, elite versions are much harder with new boss phases, tricks and even enemies, along with the buffed HP and damage of the enemies.\n\nThere are ingame purchases, however it is not neccessary, you have the option to buy cosmetics which die along with your character. This is more of an option to put on a prized character for the more veteran players I feel. It is not neccessary at all.\n\nYou can buy extra character slots, and extra storage space, which is nice, however not neccessary, as you only really need to save the vault space for items for your next character.\n\nThe in game money is very worth it, you can buy extra rare items with around 5k-12k of the in game money in secret shops in the harder dungeons, which is a lot, however the items are very powerful, and generally worth it.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys hard to learn games, however it is by no means for the easy going player, it is frustrating at times, yet for me, it is extremely rewarding.","May 17","true","10.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's essentially a Metroidvania game but with MMO systems and permadeath in place, challenging you to build up characters and play smart to see how far you can get.   Death has its rewards though, as you gain experience which can go towards unlocking new classes (called Shells) that offer different playstyles.\n\nWhile you can just rush along with the other players running to the right towards the next area, I personally find it more fun to take my time and explore each area before moving on, as you get more powerups and most of the places that are off the main pathway lead to enemies that drop chests full of loot.   Loot of course being potential weapon/equipment upgrades and currency used towards buying more upgrades.\n\nThe F2P model seems very fair and so far doesn't feel restrictive or pay to win in any regards.   Stash and Shell Storage seem to be the primary things you can buy with cash shop currency, and are largely conveniences that can lessen the impact of death (as you can store more items for your next Shell or keep Shells that you already geared up on standby).   Only other thing I've noticed with a price tag are stat-less cosmetic head items, with likely more cosmetics to come in the future.\n\nOverall this game shows a lot of promise and doesn't have any of the red flags of normal F2P games.   Definitely a must-try for fans of the Metroidvania genre who like a bit of Roguelike thrown in.","May 10","true","7.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This game is not easy at first, but the difficulty makes completing a dungeon feel rewarding. The community has nice people as far as I can tell. The devs listen to the community, and they have already made updates to the game that are community focused. I really look forward to seeing this game grow.\n\nIf you have played Realm of the Mad God and enjoyed it, you might enjoy this game as well. The co-founder of Realm, Alex, worked to create this game, and I have to say that he's doing a good job. As a Realm of the Mad God veteran myself, I recommend this game to fans of dungeon crawlers, chaotic co-op gameplay, and difficult but rewarding platform shooting. Stick with this game even if seems challenging at first; the game becomes immensely entertaining once you hit the 10 hour played mark and have unlocked a few characters.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 8/10 with plenty of room for improvement and exciting updates. I want to see a guild system implemented so that it is easier for people to meet and play with friends in game.

That said, it's still pretty enjoyable, and it's free to play, so overall no complaints and still a thumbs up....just not as enthusiastic of a thumbs up as I expected to give this game before I actually played it.\n\nOn the plus side:\n- Fun sidescrolling, platforming action; if you like Contra, Metroid, CastleVania, etc you'll probably like this\n- Pretty cool art style; some different pallets in use here, a lot of nice contrast\n- Free\n- Big mobs of people all mowing through someplace...everyone fights, nobody quits\n\nOn the not-so-great side:\n- The cash cost of the currency you use to buy "extras" is out of whack; stuff is just too expensive\n- While I've seen some say that the cash stuff is a convenience, and can appreciate that perspective, some of it seems pretty useful (e.g. the ability to store a character with all their equipment for later use)\n- Fun, but staying power remains to be seen....I thought I would play this most of the evening on (Steam) release day, but find myself done after about 2 hours\n\nIt's free, so if you ever thought it would be cool to play a game like Contra, with some light RPG elements and a whole slew of random people, why not try it?","May 10","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I could see how this might be a hassle to fix, but getting gear for Fabricator when you're level 1,2, or 3 and aren't near to getting him can be a tad infuriating.\n5: There is no form of, I guess "shell XP," where regardless of how many enemies you slaughter your shell itself does not get any direct benefits from just killing enemies, again a bit more of a personal peeve than anything.\n\nStill!

You get killed, you lose that hat forever. Money well spent.\n\nOverall i think this game has a fun concept, it sorta yields to my contra and castlevania days. The only difference is the fact you have no goals in this game other than to grind away till you die. If you grind away enough and die, you get exp based on how you did through your lifetime, hopefully leveling up so you can unlock another character.\n\nYou may have multiple characters, but the gameplay just amounts to the same thing, running the same stages over n over  with a herd of other players. Looting and maybe sometimes actually contributing to killing. It's mindless fun, good enough to tide you over for a couple hours or so. The game has a difficulty curve to it and will require some finesse to survive when playing alone. If you play with others, you all seem to form a hivemind, forming a wall of death.\n\nSomething I found very appealing with this game is the native controller support. The game works perfectly well and personally I would recommend controller over keyboard for this game in particular.

In most games it's a big bummer and in this one... it's not much different. You lose everything you are carrying with you and all your stats return to base. However this game makes it so you feel compelled to do better next time.\n\nThe premise is simple: Improve yourself trial after trial. You do not gain Exp in srtings of data to your character. You gain experience by playing the game and feeling how the environment and the enemies move. (technically there is a level system but to be honest here it doesn't do anything)\n\nIn a true 2D platformer, StarBreak manages to give you the feeling of transversing a foreign planet, much like Metroid. You and everybody in the dungeon must go forward, defeat enemies and come out victorious without losing your life. And if you do, well try better next life! There are four classes (shells) to choose from once you unlock them all. Each of them have different playstyles to suit your taste.\nAs you defeant enemies you will come across boosters to your stats. These are divided by tiers in which you have to do a Tier II dungeon to get boosters after you complete your Tier I. This helps build progression.\n\nThe best thing I can think that this game has is giving you a goal to work for. Everytime after you die, you will see a list of different statistics showing how well you did in that class. But you also have your own hich scores to beat!\n\nStarBreak makes it so you can massage your own ego by saying that you can do better everytime you die and not just repeating the same process of wasting lives over and over to get the same result.","May 13","true","8.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spm09/recommended/420790/","spm09","Spm09","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spm09/","82 products in account","TL:DR version- This game will ♥♥♥♥ you up, but in a good way.\n\n\nSo I played Starbreak back when it was in browser and honestly, for how early it was in the dev cycle you could tell the potention that it had and still has. When they add a friend and party system I feel this game is going to blow up. Until then it might not get as much attention but it is still a blast to just play at night and chill with. When I play this game I get a very Binding of Isaac vibe from how it is fairly simple to learn but when you see someone who is actually good at the game (at least better and played longer) then your mouth will drop at what they can do with ease. I think another feature that they should add would be private missions, just for the challenge because I know there are masochists out there who will play the ♥♥♥♥ out of that.\n\nTo cover the loot system is super simple, all it is, is a very universal system. Meaning that when an item drops, no matter the item, it will drop for EVERYONE in that mission. Of course the chances of those rare drops are still slim but the fact that you can't party with a friend who gets an item that you've been grinding for before you is just such a great idea. On top of that someone who gets a health drop at full health and picks it up, doesn't affect you since it drops for you too. The system also accounts for ninja-ing loot. You can't just pick up an item because it's good but for a different shell, or class, because unless you stash it, it's useless, plus you have what I would describe as personal loot. Meaning that when it drops, everyone can see it but they can't just steal it because you will have it on your client and everyone else will get their own drop of the same item. It's someone difficult to describe appropriately.\n\nI'll end this review now since it's turning more into a ramble than a review. In short this is very much a game to play if you want just endless play time and a great loot system.","May 12","true","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though I recommend this game, it certainly isn't suited to everybody.\n\nAfter choosing from one of four classes (unlocked through exp gained from playing) the player then has to explore levels, fight enemies and eventually kill the boss. Enemies drop stat increases that are capped based on the difficulty of the level and equipment that increase stats and alter your abilities. Ricocheting bullets, bullet spread, armour piercing bullets, to name a few upgrades. I'd like to see more variation, but it still keeps things interesting. The hit-boxes feel tight and accurate, there seems to be no server lag, and I've experienced no frame rate issues.\n\nThere is perma-death, and yes, you will die. You will lose your character, you will lose all your inventory (except your stashed items) and you may feel as though you wasted your time. Some people find that frustrating, and that's perfectly fine. I enjoy that death has a weight to it, and that I am genuinely afraid of being killed. I'm terrified to go into the next room in case it's a boss; I'm scared to jump down that hole because of what might be waiting for me; I'm anxious about fighting an enemy that I don't yet fully understand.\n\nLevels are procedurally generated, so every time you repeat a dungeon it's a little bit different. I enjoy them, but I think they're a little too long, and I'd rather get to the more interesting boss fights quicker. The few boss fights I have encountered have been an absolute joy, and so far they've been fantastic, a true highlight. Punishing, to be sure, but oh so rewarding to kill. I'm really looking forward to encountering more of them.\n\nMy favourite part of this game is the comradery I built with complete strangers. When you enter a level, other players may already be there, or they may follow you in. Let's say we enter the 1st level with 20 people. The first few sections are an absolute cluster of mayhem and destruction, with enemies mowed down left and right. A few people teleport home because they're low; a few more randomly die. It's disappointing, but you move on. At the mid-boss, a couple more die, lose their character and miss out on loot. I feel bad for them. Now we're a 10 man group, and some of us are low on health.\n\nDespite being low on health, the 10 remaining are strong players, and they all make it to the final boss. But this one is far harder than the mid-boss. At first he seems quick and easy, but the lowest HP member who wasn't prepared for a boss fight dies the moment he gets too close. Suddenly, the boss changes into it's 2nd phase; 2 members are caught off guard, panic, and die. As you're all sure the boss is nearly dead, a few members get too cocky and die getting greedy for damage. By the time the boss falls, 4 of the original 20 remain. The loot tastes like victory, but there was a cost getting here. The fact that death is so harshly punished gives me a real sense of empathy for those that die along the way.\n\nNow onto my least favourite part of this game - the monetisation. If you feel like playing a different class, you have 2 options - die, and lose all the progress of your character, or pay real money and store your character. If you want to store more than 6 items, you have to pay. This is possibly my least favourite form of monetisation. The developers have a great game, and have created inconvenience that you can remove with cash. It thoroughly annoys me, because I'd pay for this game to unlock cosmetics, but I don't want to encourage these atrocious monetisation schemes that revolve around annoying the player into paying. That being said, it could be worse. At least they aren't offering extra lives for money. If any dev reads this, I'd heavily encourage you to rethink your current monetisation.\n\nAs a side note, the game is nigh unplayable with a keyboard. If you do not have a controller, do not bother playing. Even with a controller, the controls can be a little awkward. For example, diagonally aiming downwards is incredibly difficult with an analog stick. It's certainly playable, but it could definitely be improved upon.\n\nOverall, I've really enjoyed this game. It's difficult, but rewarding, with great boss design and fun gameplay. That being said, this does not appeal to everyone. Give it a go, but if you find yourself constantly frustrated, find another game.","May 15","true","12.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just love it. I've had more fun with this game than I could've ever imagined in just the first couple of hours. I thought the "permadeath" would kill the experience for me (no pun intended) but I just can't deny how fun this game is. One of the main things I like about this game is how you will find yourself teaming up with other constantly and easily, and having some other players backing you up is always fun. The shared loot system means that you never have to find over loot drops so there is pretty much no downside to running with a crew. Plus on top of how fun this game is, it's free, so dowload it, you won't regret it.\n\nP.S. As far as I can tell, you make EC (in-game currency) at a pretty reasonable pace so purchasing EC isn't really neccesary, and the gear at the shop isn't any better than what you can find in loot drops so I'm pretty sure there isn't any issues with the games business model.","May 31","true","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Instead of putting all the classes behind level caps they should all be available from the start and have different skill trees that serve as the motivation for leveling.\n- And lastly there needs to be some basic free methods to customize your character so that you can tell which one is yours more easily when things get hectic. A few simple color schemes would be fine.\n\n","May 18","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead, actually read through this review, and take into consideration the things I have to say, as much of what is here could be considered a legitimate reason for viewing a game so negatively. Many issues I will be pointing out here have also been pointed out by not just myself, but others on both sides of the 'aisle'. All I ask is that you allow a guy a moment to offer his opinion.\n\n\nSeeing as I apparently earned the ire of a few people for being 'negative about a perfect game', I'm rewriting this review to give more people insight into why I cannot recommend this game. I even TRIED to enjoy it, TRIED to play it and see the good in it, even after writing this the first time. As you can plainly see: Not much has changed, and I've only come away from it with more to focus on.\n\nFirst of all: I still stand by the feeling that this has the 'potential' to be a great game with some pretty interesting mechanics. However, the mechanics are also what make this such a difficult game for me (and others) to like and enjoy. The gameplay is fun when you're on a roll, when you're blasting through enemy after enemy, finding really good gear to use, and just nailing those difficult jumps and attacks when it really matters. But the progression and combat mechanics can also make all of that work you've put into leveling damn-near useless, no matter how good you get.\n\nWhen you die, you lose everything, including gear and stats. When you enter a new shell, you start back at square 1: bare bones stats, the most basic of weapons, no body or mobility gear, and not one thing to show for the amount of work you put into playing, except for a little pocket change and a tiny handful of experience points. Even then, it's not worth the trouble, as money is currently useless, and your level only dictates which shells you can use.\n\nWhen out on the field, you pick up stat boosts to enhance your shell's abilities, which is all fine and dandy, as a couple extra HP can mean the difference between life and death. As you collect these stats, you will sometimes find that you max out an ability. This means that you've just maxed out one ability needed for the increase of your shell's MK level! Awesome! But, like I said: You die, you lose it all, and you have to do it all again. The only way to keep those stats is to stay alive through the entire dungeon. What doesn't help is that you have to collect MK II upgrades from harder dungeons, which means...You guessed it. You're gonna lose all that work, and lose that shiny MK II rating. It's not fun, it's not an enjoyable feature, and the only players who claim to see this as enjoyable are the 'hardcore' players, or those who believe the risk-reward system is 'perfect'. Not everyone is a masochist.\n\nIf you want to save those stats, plus the gear you managed to scrape up off the ground in a dungeon, you have the choice to purchase the game's premium currency, which can then be used to unlock a shell storage container, allowing you to switch out to another shell when you want to. Buying the currency is the only way to get these handy dandy containers, as, even if you were given the option, you'll almost never be likely to have the cash on-hand to pay for it, seeing as dungeons pay you in literal pocket change.\n\nOh yeah, you can even buy cosmetics with that same premium currency! But, like every other item in the game, it can be rendered useless, not to mention non-existent, the moment you die. In other words, you're wasting your time and money on something that doesn't even help you. People say it only costs you a few cents, but the amount really starts to add up, as you grab those same items and try a dungeon again. And again. And again. And again. It starts to add up very quickly.\n\nYou may be wondering, though: 'Just how easy would it be to die in this game? It all looks easy!'\n\nTrust me. You'll die easily. SO easily, in fact, that you can likely attribute your death to either sluggish framerate, poor terrain generation, enemy placement, or a ridiculous combo of any and all of those things. Or you can attribute it to the often-insane number of players on-screen, which makes jumping and fighting nearly impossible in some situations, and it limits the amount of points you get when you die. Of course, you COULD run a dungeon solo. Wait wherever you spawned in at, give everyone a few minutes to die off or move on, and then you have all of those respawned monsters and a few treasures waiting for you. Just don't expect it to amount to much.\n\nNot only will you be fighting a ton of alien creatures looking to strip away all of those shiny boosts and pieces of gear you've picked up, you'll be fighting the controls as well. If you're using a controller, aiming is VERY clunky, not to mention very frustrating, as it's tied directly to your movement stick (left stick by default, or d-pad). You can only fire left or right, and then diagonally in between those directions. That's it. No shooting straight up or down. There's no precision shooting, and there's little garuntee you'll hit that enemy coming at you at an odd angle, as you have to find that sweet spot to make your shell fire in an upward direction. Controller users also have to wrestle with the VERY unusual right-stick special. Flick your right analog stick up, down, left or right, and you fire off a special skill. It's a pain trying to use that in the middle of a boss battle, especially when you try to quickly go back to your default primary and secondary fire buttons (B and X on Xbox controllers), and more so when you're trying to out-manuever both the boss AND it's minions (wo spawn in so frequently that you'll likely die in a pit of the blasted things).\n\nIf you enjoy platforming games, or maybe just enjoy being put through hell for a handful of XP and credits that will do you very little, sure, this game is fun. But for others, myself included, this game just isn't fun. Fighting controls, fighting framerate issues, fighting BS terrain generation and enemy spawning, fighting the game's mechanics...None of that is fun, nor is it worth spending time trying to adjust to it.\n\nAnd there you have it. My reasons for not enjoying this game, and for not recommending it.","May 13","false","3.1"," 74 of 153 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","74","153","3","12"

I've heard talk that the devs are considering a way to remedy this, but I assume their silly business practices will still be in.\n\nThis game is NOT P2W by any means, but it IS P2C (pay 2 convenience), and to me that's just as bad as pay to win, considering their storage spaces are less than your own inventory, and of course, you have to pay UC to buy additional storage spaces.\n\nI liked playing the game for a bit, but currently? I'm going to stay away from it and play better 2D side scrollers out there.\n\nEDIT: as an added note I find it funny when people try to debate how with the rogue-lite elements it's justifiable that you lose everything upon death, but they conveniently want to ignore how you still keep your EC with you, which is ingame currency, which by their logic, should also be destroyed upon death since you don't have a bank in your home to keep that ingame currency","May 11","false","2.1"," 42 of 89 people (47%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","47","42","89","7","22"

You and of other players spawn at a central hub from which you can then join different missions (levels) increasingly difficult. Also and most importantly...there is permadeath.\nYou can only play one mission as soon as spawned, and you'll have to beat the end level boss before you can pass to other levels.\nStill ok till, and here comes the bad part.\nNow, what happens is that you and another bounch of players (to a max of 50) join the first mission (instanced), and it's a total wreckfest. As long ad you keep up with the group pace you'll annihilate anything in your path without any effort. Not really fun in my opinion. So i decided to slow my pace and find myself more isolated to enjoy the level. And i did...i found myself trying to explore every area, open every loot box, approach monsters with tactic instead of a "50 people wave of death". Pleasant gameplay....till I get to the boss...and i don't stand a single chance, cause the boss is supposed to be killed in group and as good as you can be, your 80hp will not keep you alive for too long.\nYou die. You restart with nothing.\nYou rejoin the first mission and this time you stay in a group, which will rush through all the first mission without even blink once. You will probably also kill the boss and get some decent loot. Then you join the next unlocked mission, and possibly die. Well, prepare to redo everything again from mission 1.\nThe main problem is not permadeath, many games include permadeath in smart engaging ways. The main problem is that to progress in the game you have team up in a boring level rush just to stand a chance against the mission final boss. Remain on your own and you'll be eventually screwed.\nUltimately 1 day after i played the first time, i didn't feel any need to come back for more.... StarBreak is disappointing","May 13","false","1.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Perma death because that always enhances any game. Unlocking classes by dying and take a guess if they are the long to unlock. A pointless cash shop since you lose everything on death.\n\nIts like, how do you take a foolproof concept, "contra online", and ♥♥♥♥ it up?!\nI'm sorry, I tried really hard to like the game but all I kept thinking to myself was 'this is not fun'.\nThe controls are a mess, you can't shoot straight up or straight down and you have enemies that come from straight up and beneath you!\n\nI could go on, I really could but because I obviously hate myself I decided to play the game more. Well try too anyway because Star Break revolves around Zerging. Yes every boss in the game 'can' be beaten solo just like you 'can' start a media empire with a small loan of a million dollars but the sheer time investment required, the instant deaths that many of the late-game stages have, the unresponsive controls, infact lets just say the "everything" leads to a situation where not many people have gotten far in the game and steam achievement listings will back up that fact so let's take a look shall we?\n\n27.6% of players ever clear stage 1.\n2.9% of players have ever beaten stage 2!?\n0.9% of players have ever beaten stage 3!!\n\nYou will try to like it, you really will. You will even subscribe to the "git gud" mentality thinking that when you haven't died after a day that you are good at the game finally. Then you will fall in a bottomless pit or whatever and everything you worked for is gone, just like that.\n\nRogue-likes can be fun. Realm of the Mad God was arguably fun. This game isn't, its wrong in all the worst places and just outright fails to deliver any fun at all!\n\nDownvote this review all you want, the numbers don't like. A lot of players are quitting very quickly after the first stage but I imagine that like this review, most people just look at the first few lines and then give up and hey, that's fine with me. If I had that attitude I would have played stage 1, said the game was 'good' and then moved onto another game. No one is going to thank me for beating 5 stages of this game and in a way, isn't that the perfect allegory to this game?\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","May 14","false","31.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Go into a portal shoot things leave. No quests, no objectives all you do is level up. Each time you die you respawn with nothing. Everything u just got that was amazing u will never get again. The chance of getting a good gun is worse than getting anything decent in Borderlands 2. All the grinding for levels so you can pick a different class and do more nothing. It's unfinished and plays like a gimmicky trash free to play game. Its not pay to win though because there is nothing to win but you can spend money if you are stupid enough.\n\nMostly this game is following dozens of other players in their conquest of murdering everything while you just loot the items they leave behind. Rarely do you get to kill something. You enlist in a free to play hivemind and if you play solo the game is completely garbage and boring because you have to fight all the enemies that camp the only entry points to certain areas and block it with knock down attacks and fight mini bosses with the standard 50 bazillion MMO hp.\n\nThis game sucks. G'night. Uninstalled. Steer clear please. Don't support devs trying to make money off expanding ♥♥♥♥ing storage capacity. No one has the insight to store good items unless u have millions of them of which the game only gives you 8 inventory slots and a measly 6 item stash.","May 13","false","1.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dinozor/recommended/420790/","Dinozor","Dinozor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dinozor/","442 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTotaly negative review!\nBefore and if you read this I wan't to mention that I played a lot of hardcore games like DarkSouls, Mortal Online, Ultima Online, Salem etc. Huge fun of Realm Of The Mad God (donated a lot).\nThis game is not even close like them.\n\nGame is great, fun, addictive, but gamedevs made it SUPER TOTALY BAD because of two things:\n\n1. Controlls, joystic, inputs are bad. Not native, hard to get used to, Can't switch them properly.\n2. Huge amount of useless staff and totaly no way to save, store, checkpoint or somehow mark your progress!!!!!!! (so there is now point of even waisting any cent in this game)\n\nNow more about thouse things:\nAbout controlls:\nThere are "dodge" like skill that is activated by pressing shift (as in many games), but with such difference as it works completely opposite! You need to press shift AND THEN direction key. So on most characters this, on the run, pressing shift, releasing direction key, taping it again.\nTry it now on joystick using thumbstick! If you missclicked - you do it in opposite dirrection or stop. On advanced maps it means just insta death!\nWouldn'y it be simple just tap shift and automatically do "dodge" in dirrection "pressing"? Like all games?\n\nAbout staff, progress and other:\nPlaying game gives you level, stats, money. If you die - you loose everything exept money and get some experience towards your total progress.\nNow "FUN" part: Experience ponts gives you nothing! You just open new characters. You can get all of them in couple of hours. After this thing gives nothing!\nMoney also is useless: game has shop, where you can buy items. All items are ALWAYS bad and you can get most of them in 10-15 minutes (but you can't get same amount of money ther you spent on them).\nAlso there are secret shops: you can get some realy good items but they are not cheap (about week of active playing).\nNow one more "FUN" part: you lose thouse items when you die!!!!! What's the point of buing item whrn you are going to switch it after 10-15 minutes or store it without using to use it "later"?!\nAlso you can't exchange items with other players!\nTo make it more dramatic - game have many staff that insta kills you. And you probably won't know about it until you die!.\nAaaaaand ... game servers (or rooms) sometimes lagg. And teleport back to game takes 10 seconds ... That's in game where 0.5s decides will you leave or not...\n\nSo you will be playing annoying first levels,  getting staff and stats thousands of times. And, probably, will never see other levels.\n\nEasy improvement to the game and actualy the way to make people more interested in donating to the game: MAKE SHOP ITEMS PERMANENT. Sure price sould be greater and items in shop should be limited by level and only regular ones. (also stats).\nThis would improve game, will allow to "mark/save" gameprogress. Storing shop items will require to buy new chests and donate (If I want to have all items for all characters). It would allow to skip first levels and get faster to harder ones keeping progressing into the game.\n\nSo this game has TOTALY NO POINT OF PLAYING for long time. If you are going to play it with friends for hour or so - this game is fun. More - go find another game from devs who care and think how to make game hard, but interesting and challenging for anyone.\nFor now I want my time and money back wasted on this game. If needed - can give more advices how to make this game better.","May 16","false","16.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Mouse input is not enabled so all of the input must be handled via the keyboard if you do not have a controller/gamepad.  The primary reason why keyboard input is designed poorly which significantly affects the gameplay is using the special combo (its called RS in this game).  Using RS is awkward because either you can use a meta key (shift) plus the direction to boost up/down/left/right (with the default shell) or bind your own keyboard shortcut for each RS direction (up/down/left/right).  This boost requires the opposite direction press.  For instance, if you want to boost forward, you need to hit meta + back arrow.  Its not intuitive and makes controlling the default shell unnecessarily difficult.  It would be so much easier if they implemented mouse control where the boost would go in the direction of where the mouse is pointing.\n\nInput handling for the default shell in my opinion is broken or at the very least horribly designed.  The default shell has the artificial limitation of not being able to move and shoot at the same time unless the shell is in the air.  This limitation does not make any sense and I never played a 2d side scroller that had this requirement.  Imagine playing Contra or any 2d side scroller with this limitation.  Its simply not fun.  And anyone saying 'git good' simply hasn't been alive long enough to understand that the mechanics for 2d side scrollers are well established and adding this limitation does not make sense.\n\nI have heard some say that the default shell would be over powered if they allowed running and shooting.  I say, the rest of their game design is broken if they needed to add this limitation in order to balance the shells.  Running and shooting in a 2d side scroller should be a given.  The developer IS NOT doing anything innovative by adding this limitation and I really do not think anyone needs to 'git good' using such an impractical mechanic.\n\nMy advice to the developer is to balance their game within the context of a 2d side scroller.  Allow running and shooting.  Since this game is on Steam, the majority of steam users USE keyboard and mouse input.  Implement mouse aim.  If you do these things, I will change my review as I think the game has potential.\n\nAs for now, I simply cannot recommend this title due to the input handling as I think its overall a frustrating experience.","May 13","false","2.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Apparently, writing a negative review of a game sparks people who like that game to rage at you.\n\nI'm just going to say this, I don't *hate* the game, I think it has potential and maybe, in the future, if they improve the game, I might change this review. Who knows? But as of right now, I can't recommend it.\n\nWhich isn't saying I'm trying to ruin the game or anything - all I'm saying is, *I* personally didn't enjoy it and wouldn't recommend it. *I* don't think that the concepts used in this game work well. If *you* like it, then please, be my guest and play it to your heart's content. I'm by far not trying to raise a campaign to get the game removed from Steam or anything like that, and the positive reviews currently heavily outweight the bad ones, so I don't see why people felt compelled to come whine about my review.\n\nOnce more, I think the game has potential. I just can't recommend it currently - and the keyword is "currently".\n\n********************\n\nGood idea, but poorly executed, unfortunately.\n\nThe game itself is quite fun and simple to play, too. The problem is, you lose your gear when you die. You also get experience when you die, so it's part of the game, but it doesn't help when you need to re-obtain gear.\n\nYou can stash items, but you only have 6 storage slots to store items. You can buy more... But you need to either pay with real money for them or slowly accumulate the currency used to buy those slots.\n\nThere's potential within the game, but I cannot recommend it currently.","May 10","false","1.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","10"

It's absurdly hard to progress with the current permadeath system. The only small, glimmering hope you receive from dying is a marginal amount of XP so that you can eventually buy other 'shells' to die with. Ultimately, the fun of platforming with a dozen other people and seeing your screen light up in a cacophony of neon lasers is outweighed by the fact that whatever effort you're putting into it will amount to nothing when your shell is killed.\n\nThe visuals are great, but the microtransactions seem pretty meaningless. The items you buy with in-game currency and even microtransaction money are *still* lost when you die, along with all your boosts, stats, and sense of purpose as to why you're playing this game.\n\nLastly, I didn't enjoy how the grouping of players would be so variable. If you spawned into a dungeon, you'd spawn with a few other people, no matter how far they were through the dungeon. More often than not, I'd somehow find myself alone on the map within a matter of minutes. Being that even the first dungeon's boss is nigh-impossible to kill by yourself as a MKI or MKII, and that the boss's area seems to lock itself when you enter, you pretty much shoot yourself in the foot if you're not with a group of 5-10 people at all times.\n\nFor the player looking to try this:\n– It's free, so you've got nothing to lose.\n– Stay with the group at all times.\n– Get a weapon with more range than the starting shotgun.\n\nUltimately, StarBreak provides several hours of mindless entertainment, but the excitement quickly drops into cataclysmic nothingness. The visuals are fantastic and the game could run with max settings on a broken toaster. I recommend this game solely because it's free, but I would not recommend pouring any real money into the game, because you will lose whatever you buy.","May 11","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it.\n\nChanging a bit of my review simply because of one reason, literally every single negative review here states that "When you die, you lose everything! This is a bad choice." No it's not, this is a roguelike. This is what happens, it's a design choice, if you don't like it it isn't your kind of game and I respect your opinion.\n\nI also saw a few that say the devs are money hungry because you can spend money to buy extra space to store items? Yeah uh, you can literally do that in most MMO's, this isn't anything new. I'm a complete F2P user and I found that I don't really need anymore space than 6 slots, I don't pick up every single item I see, only the ones that I think I will need. For example, I ALWAYS keep an extra rifle for Wildfire (The first shell in the game) inside of the chest, because the starting shotgun is REALLY bad.\n\nThe only real flaws people are pointing out are ones that are design choices, they aren't flaws at that point, that just means you should play a different game. There are PLENTY of flaws with this game, which I have yet to see pointed out in the review section. For example, there's a limited social aspect to the game, which is really bad, as the game requires you to work with your team to take down bosses. That's a legit criticism and the devs have acknowledged this.\n\nSorry for the little rant, just gonna ignore this review now and go back to playing.","May 14","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is extremely fun, challenging, rewarding, and punishing. Permadeath adds so much to the game. You gain a sense of accomplishment when you gear up a bit, find some implants, some exotic gear, reach mk ii, mk iii, etc. and then die due to an unfortunate chain of events. The game has a bit of a learning curve. It will take a lot of time and a lot of deaths to get proficient at any of the characters. Anyone looking for a challenge, I highly suggest playing this game and trying out the first 2-3 tiers of dungeons.\n\nWith that said, I also want to mention a huge downside to the game, the higher difficulty areas (very high/extreme). When you die, you lose all of your stat boosts and your gear. The game gives you a storage container to store a second/backup set of gear, but your stats reset back to zero. Getting your stats back up can be a time consuming process, and is basically required if you want to go back into the tier 3/4+ dungeons. This is fine for the first 2-3 tiers of dungeons, but later on a single death just sets you back too much (and dying isn't that hard in the game, especially if there are 20-30+ characters on the same screen).\n\nOverally, definitely reccomend trying out the game for those looking for a challenge. Just be prepared to be a bit disappointed with the later portion of the game.","May 23","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's absurdly hard to progress with the current permadeath system. The only small, glimmering hope you receive from dying is a marginal amount of XP so that you can eventually buy other 'shells' to die with. Ultimately, the fun of platforming with a dozen other people and seeing your screen light up in a cacophony of neon lasers is outweighed by the fact that whatever effort you're putting into it will amount to nothing when your shell is killed.\n\nThe visuals are great, but the microtransactions seem pretty meaningless. The items you buy with in-game currency and even microtransaction money are *still* lost when you die, along with all your boosts, stats, and sense of purpose as to why you're playing this game.\n\nLastly, I didn't enjoy how the grouping of players would be so variable. If you spawned into a dungeon, you'd spawn with a few other people, no matter how far they were through the dungeon. More often than not, I'd somehow find myself alone on the map within a matter of minutes. Being that even the first dungeon's boss is nigh-impossible to kill by yourself as a MKI or MKII, and that the boss's area seems to lock itself when you enter, you pretty much shoot yourself in the foot if you're not with a group of 5-10 people at all times.\n\nFor the player looking to try this:\n– It's free, so you've got nothing to lose.\n– Stay with the group at all times.\n– Get a weapon with more range than the starting shotgun.\n\nUltimately, StarBreak provides several hours of mindless entertainment, but the excitement quickly drops into cataclysmic nothingness. The visuals are fantastic and the game could run with max settings on a broken toaster. I recommend this game solely because it's free, but I would not recommend pouring any real money into the game, because you will lose whatever you buy.","May 11","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, although I still give it my full recomendation, there are some flaws that need to be pointed out.\n\nCons:\nYou have to die in order to level-up, or change character class (unless you pay money)\nCosmetics are lost on death (which happens frequently)\nThe graphics, although very pleasant, and expertly made, do lend to an overal clutter on screen, making doging enemy fire niegh on impossible when working in large groups.\nBosses do not scale dependant on how many people are in the fight (i.e. with 20, it will be a breeze, on your own, you have a shot in dark at best.\nThe devs are cheating themselve when it comes to f2p. The game is great, however, the in-game currency is practically useless. There are some feautres, such as places to store your current character, or additional cross-death storage, but there are only so many of those. Cosmetics... Let's just say that I am certain the sales numbers are very steeply in the red on that one. UC (the name of the ingame currency), is more like a dev support token than it is a currency to be bought for pleasure.\nPros:\nThe gear system adds enough diversity to play to make you contemplate lowering your dps, just to have a better playstyle.\nArt and sound design are fantastic. The music is almost never going to bore you.\nThe pace of gameplay allows a team to take the missions at either a leisurely pace, or at breakneck speed, depending on your familiarity with the game.\nYou are almost always going to have other people with you.\nThe community, for the most part, is fairly non-toxic\nUnlike many f2p games, it is not trying to shake money out of you (though this is to such an extent, it's also a con)\nThere is a proper balance between life and death, where you can either try desperately to keep one solid character running, or to go head first, and just grind some levels.\nthe gameplay is addaptive to whatever style of action-platforming you like. Melee, lasers, blocking shot's for your friends, ect.\nI am sure you guys can list some more positives for this game. And I am sure there are some other glaring issues I forgot.

Every encounter and enemy in the game scales on the number of people who are with you, so if you are alone encounters are not as strong, but if you're in a big group then you basically need each other.  It's not an unusual thing, of course, Phantasy Star Online used such a design to make grouping more rewarding but more difficult as well, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhen the player dies, they lose everything they have equipped and are carrying, with no way to recover those items.  To change character you also need to become a spark, which requires either EC (in-game currency), or to die.  It's very easy to die, and you're basically expected to repeat the first dungeon over and over and over and over until you're either sufficiently leveled up to play as the character you actually want to play; or you basically outlevel the current content you're doing.\n\nThe game is a grindfest.  As you play you will find minibosses, midbosses and bosses as well as enemies.  Only midbosses and bosses are GUARANTEED to drop loot, but you'll definitely get plenty of chests along the way.  As a diversion, I would say that the game is definitely a pretty good time sink, you'll keep playing, getting better little by little but also dying a lot.\n\nNow for the negative, the in-game currency is tied to every type of purchase in the game, and there's two ways to acquire currency.  Either you keep playing through dungeons -OR- you pay real money.  Currency is NOT plentiful in dungeons, so I could see a lot of people opting for the microtransaction method of getting money, which I don't personally feel is worth the money but that's your choice not mine.\n\nI'd give it a 7.5 out of 11, it can be a good time sink, but it sure can get old quick too.","May 29","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As of my video and this review, I have about 3 hours put into the game. The main mechanic of this game comes from the fact that there is permadeath for your suit. Once you die, all progress is loss and you will have to start anew.\n\nThis game is the starchild between Megaman and Realm of the Mad God. The Megaman aspect comes from the action platforming, how items are obtained, and the boss battles (which are fairly well designed but far more bullet spongy than the trash mobs would make you think). Everything else is influenced from the Realm of the Mad God. Players start in a lobby with everyone else on the server chosen. They have the ability to enter named instances with up to 39 other players. These instances are unique planets or worlds that having varying tiers of difficulties and rewards to match the difficulty of the instances. Loot is personal, so you don't have to worry about the other 39 players stealing your +1 bullet weapon.\n\nThe developers, Crunchy Games, included a premium currency, obtained by paying real money. As of this review, you can purchase cosmetic hats, that are lost upon death, or quality of life upgrades that include more storage space.\n\nIf you love Realm of the Mad God and miss the days of classic Megaman, this game is for you. In spite of myself owning Overwatch, XCOM, FFXIV, etc... I've continued to find myself drawn back to the game to slaughter my enemies. I fully recommend trying out the game as I enjoyed my time with it.\n\nYoutube impression: https://youtu.be/8ZxKCcSTjrw","May 28","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starbreak has some great sidescrolling shooter/rpg elements, but like all perma death games it leads you to rage quitting, a lot. The XP system is more your typical F2P progression system where levels are used to 'unlock' access to different playable characters, all of which have their own unique purpose and playstyle. Like most perma death games you can pick up random drops which upgrade your stats minorly like a stat point, until death. You can also loot gear to improve your character, the combination of the two (Stats+Gear) More or less equals your "level". That is levels seem to be classified into 5 difficulties, Easy, medium, hard, very hard and extreme. While there are different playable levels of the same difficulty, all difficulties drop the same tier stat upgrades and gear. However, each playable level has a different boss, each boss has their own achievement for beating them.\nThe Perma death structure isn't so bad, yeah it causes rage quitting because you lose stuff that was hard to find, the issue I have is with that Starbreak is ALSO F2P. You see Starbreak has 2 different currencies, your basic and your paid premium. First off as far as my experience goes, money has no functional affect on gameplay, all monetarily obtainable items are cosmetic or storage based. The basic "EC" is something you get through due course of the game, but the premium "UC" is only purchasable, so when you die you lose the item and the money forever. Seems pretty hanky to me.\nOverall Starbreak is a shallow but enjoyable side scrolling shooter with rpg elements. Well executed but with Perma death the games base mechanic it can't offer very deep gameplay because of the failure penalty. In combination with paid for content though that also gets deleted when you die I give it a 'meh'. Perma death is rather annoying anyway, it forces shallow investment mechanics into a game because no one wants to spend weeks working on a character just to get it deleted anyway, so perma death games have to offer a rapid and simple 'leveling' system of some sort to compensate. This makes it a great game though for a short gaming session just to kill some time. No story. No complicated controls or mechanics to learn. Just a straight old school arcade style side scolling shooter. 6/10","June 2","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starbreak has some great sidescrolling shooter/rpg elements, but like all perma death games it leads you to rage quitting, a lot. The XP system is more your typical F2P progression system where levels are used to 'unlock' access to different playable characters, all of which have their own unique purpose and playstyle.
