No weapon skins, no perks, no kill streaks. Those things don't make a game great in the slightest.\n\nStarting with the Campaign. To this day I still go back and revisit the campaign at least once a year, the campaign is action packed, tells a fantastic story of some of the battles during World War 2, although the graphics, animation and physics do not compare to the newer versions of Call of Duty or new games in general, playing through the Campaign never fails to entertain me.\n\n\nCall of Duty United Offensive has bought me probably the best multiplayer I have ever played, again it's dated compared to games nowadays but you can't get more fun than going through Foy in a jeep or tank with your friends or even going it alone will bring endless hours of fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the Multiplayer is not as active as it used to be, however there are still plenty of servers running stock maps and generic settings.\n\nMods are another thing that make United Offensive such a great game. There are so many different maps (Both serious and silly) the game will never go stale and unlike modern versions of the Franchise which release yearly and provide no modification tools to the community, effectively making the game stale after a year.\n\nIs the game worth getting? Yes\nIs it worth $24? Yes and No. A 10 year old game should be cheaper.\n\nIf this game is ever on sale, I recommend this game for hours of something new and fresh.","August 22, 2014","true","14.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","40","43","3","0"

Expansion? Impossible! Oh but it is and it was the only expansion ever made to date. Developed by Grey Matter Studios, Call of Duty United Offensive is an expansion to the original Call of Duty. It contains a new campaign split up into three smaller campaigns where you fight as a British, American and Russian soldier during battles spanning across World War II.\n\nAs an expansion it's pretty good. You got new locations and battles to fight in, some new weapons, and some tweaked gameplay. I forgot to mention how in the original Call of Duty the MG42 was quite hard to shoot at because the muzzle flash blocked out nearly the entire screen however they tweaked it making it much more useful to use in United Offensive. The best levels tended to be the starting and/or second levels of each smaller campaign. The American, British and Russian campaigns had really good starting levels however the last levels of the American and Russian campaign were quite annoying as you had to defend a specific location until help arrives and it was annoying getting shot at all sides.\n\nI can't really say much more. It's more Call of Duty and has a decent campaign, sadly I still couldn't find a game in the multiplayer which was kind of dissapointing. If you're going to play the original Call of Duty then most likely you should pick this up as well in one of the bundles when it goes on sale. It's worth a look if you're looking to play more classic Call of Duty and it should keep you fairly entertained. I give this game a 7/10.","August 9, 2015","true","7.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/2640/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","NOTE: United Offensive REQUIRES/NEEDS the original game to be installed to function.\nUnited Offensive takes almost everything great from the original Call of Duty and builds upon it. New larger maps, a campaign as long as a standalone Call of Duty are on offer up-front. Behind these large offerings are smaller but notable additions, such as driveable vehicles and new weapons for each force in the game.\n\nThe campaign is slightly shorter than the base games by about 3 missions. The campaign itself is still about as long as, possibly longer than what is offered in Advanced Warfare, a definitely longer than Modern Warfare 2 and 3's single player. The American missions take you across France in large battles for control of towns, fields and ridges in the besieged countryside. The British missions start you in a RAF bombing raid as a plane gunner before switching to covert missions for the SAS. The Russian missions follow a small unit as they fight their way to Kharkov to liberate it from Nazi invaders. The campaign features the usual Call of Duty missions where you do slightly different things from the usual infantry boot work, such as drive-by turret sections, the RAF section and the Soviet tank mission which is similar to the tank mission in the originals Soviet campaign. Overall, the campaign is well made, the variety of missions under such a tight gameplay build is something that this and the original have that the modern games lacks.\n\nThis helps the gameplay factors. The lack of regenerating health means that you never feel like a super-soldier. You will probably want squad members to take point to avoid getting your face shot off by an unexpected MG42 gunner. The levels are built for PC players and the maps are built for vehicle traversing as well as on-foot movement, so a scale not present in later instalments is clear.\n\nVisually, the game has aged. Animation looks hilarious sometimes, the faces look really bad. The environments look a little middy, but are large and grand. On higher settings (which I think a toaster can do now), the environments are more than passable. Forcing Anisotropic Filtering cleans up a lot of the problems with the games textures. Although the game is not beautiful, it is passable and the visuals never interfere with the game itself.\n\nAudio-wise, just like the original, the soundtrack is brilliant and memorable, with the OST being pretty much identical to the original. The gun sound effects are decent, again being re-used from the original. The voice acting is hilarious sometimes, with the fake Russian accents being the most memorable. The German voice work is brilliant as well, with a few shouty lines being spammed across the whole campaign (This is re-used from the original). As with all the main instalments, the amount of chatter on the fields, screaming from soldiers to move and take covers enough to keep the player in the game.\n\nMultiplayer-wise, if you can get on, people still play it. The maps are well-done. The use of mounted guns and vehicles means that the game is played differently from later games in the series. The maps are much larger than what is offered in later games, changing how multiplayer is played as they are far more open due to the different methods of play. There are some problems with weapon balancing however which is present in both this and the original game.\n\nMy only actual complaint would be within the campaign. Sometimes some objectives don't trigger themselves properly (well, it happened twice to me) and although the campaign is solid across the board, the Russian campaign could not quite beat the atmosphere shown in the original Call of Duty game during the Battle for Stalingrad, which is my personal highlight for the series. Despite this, the expansion pack goes above what many other games in the series attempt and is in my opinion, the best of the series. Any fan of the genre should definitely get it and any fan of the new ones should get this to see how Call of Duty should be done.","February 13, 2015","true","6.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","0"

This is the definitive Call of Duty game. Great story, fun multiplayer, it's all in there, and better than the modern bullcrap that Activision is pulling out of their proverbial butt nowadays. Here's an overview.\n\nThe Campaign\n\nThe story in United Offensive is based on the happenings of actual battles of WWII. Throughout the campaign (which includes 15 missions), you'll play as Amercians, Russians, and the British. Instead of today's ridiculous "get behind cover to magically recover health", you'll be dealing with a health bar that can only be replentished with health packs. Instead of a one-man army, you have somewhat competent ai allies who can actually take down enemies (unlike another game I know...). There are one or two missions where you are on your own, but even then you aren't alone for long.\nThe multiplayer is fun, but sadly mostly dead nowadays. There is a greater variety of maps than there are in the new CoD games, some of which are large and have vehicles (Yes, I said VEHICLES, like, TANKS) and some of which are small and made for close-quarters. Guns have recoil, and the guns with the best range are single-shot bolt-action rifles. It takes more skill to be good in UO than it does in any game after it.\nSidenote: YOU CAN LEAN AROUND CORNERS. The same mechanic ironically was one of the key points of CoD: Ghosts E3 presentation last year. All they did was re-add a feature that had been stripped out.\n\nOther Stuffs\n\nHere comes everyone's biggest gripe: the graphics. I personally don't care how the graphics look, and I will say that even then they look better then certain "AAA" games nowadays. There are little to no physics, just death animations when you kill enemies. The voice acting is superb. The sound can also be commended for the time the game was released.\n\nClosing\n\nCoD: UO is worth buying. I would wait for a sale though. I think the battle chest which includes UO along with CoD and CoD 2 goes half off once in a while. Even if you are pleb, this game is worth playing as a reminder than CoD was not always a pleb game, and may in fact help cure your plebness.","June 11, 2014","true","30.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

There are alot more vehicle based levels in this campaign which I personally enjoyed more. They removed most of the nitpicks I had with the campaign such as having too much padding with the "defend this base for 5 minutes as well as adding a sprint feature.  The only major issue I have with this game is the checkpoints are terrible. Luckily you can save the save the game at any point creating a new checkpoint manually but this gets very tedious later on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivory_soul/recommended/2640/","ivory_soul","Ivory_Soul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivory_soul/","316 products in account","The Good: Amazing cinematic atmosphere, holds of graphically even today, immersive sound effects, realistic feeling gun play\n\nThe Bad: Visually look pretty dated in spots, no one playing online, a tad short\n\nAnother World War II game, but wait this came out 7 years ago during the subgenre’s peak. Why should I play this? It’s just another Call of Duty. Before you go making drastic decisions Call of Duty started out as a WWII series way before the Modern Warfare explosion. Call of Duty was known for great cinematic atmosphere, tight gun play, and excellent story telling. United Offensive is the expansion to the award-winning debut game in the series. Offensive is just superb and even hold up on all levels today.\n\nThe game has three campaigns that run between America, England, and Russia. You play as three different faceless soldiers, but the environment is the main character here. Each campaign has an amazing opening scene as well as some memorable moments like the escape on a Jeep in the American campaign, the gripping plane scene in the England campaign, and the tank scenes in the Russian campaign. There is never a dull moment in Offensive and everything from sound, great voice acting, and realistic sounding war effects bring together a riveting experience that I truly have not found in any other WWII game (even in later CoD games).\n\nInstead of trying to pack every scenario into one game (including weapons) we get some long battles that feel challenging, but not terribly hard. Some scenes can last up to 20 minutes (like the plane scene in the British campaign), but it holds you out just enough to make you feel the terror of war and a little helpless. Some battles require waiting a certain amount of time before reinforcements arrive and then a wonderful orchestral soundtrack picks up and makes it that much more intense.\n\nThe gun play is solid and feels great with favorite weapons like the MP40, M1 Garand, MP44, and the Springfield sniper rifle. We’ve used the weapons dozens of times but each weapon feels different which includes power, accuracy, and mechanics of the gun. I feel the grenades still have no weight, but there are a variety of them. Each level and scenario feels different and gripping, but you never get attached to any characters because the environment is the main attraction.\n\nMutliplayer would keep you coming back, but due to the age there is no one playing online ever so you have to stick to LAN. War games just aren’t like they used to be, and United Offensive shows how to put across the feeling of war as well as realistic feeling weapons. United Offensive stands up graphically as well thanks to tiny details. The only thing dated are the low poly models, low resolution textures up close, and some static lighting. Most of the time you won’t notice because you’re sucked into the experience too much. If a game from 2004 can suck you in after playing modern war games then that really shows how much a games stands up.\n\n--Score: 8.5/10","June 28, 2012","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you played COD1 you know what to expect gameplay wise, but UO stands out with its missions and level design.  Just does a good job of mixing things up. My favorite part is probably the British campaign. If you like the COD franchise or WWII shooters in general, I would recomend UO.

I never played this expansion back in the day, and I do regret it. Once again, the WWII scene, however, I found this a bit more fun than the first Call of Duty, the reason for that being that there are some missions which make you feel like you're in the war. Navy, Army, Air Force - although you don't actually drive the boats, or fly the planes - but you do get to play the vehicle guns. Nice addition of the flamethrower, picked it up and torched some enemies. The final mission for the Soviets is really really hard. I died about 20 times (played on 2nd hardest difficulty), even rage quit, but eventually I got through it. You have Stukas bombing you from the air, tanks rolling in, light armoured APCs, machine gunners all at the train station ready to gun you down, Nazis on the rooftops, list keeps going. That mission was what I meant about feeling like you're in the war kind of feeling. However as you do play on a harder difficulty and you have to get through the final level, you want to save your life, not caring about your peers which is a shame! :P\n\nI like this game, but I think the pricing is pretty harsh still. Aus Multiplayer has 1 server, but it looks pretty dead.\n\nSo yeah:\nCOD 1 +\n- Flamethrowers\n- Guns on boats, aircraft\n- Binocs in one mission for artillery calling\n- More war kind of feel\n- Blow up stuff like a train coming on the bridge\n\nMinus points for price IMO as the story roughly takes 6 hours.\n\ntl;dr: Good game for Single Player WWII, however for the duration of the game and at this price point may only make this game suitable to buy in a deal.","May 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/recommended/2640/","Nick930930","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nick930930/","256 products in account","United Offensive is a major expansion pack for the original Call of Duty game. It improves on a few of the issues from the original game and features some incredibly epic missions. The game's campaign is structered similarly to the original game with 3 seperate military campaigns starting with a largescale American battle in Bastogne (Battle of the Bulge), easing into a slow and painfully boring British campaign in Italy, and ending with an epic battle with the Russians at Kursk.\n\nOnce again, Call of Duty's american missions are based strongly on the events of the 101st airbourne as seen in "Band of Brothers." You are tasked with fighting off a larger Nazi platoon in the wintery forests of bastogne as you wait for Pattons tank unit to relieve you and there's plenty of artillery, tanks, and firefights. You then have to attack a village crawling with nazi soldiers by moving up with your squad from the forest to some haystacks just like in the show. These missions are some of the best missions that this game have to offer and they're a lot of fun. Unfortunetly, once again, you are stuck as a British soldier doing boring "stealth" based missions that require infilitrating enemy strongholds and destroying artillery guns or getting into incredibly frustrating on rails car chases. And then finally, the game picks up the pace again with another largescale Russian battle sequence, this time taking place at Kursk. This time, instead of landing on beaches with several other soldiers, you are all packed into large trucks and are crossing open fields while planes fly by and blow up your allies nearby. You are then tasked with reinforcing the trenchlines and repelling a major german offensive. The campaign starts to lose its pace after this though, as you start fighting through the streets to eventually hold off a German attack on a railyard that is impossibly difficult. There are snipers, tanks, halftracks, MG42s, infantry, and worst of all... player seeking airplane bombing runs. That's right... during your defense of this entirely open railyard, you are forced to relocate from cover while being shot by all the above because the bombing runs that come ever 30 seconds will always aim for you. It's an incredibly frustrating mechanic that really ruined the finale of the game. But other than that, the gameplay was solid and a significant improvement over the original game.\n\nThe graphics were improved also. The textures and models look essentially the same, but the smoke effects that would later become a staple of the series are finally introduced in this expansion and still to this day look fantastic, especially after a massive allied bombing run or after blowing up a tank with a bazooka. The lighting also appears to have received a boost, with interior fires casting a bit of an orange glow on the walls that I'm pretty sure didn't happen in the original game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics also recieved some attention. A sprint button was introduced, but unfortunetly the sprint is incredibly short, allowing you to only sprint about halfway from one position to another before you have to start walking again. The health system is still incredibly stupid and enemies still home in on you as soon as you try and fight back. Some new weapons were added in that are given plenty of time to shine like the silenced sten submachine gun or the bipod mounted MG42 that you can walk around with. However, the latter came be annoying because it takes forever to deploy the bipod, and you have to keep the right mouse button held down in order to keep it deployed, or it will reset the animation, which can really ruin its effectiveness considering you generally need it when mowing down a large concentration of soldiers crossing a field towards you.\n\nAnother thing I feel I should mention is that the sound design is fantastic. Bullets will wizz and snap past you if they're close by and you can hear all the dirt and snow spitting up in your face after a tank fires nearby. Rain sounds accurate and realistic which is generally not even done correctly in games that come out today in 2015. So cudos to Infinity Ward for nailing the sound design way back in the early 2000s.\n\nSo overall, I recommend this game as it continues the 101st airborne campaign into the Battle of Bastogne and also features another cool russian campaign. However, just be aware that the graphics are severely outdated, the gameplay has plenty of issues, and the British campaign is painfully dull.","July 19, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2640/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Call of Duty United Offensive is an expansion pack for the first Call of Duty. Once again we will take on the role of three different soldiers from the USA, UK and Russia respectively. We start things off as the Americans in a snow covered Belgium. The snow doesn't make any difference to the gameplay but it is something that wasn't in the base game so it does give United Offensive it's own style. You will quickly find out that this dlc has much more fierce and unpredictable battles. It will keep you on your toes and raises the difficulty quite high right from the beginning. UO introduces a couple of new guns like silenced machine guns and flamethrowers for your nazi killing pleasure. They are uncommon unfortunately, I would have loved for more time to use the flamethrower.\n\nLike the original you are nearly always accompanied by fellow soldiers and this time around they are a lot more useful. They can hold their own and are way more likely to actually kill the people shooting at them. It may be do to AI improvements or the fact that you will be spending a lot of your time in this dlc fighting close quarters. UO has much more fighting in villages and condensed spaces so carrying a weapon suited for that is a must. Unfortunately some levels spawn way too enemies out of the same locations which makes shooting them kind of tedious as another nazi will sprout out of thin air to take their place until it is time to move on. It also features far more moments were you must defend a location for a given amount of time which almost starts to feel like it's there to pad out the dlc.\n\nIt took me 6 hours to beat the dlc which is quite close to the what it took me to get through the base game.  No longer are the three Allies campaigns intertwined together instead you play through the whole American campaign then switch to the British when it is done. I much prefer it this way as it helps you keep track of the characters and makes the journey much more consistent than randomly teleporting your view to different events like in the base game. In the British campaign you will be riding in both a boat and a warplane. The plane section is pretty cool as it has you running in the interior to pilot different turrets and fix issues but it goes on too long and both vehicle sections just play out with you endlessly shooting from a turret.\n\nRussian campaign does allow you to pilot a tank which was a fun distraction. It also lets you call in artillery strikes via binoculars at one point but you have to look at a very specific point and it comes off as nothing more than a gimmick. Fortunately the main bulk of the levels are very good and have been designed as to challenge returning players from the base game. Whether this difficulty is a good thing is up for debate but from my experience it kept it from feeling like this dlc is just more of the same even though it pretty much is. I don't believe it has any new additions to the soundtrack either which is disappointing as the composer is amazing.\n\nOverall United Offensive tries new things but it is very much more of the same. If they would have toned down the padding thrown in to make the dlc seem longer I would say these campaigns surpass the ones found in the original. The multiplayer seems to have very few people left and some servers have bots to fill up the lobby. It is completely separate from the base game so the already small amount of people still playing CoD1 and UO have been split. You will need Call of Duty 1 to play United Offensive, this is not a stand-alone expansion pack. In the end of the day this is still a lengthy and exciting expansion pack that knows what made the original so good and made it better. Recommended to those that have completed the original and would like to take the fight to previously unseen countries like Italy and Belgium.\n","May 25, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","2"

So I get back in and keep shooting guys and then finally, GUESS WHAT?!  The same guy escorts you to the next nest you gotta cover, but this time you have to pickup this sniper and *KILLED.*  I died while I was trying to figure out what I was supposed to do.  So I pressed the restart button, respawned me back at the bipod place.  *QUIT*  The main games is awesome, but they went from it being a lot more tame, "This is your objective, whichever way possible"\n\nIn here however, it's DO IT OUR WAY OR YOU DIE, and it's so unclear and so annoying and it doesn't work.

The biggest problem COD:UO has is the fact that this game is the one that experiences the most growing pains in the series. This is reflected in the first few missions in the American campaign where the player has to suffer through respawning enemies, limited health, limited ammo, and ridiculous objectives that force the player to do everything. If there is a tank, YOU must be the one to find a rocket launcher to destroy it. If there is an enemy bunker, YOU must be the one to charge in to conquer it. The list goes on and on. On a video game standpoint, this is perfectly fine, in fact, Wolfenstein uses this type of gameplay to enforce a good power fantasy. United Offensive goes too far however, to the point that teammates are rendered useless and the idea that the battle was won by a team effort absurd.\n\nThese following statements are going to be a bit controversial but please keep reading. The combination of respawning enemies and suicidal objectives may not have been so bad if your health was not limited or if you had a way to suppress enemies into cover. Call of Duty 2 has regenerative health for the player and smoke grenades that cloak your advancement on the battlefield. These solutions may be a bit overkill but they do a great job of keeping the action moving forward instead of the previous games where a stray bullet would make you have to backtrack through the level to find a medpack. The whole issue about health would not have been mentioned if it wasn't for the fact that COD:UO makes you do everything in a battle, to the point when you wonder if you are actually a Navy Seal disguised as a Private.\n\nThe game does have a quick save feature, which you may have to use quite a bit because the game has very inconsistent checkpoints. There will be times when you have already completed several objectives before getting a checkpoint. At the very worst, you may even get checkpointed while getting shot or having grenade land near by you (and no, you cannot throw back grenades). I do understand that quick saving has its purpose in PC games, especially RPGs, however, action games benefit more from carefully placed checkpoints rather than quick saves. If the developer is smart enough, they can place checkpoints in safe areas or segments past cutscenes that help with the flow of the action.  United Offensive assumes you are going to be using quick save frequently and the game definitely seems to be crafted that way. The first Call of Duty does not seem to suffer from this problem too much, at the very least not on Normal mode. COD1 was crafted in a way that it can even be playable on a console, where you can't quick save at all.\n\nNot everything was bad in Call of Duty: United Offensive. The music was great, sound effects were great, and the British and Russian campaigns were interesting (You even take part in a bombing raid with the British Airforce in one mission). There are even light machine guns with deployable bipods you can use to defend areas (which become useless once you find out that you can't deploy them on sandbags aside from the mission sensitive ones). If you are lucky, you may even come across a flamethrower you can use for a few seconds in the early Russian missions. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend COD:UO because COD1 and COD2 exist. I get the impression that United Offensive got the praise it did because there really was nothing like it at the time but now that there is, the problems I mentioned earlier do not stand the test of time. Unless you are a completionist, you should avoid Call of Duty: United Offensive.","June 23, 2015","false","6.6"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","0"

If you were several seconds late behind your captain in the first part of a mission, forget being able to rescue him when he is downed in the second part of the mission - the game assumes you were right behind him the entire time, forcing you to replay 10-15 minute sections to ensure you are in the proper position to continue with the level.\n\nThe objective marker has also seemingly been programmed by 45 different people that have never talked, emailed, or followed any project guidelines. The marker will sometimes point to where you need to go, where you need to run away from, where the weapons are to blow up the tank, where the tank is but not where the weapon is that you need to blow up the tank, etc.\n\nOverall, this might actually be the worst Call of Duty campaign.

It features new single-player missions and also some new multiplayer features, though I have only played the single-player part of the game. Let's talk about that.\n\nI found it bad. The level design is plain terrible, the placement of event triggers often sucks and pretty much everything is scripted, while the scripts are very likely to get bugged and kill your progress through the mission. And I mean that, because the save triggers are also placed so badly that it hurts - I found myself back at the beginning many times just because I hadn't walked through the exact spot it wanted me to.\n\nMaybe it would have been a good movie as the action and variation throughout the campaign is cool, but as a game it just doesn't work. I think the base game was better, as this wasn't fun and only gave me headaches and frustration.","January 8, 2015","false","5.9"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","6","28","4","5"
