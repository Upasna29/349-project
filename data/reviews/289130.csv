Beautiful, intriguing world.  Not generic fantasy.  Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game.  Even descriptions of the odd map "anomalies" are interesting.\n2.  Emphasis on effective empire management (vs. constant warfare, as in AOW, Warlock, etc.).  City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are immensely satisfying.\n3.  Combat is done nicely and wars aren't a slog.  Tactial battles can be fun to play out, or you can auto-resolve without worrying too much.  Unit upgrading is fun but not too time-consuming.\n4.  Different races that actually play quite differently.  Choose the Vaulters to race for a scientific victory, or the Necrophage to dominant your foes.\n4.  Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre.  For example:  race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc.\n\nCons:\n1.  Still crashes periodically, esp. after I've been playing for a while.\n2.  A.I. is deficient.  This is the game's greatest threat to long-term success. But it is possibly improving with each patch, and I wonder how the modding community's efforts will help.\n3.  Some of the more nuanced aspects of the game are not obvious and require digging for info on forums, etc.\n\nSummary:\nI love turn-based strategy games, and I love this game.   Absolutely gorgeous and relaxing to play.  Nothing better than coming home from a long day at work and watching toddler, locking myself in my office, and playing Endless Legend till 1AM.  Plays quicker and smoother than Civ V.  Yes, the AI needs improvement, but that's every strategy game since the beginning of time.  If the developers support it like they did Endless Space, I think this is going to stay installed on my HD for a long time.","October 20, 2014","true","98.9"," 569 of 585 people (97%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","97","569","585","15","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leracos/recommended/289130/","leracos","Hrist Valkyrie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leracos/","191 products in account",""...an excellent game in a sea of mediocrity..."\n\nAre you looking for a Civ-a-like to play? Don't buy this. Go buy GalCiv 3 instead. Are you looking for a fresh, new look at 4X entirely? You just found it. Before I get into my personal thoughts [the review, essentially] I want to explain why I say this and why I feel how I do about my review, found further below the following four paragraphs.\n\nTo say Endless Legend is like Civ just because its a 4X game is like saying a cheesecake is a cake simply because it has the word 'cake' in it, or a pie because its formed like one. Endless Legend may be labeled as a 4X, but neither does it fit into the traditional mold of a 4X nor does it conform to those of its predecessors, the most notable being Civ.\n\nOne of the key principal differences, for instance, is that the land is divided into regions. In each region, there may only be one city. That's it. Choose wisely where you place it; finding out later on there are better resources to be had from founding elsewhere will hurt you in the long run. This is particularly notable just starting out. Rush placement for the early settlement lead, or explore a bit for a chance at longer term returns on prosperity in your capital?\n\nAnother key notable feature that I like is that each of the major factions not only has a different play style, but has their own major quest as well. Completion of said quest before the final turn results in an automatic win for that faction. [AI opponents do not pursue quests, major or minor] Is it easy? NO. Do you get rewards along the way? Certainly. Are the rewards worthwhile? Most definitely.\n\nOne of the final overhauls I want to mention is the combat system. Rather than Civ's straight out 'this is my unit strength, this is yours, let's do this' system, your units are grouped [as you see fit] into armies. When you engage another army, a small battle map opens and each unit is controlled manually by you, via a directive of three basic commands; attack, defend, hold. Pretty self explanatory. On top of that, there are faction specific and unit based abilities you can use in battle which greatly diversify the depth of combat, instead of just 'surround city with siege units, bombard, invade with one unit when done' as in Civ.\n\nReview:\nA/V:  First off this game is gorgeous. I don't generally place stock on judging a game based on graphics, but it *really* adds to the atmosphere here. The level of detail is incredible. To supplement that, the ambient sound effects and music are just as amazing and deserve an equal amount of praise. The graphics get a small demarkation for having to re-draw everytime you tab out of the fullscreen interface, however. I am hoping this is addressed, but if not its not a major detractor.\n\nMechanics: As stated above, this game is a fresh look at a genre that, in my opinion, deperately needed new life. Endless Legend is that life, I feel. This game has introduced things in a way no one would likely have ever thought, and the best part is that the community continues to remain a large part of the process the entire way. If you do purchase this [or are on the fence] head over to the Amplitude forums and check out what we have all accomplished. Several dozen features and additions to this and their other two games have been ones suggested by or designed almost completely by the community. I digress, though. All of these mechanics may sound like a steep learning curve, and the first game through it is. After that one game, however, it flows much more logically and you'll likely end up asking yourself how such an amalgalm of crazy ideas never happened before this.\n\nMiscallenous: There are still some bugs and flaws being ironed out, but Amplitude is very studious and responsive about addressing these issues promptly and responding to user feedback on how to resolve these problems until patches are released. There's even a feature in the game to create your own faction with your own selectable traits, including a couple that aren't assigned to a preset faction by default. Amplitude wants this game to be something for *you*, so if none of what I've written grabs you by all means don't feel pressured. If, however, you feel like Civ used to be enjoyable but has seen its days and you need something new, or if you just love fantasy and deep lore based worlds; this is your game.\n\nOverall: I'm not a fan of numbered/aggregate ratings, so I'll just close with this; if you're on the fence after having read what I wrote, buy it. It will not disappoint. Its an excellent game in a sea of mediocrity that more than deserves a chance to shine.","June 14, 2015","true","49.2"," 719 of 759 people (95%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","95","719","759","30","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006331530/recommended/289130/","76561198006331530","판차수","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006331530/","148 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is less of a review and more of a preview of what you can expect from this game. I know that steam says I barely played EL - that's because I've been playtesting this game for several months before release. As such, I'm also inherently biased so take that into account.\n\nWhy should you buy this game? The short answer is - if you have any doubts, don't buy it. Wait for the full release and then do your research and see if it's the kind of game that you will enjoy :)\nPersonally though, I think that EL stands strong among other 4X games. It feels fresh and unique in many areas where 4X were starting to get stale. There's a lot to talk about so I'll just go over some of the bigger features:\n\nFirstly, the city management aspect. Like in most 4Xs once you make a city you can grow it, make improvements, train troops, gather food, industry, science, dust/gold and influence (FIDSI in short). But population works differently - you assign your workers (you population) to specific areas like food generation or influence generation. The amount of population working on that is multiplied by various bonuses (but it's at least *3) and then other various other bonuses are also added to the amount of FIDSI you can generate. This gives you a lot of control over what your city does (more so then in civ where you're much more dependent on the tiles around your city).\n\nSecondly, empire management. Every 20 turns you (and all other players) choose your "empire plan" which will define how you play for the next 20 turns. You need influence to invest into your empire plan - the more influence you invest, the better. You also have more options in empire plan as you enter new eras.\nAnother use for influence is in diplomacy - all diplomatic actions (closing borders, declaring war,  etc) require some influence. You can also spend influence to improve your influence with AIs. Right now however, this aspect of the game only has basic functionality because there's no multi (yet) and the AI is fairly dumb (for now).\nAdditionally, the tech is non-linear, meaning that you have free control over which tech you want to go for next. There are no prerequisites to anything. However, you have to choose what you research wisely as technology gets progressively more expensive. The only limitation are the eras. Basically, in order to unlock tech from next era, you need at least 10 tech from previous era.\n\nThirdly, army management. There are 5 main unit types in the game: infantry, ranged units, support units, cavalry and flying units. Each faction has access to 3 unit templates (+the settlers) which you can then customize to decent extend. For example, you can equip your infantry with weapons that will help you fight cavalry - which normally is a good counter to infantry.\nBecause each race can only use 3 basic templates (in as many versions as they want of course, I'm just talking about the infantry/support/etc kind of templates), you also have to rely on assimilating minor factions into your empire. Minor factions will grant you an empire bonus and give access to their unique unit templates. This allows you to make up for the fact that you don't natively have access to certain unit type. For example, the Wild Walkers faction has no access to flyers so they can assimilate Khazanji minor faction to gain access to Demons - a new flying unit template. There are of course limitations to how many races you can assimilate.\n\nFourthly, the battles. They're quite unique since they're played on world map (like in civ) but are little skirmishes by themselves (like in AoW3 but you have less control). Each battle starts with a deployment phase and planning phase (during which you give your units orders). Then, the battle kicks in and you watch how your units duke it out. After a while you get the opportunity to change your orders around if you so choose. You also have to remember that there's elevation in this game - attacking from high ground will give you a decisive advantage while using cliffs can lead to some Hot Gates scenarios. The battles still have ways to go, true, but they're quite enjoyable already, even in alpha state.\n\nLastly, the world. Auriga (the planet you play on) looks gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate saying that it's one of the best looking 4X games (if not the best). Aside from great visuals, there are numerous things to discover on Auriga - there are many anomalies (special tiles that are usually very good), ruins to explore (they are persistent btw), minor faciton villages,  and a huge amount of various biomes. Plus the standard - resource deposits and so on.\nAlso, let's not forget about quests. Each faction has a storyline expressed via a quest system. Every player is given a set of quests that they can complete for rewards (completing all of them will win you the game but that's not implemented yet). Aside from these main quests, you can also gain various side quests from minor factions, ruins and so on. The quests are quite interesting and make the game feel more alive, they also let you discover the lore of the game.\n\nIn general, I do recommend this game but encourage you to do some more research first. Especially if you plan buying it in its alpha state.\nAlso, this review is mostly a quote from a wall of text I wrote on the forums once. Just FYI ;)","April 24, 2014","true","333.8"," 834 of 917 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","834","917","0","11"

Your planet, Auriga is dying, with winters steadily getting longer and harsher, and threatening to kill all life on the planet. But relics left by the ancient race, the Endless may hold key to saving Auriga, or some other means to survive the coming cataclysm. But other factions have their own plans on how to survive the disaster – and some just happily fight for territory heedless of approaching doom, so you may have to conquer the world in order to save it.\n\nGameplay-wise, Endless Legend is 4X turn-based strategy with tactical battles and some RPG elements. The main focus is strategy, particularly expanding your empire and developing your cities. As the cities control the whole regions they are built in, and as expansion is limited in early game (partially due to increasing disapproval among your citizens if you expand too much, and partially due to high for early game settler cost), you have to plan which regions to colonize first. And as your cities’ population grows, you can build up your cities, visibly expanding them from small settlements into megapolises that cover entire regions they are in.\n\nTactical combat isn’t as good as in some other games that focus more on it, but still decent enough. Interesting aspect of it is that while units act in turn in combat, all orders are given in the beginning of each combat turn, without knowing how enemies will act, which can make combat unpredictable. Whether it is a good or bad thing depends on whether you enjoy an extra challenge or get frustrated by randomness of battles. If you don’t want to engage in tactical battle, the game allows automatic resolution for all battles, often with quite satisfactory results.\n\nAnd finally, as for RPG elements, Endless Legend allows you to recruit heroes from a very large list that can either serve as cities’ governors or command armies (and in addition to granting bonuses to an army, fighting in combat themselves as well). As might be expected, the heroes level up as they fight or govern cities, increasing not only their combat stats but allowing you to choose their level-up bonuses, with each faction’s heroes having unique set of skills to choose from.\n\nI fully recommend Endless Legend to anyone who likes 4X turn-based strategies or want to give this genre a try, especially if they want to enjoy a pretty good story to go with the game.","November 30, 2015","true","247.6"," 292 of 306 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","292","306","12","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/289130/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Endless Legend is a fantasy 4X game, floating in the ocean of grand strategy games that have been released in 2014. Cities are built, wars are declared, worlds are conquered - but Amplitude has created has something that stands out; a game that is gorgeous with a world that begs to be explored. It is fat with novel ideas, from its peculiar tactical combat, to its fascinating factions.\n\nI have been a warmonger, a being of pure energy trapped inside a suit of armour, watching my armies sweep across the face of the world like a merciless machine. I have been a peacemaker, a measured dragon, bringing the races together to create something better. And I have been an insectoid monster, feasting on the corpses of my foes and inspiring fear and hatred. I’ve been a busy boy.\n\n3 years ago, Amplitude launched its space 4X game, Endless Space. It was laden with potential, but it was held back by a messy research system, a sterile universe and its slow pace. With Endless Legend, it’s clear that Amplitude has grown as a developer. It takes the potential of the previous game, placing it in a strange sci-fi fantasy world - one that exists within the Endless Space universe - and improves on almost every aspect.\n\nThis is immediately apparent when starting up a game for the first time. Endless Legend is stunning - a beautiful, hex-based game with a distinct art style that merges sci-fi and fantasy comfortably. It’s minimalist and clean, strangely evocative of art deco, particularly when it comes to the Broken Lord faction. Factions are a high point overall. Where Endless Space’s races lacked any real personality, its successor is not so hampered.Each of the nine factions has a hook that drives games forward.\n\nEach race makes a strong impression, though, thanks to their lore and themes being tied to actual mechanics. The Roving Clans are a nomadic people, so they can move their cities to new locations within provinces they’ve settled, and their strength is in trade, not war. Indeed, they can’t even declare wars. On the other end of the spectrum are the hideous Necrophages. Insectoid beasties that are hated by everyone, they can’t form alliances and are destined to be at war or on the cusp of war with everyone.\n\nRounding out the denizens of Auriga, the world of Endless Legend, are the minor factions. These tribes sit somewhere between Civilization V’s barbarians and city states. Initially, they are hostile, with small armies of creatures that are analogous to traditional fantasy races like dwarves and demons - all with a spin that makes them feel appropriate for the game’s fiction - wandering around, fighting the larger factions and occasionally besieging cities. They have villages, too, which become the focus of most interactions with these little groups. These villages can be bribed, conquered or placated through quests. The end result is always the same, though: they join the empire. An assimilated minor faction provides bonuses to its new masters, including additional units.\n\nQuests make up a big part of the game. They range from small missions given by minor factions like “kill our enemies” or “give us X amount of Y resource”. These ones do tend to be on the bland side, but offer diversions and direction. Each objective is accompanied by a story arc, fleshing out the already intriguing empires even more.\n\nResearch goals are split into eras. Each era adds more buildings, resources and tools, introducing game concepts at a relaxed pace. There are a lot of raw materials that can be dug out of the earth and used to create new weapons or earn money, but the number starts off small, so an empire can be focused. Similarly, trading doesn’t begin straight away. By the time the appropriate knowledge has been unlocked, the chances are that many empires will have already met and developed relationships, making it easier to start trading.\n\nInteractions between the big factions are what you’d expect from a 4X game. Treaties can be made, alliances brokered, trade agreements put forward - it’s mostly notable due to there being a cost involved. Influence must be spent to make deals, but that’s an important resource. Empire-wide boons cost a ridiculous amount of influence and can give factions a serious edge, but maintaining diplomatic relationships is equally important.The AI is quite reactive, but not very aggressive. It will become terrified if another faction has a bigger army, jealous if they are more powerful, dismissive if they are weaker - but it takes a lot to push them into declaring war.\n\nWars will inevitably kick off at some point, though, and when they do, Endless Legend’s curious combat is put on display. It’s turn-based and tactical, with each battle split up into a maximum of six combat phases, where customisable soldiers and extra-powerful heroes duke it out.\n\nThe planning phase is where units are directed to attack a specific enemy or move to a specific tile. But that doesn’t mean the unit will be able to fulfil those orders. Another unit might get in the way, or the enemy might die before it can be reached. It’s a little hands-off, but that does build this feeling that you’re a general, organising and ordering troops, rather than some omnipotent god dictating their every move.\n\nHaving all of these options, this diversity, does play havoc with the balance. And there are many ways to quickly increase in power and devastate enemies without breaking a sweat. I don’t think balance should be the ultimate goal of every strategy game, though. I’m not certain that there’s a comfortable middle ground, here.\n\nEndless Legend combines fantastic fiction with compelling strategy. Underpinning it all is a strong design philosophy that connects the tenets of the 4X genre together seamlessly, while providing a plethora of options without being overwhelming. Even during a time when we’re seeing a lot of 4X offerings, it sets itself apart, promising something different from its contemporaries.","July 31, 2015","true","247.4"," 495 of 554 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","495","554","16","4"

For me it's basically the Sword of the Stars (1, not 2) of land-based 4X. The things that I enjoy most are the city management system and that you don't have to go wide to win, though there certainly are advantages to rapid expansion. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty with the one-city-only faction.\n\nIf I was giving it a score I'd probably say 8. It isn't as polished and well-rounded as Civ V, but I find it to be more fun and interesting.\n\n- Looks much prettier than Beyond Earth.\n- Lots of people praise the music. I wouldn't say it's the greatest, but it is solid.\n- All the factions are interesting and different. Each has a gimmick, though they don't all suit the playstyles that the developers intended.\n- The hero system can be annoying at times, since some heroes are just completely better than others, and it is random chance which ones you'll be given access to (though starting heroes are always the same).\n- As with many 4X games, it suffers from the fact that the victory conditions can be pretty meaningless. Literally the fastest way to win a diplomacy victory is to continually break your alliances and reform them each turn. Also, once you start winning, you may as well just kill everyone else immediately rather than waiting to get a science victory or whatever.\n- Combat can be very tedious; I recommend increasing the combat animation speed immediately. Also, do not underestimate the importance of initiative in combat. Each unit only gets one attack/counterattack, and the default counterattack overrides all except one of the special attacks.\n- You have to work out a lot of the mechanics for yourself. This game does not hold your hand. Reading a guide on city leveling/building is almost mandatory.\n- Harder difficulties are legit challenging.\n- Quests system is robust enough, but some of them are fairly stupid and/or impossible.\n- Strategic and luxury resources all have meaningful differences and advantages.\n\nSome basic info so you can work out if it is the game for you:\n\nHex-based movement. Out of combat movement is in army stacks with movement of slowest unit, but combat is in a 6-turn battle/encounter where the units split into one-unit-per-tile. This encourages you to build armies which complement each other out of different unit types.\n\nCities work differently to most other games of the genre. The population is essentially all "specialists", to use the Civ term, where each unit of population can be used to create (base) 4food/4industry/4science/4dust/2influence depending on your priorities that turn. Food, industry, etc. on terrain adjacent to the city is automatically collected, and you can expand the city by building districts in adjacent hexes to increase the area being passively collected from.\n\nThe world is divided into regions, and you can only have one city per region. This makes city placement be really important, and leads to important decisions as to city expansion.\n\nUnits are upgradeable with equipment. Each faction has three unique base units, and you can assimilate up to three minor factions to get a faction-unique buff and their factions unit. eg. assimilate the Haunts to get 5% to science per Haunt village in your territory, and build "Ended" which are flying ghosts with a chain lightning attack.","November 16, 2014","true","64.7"," 279 of 305 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","279","305","6","0"

Well heres some for you.\n\n*** Updated as of Beta v 0.5.18 S3 ***\n\nPros\n\n-An incredible amount of visual polish for an Early access game, and its only going to get better. You can zoom in far out or insanely close. Up close the details are stunning. And zooming far out gives you a ancient looking map with all the details you need.\n\n-It's a Completely unique game. Coming from someone who enjoys the Civ series thouroughly, this game feels totally different and adds yet another delicious 4X flavor to my palate. Some things that make it different: High Ground advantadge, Adaptively Progressive Tech trees, The Market, Minor faction integration, and much more.\n\n-Unique factions: I've played all of the major factions in complete games. This much I can tell you: If you play two factions with the same strategy it will not end well for you. Their uniqueness adds allot of immersion to the game.\n\nCons: (Will be updated as game progresses)\n\n-The GUI is set up in such a way that you can easily make a mis-click with units and suffer consequences you never intended. There is a high chance this will be polished up before release.\n\n\n-The economics of the game feel flat. The dissaproval systems are pretty linear and leave a little to be wanted, however there is more economic depth planned and even more will most likely be added before Early Access ends.\n\n[This game contained many cons at EA release but these are since gone]\n\nEndless Space problems not found in Endless Legend:\n\n-Steamrolling combat. Endless Space suffured from this, however combat is deep and thought provoking in Endless Legend even in early access. Also, there is much less of a "Rock Paper Scissor" feel to the game\n\n-Endless Space had a lack of Diversity. Endless Legend on the other hand is teeming with diversity.\n\n-Immersion. From seeing heroes fight on screen, to a richly stylized GUI, to incredible artwork, Endless Legend pulls you into the game's universe and keeps you there.\n\nOverall, this game is an incredible EA game, and a steal with the release sales. And to speak of bugs, beyond a minor one here and there, they are practically non existent.\n\nSo looking for Endless entertaiment?

At first it can be confusing, and seemingly too much to handle if you're a player new to the genre, but fortunately there is a tutorial and wiki that teaches you how to play. When you have learnt the basics, you'll find that the game play is simple, which is what makes Endless Legend™ unique.\n\nThe expansion and exploitation aspects are easier than popular 4X games, such as the Civilization™ series. It primarily consists of moving icons of workers in your cities to different zones in order to produce more of certain resources, either food, production, science or influence.\n\nIn a similar fashion to Civilization V™, you have settlers that you use to build cities; however, when you settle a city, you take control of an entire region, and there are a number of regions depending on the size of the map that you had chosen. The map consists of many hexagons, and your city will start out small, usually seven hexagons in the shape of a hexagon, unless you build it near an impassable hexagon, but the region that you built it in will change to your empires colour. You then have the option to expand your city in the region by the construction of an extension at the edge-hexagons of it's current geographical influence.\n\nThe battle system is great; when you encounter an enemy army, the scene changes and you both fight on a zoomed-in part of the map where tactical game play occurs. You first position each of your units on selected tiles, and then move, attack, debuff, buff or heal; the tiles you can position your units on are selected depending on where you attacked, or were attacked from.\n\nThe two stages of the battle system consist of fluid movement and rigid movement; after you have positioned your units, you click ready and the second stage begins, and in this stage you can target enemies, allies, or target a tile you wish to move to, but if something obstructs you, your movement will fail, yet you may still complete an action; if you are in range of an enemy at the end of this rigid movement, you will attack. You have the chance to win battles using skill and tactics even if the odds are stacked against you. There are six phases in each battle, if units on both teams are alive after six phases, it results in a draw. There is an option to auto-resolve a battle, which you'll probably use often to save time; the probability of winning is shown prior to this choice.\n\nThe customisation in this game is invigorating; you can make new units, and even create an empire of your own. When making a new unit, you take an unlocked unit as a basis and you can change it's name and equipment, which alters the statistics of that unit; or you can edit the original unit. You can also rename any regions you control, and the name appears in the centre of that region in bold letters when zoomed out, which is a nice addition.\n\nEach empire has three units--one starting unit, and two that can be unlocked by researching them. However, within the many regions are minor factions that can be pacified, either by doing a number of missions for them, bribing them with currency or simply fighting them. If you have settled a city in a region where you have pacified a minor faction then you can assimilate them to gain a passive bonus, and their unit. You can assimilate a maximum of three minor factions, therefore, you can only build six different types of unit at a time. You have the option to change an assimilated faction, so you could end up using many types of unit in one game. The army capacity is maxed out at eight, but you must research certain technologies to increase your army capacity, which begins at four.\n\nAnother good feature of Endless Legend™ is the hero system; you may hire heroes to act as Generals of your armies or Governors of your cities; heroes give bonuses to whatever they are set to, and any hero can be a Governor or General. You may switch a hero between being a Governor or General, but, there is a cool down before you can switch back again. Each empire starts out with a hero, and further heroes can be hired after researching the technology that permits access to the hero marketplace. Some heroes can be gained through faction quests, attuned to certain empires that you can select.\n\nThere are many strategic resources that are unlocked at different eras, and you exploit these to construct buildings or equipment for your units. You only need their presence in your region to build an exploitation on them, so you don't need them in your city's geographical influence. There are also luxury resources which are used to add temporary bonuses to cities or armies, depending on what resource it is; they are called booster effects, and some empires can use strategic resources as booster resources. All kinds of resource can be used for trade in the marketplace or on the diplomatic screen when communicating and dealing with another empire.\n\nThere are many victory conditions: Score, Expansion, Elimination, Economic, Wonder, Scientific, Supremacy and Diplomatic. I will not go further in depth on each but instead direct you to the wiki which can be found at http://endless-legend.wikia.com/.\n\nThe graphics are finely attuned, but it can be difficult to tell what the tiles consist of (i.e. whether a tile is forest or grassland) without mousing over and reading the information about that tile; however, if you zoom out around half way it becomes clearer; apart from that, it looks good. Zooming in and out of the map is a seamless switch between viewing the regions, and viewing cities and tiles.\n\nWhen you start a new game you're presented with an options screen, where you can change the difficulty, the empires you are against, the size and shape of the map, and more; there is even an advanced section that goes further in depth. The customisation here is brilliant.","January 11, 2015","true","146.6"," 219 of 243 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","219","243","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bufnitza/recommended/289130/","Bufnitza","Bufnitza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bufnitza/","238 products in account","Welcome to Endless Legend. Take a seat and listen, as I unravel to you one of the best 4X games of the past few years.\n\nFirst of all, there are some things to bear in mind when considering this game, and for some people, these might be off-putting at first, especially if approached in a mainstream or Civilization-like manner. The first thing to consider about Endless Legend is that it encourages experimentation and kindly invites you to leave dogmas and balance at the front door before you enter its universe.\n\nSo, onwards we go.\n\nIf you've played Amplitude's former 4X Sci-fi space game, you'll immediately feel familiar with some of the concepts here. Endless Legend is actually set in the same universe, but rather on a single planet, named Auriga. Gameplay itself and the UI is very similar to Civilization V and fans of this game will immediately feel at home. However, there are a few subtle differences.\n\nAuriga's first impressions are breathtaking. The landscapes are beautiful to watch and behold, making the most of the fantasy theme which has been provided. Also, Auriga features 2 seasons. Games start at the beginning of Summer, and every once in a while, a short Winter will set in. However, this isn't just a cosmetic feature. Winters affect most aspects of gameplay, including military and economic aspects, and some quests can only be completed during a certain season. Winter itself is a pivotal mechanic to the storyline, as Winters will become longer and harsher as time goes by, and you must find a way to "fix" this or risk complete obliteration of Auriga.\n\nSpeaking of quests, they make a pretty big part of Endless Legend. While the main quest will eventually lead a civilization to victory, there are dozens of side-quests to be found across your journies, varying from mundane tasks (such as kill X creature, provide Y resources) to more compex ones, such as forming an alliance or capturing a town. Most quests actually have follow-ups and context, so they're not completely forgettable.\n\nAuriga is also a very lively place. You will encounter roaming creatures and also native tribes. These tribes are akin to Civ5 city-states and can be persuaded through various means to join an empire and provide unique bonuses or units. And speaking of tenants, you share the world with the other civilizations. Amplitude made full use of the fantasy setting and created a set of wonderful civilizations, each different and with their own personality, charm and mechanics. While in Civ, all civilizations were technically the same, bar some variety in buildings and units, in Endless Legend, each civilization is completely different. For example, the Roving Clans are trade oriented nomads, able to move around their cities. They're so trade-oriented that they can't even declare wars, and must push through trade, diplomacy and alliances. The Necrophages, on the other hand, are on the opposite side of the spectrum, being an all-evil warmongering insectoid race which consumes everything and is constantly at war, not being able to ally with anyone. No matter who you choose to play with, the level of detail and artwork will surely surprise you.\n\nProgress is done via eras and a tech tree. While not as excentric and confusing as the Endless Space tech web, the tech tree of Endless Legend is also not as bland as the one in Civ5, for example. What Endless Legend wants you to do is to encourage experimentation. Forget about linear tech progression or "must-have" technologies. You can go that path, of course, but you will not only be very slow in progression, but you will also feel that the tech tree is there just for the sake of being. Instead, it invites you to try a more daring approach.\n\nYou dont' *have* to unlock everything, from hero recruitment, to all the resource extractors, to all armor and weapon upgrades. Doing so is the obvious but also the blandest way. I found out that experimenting with lesser-mainstream approaches can lead to interesting results. For example, in a game, I skipped completely through a set of resource extractors in order to focus on more combat-oriented techs (like weapons+armor) without having to linger too much in early eras. I ended up reaching the fourth era first and having OP military which then resulted in a fairly easy late-game. Surprisingly, the other civs were pretty easy-going on trading the resources I was lacking, so I didn't really feel handicapped by skipping those extractors.\n\nAlso, I've also won with just one hero by skipping most militaristic tech and piling up economic and trading techs. I was the laughing stock of the game when i came to military, but funny enough, I didn't have to deal with any wars, as the other Civs were appeased by my edge in trading and economic "gifts", allowing me to spearhead through the main questline and win the game.\n\nThis, of course, would never be possible without a proper diplomacy system. Endless Legend's diplomacy system, fortunately, is one of the best I've seen. Trading of resources and tech is done by using a special resource called "Influence". Alliances and conflicts are also brokered the same way, which means that players who focus on Influence tech and buildings can easily become rulers of the world. The AI is also very well-done in this regard, with leaders having proper attitudes and reactions to diplomatic events.\n\nOf course, when diplomacy fails, the swords do the talking. As all 4X games, Endless Legend features a combat system. As with the rest of things, its combat system is far from mainstream. Instead of using a simple die roll, each combat is resolved on a tactical battlefield, similar to ones in Heroes of Might and Magic games. However, there are very different mechanics.\n\nWhile the battlefield itself is merely a "zoomed-in" version of the actual terrain, units are not exactly in direct control of the player. Each battle goes through seveal "phases", and the player can only issue pseudo-orders to units, in the way of "try to move here" or "try to attack that unit". However, during the resolve phase, units attempt to carry those orders but there is no guarantee that the action will succeed. This may happen due to the units being out of range or the path becoming blocked. While this can be frustrating for people who like total control of the battlefield, it is actually a more realistic approach to the battlefield, by making the player feel more of a general in command, rather than a God dictating each and every move of its underlings at any given point in time. The only problem arising is that sometimes, units' pathfinding might be awkward and inconsistent with the player's expectations. Fortunately, for such people, an automatic battle system is available, which is more than decent in resolving conflicts.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to every 4X fan out there. However, I would like to stress again that this is not your average game which lets you comfortably settle into a comfort zone. Getting the best out of Endless Legend will mean having to avoid that comfort zone, experimenting a lot and thinking out of the box. Almost all aspects and challenges in the game can be resolved in more than one way and sometimes the optimal way to do it is not necessarily the most obvious one. This game rewards those people who dare go outside the comfort zone and that's what sets it apart from the rest. If you expect a game which emphasises balance, precise combat and a sandbox for you to expand your empire in, you will be disappointed.","December 27, 2015","true","44.9"," 183 of 199 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","183","199","4","5"

Will update as updates come (to the best of my ability).\n\nFor those who decide to look and say TL;DR - Great game, Worth the Price, Alpha = Better than any Alpha I have played, Missing Some features and directions, but will be fixed over patches as is known to happen with Amplified Studios.\n\nLet me start by saying, this is EASILY the best Early Access game I have seen come to Steam. It is already VERY polished for a game still in Alpha. The graphics are actually more impressive than I expected from an Alpha version. Glitches? Kept to a minimum so far, in fact, I don't think I have really seen anything that was more then a moment's annoyance.\n\nA previous review I read said, it takes too many clicks for a unit to make an action, compared to Civ. I disagree. I select the unit, tell it to walk to the tile i want, once its there, it pops up and says "Do this action?" And I can say Yes or no. Quite simple. Attacking another unit? Select your unit and click the other one. Very simple, not tedious, not a pain, and considering how much this game LACKS in direction at its current stage, its refreshing to be given instructions to understand.\n\nThe game plays like a combination of Age of Wonders (I,II,II), Civ (Any), Fallen Enchantress and Endless Space. It takes the best part of each game, and mixes them together. Want an easy way to build you cities and manage your workers? Done. Want to have a little more control over battle but still have it streamlined so it doesn't bog down your game? Done.\n\nThe Tech tree is similar to the Endless Space Tech Tree with a few differences. Right now, you can only research the Tech of the "Age" you are in. You gain levels in "Age" by researching so many of the previous "Age's" technologies. For example, you start at the First Age and can not advance to the Second until you have researched 10 technologies. The only catch on this is, you do not need to research certain technologies to unlock more advanced ones. For example, if you do not research Age One Weapons, you can still research Age Two Weapons. I am sure this is something that will be addressed in a later patch.\n\nI have so much more to say, but I just want to play! More updates and information to come!\n\n**Update 4/26/14**\n\nSo now that I have some more time to expand upon things I wrote earlier, I am going to do my best to do so.\n\nSo as I have said, this game plays like a combination of a few games. Most notably it feels like Fallen Enchantress and Civilization games. Allow the following to help explain what I mean by this.\n\nFallen Enchantress - The biggest similarities come from how the units stack. You stack armies onto a single tile. You are also limited to how many units can be in a single stack. This is based upon your hero and your tech tree. There are roaming bands of armies (mostly made up of creatures) as well as the other empire's armies. When you initiate battle, you will also notice that it has a similar system that shows you how balanced the fight will be. It differitiates slightly from here though. You pick if you want your armies to play offensively, defensively or stay put. Then, your battle takes place on the actual hexagons of the campaign map, but it is limited to a small area. It does not go to a difference screen where the single hexagon turns out to be some huge 12x12 area inside of that single tile. This means that you can potentially start a battle in a part of the world map, knowing that they have to come through a bottleneck because of a mountain range with only one entrance. Once you start your battle, you have the opportunity to place your units in the desired hexagons prior to the fight starting. this allows you to protect your ranged by playing them behind mountains or cliffs and adds a nice level of strategy into the battle, while not becoming so tedious that you spend hours in a single battle (for example a Total War game where you might spend 10+ minutes arranging your armies perfectly). After you have placed your units, you get to choose what units target which enemy units. Then once the round starts, the action is streamlined and you are along for the ride. This helps streamline battle, but it does have rounds where you can re-adjust your strategy to ensure your victory.\n\n*A quick note I will need to add more to later, they also allow you to upgrade/change gear on your armies just like in Fallen Enchantress. I will need to expand on this more later.\n\nCivilation - It is similar mostly through building and placing cities. You also have control over what your population works on in each city (i.e. FIDSI - Food, Industry, Dust, Science and Influence . You build expansions on your city, utilize resources in your region and basically control your settlements expansions.\n\n\nA couple quick notes I want to make here.\n\n* You can only create one settlement in each region. Choose wisely. You *can* still use any resource in that region, even if you are not settled next to it. This mainly makes you choose wisely when it comes to the resources available in the tiles near you.\n\n*Influence and Empire Direction - You use influence to choose the direction of your empire every 20 turns. I made the mistake (due to lack of instructions) of thinking this feature was not implemented. You do not just click the direction you wish to go, you must click and DRAG it to the marker line. I spent my first 60 turns before I realized this.\n\n*There is no tutorial. This is not a game to learn 4x strategy on. It is still being developed. There are truly no directions and you will make mistakes or wrongful assumptions. It may frustrate you when you do so. Save often, you will appreciate when you can go back 20+ turns because you didn't fully understand the consequences of an action you took so long ago, thinking it wouldn't effect you the way it did. I am sure a tutorial will be available upon release if not sooner. If you have any questions, you may also feel free to add me and I will answer them to the best of my ability.\n\nMORE UPDATES TO COME!! Check Back often please! Feel free to comment!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/recommended/289130/","MTizzler","Dark MT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/","483 products in account","I refrained from writing a review on this game until I had a better grasp of the mechanics and content available -- and there's a hell of a lot.\n\nFor those that are too lazy to read a somewhat cautious approach to review this game, tl;dr -\n\nSick graphics,\nGreat Design,\nMindblowingly good music (i'm talking supergiant quality)\nA lot of hours holding on for the next turn.\nSome boggy mechanics but nothing completely quality breaking.\nMultiplayer is dun goof'd, save us amplitude.\n\n\nOther reviews have already outlined the various 4x features that they like, there is a general consensus on the graphical aesthetics of the game being phenomenal and the outstanding music. These are well deseved and there is little I have to say about either.\n\nAs far as 4X games go, this is far from being ground breaking, a lot of its features are ubiquitous. However what the game does do well is polish these features combining complicated designs with simplified presentation. For example, the concept of citybuilding is simple at first glance, any player can create a relatively stable state by implimenting all the upgrades available, and for the most part this will work for beginners as the game is designed in such a way that the improvements benefit off and balance one another. However, at higher tiers of play, more experienced players are able to selectively design a city around a handful of upgrades and achieve very impressive specialisations and "minmaxing" as RPG players would describe it. Whilst minimal in its impact at first glance, this definitely sets apart players as I've witnessed in multiplayer games.\n\nMultiplayer as of release has been relatively buggy, often desynchronising (a problem also inherant in the original launch of endless space). The developers have recognised this since their previous game and have implimented a resync feature which whilst not optimal is at least a fair attempt at multiplayer stability. I hope they bring further development into this specific problem as players are currently not residing in multiplayer as much as anticipated. It would certainly detract from the game's value if things remain this way.\n\nTechnical problems aside, Endless Legend is a game taking after Endless Space; the game is very lore rich, even moreso than Endless Space in my opinion. Each faction is unique and interesting, which whilst subjective to each person's perception of what constitutes "fresh" is at the very least very different from the tolkien lore archetypes. Don't get me wrong, there are still ogres or elves as one may be led to believe, but what is different is the way these factions and nations are portrayed and how their lore is intertwined with their playstyle within the game. This game is effective at combining lore and gameplay mechanics which reinforce the depth of the world and its immersion. For every generic "orc & elves" faction (which are at least less stereotypical in this game) there are factions such as the Cultists that convert villages to fight for their single fortress state and its queen, Dust Lords who do not consume food but instead will stop at nothing for dust, the energy and currency to expand or Vaulters who bear an uncanny resemblence to what would be medieval space muhreens and fight for glorious science - coincidence or not, this is cool. There are more, my favourite being necrophages will burst into poisonous clouds on death and spawn more crawling bug-things from the corpses of their enemies and more.\n\nThis leads onto the world itself, each randomly generated or generated by user seed input, it is always interesting. I found myself almost mechanical in my routine when playing Civ. The start of a game would always involve checking for the closest luxury or strategic resource and setting up camp. Endless Legend however, sets itself apart. The combination of interesting anomalies (of which I was more than happy to read its descriptions for further lore) and the implimentation of a height system in the terrain meant that locating a city now meant much more than a simple viewpoint of resources. The world appears vibrant always and the alternation between winter and summer seasons further draw a need for players to consider the environment in which they set up a city. Cities themselves are also unique. I found that many 4X games were often too promoting of brainless expansion, Civ and Endless Space were shocking exemplars in this regard. But with Legend, since cities can only exist lone in a single region, the need for strategic location, expansion and management are further incentivised.\n\nThis same depth however, is not applied to combat, where gameplay boils down to simply selecting units to either target or move. Advanced combat does improve things somewhat, restricting users to only being permitted selection every two turns but this doesn't remedy the lackluster depth here. I especially hope to see more emphasis on heroes and their role in combat.\n\nHowever all of this is also stumped by the fact that the game is rather lacking in certain important areas of play. Custom faction creation appears to be quite a good idea at first glance, case in point Endless Space, which was phenomenal in the various options you could create a playstyle through your own faction. However, in Endless Legend, the very limiting restrictions of having to choose an archetype based upon the existing factions is doubled with the limiting number of options you have for the faction's traits. Compared to Endless Space, there are less categories, less negative traits and less traits overall. Furthermore, many of these traits are distinctly and very obviously geared towards the playstyles of the existing factions which further make the creation of one's own faction that much less free and satisfying.\n\nAdditionally, the customization of units and heroes within the game are frankly terrible. I can understand where Amplitude got the idea-- many games have the problem of overbearing numbers of units and technological trees. To counteract this norm, Endless Legend has been designed by nature to rely upon 3 units (and the settler, bar Cultists) for a single faction, each with a distinct playstyle. This was to be supplemented by the use of mercernaries and assimilated factions. Customization and variety would come in the form of unit design and customization within the game, choosing their armours based upon various strategic resources and accessories. This was an impressive idea in concept, however it was poorly executed. Units appearances do not change if you swap their armour (this includes heroes) and the variety of equipment mostly came down to very clear cut and distinct differences in statistics, one will have less attack than another or one will be better against ranged units than another. Yes, this does indeed promote playstyles, having a platoon of archer killers with a line of infantrymen in the front is often optimal. But it also sets players into a very rigid selection of play for combat, killing any innovative ideas one could have procured. I hope Amplitude expands this region further as this was certainly one of my biggest complaints regarding this release.\n\nEndless Legend is certainly a fantastic game, well worth its retail price nevermind sales or discounts. We hope that amplitude does what amplitude does best and develops its released games further, I have seen few studios that have managed their community better, through the use of games2gether which is a lot more than a witty coorperate front. Players can vote on game content to be implimented and provide input that is often responded to by the developers granted enough momentum and correct timing. For what is there alone, regardless of future updates and patches, I would recommend to any fan of turn based strategy games.\n\nBuy this game and exterminate the invalid species of Auriga.","September 25, 2014","true","76.2"," 120 of 132 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","120","132","3","8"

So far it's still in early access and it blows me away how good this game is.  Very polished for the stage it is in.  It continues to evolve the combat system from Endless Space where you don't micromanage each unit, but give broad orders to your army.  Some of the game concepts aren't clear when you first begin playing; for instance how far you should place cities to maximize land use, or how terrain affects the borders of your cities.  Not all is lost, however, as you have the option of razing your cities to effectively move the city, though this slows down your empire's progress.\nSome of the unit actions seem a bit more complicated than they need to be.  In Civ you're used to right clicking on a goody hut and everything is taken care of.  In Endless Legend you place your army next to the "goody hut" and then click on the action you wish your army to do, and then click again on the "goody hut".  This makes the task take three times as many clicks as needed and gets cumbersome after a short while.\nThe tech tree is interesting, though a bit light imo.  It follows the path system set by Endless Space with a few changes.  You are not limited to which tech you wish to research except by which phase of the game you're in, which they call "Age".  There are 6 seperate Tech Trees, one for each Age.  There are no paths between the techs currently, though I hope they change that, and it is not quite clear how to advance to the next age.  It just sort of happens as you play.\nThe units do not feel complete or unique yet.  They have different animations and icons, but I have yet to see a reason to bring along a support type unit with an army instead of all infantry or ranged, besides terrain.  Which leads to the next thing I'd like to talk about.  When you initiate combat the camera pans out a bit and uses the terrain of the world map as the battle field, with both height and types of terrain that affect how units move about the fight.  You can place the units initially, but after the fight starts you have no more control.  This makes ranged units very powerful, as you can place one on a cliff and it will plink away at a melee unit while it travels around the hexagon to reach the ranged unit.\nOverall I do reccomend the game for fans of Endless Space and Civilization type games.  If micromanaging units is a must, stay away.","April 24, 2014","true","14.7"," 187 of 245 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","187","245","0","1"

And I enjoy these things, the RPG elements with regiments and heroes is really cool, the battles are an interesting twist from the norm, the quests are cool and the factions are all very disinct in look, play and lore.\n\nHowever, I must stress caution with this game, don't expect a masterpice, becasue it isn't, the increadible amount of praise on this doesn't take into account all of this games problems, which is what i'm going to stress here.\n\nI first played this game when my friend brought it over on his laptop, I would play a few quick, short games and they where so much fun, and indeed the start of the game is a lot of fun. But once I had the game and started longer playthroughs, I began to get bored really quickly. The game is great when you start it up, but as you get further in, it becomes a drag. This is largely the fault of a terrible AI, which isn't a good thing to have in a game for a genre that is heavily reliant on single player.\n\nThe Ai just doesn't know how to play this game, it will always build the same armies over and over again, in one playthrough it will build full stacks of Dragonlings, and only that, then next playthrough it will build 6 wyverns and two ancients per army, and thats it, it will take a stack and only build that stack, and this makes battles in one playthrough increadibly repetitie and boring. It's play style will never suit the scenario, andf it will almost never declare war on you. It's increadibly easy to beat as well, and this means that games become a drag to play through till the end.\n\nThe quest system, while initially pretty cool, has multiple problems, for one it won't often make sense what it demands of you, for instance it may tell you to conquer a city from someone you've signed an alliance with when there is someone else much closer who isn't your ally. Biggest problem however is that they can become uncompletable very easily. You can get a quest asking you to do something that you've alrady done, and as a result the quest becomes incompletable. I remember with horror when in one of my campaigns I got a quest to increase the population of one of my cities to a certain level, and found that the population was already at that level, and then the quest became incompletable! And this was a faction quest, the kind nessisairy to continue the storyline!\n\nThe winter system too, while initially cool (no pun intended), helps this drag as it bcomes more and more frequent the further you go into the game, and this helps add to the drag that you start to feel the further in you go.\n\nThere are some other problems, but most of them are really negligable, the biggest dissapointment is that these issues could all be fixed with a better AI, and so it is with a heavy heart that must say i can't recomend this game, despite all the effort in the art style, the lore and all the unique mechanics, the poor AI just makes this game soo boring. So I say don't buy this game, at least not yet, if they fix the AI then it'll have my full recomendation, but until that stage, I just have to say no.","April 30, 2015","false","29.7"," 358 of 501 people (71%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","71","358","501","10","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimothyDexter/recommended/289130/","TimothyDexter","Veteran of Forum Wars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TimothyDexter/","152 products in account","This game is very much Civ-inspired. Civ V: BnW+GnK, not Vanilla. It's hard not to compare the two because they share so much in common. But that's not a bad thing. It takes what works, and it adds some very nuanced depth to the mechanics.\n\nFaction selection is at the moment 8 choices. They cover most gamestyles you'd expect to find, for the most part they are fairly balanced between each other, with only one faction seen far and away as being UP, and none in particular as being OP. If you don't like any of the factions you're free to take one of the factions as a template, and make a custom faction, with different bonuses costing a set amount of creation points. You can also take some disadvantages to allow you more points to spend on bonuses.\n\nYou start the game with a meager military, a hero, and a settler. You can't settle wherever you want, as there are a finite number of regions, and there  can only settle one city per region. Each region has its own host of strategic and luxury resources, who's exploitation is handled with city improvements. This is in addition to minor faction villages, which when pacified and settled, provide you different bonuses depending on which faction it is, and how many of their villages you own.\n\nHeroes are units that can either lead a military stack, or lead a city, providing bonuses to one or the other. For the most part they are slightly stronger than regular unit, but as they level up and acquire skills through a skill tree, they can become quite powerful, but also much more expensive. After researching a certain technology you're free to pick up as money heroes from the mercenary market as your wallet will afford you. You're also free to pick up other faction's heroes at the same time, if you so choose.\n\nYour city planning is handled with city improvements, most of which cost dust (money) to maintain. There are no "workers" in this game so most of your tile improvement is handled with city improvements. You can expand your city with borough expansions, which extends the urban sprawl of your city while adding the surrounding tiles as usable. However this comes at the price of happiness (which can be mitigated as your urban tiles level up by building surrounding urban areas, wiping out the happiness deficit of that particular tile).\n\nCitizen management is a large overhaul from Civ as well, it isn't something that is mostly used to fuel great people or beakers. Citizens can provide any of the basics of a city (food, money, production, research, culture, etc) at any time. Late game especially improvements can allow workers to provide more income than most tiles. Micromanagement of them allows for high level efficiency, but can get tedious towards the end of a game when your empire has a lot of workers, and a lot of cities.\n\nPeriodically during gameplay, you'll break from normal weather to undergo winter. Winter for the most part, halves movement, decreases combat effectiveness and vision ranges, and plummits your city growth, production, and income for the (several turns) duration of winter. Most heroes, once leveled high enough, can learn a skill to mitigate or eliminate the effects of winter, on stacks of units, or cities. This becomes essential later in the game when the map becomes permament winter.\n\nMilitary is handled rather well, but could be expanded upon somewhat with more diversity in selection. Each faction gets 3 military units ranging from cavalry, infantry, archers, flying, and support. Each faction maintains a flavor for their selection of units, and these can later be upgraded and diversified with an rpg-style equipment system, most units carry a selection of at least 2 weapons selections which can change their role significantly, as well as a host of armors and accessories. However none of these change the appearance (save the weapons) of the unit. These 3 units are augmented with whatever units your minor factions can be recruited from. These too can be upgraded.\n\nCombat is handled much differently from Civ. It is not handled with dice rolls (although you are allowed that option). Every engagement is zoomed in on the map and played out in a Fantasy Tactics-type of minigame. You (or you can let the computer manage for you) fight the enemy's stack on the map as is, terrain and all. If the enemy AI was more detailed it would be more enjoyable, but they for the most part tend to attack the first thing they run into. Which (in my experience) means most of my stacks are developed as hordes of archers with 1 or 2 high defense tanks to block the enemy.\n\nAs far as diplomacy goes, it's very rudimentary, you start off in cold war, for most factions, which means you're allowed to do anything to them short of outright taking their cities. You can negotiate peace, alliance, and trade settlements, or attack them. They will do the same.\n\nQuesting is a big mechanic within the game. Each faction has its own quest lines, which pile your usual quest fair of kill this, and search this location, with more factional specific missions that try to guide you towards playing on the  strengths of your race. Expect conversion and building from the Cultists, trade and money from the trader oriented Roving Clans, etc. These are nice little distractions which keep interest in the game when you aren't actively at war or preparing for war.\n\nAI in general, is very unchallenging it seems, but so was Civ's. If you are fairly experienced with turn-based 4x games, you will most likely find Normal difficulty useful only to be introduced to mechanics or factions. The difficulty factor primarily seems to be from increases on the AI's starting roster, and their increases to research speed, production, and income. They don't seem to handle oceans or seas rather well either, in aggression or in peaceful expansion. So expect to perform better, with more water seperating you from the AI.\n\nGraphics, are stupendous. For a 4x game. The artstyle surrounding the game is also quite good, and maintains a very fantasy/sci-fi vibe. Units have a fair bit of detail to them, along with your cities, and the general tile layouts of the map. It's not hang up on your wall beautiful, but it looks good, doesn't get boring to look at for extended periods of time, and doesn't tax a moderately built computer's resources too much. However it does make initial map seeding take a fair longer than what I'd like, but once the game's loaded it runs without many hiccups.\n\nI have no experience with the multiplayer, but I haven't heard anything bad about it. No news is good news right?\n\nAll things said, if you've enjoyed Civ V, EL brings enough new things around that it'll be interesting enough for several games. If you enjoy 4x games in general, it has some rough trimmings about it, but it is already a fairly solid game, with some fairly interesting mechanics bundled with it to make it one to give a shot.","September 27, 2014","true","28.3"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","54","58","2","0"

VERY VERY EXCITED. I loved Endless Space (even with it's shortcomings). I knew what I wanted to be there, and from the feature list and reading on the forums, I knew that EL would have almost all of it, with the potential for all of it with Amplitudes propensity to give free add-ons and support. The game is absolutely beautiful. It has all of the common fantasy tropes (a good thing) but each has a twist (even better). City spam? GONE. Unique tech? present. Fun factions? there in spades. Tactical combat? Indeed (and getting better). Lots of resources?.. I'm in heaven. Naval combat? coming soon. Minor factions? oh yea!!! I'm sold. The A.I. is getting better in both combat and city/unit management (very important). As a community, we the players suggest, and Amplitude is still istening and making changes. We even got a faction added to the game. By the community, for the community. Amplitude really is working with us. Now, to the game. I love the winter mechanic because it acts like an enemy (Winter is coming after all). The planet has a volatile nature and it moves from the carrot to the stick at the drop of a hat. One moment summer is there and your economy is in full swing, then winter hits, and you are wondering if you'll be the same after it passes. Auriga (the planet we're on) is dying, and it's time to leave. Many different ways of doing that. The usual victory conditions: Domination, science, military and more. It has a robust quest system that will get more depth as the devs continue to add components to the game (co-op quests perhaps). Hero leveling that actually has meaning. Meaningful (still getting balanced) unit and weapon design. No two regions are the same because of the location of the crucial resources. You get to plan it out as you decide how to grow your empire. One of the factions, Roving Clans, even gives you a do-over if you find a better settlement options because your scarab cities can move. How cool is that!!! As you pacify the minor factions, you get to chose a couple to join your ranks. But wait, you wanted that other one... you know.. the one that your enemy controls!!!!!  No problem, just buy it on the market place and make it a privateer. Now you can wage war, without waging war....  Nice!!! I can keep going, but why spoil all the surprises. Oh yea, I love the changes to the UI that they implemented since ES. LOVE THEM!!!\n\nThat was the good.  Now the bad.\n\nThe game is a graphics hog, and it can be slow between turns and during combat. Make sure you have a fast machine with a good graphics card, or play on lower settings. The A.I. can be rather obtuse sometimes, but then again, when have you played a 4x game with a strong and well rounded A.I. from the get go? me? never. The tool tips could be better because there is soooo much going on.  They need a more in depth tutorial that isn't so boring. I was bored, I couldn't finish it. Naval combat and aquatic resources are mostly missing, but we're told that is their next major thing, as well as espionage.  Nice!!!\n\nI am sure there is something I'm leaving out, but I hit all the main points.\n\nUpdated December 6th, 2015: I would give Endless Legend at it's current state 9.25/10. All the patching and additions have realy brought up the score. This game is fantastic. I highly recommend it. Go out and get it.. go go go!!!\n\nUpdate #1: March 28th, 2015 - Three free add-ons have added much requested features and extended the gameplay. The AI has improved and the bugs are all but disappeared. I can honestly say that the game is a 8.9 or almost a 9. So close.  If you are still hesitating, don't.\n\nUpdate #2: April 29th, 2015 - The release of the Guardians DLC really improves on the early and mid game. Your choices now have meaning that carries through the late game. Titan units with co-op quests and legendary buildings? Where do I sign up. Oh yea, right here. I can't wait to see what else comes from AMPLITUDE Studios.\n\nUpdate #3: October 1st, 2015 - The Shadows DLC is amazing. It finally brings us the espionage mechanic all the while introducing an espionage focused faction called the Forgotten. The single player game has improved, but the multiplayer game is where it's att. Continued support and incorporation of community feedback has made EL one of the best 4X MP experiences out there. The espionage mechanic makes consider some really important choices. Use heroes to command your armies, as city administrators or foreign spies. You can now pillage and loot. YOu have invisible armies on the field. So much to do...\n\nUpdate #4: Demeber 6th, 2015 - Echoes of Auriga and the Lost tales are two mini DLC (paid) that add additional quests, events and new music by FlyByNo. Amplitude knows how to keep you engaged with compelling lore and music. Both of these tiny DLC are worth every penny.\n\nAnother part of this update is the FREE-DLC called Forges of Creation. Within it, Amplitude has put in some serious effort into updating the A.I., which by the way is getting much better. It also has a solid balancing pass from SP/MP gameplay. But, the reason it's named thus has to do with moding and Steam workshop support. This one has both. Finally!!!\n\nUpdate #5: April 21st, 2016 - The Shifters DLC blew me away. The Allayi faction with their multiple personality disorder, winter affinity and tall empire growth really makes them fun. The new re-worked winter mechanic with the Pearls of Auriga and the Alter of Auriga to eXploit them is spot on too. The new tracks from FlyByNo just make it that much better.\n\nWas there a small AI update too? Yes.\nAnother balance pass? Yes.\nBug fixes? Yes.\n\n\n\nKeep up the great work Amplitude Studios and please keep the DLC coming. Such high quality stuff indeed.\n\nGo check out eXplorminate.net and see what they have to say about. 4X Game of the year for 2014.","September 24, 2014","true","370.5"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsanscartier/recommended/289130/","dsanscartier","dsanscartier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsanscartier/","97 products in account","For the first 20 hours of gameplay, I thought I had found a new 4X game to add to my favorites along with Civ and AoW. Unfortunately that feeling did not last. Amplitude did a lot of things right but in the end failed to make the game engaging enough for "endless" replays.  Gameplay features that made me come to this conclusion around the 40-hour mark are as follows:\n\n1.	Winter is a game breaking borefest. If it appeared randomly after 30 to 50 turns and lasted between 5 to 10 turns, it would be an interesting feature… but the way it is implement (where winter occurs more and more often, lasts longer and longer and leads to endless winter by turn 200), it is simply a chore and the opposite of fun. The AI does nothing during winter, productivity comes to a screeching stop, and movement and offensive military action are severely hampered. This equates to a clickfest on the “next turn” button. Few skills and techs help with winter’s onslaught, and even if Amplitude added some, it would affect replay. Good 4X games let you implement your winning strategies, they don’t dictate which techs should be researched in order to compensate for devastating scripted events. This reminds me of Medieval Total War, where after building up your empire, you knew that everything would be laid to waste by the scripted Black Plague and the back-to-back Mongol and Timurid invasions.\n\n2.	City invasions are too easy. Considering that empire building is really engaging in Endless Legend, you end up holding off your armies and then unleashing them in the game’s last "decent length" summer, before the endless winter comes, or otherwise you lose on points. Again, Amplitude is dictating gameplay with their lore. I don’t care for lore in a 4X game, it affects replay.\n\n3.	The Quests are ill-conceived and do not provide enough reward. Almost all of them will ask for some resource only available in the next era, to visit a location in a region controlled by another faction that would require you to declare war just to get to it, or to develop one of your city with Level 2 districts and city centers that would take at least 50 to 100 turns to complete. Same thing applies for assimilating Minor Factions: their requests can either not be fulfilled anytime soon, force your hand into war (which you don’t want to do considering the poor return you get from assimilating Minor Factions) or make you turn to the marketplace to purchase the requested items only to realize that it would be twice as cheap to just bribe them into submission.\n\nPutting aside those issues, I love everything else about this game. AI, combat and diplomacy all need to be improved, but it is not game breaking for me. If they can make winter optional or configurable, perfect city invasions so it is better balanced and change the questing and Minor Factions assimilation features to make them more enjoyable and worthwhile, they will greatly improve the replayability factor. As it is now, I was fun playing through a game, but I doubt I will revisit Endless Legend often.\n","January 24, 2015","false","60.8"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","71","93","3","3"

If that is not enough variety for you, then you could also make your own custom factions!\n\nYou can also customize your heroes and units with weapons and equipment you unlock via research or from quests. For instance, the Vaulter's archer unit - the Marine - can be equipped with long bows that are strong against flying units or a 1handed crossbow and shield for more defense and extra firepower in short-ranged combat. Armor and accessories can be mixed and matched to customize your heroes and units even further.\n\nThe game also features politics and trading like your standard 4X fare but adds a new twist due to the introduction of influence as a resource needed to engage in such. Influence is not only used to for politics and trades, but also for assimilating minor factions and passing empire plans that give buffs to your empire.\n\nThe game might seem daunting and intimidating at first due to the many complex mechanics and vast amounts of customization available to new players - but they're actually easy to learn and engage with thanks to the smooth and intuitive interface as well as the empire screen and army screen which shows a summary of everything in your empire like your cities, resource production, construction queue, heroes and armies, etc etc. All it takes is just 2 clicks to find anything you might have lost track of in the map.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, the game us top-notch - with gorgeous visuals and art style, backed by an amazing soundtrack, and fascinating fantasy/sci-fi story and lore.\n\nMy only complaints is that the AI can be quite dumb; and slow-down may happen when a game gets ridiculously long like turn 300+.\n\nOverall: Highly recommended for newcomers and hardcore fans of the 4X genre.","December 26, 2014","true","63.6"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","47","58","0","0"

What i mean by this is someone who wants to get the game, and play a couple matches, there is enough new and exciting content to make it worth it.\n\nBut if you are looking for that game to match or rival Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri (that you still play after years), then this isnt it.\n\nIn my opinion this game could be awesome. But the amount of bugs, glitches, broken and missing systems outweigh the positives, and that is why im giving it a negative review. Its like a computers game version of a 'tease'. "Here is all this awesome stuff...that i will fail to deliver." The AI makes single-player play only a short term option.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nPositives:\n+ Each Faction has unique technologies and unique playstyle\n+ Each Faction has unique units (changing factions forces you to change combat style)\n+ Each Faction actually feels distinct and plays differently\n+ Beautiful world design with unique concepts\n+ Detailed Civilization Statistics easily accessed during the game.\n+ Customizable Races and Units\n+ Customizable Maps\n\n\nNeutral:\n+- Unique map system that is cool but doesnt allow you to see the whole world at any one time\n+- Quest system, while a positive at first glance, is poorly done and alot of quests 'break' easily, quest count is low which leads to lots of repitition\n+- Unique 'Winter' system, while a positive at first glance, effects everyone the same and only slows the game down\n+- No naval system for people that like water maps. I just turn water levels way down.\n\nNegatives:\n- No Key Rebinding and limited shortcuts\n- Lack of documentation. Tutorial/Wiki only give the broad information on how to play the game. Indepth game mechanics are not explained. There is no internal game library (like Civ) to explain these details either.\n- Bugs are addressed each patch. However there are still a few annoying ones that havnt been addressed since January.\n- The diplomacy system is better. Flavor text makes sense most of the time. Trade values are still iffy which leads to easy exploitation.\n- While each faction has a backstory, it is harder to work through some factions then others. Others can ruin your play if you try to follow them (as Drakken, try to take that one city all the way across the map, of the Ally you have been friends with since the start of the game)\n- The battle system IS unique. But in a negative way. Lack of unit control and poor programing lead to frustration. You give commands at the start of each battle round. Issues occur when your units cant follow your orders (which is often). The AI takes control of your units and sends them places which dont make tactical sense. (HINT: Make all of your units "Stand Ground" to avoid the crappy AI moves)\n- A full unit stack (6-9 units) can kill (literally hundreds) of weaker units and take tons of cities without taking major damage. There is no 'fighting your way back' in this game.\n- Taking cities is waaaayy to easy. You can easily take a close neighbors city within the first 20 turns.\n\n\nMajor Negatives: ***AI is still pretty terrible.\n- It cant fight in battles. Once you get the hang of the battle system its easy to trick.\n- Makes no diplomatic sense. Never fights empires that are threats. Easily bribed.\n- It cant build 'strong' armies. It doesnt upgrade units early/often enough.\n- AI technology selection doesnt make sense (Dust based civilization skips 3 dust boosting techs). They also routinely skip "unskippable" techs.\n- Kinda stops playing if they lose majority of empire. Never see more armies from them or any switch from horizontal to vertical gameplay.\n- Doesnt play to victory type. Playing conquest victory? Every AI empire is fine playing an economy based game as one empire slowly takes out empires one by one.\n\n\nFinal Statement:\nThe game is in much better shape then when i started playing in November. I last played during th beta release of the expansion pack. AI still needs work.","December 16, 2014","false","188.2"," 387 of 616 people (63%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","63","387","616","23","13"

The 4x genre appealed to me and Civ was a damn good game to get into at the time. That said, I'm not a big solo game type of player. I don't really enjoy playing vs AI. I've got a solid group of friends and multiplayer is where we set our hearts on. Time and time again Civ would crash, freeze up and just corrupt. Hours and hours of multiplayer games wasted and ended before the fun could really start.\n\nEndless Legend WORKS. It just ♥♥♥♥ing works. I want to really push that point home. If you were disappointed with Civ's ♥♥♥♥ multiplayer, Endless Legend could be a real option. Any time steam would go down or there was a DC, we instantly could go back to lobby, load up that turn or 1-2 turns prior and continue. Every. Single. Time.\n\nIf you have a group of friends that are looking for a 4x game, I highly recommend this game. We played easily 60-80 hours before we noticed any imbalances in the game. We are able to turn on and off different content in the main menu. A REALLY nice feature. We've opted to disable the Guardians content because it's heavily RNG based. For example, I as the Broken Lords was easily able to accumulate 4,000 dust. I was rewarded with 200 of a very powerful strategic resource which allowed me to in a matter of 10 turns, dwarf my friends and crush them 1v2. Guardians has fun additions for single player but for multiplayer, we've had a much better + more balanced time since we turned Guardians off.\n\n150 hours in and I just want MORE. I think a large part of it is that while the game is fun, I've many friends to play with consistently. If I only had the ingame AI, I'd probably have only played 50 hours or so. Going beyond Serious difficulty, the AI doesn't get smarter, they just get more free stuff which is pretty lame. Playing with friends, the politics, the diplomacy and back stabs are ♥♥♥♥ing epic!\n\nI'm glad I got this game. If you have friends that want to try a 4x, I heavily recommend this one. If you get into it, try disabling Guardians and see if that resolves any frustrations with the RNG aspect of Legendary Deeds. If you just want to play vs the AI, you'll probably get bored after 30 hours or so - still really good value if its on sale.\n\n","September 14, 2015","true","178.0"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","45","56","0","0"

Thats not easy for me to say, as i love Civ 5 more than any other game ive ever played. For years ive come back for one more turn, endlessly, never tiring of the game. Untill i bought Endless Legend after seeing it win 2014 game of the year on Rock Paper Shotgun. I bought it, and stumbled through the first few turns of a Drakken playthrough, and realized in those few turns that i was suddenly tired of Civ 5. I have said, "man i wish that feature was in here" or "they should but this and that in Civ BE (which they didnt) or "this needs to change in Civ 6" a million times. And all those changes i ever wanted were already there in endless legend. Entire armies of only unique units. Truly fully cusumizable units. Cities can expand in physical size on the map and encompass more tiles, till the planet looks like Coruscant. Truly unique factions, not just a weak bonus and one unique unit, i mean the factions are unreacognizable from each other. I mean one faction can even MOVE its cities somewhere else. Or this other one can literaly trick other players into siging and agreement that they dont want. another action quite literary feeds on the flesh of the other factions for growth. They are all truly disticnt, unlike civ 5 and BE's stale factions and units. If you were whatching a game were you couldnt see the name of a factions cities and could not see there factions color on civ 5, you probly couldnt tell two factions arpart, untill one of them builds there only unique unit. That will never be a problem in EL. Not only is every unit unique, but the city art is so lovingly crafted, a glance at a city and you know what faction owns it. Each faction has radically diferent architechture from the others. But enough on the aesthetic part of the game. The gameplay is something to behold. Because gameplay is different for all factions, ill just cover the basics. There are regions. Only one city cam be built in a region, and that city is named after the region its constructed in. Once a cities constructed, a farm or any other tile improvement (called exploitations) are automatically built on the tiles surrounding a city. As your population grows, you gain workers. Workers dont roam the map, but instead are assigned in cities to work a specific type of tile, not an individual tile. Cities expand to new tiles by building districts, which expands  the size of the city by adding a new bock. Coin is replaced by dust, which is money, and has magical purposes as well. Luxary resoursces are used to create empire boost, which cost a amount of resource, so having large quanities of the smae luxary is very beneficial. Ifluence is used to make deals, and assimilate villages, which are a mix of barbarians and city states. There are so many diferent systems in this game i cant possilby cover them all.

I'm dying for a good 4x that provides a real challenge in the form of good AI rather than simply giving a dumb AI more resources.\nHeres my take:\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics are great (Subjective)\n-Most files are in XML form so many facets of the game can be modded/edited to your delight.\n-Expansive tech tree varied by race/faction\n-Each race has specialized roles and perks\n\nThe Bad:\n-Poor conveyance. Meaning you will have to do some forum hunting to figure out certain elements of the game.\n-Having good FIDSA where you place your capital can make/break your game.\n-Painfully easy (subjective)\n-The AI is SHARED by different factions. This means that what one race will say to you, and the tactics they use   against you, are the same as any other AI race. The only difference in tactics are their use (albeit poor use) of the given faction's unique abilities. There are TWO AI paths: Minor Faction and Major Faction, thats it!\n-The AI is dumb. They will lay seige to undefended cities instead of taking them. They will STAND STILL while being fired upon if they cannot reach you within 1 turn (sometimes but still). In a scenario where I set every faction to be aggressive and incapable of diplomacy, the AI simply wanders about aimlessly in a semi-confused manner while you build up to a point where you're already unstoppable.\n\nI really like the concept of it all but the ability to faceroll "impossible" enemies simply isn't fun for me. I don't like the feeling of "holding back" just to give the AI a chance.

They each get unique units (different classes of units, not just stat modifications) and have dramatic civilization modifiers, such as the roving clans faction that get significant economic benefits but cannot declare war.\n\nCities are limited to 1 per (fairly large)province, which prevents overcrowding while still giving a lot of freedom in city placement.\n\nOn top the usual forest/grassland/river tiles you would expect, there are also a plethora of "anomaly" tiles, which give powerful and unique bonuses. Each province usually has 1-3, which coupled with terrain + resources contributes to each province having its own flavor.\n\nInteresting and varied quests.\n\nAlmost all heroes and units can be customized.\n\nYou can integrate a wide variety of minor factions (each which their own bonus and unique unit) into your empire. However, you can only do this with 1-3 minor factions, so this choice is nice way to further customize your faction.\n\n\n--Cons--\nExtremely poor tutorial and in-game documentation. Unlike the Civilization games, there's no help menu or in game tips. You're just kinda thrown in to flail.\nFinding and reading the 60-page manual (an online pdf) helps, but lots of important mechanical details (especial faction-specific) are still not explained and need to be uncovered by coincidence / trial and error.\n\nExamples: The cost of a technology scales based on the amount of technologies you have, INCLUDING those acquired from quests or trade, meaning you can accidentally sabotage all your future research by completely a quest for a technology you didn't need (PS: It's impossible to cancel quests.)\nEven though cultists only have one main city, they get 10% of the strategic/luxury resources from a province where they have a converted village IF they have the appropriate mining technology (technology which you would never research unless you knew this rule).\n\nAs an additional frustration, this game was in early access for a while and it can be hard to tell which wikis or forum posts have outdated information about how the game's systems work.\n\nThe battle system is really bad. It's hex based like HoMM or King's Bounty, but instead of specifying moves, you specify intent. However, after 40+ godd*mn hours, I'm still not sure how to get my archers to just attack something convenient without suicidally charging into the fray. Additionally, when attacked, a unit must counterattack, consuming it's action. It's an interesting way to make initiative matter, but now you have imprecise commands which are ignored half the time anyway, and the combat frequently feels like a comedy of errors.\n\nAdditionally, combat takes place on the geography of the world map (but with cities and uninvolved units removed). Even leaving aside coastal battles (where you might not even be able to deploy most of your army because you had a sea at your back) the geography complications can play havoc with your units' AI.\n\nThere's a bunch of other minor inconveniences, like being unable to see a unit's abilities at various points where that information's important. Or being given a settler when razing a city, and being unable to sell him (meaning you just pay upkeep the rest of the game, unless you want to expand or suicide him.)\n\n\n--Conclusion--\nFor all the cool ideas the game brings, I was too frequently frustrated with the lack of information or the fiddly mechanics. That said, if you're a very patient person who's interested in the unique elements of this game, I could see you having fun with it.","December 18, 2014","false","49.1"," 107 of 162 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","107","162","8","0"

This time it's fantasy instead of space, but it still has the "Amplitude Spirit". By that I mean that the game looks neat, isn't too heavy on your rig, has a clean and easily accessible interface but does stuff differently than you probably would expect. While Endless Space was relatively true to the 4X space standards, Dungeon of the Endless deviated from the typical rogue-like noticeably, and now, with Endless Legend they take it even a little bit further.\n\n\nOverview\nAt first glance Endless Legend looks like your typical hex based fantasy 4X; or it looks like it will turn into one once it is finished. You start the game with a small army on a randomly generated map and the ability to found a city. As with most other fantasy 4X games where you build your first city is important. Each city generates resources based on the hex it is build on and the 6 hexes surrounding it, which resources you want depends on the faction you play. From there on you start to explore the map with your starting army, looking for ruins to loot, roaming mobs to fight and villages to burn until you meant your first AI faction and start the typical dance of diplomacy and war.\n\nThere are also heroes in Endless Legend which can either be assigned to a city or an army. Either way they gain experience and offer boni based on their skills. An army accompanied by a hero is much stronger than one without and a city with the right hero can be pretty effective.\n\nLike most new 4X fantasy games Endless Legend has quests, but it does it a little bit differently. Quest are not just simple "fetch x kill y" missions, they also tell a story - at least the main quest which is different for each faction - and don't just give items or dust as a reward but can also give you access to technologies you can't get otherwise. So, searching ruins for quests is something you really want to do.\n\n\nRegions, Cities and Empire Management\nOnce you start exploring the map you instantly notice that there is something different: The map is divided into regions.\nRegions come in different sizes and shapes but they always have a least one minor faction village and some special resources, which you can only harvest if you have a city in that region. But the most important thing about them is that there can always only be one city in each region. This doesn't only mean that whoever has a city in a region basically controls it, it also makes you really think about where you want to build your city.\n\nOver the course of the game cities can expand. You can build boroughs in hexes adjacent to a city centre or other boroughs and thereby gain access to resources that previously where out of reach.\n\n\nCombat System\nEndless Legend utilizes a turn based tactical combat system but doesn't give you full control over your units. At first, it is kinda weird but it has its charm and give the game a unique touch.\nEach battle starts with a deployment phase where you can place your units. After that you have multiple order and action phases. During the order phase you give you units orders which they than try to fulfil during the action phase. If they can't fulfil their order, e.g. cos the tile you want the to move to is already occupied by another unit or the unit you want them is already dead or out of reach, the AI will take over and let the unit do what it thinks is best.\n\nAnother neat thing about tactical battle is that they take place on the strategic map. When two opposing armies meet a battlefield is staked out around them which means that the area where you fight actually matters. This is especially true since elevation actually matters in Endless Legend and stuff like cliffs can block your movement paths.\nYou should think twice before you move an army next to a cliff where you opponent could attack them from above but they have no chance of reaching them.\n\n\nCustomization\nEndless Legend doesn't allow you to fully customize your units and heroes but you can give them equipment such as weapons, shields, armour and trinkets. In addition to items heroes have a skill tree that consist of 3 different line that are connected to each other. Which skills a hero has access to depends on its type (infantry, ranged, cavalry or flyer) and the faction you play.\n\nEach faction only has 3 units that will always do specific things and look a certain way. Equipment won't affect their appearance much nor will it allow you to change a units role. However, there are also quite a few minor faction units which you can recruit once you assimilated a village of their faction. This allows you to add troops to your army your faction otherwise wouldn't have access to.\n\n\nInfluence and Diplomacy\nWhen it comes to diplomacy, which is also not fully implemented yet, Amplitude goes for a strange new but nonetheless interesting concept. They have a resource called influence which is needed for every diplomatic act, may it be offering peace, declaring war or assimilating a minor faction.\n\nEvery 20 turns you can also use influence to change your Empire Plan, which gives you different buffs based on what you pick. A neat little idea that helps you to adapt your global strategy a little bit.\n\n\nMajor Factions\nThere are 8 major factions in Endless Legend, some of them are pretty standard fantasy stuff others are rather unique and offer you a different approach to the game.\n\nThe Vaulters are you typical science guys with a dwarfish love for crossbows.\nThe Wild Walkers are wood elves that left the woods to start a civilisation, they are you builders.\nThe Broken Lords are basically Dust vampires that have to purchase population.\nThe Necrophases are warmongering insects that can't be at peace, ever.\nThe Arden Mages are masochistic mages that grow stronger the more you hurt them.\nThe Roving Clans are nomad traders that can't deny you access to the market place.\nThe Drakken try to play world police, they like diplomacy and can force treaties.\nThe Cultists only have one city but can convert pacified minor faction villages.\n\n\nMinor Factions\nEach region in Endless Legend has 1-3 villages of a minor faction in it. Unless pacified, which can either be done by bribing the, attacking the village or doing a quest, these villages will grow and spawn armies that will roam the map and cause havoc.\n\nOnce you have a city in a region with a pacified minor faction you can assimilate that minor faction which will add population to your city, give you some small bonuses and allow you to recruit a special unit.\n\n\nWinter is coming\nThere are two seasons in Endless Legend: Summer and winter. In summer everything is fine, your people are happy, your cities produce resources and your units can actually move. During winter however things are different. Suddenly you produce less food and dust, your people might get a little grumpy and your units can't move as far any more.\nWhen winter is coming and how long it lasts is somewhat random. You know vaguely when to expect it, but you can't really be sure. And the longer you play the harsher the winter.\n\nThis adds another interesting layer to the game. While Endless Legend plays like a typical 4X during summer, winter changes the rules. Suddenly it becomes a survival game, if you haven't stockpiled enough food your people might starve and if you are low on dust your might have to destroy city improvements or disband armies cos you no longer can afford them.\nWarfare is also quit different during winter. Units need way more time to reach their destinations, so it's probably not a good idea to send all your armies searching ruins when winter is coming.\n\n\nMultiplayer\nWell, Endless Legend has multiplayer. That's pretty much all I can say about it cos I never tried it. In my book, 4X games are meant to be played solo, on your own clock.","April 25, 2014","true","71.4"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","64"

I feel that many changes were introduced into the typical 4x formula more out of a desire for novelty than genuine improvement over tried-and-true systems. It's not praise when I state that every time I put this game aside for a month or two and come back to it that I am nearly at a complete loss as to how to play/enjoy the damned thing.\n\nPart of the allure of a strategy game is in untangling its mass of interconnected parts and learning a new series of mechanics and how they affect each other and the overall thrust of the game but I feel that the awkward learning curve of Endless Legend lacks the payoff in gameplay that makes the effort feel worthwhile. Most of the mechanics revolve around maximizing an endless pile of tiny modifiers that work invisibly most of the time and don't really contribute to an impression of growing an empire. The spreadsheet-y nature of 4x games is just too front-and-center for this one and in board game terms, I feel like I'm playing a euro-style abstract victory-point chase rather than a more viceral, thematic war game.\n\nI am not baffled by the popularity of this game and can see how it would be very appealling with gamers of a different stripe than myself but for me, the only reason that I keep coming back to the game and giving it another go is that I am chasing after the same enjoyment (and failing to find it).","January 1","false","29.0"," 93 of 141 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","93","141","4","2"

In other words, concepts, ideas, mechanics, etc that have been used or done before. At first glance, Endless Legend does indeed have those traits. But, when settling in to give the game a chance, there's a feeling of refresh by the way it presents itself.\n\nThe graphics and style of the game are beautiful and help give a lovely sense of immersion and personality. The music score of the game is especially a treat and only help accentuate on these features. Gameplay is refined yet still deep enough to be somewhere in the intermediate of complexity. No, it's not the most deep of strategy 4X experiences one could have, but that's certainly not a bad thing. Rather, the way it plays out allows one to still use their mind and strategize, but not be overwhelmed to the point where it takes hours and lots of reading to make heads or tails of how the game plays out.\n\nThe factions in the game all have their own background, theme, traits, and their own thing going for them. And I have to say, some of them are downright intriguing. And in some cases, even unnerving--but in a good way! What's nice about these factions is they all play quite different from one another and even have their own quests to follow. As such, one could play through the game and have a distinctive experience each time. Though, this is all also thanks to the many customization options one can do for the world generation, changing anything from size, terrain types, general land formation, world difficulty, victory conditions, and more. For those bold or wanting to mix things up, you can even make a custom faction based on one of the existing ones as a template.\n\nCombat is turn based with light tactical considerations. It's not as deep as some other 4X games, but there are some I have played where it's even more simplistic than how Endless Legend presents it. As mentioned before, Amplitude seems to aim to make games that have a happy medium with their approach to complexity, nothing too complex, but not too simple. They also like to make a nice clean, accessible, and slick interface to help make navigating and display information in a pleasant fashion that helps make a person feel comfortable using it more than intimidated.\n\nI do like the direction Amplitude has been going with their games and certainly would love to see future developments from them. Their work is pretty solid from day 1 release. Though, there are bugs to be had and their track record with patches has been quite good with Endless Space. As such, their support is quite good and they're willing to do what they can to make their fans happy, even if given some time.\n\nBottom line, if you like 4X strategy games and enjoy ones of a fantasy nature that doesn't take itself too serious, but not too lackluster, I think you'll be at home with Endless Legend. It's a happy medium that makes it hard not to like for those that aren't looking for something too complex or casual.","September 20, 2014","true","87.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudointellectual397/recommended/289130/","pseudointellectual397","Pseudo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudointellectual397/","541 products in account","It's a 4X fantasy(?) game set on a world called Auriga. You play as one of the major factions on the planet - one of the species who has risen up and is sufficiently advanced enough to be a dominant force. Also scattered throughout the planet are minor factions. These are all kinds of other species who will try to raid your cities but can be stomped or made a part of your empire.\n\nA lot of the different factions are based on tried-and-true fantasy creatures. The Wildwalkers are elfish (bearing a resemblance to the walking plant elves of Glorantha), the Broken Lords are a kind of undead/necromancer faction, and there's minor factions like the Delvers and Urces (dwarves and ogres, respectively). However their look and feel is often twisted a bit and really cool. Dwarves wear skull masks and have skulls braided into their beards, for instance. And each faction feels very different.\n\nThat's one of my big Things for sci-fi or fantasy 4Xes these days. If you're going to have different species of creatures, I want them to feel different, play different, and have different goals. The developer totally nailed it here. While there's some core gameplay that's similar, the different factions spin off in different directions. The Broken Lords are powered by Dust, the game's magical currency and power source, and it is the only thing that lets their populations grow and the only thing that heals their armies. To begin you must be very cautious but once you get your dust engine going you become terrifying. The Necrophages are people-eating insect creatures, and diplomatic options are forbidden to them because everyone else is food. Additionally, defeating enemy armies gives you bonus food. Yum.\n\nIf you've played the developer's other 4X, Endless Space, you'll recognize dust, and probably a lot of the other game's resources. There's a smart reason for that, and that's because I feel like the setting of this fantasy world is built on Clarke's law - "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I won't dig into the setting stuff too much, but the game blurs fantasy and sci-fi, and I'm pretty convinced it actually takes place in the same universe as Endless Space.\n\nOther neat things:\n- You can make minor factions a part of your empire, giving you a bonus and a special unit from that faction. The Hurnas aka Orcs in this game give you orc archers and give all your units throughout your empire a bonus to damage, while the Delvers give you an economic bonus and skull-wearing axe warriors called dredges.\n- Each faction has a storyline quest that either guides you to victory or a serious empire buff that generally seals your victory, and lets you learn more about the faction and their history and future. This is probably one of my favorite bits, and is the reason why I'm playing and replaying and replaying.\n- A lot of people compliment the UI so it's worth mentioning. Managing your empire is pretty easy and doesn't require a lot of clicks. It's the first game where I've found worker management to NOT be a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. All the information you need is pretty easy to come by too.\n- There's a season cycle! Summer has an abundance of resources, and units move farther. In winter your resources get significantly reduced and armies move at a crawl. It creates a really interesting cycle where you're growing and building in summer, and conserving and trying to keep things together in the winter.\n- I feel like both Endless Legend and Endless Space make the choices to build and expand really significant rather than no brainers. A lot of the time playing conservatively is a really good move, and having your cities sitting there, doing nothing, is the best move you can possibly make. Similarly, settling a new territory or conquering a neighbor might have a ripple effect of consequences that messes up your whole empire. I appreciate that, and I think it's pretty rare in 4X games.\n\nThe game has been fun enough to motivate me to ramp up the difficulty and fiddle with all the different knobs and levers of game creation to try different things. I think I've finally nailed Normal difficulty with my current playthrough as the Necrophages, after my last playthrough as the Vaulters was a failure. However, that game taught me some lessons about worker management. It was also probably due to me selecting a Hard world at game creation which led to fewer resources and more aggressive minor factions. Halfway through the game minotaurs burned down my capital city.\n\nIt does have some flaws though:\n- Game crashes. I've had a few of these. Luckily the game autosaves every turn, and you often even have a chance to save after the game crashes and a reload fixes it (rather than just shut down the game stays open and gives you an error message that you can copy and paste and send to the developer).\n- AI has some problems. There's been a few times where I've fought some melee units, and had them just stand there and do nothing while my ranged units plugged them. At first I thought it was some kind of feature of the faction I was fighting as they were giant rock people, but I had it happen against a few other factions when they were defending with melee only units.\n- This probably only bothers me but right clicking is how you exit out of screens. However, if I try to exit out of the city screen and there's garrisoned units it makes the garrisoned units go for a walk. It's the only instance of this, and I wish they'd get rid of it since ungarrisoning units usually means going to the city and select New Army. I'm sure this is supposed to be a convenient time saver but it's more of a pain in my ♥♥♥ than anything else.\n\nOverall, though, I'm hooked. I'm really amped for them to create some new factions, and maybe add some art assets for all the different armor you can customize your units with.

Centered around economy and constantly building up all of your cities (as opposed to simply trying to destroy your opponents, though you can also take over other people's things).\n2. Despite being heavilly driven by economy, you can build armies and conquer other people through force as well.\n3. Advantages of peace, with trading and sharing of technologies.\n4. Choice in technologies (now all of them are fairly good, and eventually you can choose all, but sometimes you have to make a few sacrifices to get to the higher ones first :) )\n5. Multiple Interesting Races (6 so far, 8 coming) each with different strategies.\n6. A constantly changing environment (the game creates an entirely random setting each time you make a new game, which is lovely <3 ) and perfect for replaying and multi-player gaming with friends.\n7. Ruins, minor factions, and ocean travel for the explorer in you.\n8. Turns instead of all at once (now while I can see why the alternative some people would like, I think it takes away from the strategic of it and would make things too much 'who can click the fastest' type of game, luckilly this isn't that.. you can spend an hour if you want in a non-timed game turn, there isn't a constant rush.\n9. Endless time, even though it does announce a winner at turn 200, you can keep on playing, keep getting different resources, keep building up massive cities, learning new technologies, and exploring the very far corners of the world if you haven't. (this is unlike wherein warcraft resources are limited, or in battles of middle earth where it all becomes the same).\n10. Cities can be expanded to near limitless dimentions (atleast till they take up an entire region, which probably wouldn't happen unless you really tried)\n\nThis is my favorite strategic game of all time, and I look forward to whatever they do to expand it :) (( Come on Cultists and a water race.. we're waiting :3 )","July 9, 2014","true","480.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","1"

I'm completely hooked at the moment!  There are still a few factions left to play, so while longevity will be limited until the AI is improved, the game represents a good investment.  The professionalism of the games development stands out in many ways.  The user interface is easy to use, the music is terrific, the graphics are beautiful for a 4X game and the tactical combat is vastly improved over Endless Space. I've had no crashes or seen any bugs with a material impact.\n\nAmplitude have developed a really good 4X game.

This game has it all. A real in-depth strategical engine, factions that actually change the way that the game is played for once, and a compelling story (in a 4X game no less!).\n\nAnd the ART! Every time I see a new painting in a faction quest, I've got a new desktop background. Sometimes, in the mid-to-late-game, I take a break and just zoom in and look at all of the cities and terrain in my empire... its gorgeous! When Steam announced their Music service, this was the first soundtrack that I thought of... and I'm not a soundtrack guy at all.\n\nThis game was originally purchased to "hold me over" until Civ: Beyond Earth came out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenfalcon07/recommended/289130/","goldenfalcon07","Golden Falcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenfalcon07/","89 products in account","I want to start off by saying that endless legend is my first, “Real” 4x strategy game. I have tons of time in games Like Civilization 5, and Total War games, but nothing as in-depth as a full blown 4x title. Until now!\n\nEndless Legend takes place in the realm of Endless, I guess. From what I hear the game is set in the same universe as there other Amplitude titles. As you begin the game you will jump into the role as one of eight different factions. Each with a very unique style. Anything from the Wild Walkers who worship the earth and the land, but have very few powerful fighters, too groups like the Drakken who fight for equality and diplomacy above all else. Though there is not much upfront lore about each faction (minus a brief opening cut scene before each single player game) Each Faction feels incredibly unique. Making multiple play throughs, and multi-player a blast.\n\nGraphically, Endless legend is phenomenal. Featuring a map that looks like it was taken straight from a table top board game, and more colors that I thought were possible. Which really helped me to immerse myself in the world. A world in which you will be spending lots of time.\n\nLike other 4x games, Endless legend is one you’re in for the long haul. An average single player game can take 8-10 hours. Plenty more when in multiplayer, playing against smarter more politically minded people. Bringing up a few interesting issues.\n\n20 hours in, I’ve found the AI to be almost unresponsive. In my first game (after the short tutorial) I played for about 5 hours. Having almost no contact, with any other races (of which there were 6). Except a few minor races which are very aggressive unless pacified. In a second game; that is now lingering into the 10 hour mark, I’ve had the pleasure of being nose to nose with 3 factions, only to relies that they don’t give a damn, what I do, think, or say. One enemy did declare war on me, but only because he is a “war type faction”. His minions carelessly threw themselves at my walls only to die time and time again. It felt like he was doing this only because the game said he had to, in order to fulfill his role, not because it was the best strategic decision. (I was playing on hard difficulty)\n\nOther than some Dumb AI, the gameplay is solid. City management is as deep as ever featuring an approval system, resource management, and growth. Resources types are plentiful, and the tech tree is very easy to understand. It must be noted that you won’t be teaching down a linear path anymore. Endless Legend, allows players to tech as they please entering a new era every 9 researched techs.\n\nCombat in Endless legend is a bit wonky, but fun none the less. Armies, fight each other on the same hexes in which they are positioned on the world map. Clearing away minor debris like trees and towns, for an instanced battle. Bonuses are given for terrain, and certain units gain bonuses based on faction traits. Once things kick off, you can issue unit orders, then press go to see you're warriors go to work. Most of the time units are smart and fight to win even if you have given them orders detrimetal to there sucess. Other times though units can move into compromising positions, without so much as a notification this is possbile. Also, I have found that Factions like the Wild Walkers, who are range based, have a rough start. Entire armies can get wiped out in a single battle because of their low defense and inability to run from most melee enemies effectively. Thankfully upgrading your units nullifies this issue.\n\nCustomizing units in Endless Legend, has been a blast. Changing everything from a units name down to every last piece of gear. I love outfitting my soldiers with new weapons, amour, and accessories, all of which have to be balanced around you're production and resource amounts. Add to much high tech gear, and your units will take too many turns to build. Add two few upgrades and your units could be combat ineffective. The balancing act is one that allows for a lot of experimentation, as well as challenge.\n\nIt has to also be said that features like trade routes, some odd buildings, like watchtowers, and unit abilities, are confusing to understand, at least for the first 10-15 hours. The game is terrible at telling you why you need these buildings / abilities, or how to access relevant information, on the subject. Luckily a bit of mucking around, and experimentation allows you to get the hang of things. Tool tips galore!\n\nAll in all, Endless Legend is, an amazing game. It offers up some of the best fantasy strategy out there, and does it in a way that is not only familiar to strategy fans, but unique in its factions, worlds, and lore. If you can get passed, a few AI issues, and a rough combat system, you will find a deep, engaging strategy experience, at an incredible price.

I typically don't pay much attention to giveaways, but I actually won something that time.  And that something happened to be a game that seemed somewhat fascinating to me at the time.\n\nAs of now, Endless Legend is a whole lot more than "mildly fascinating," and I am shocked I did not know about it sooner.  This is one of the few games that I wish so many more people did know about.  My opinion of this game is from the perspective of a[nother] person stepping into it from Civilization V.  I also have some Total War to be comparing it to, so I have that to reference as well.  That said....\n\nEndless Legend is a beautiful game.  There are few other words that can describe it so aptly.  The presentation of Auriga (the gameworld) from the map anomalies to the tile improvements that match the civilization's stylistic impressions to the special effects during winter to the GUI, everything about the game is beautiful.  The UI deserves a special shout-out, because everything is placed so intuitively, and it's simple, clean, and elegant.  There is no other game that matches the polish of Endless Legend's UI (although vanilla Civ and G+K were both very meticulous through the menus and what-not).  As a turn-based strategy, the gameplay is sufficiently balanced, and the overall war mechanic is somewhat more sophisticated than what you'd find in Civilization, using Total War's army-building model.  The quest functionality provides a lot of deep lore, and it really is amazing how intricate Amplitude's universe is - they have clearly committed a lot of energy to just... being creative here - so I have to mention it even though I really don't care for it much in my playthroughs.  I don't have to, though.  It's there if you want it, but I'm just not an RPG person.  My biggest gripe about the game is how much ALL CAPS ARE USED IN ITEM DESCRIPTIONS. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING TO READ.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantasy version of Civ that is very, very polished, endlessly replayable (see what I did there?), full of character, surprisingly strong on the war/conflict front, and I am recommending it now solely because I want more people to know about it.  I encourage you to pick it up, or at least look into it a little deeper.","January 1, 2015","true","99.4"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","5"

Hits so many great titles out there, but adding its own fresh curve balls. I do not regret my purchases. I would recommend this game to anyone. 10/10\n\nThis is by far, one of the best 4x I have played in a very long time. If you are a Civ fan you need to give this game some thought. It has everything the civ fans enjoyed over the years, but at the same time also gives new and refreshing ideas. It has the 4X feel to it that we all know and love. So it wont take long to start understanding the way this one plays but at the same time also throws some curve balls your way making you go "whoa, that is awesome"\n\nScrolling out the map never felt so good. in other games you scroll out. Get an under standing and scroll back in. This, you scroll out and admire everything you have done seeing all that you control from a more masters look. Feeling like your on that iron throne and pushing around your wood pieces.\n\nCombat gives a whole new meaning to the 4X genera. Iv played allot of these style games. I love the combat to this, So far this game has dabbled in my childhood more then I thought it would from playing Civ 1-5 and Heroes of might and magic.\nIf your a heroes of might and magic fan being able to tell each unit who to attack and where to run instead of click, right click. and a fight broke out. You get so much more control over what each unit does. AS well as your hero.\n\nUnits, being able to gear up your units with more armor and weapons, rings and necklace. For how indepth this game goes. Its got me comin back for more and more each time.\n\nHeroes. Each hero has a skill tree as well as gains xp. Adding new armor, trinkets, weapons. Skill points. Want a bad ♥♥♥ that leads your troops to hell and back, you got it. Want one that sits in your city and just helps run that ♥♥♥♥. You got that to. I love just exactly how much control i have over what everyone does.\n\nOn to that last part over control. Your citys go a little different in the route of how things are done instead of making workers. plowing fields building this, and telling them to do this. Instead you have workers, but apart of the city. Want to pop out more gold(in this case Dust) Move one, two or all of the workers over to dust. Need to make this troop faster for that war. Move all your workers over to industry. Some may say that might make it easier but it doesn't just makes it more convenient. Workers are still taken away each time you make a settler so there is a downfall to all happy ups.\n\nThe other thing that I love about this is the races to choose from, each with there own back story and quest line. There own play style. Really throwing more in to the ring. Not only this, its the fantasy theme, if your a fantasy lover, 4X player, and a Heroes of might and magic playing Civ 5 person. Give this game more then just thought, go ahead and put it in that cart. You will not regret it.","November 5, 2014","true","37.6"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","41","57","0","0"

Would be a strong 10/10 if endgame were successfully rebalanced.\n\nEndless Legend is a deep, complex 4x game with a great selection of unique factions and a ton of strategy. Of the many 4x games I've played, this is the only one that holds up to the Civ series, and actually exceeds it in many respects. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves strategy. It is fun and extremely addicting.\n\nThe game has a long learning curve - hundreds of hours in, I'm still improving. I absolutely love this about the game, though some may find it overwhelming. Every turn presents choices, and every choice feels important. Mistakes are punished harshly, and can make or break your early game. To play well, you must pay close attention to every detail. You must be aggressive but careful at the same time, and most of all, you must be thorough.\n\nManual combat is very difficult, and can be frustrating. Checking each unit's initiative and minding the terrain are essential. Even then, things will not go as planned. That being said, I don't see this as a weakness - just a challenge. Keep in mind, most 4x games do not feature anything close to this. And if you don't like it, you can just use auto-combat (which works quite well).\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nOnce you learn the ins and outs, you realize that Endless Legend has one major weakness: Endgame. The problem is with pacing, scaling, AI, and the lack of an effective "limiter".\n\nThe pace of the game accelarates as certain empires start to dominate the map, and the numbers get out of control. The victory conditions are reached too quickly, and feel anticlimactic. By the time you reach the final tier of technologies and get the best gear, the game is pretty much over and you don't get to use any of it. This is extremely disappointing after a very long game of building up to that point.\n\nAdditionally, the AI does not function well in endgame. They don't upgrade their equipment all the way, and you can crush them easily in every fight. Even on higher difficulty settings, they just pump out lots of weak armies.\n\nBasically, endgame needs a serious rebalancing, and it needs something that slows the game down (especially victory conditions) and limits the exponential growth of empires. Approval rating (the equivalent to happiness in Civ) should be the limiting factor, but it is too easily overcome.\n\nIf the devs pulled off a serious endgame overhaul, I can say confidently that Endless Legend would be the greatest 4x game ever made. As it stands today, it's still a great game, but the disappointing endgame is a real buzz-kill.","May 16","true","238.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","1"

I'd buy them and then play them for a few hours and probably never touch them again.\n\nThis was the case with Endless Legend when I bought it shortly after it first came out. I played half the tutorial and didn't touch it again. Jump to 2016 and I thought - "You know what? I feel like getting into that Endless Legend game I've had for a while now." and oh boy am I glad I gave it another shot. I'm enjoying it a lot more than CIV 5.\n\nThe key features I like about it are as follows:\nThe Races - Roving Clans and Broken Lords are my top favs. Each one is amazingly unique. The Roving Clans are a nomadic trader faction that can't declare war at all but they can ban people from using the in-game market system and are really good at making money. The Broken Lords don't need food. They live off Dust (in game gold) and I actually mean 'live off it'. Each faction has it's own aesthetic beauty which really shines through in their cities and units.\n\nThe Music - You've got all types. Nomadic type music for the RC faction, medieval/spooky for the BL etc. The music really fits this world and helps immerse you in it.\n\nThe World - Now I really like the lore in this game. It may not be much in comparison to Middle-earth or League of Legends' lore (League has lore???), but it has a good enough lore for me.\n\nThe Climates - You have your generic desert, forest, snowy tundras etc. but they look beautiful. Each match makes the world look breath taking and that's brilliant for a 4x game. (When you build districts near water, you get a little port going on and it looks so nice). :3 It's just wooden boats and wooden walkways but it's still nice. I hope the next expansion is a naval/aquatic one which actually adds REAL ports into it and naval warfare and a naval faction that can build on water.\n\nNot really a review, but I'm loving this game and I can't stop playing it. This is the first game to do this to me in a very long time. I want to know more about the Endless world, but sadly after Endless Legends, it expands to space (Endless Space) and all the factions except for The Vaulters die out. That's not a spoiler. You'd know this if you played Endless Space (I haven't but I have read up on it) and the planet EL is set on, Auriga, is dead and barren during the events of Endless Space which is set AFTER Endless Legends. There's another game called Dungeon of the Endless which is set before Endless Legends.\n\nThe timeline goes:\nDungeon of the Endless - Endless Legends - Endless Space - (and maybe Endless Space 2 which comes out this year).\n\nOverall, I rate this game a Roving Clans Best Faction/10.","April 17","true","16.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefeint/recommended/289130/","thefeint","thefeint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefeint/","112 products in account","This is one of those games that I saw a huge amount of potential in, but falls short in ways that make it difficult for me to recommend. The designer had some creative approaches to the issues that come up in 4X games - quest victory, minor factions, 1-city-per-region, and the Influence system. The amount of care that went into designing each factions' quest lines, unit art, and the overall story is quite impressive, and it brought me into the game with some level of excitement.\n\nBut in a game of this scope, the weakest link stands out like a sore thumb - or in this case, sore thumbs. The battle system starts off promising, with a small section of the actual world map playing host to the somewhat small-scale battles that constitute army-on-army warfare. In practice, the battles are honestly a nightmare. They usually play out like this: the two highest-initiative units get to act as they please. If these two are on opposing sides, they'll form sort of a central conflict, around which the rest of the battle swirls. Except swirling makes it sound intense & interesting - the swirling comes from the out-of-date unit orders, trying in vain to get to an available side of the single enemy they were allowed to target in this round. It can actually be a relief at times for one of your obstinate, lackwit units dies, because it opens up room for a fresh unit, which had been flailing about at the outskirts of your battlefield, to charge over to the site of that unit's corpse and actually accomplish something. I don't know how much time was spent working on the battlefield AI, but it seems to consist of simple pathfinding, and quite possibly nothing else.\n\nThe tech tier system is an interesting system, but I kind of have to scratch my head at some of the decisions. For example, there's a tech available in tier 1 that unlocks the Heroes & Mercenaries section of the Marketplace, allowing you to spend Dust/currency on hiring either of these kinds of units. If you don't unlock this tech, you will have 1 hero for the duration of the game (barring any that might come from your faction of choice's quest line). What's odd is that some of the hero skills unlock incredibly valuable upgrades - for the Broken Lords faction, which is extremely reliant on Dust income, you might unlock a 15% increase in the Dust income of a city, if the hero in question is set to govern it. What this means is that the Heroes & Mercenaries tech is absurdly valuable. There are techs each for the tier 1 strategic resource extractors, and the tier 1 luxury resource extractors, as well. If you don't unlock those, you may be missing out on an enormous set of features of the game. Compare that to the Aquapulvistics tech, which unlocks a couple of city improvements that generate 2 or 3 dust per turn on a tile that has a river, or a lake respectively. And only in summer (something like 3/4 of a game's turns, by my rough guesstimate). Anyways, the idea is that the balance between tech decisions is pretty lacking.\n\nSo those are my complaints #1 and #2, out of what is a much longer list (of which I'll spare you the rest). Really, the reason why I bother to write this isn't because I hate the game! But rather that it's promising enough that I wanted/want to like it, but the flaws are so irritating that it drives me to put it away. I hope that another game can come in and take the effective and interesting gameplay elements & features, and make a better game. Or at least one I can tolerate playing a whole game through without wanting to claw my eyes out in frustration.","October 6, 2015","false","36.3"," 168 of 282 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","168","282","8","10"

It has some outstanding ideas, notably the heroes, the weapon systems, and the quest system.  It has some quirky ideas that don't quite meet their full potential, such the incredibly unique and varied races and the tactical battles.  Then it's got some neat ideas that just don't work, like the province system.  At the end of the day, this is a great try and injects some life into the 4X genre, but it's missing the mechanics of other greats that prevent it from being fully recommended.    *CAVEAT: I should actually say that I am a peace-loving hippie; this game may very well cater towards you warmongers...\n\nPros:\n- Downrigth gorgeous, with stellar art and graphics\n- Excellent strategic pre-battle planning for your units and heros\n- Fun quests, especially since each race has their own unique storyline\n- Great race selection, albiet with flaws (see below)\n- It really is a servicable 4X game, and is fun enough in its own right\n\nQuirky idea shout-out:\n- I loved the tech where you can make all-merc armies neutral, then have them wollop on you friends without them knowing it is you.\n\nGood tries:\n- Tactical combat\n- Racial abilities don't always work as anticipated, or are not as useful as the developer's thought\n- Complex trade and diplomatic systems; the problem here seems to be AI, not the system.  Excellent ideas.\n\nBig Issue that was never fixed:\n- There are still missing explanations for game mechanics, which is nigh unforgivable in such a complex game.\n\nCons:\n- Province/district system really shoehorns your expansion and negates any real need for protection of non-city areas.\n- Utter lack of customization of districts or landscape; incredibly dissapointing given the fascinating take in Endless Space.\n- Because of the above two problems, the mid-game is incredibly dry if you don't want to fight everyone; you simply set up a build and research cue, then hit end turn (as opposed to micromanage tiles, planets, etc.)\n- Further, expanding your city is not that fun since you take huge hits in happiness every time you do (which, if you think about it, is bass ackward).\n- FIDS system, or rather the DS (dust and science) part of it, make unique cities unnecessary and pointless; each city can easily produce everything.\n- Laying seige to a town is odd; it is completely necessary, but is so easy it feels as though it is not.\n- Playing with an emphasis on ranged combat gives you a huge advantage with just a minor understanding of tactics.\n- No sea or air combat, and very limited sea exploration/exploitation\n\n\nOriginal EA review:\nTo start, this game has tons of potential.  The base buliding is fantastic, it exudes character (for example, each race has a unique quest/storyline with rewards), and the combat is a unique take on 4X games.  Also, I love the way they are approaching diplomacy (it depends a little on its own resource, which makes it easier when playing with the AI).\n\nOf course, this is early access. Now, normally I am 100% against early access games.  They lack polish, they are buggy as hell, etc.  The same is true of Endless Legend.  The biggest problem: the utter and complete lack of explanation of anything.  So, why a thumbs up for this one?  Because Amplitude did it right and is giving a 25% discount!  Hot damn people, we've got good marketing and benefits for all!\n\nI'll update when I've played more, but for now, this already awesome looking game is being offered at a significant discount and is enjoyable enough right to sink a few hours here and there.

It seems like a game that would be best played again human opponents (not that I have had the chance), but the AI on harder difficulties still pose a challenge. It doesn't bring anything terribly new to the 4X genre, but neither does it fail terribly in any respect. I'd seriously reccomend getting it on sale, and if you're a 4X fan, I'd tentatively reccomend it at full price.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nTech tree seems well rounded, and contains enough content on a standard-sized map, facing the default amount of enemies (5), on the standard game speed, that I wont come close to exhausting research options. The need for completing X number of techs of one tier before accessing the next finds a nice balance between depth and breadth in research.\n\nSimilarly, there is enough "map content" that I'm still coming across new resources, minor factions, and anomolies fairly late into a standard length.\n\nI like the region system, where the world map is broken up into pre-defined, randomly-shaped regions. Each region can host a number of different terrain and features, but only one city, so city placement within a region has an impact on empire development (though this fades with time, as modifiers from buildings and population begin to overshadow those of the terrain).\n\nRidges add some depth to both exploring and combat.\n\nFactions play fairly differently, with many of them operating under different mechanics.\n\nSummer/Winter mechanic makes for some interesting scenarios.\n\nBeing able to customize the weapons, armour, and accessories of standard units, as well as upgrading these on existing units helps keep most units from becomming obsolete as the game progresses, and allows you to invest significant resources into specific units, should you desire.\n\nSome things I don't like:\n\nThe game needs another pass of bug testing. It's not unusual to encounter crashes and hangs, and I have encountered the odd game-play bug.\n\nThe AI is inconsistant, and varies is competence from one game to the next, within the same difficulty setting. One game an AI may be a clear threat, other games the AI barely seems to handle the basics.\n\nThere are some equipment combinations that are clearly superior, leading to less variation than the number of options would suggest.\n\nThe learning curve is steeper than it should be, thanks mostly in part to a lack of in-game documentation and tool-tips, and mechanics which are not adequately explained. A number of mechanics will make sense once you've realized how they work, but getting to that point is more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nTactical combat doesn't have a lot of depth, and becomes tedious. At the same time, auto-resolution tends to kill off too many of your units. This is the worst situation a 4X game can force you into: choosing between bland combat or taking unnecessary losses.\n\nSummer/Winter mechanic can be downright annoying. Some quests are turn-limited, and the untimely arrival of winter will make them impossible to complete.","September 22, 2014","true","14.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

The factions are all varied and play uniquely and creatively, each having their own strengths and weaknesses and very distinct looks, both cities and units. The battles are quick, but full of true tactical choices and even strategic choices, as they require knowledge of the terrain and the elevation bonuses to take full advantage of. They're also quick enough to not become the focus of the game, unlike another recent "4X" game with a long history....\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that if you like 4X and you want a polished, pretty, and deep game, look no further. The game is, most importantly, fun, even in its BETA state. The AI is competent, though in need of some love (they have time), the balance is getting better with every build and the flow of the game is becoming extremely solid.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

If you liked both You'll love Endless Legend most likely, even if you didn't like Fallen Enchantress, the mix of Endless Space makes it great.\n\nThe game-play will feel right at home for Endless Space players, and other 4x games like Fallen Enchantress with some unique spins as well.\n\nGame-play:\n\nCities:\nThe map is split up into pre randomized territories. When you build a city in a territory you capture that entire territory. As you build your city expands tiles. Your city uses all of the main tiles its on + the surrounding ones for resources, gold, industry, and science.\n\nThe towns can also be governed by Heroes just like planets in Endless Space, which will give a nice boost depending on how you level up your hero.\n\nArmies:\n\nArmies work much like Fleets do in Endless Space.  You have a max number of squads you can have, until you research more. Armies can be lead by Heroes which will give the army nice amounts of boosts depending again how you level them up.\n\nHeroes:\n\nHeroes in general are a bit different than in Endless Space. Though they can govern towns and armies, they also have armor/weapons and accessories you can equip them with like in Fallen Enchantress. As you research more, and get more resources, you unlock more powerful and different kinds of weapons/armors for your Heroes to equip.\n\nRegular units cannot be equiped with different armors, but they do get a boost depending on which tech era you're in, and as they gain levels through battles they get stat boosts.\n\nBattles:\n\nBattles play out like they would in Fallen Enchantress, but with a few slight differences. It goes in phases much like battles in Endless Space, with the setup, telling each unit to be aggressive, defensive, or not to move at all. Next phase is selecting who they focus. Then its go. They'll move if need be to get in range of who you wanted them to target, and they'll take turns attacking. Their initiative determines who goes first.\n\nAfter 2 turns, you get to re adjust your army, if you want some units to fall back, or re adjust who they focus.\n\nThe battles also take place on the tiles around the map itself. As a battle starts the battlefield will consist of a large portion of the tiles that actually exist on the game map itself, allowing you to use the terrain to your advantage.\n\nThe Map:\n\nThe map is split up into tiles, and on these tiles, and plays just like you'd expect a 4x game like this. However, there are also ruins which you can find, and if explored by an army with a hero may generate a random quest to go on, or give you gold(dust).\n\nThe map is very beautifully done, and looks amazing, and changes depending on if its summer or winter.\n\nMinor Factions:\n\nMinor Factions are randomly put around on the map. You cannot trade with them, and at the start they are neutral. You can attack or negotiate with them to add them to your faction. Each Minor Faction has a faction wide boost for immulating them into your faction, and you get to train their troops along with your normal ones.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAlready in Alpha this game has nearly more than Fallen Enchantress and other 4x games that have gone through in the past. You know a game will be well worth it if you can get your money's worth in Alpha.\n\nHowever, it being Alpha does mean there are things still not implemented, and balancing that needs to happen, but is well worth the money in my opinion, and will be something worth investing in early that you won't be disappointed in.\n\n\n\n","May 2, 2014","true","105.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

The overall experience is however masterfull and a joy to behold.\n\nFirstly the things it does wrong:\n-The game has a tutorial that goes as far as explaining the tried and tested tropes of the genre. It fails to explain the intricacies of what Endless Legend offers beyond this. Adding layers of complexity where little external resource exists to fill you in. The steam copy of the manual is actually usefull for once, but Learning to play a modern day game especially one that innovates in so many ways, shouldn't involve reading a 70 page pdf.\n-The difficulty and overall balancing is out of wack. This only time will heal, and it will, knowing amplitudes excellent track record with supporting their tittles post launch. The best way to play this game at release is with other human beings who are as fallable and new to the experience as you.\n-The combat system removes power from the player in an attempt to streamline what is often the most tedious part of the genre, player agency is important in all game genres and unless I as the player have explicitly surrendered it, it should never be taken away.\n-The quest system feels pinned on to the experience the game already offers, and doesn't stand up as it's own thing, You can tell the potential and desire to enhance it was there by the devs but to date it's been squandered.\n\nNow quickly the things that it does right:\n-A slick, clean, effective, forward thinking and wholly PC interface. No big picture or touch screen nonsense here tyvm.\n-Asymetrical faction design. Making each and every one of the different faction play in a unique and different way. This adds to the multiplayer joy, a 30 hour trade war mirror game where the players can't declare war on each other? priceless. An expansion faction versus a tall single city empire? totaly legit. The options are there and out of the hands of the AI totaly viable.\n-It's beautifull. I've never liked blur in video games before, but whoever designed the art style of this game knew all the right things about lens shifting and lighting. And a niche love of papercrafts maybe?\n-Combat. Yes it in part removes player agency forcing you to fight for control but other innovations make up for this. The combat the most arduos part of this genre is hastened by spontanious (or double spontanious) turns and a 6 turn turn limit. Combat never feels obtrusive and is actualy worth investing time in thanks to these design decisions.\n-Tile exploitation and cities. This one is probably preference and others may disagree with me, but the way cities expand and exploit the FIDS resource system is very rewarding, feels organic and empowers the player. You'll learn to love triangles and spiral patterns in a weird way I swear.\n-Soundtrack and art. The word eargasm doesn't exist. But it should for this very reason. The ost captures the hybrid fantasy lowtech sci-fi setting brilliantly as does the art.\n\nIs it worth buying? I judge a games worth if I enjoy playing it over it's price in £ converted into hours. I got my copy cheap as part of a subscription service to IGN, but it retails at around £30. Check my hour count and you'll see that I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\n~Litany","October 27, 2014","true","92.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

So going into this game I was highly skeptical and I felt that Age of Wonders 3 was going to be a superior game in all aspects. Also, if you'd rather watch my review rather than read it, well, here you go:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkXBrS9-sRE\n\nThankfully, I was horribly wrong. Endless Legend is a refreshing 4X Fantasy Turn-based Strategy game that has a beautiful aesthetic, simply beautiful music and an incredibly immersive world. Artistically, you can see where Amplitude was trying to create it's own world rather than copy and paste the Civ Map and formula with it's interesting terrain design, huge assortment of resources and even its graphical style. Exploration in this game is an absolute treat and you will find yourself scouting out the various corners of the world with glee; meeting new races, looting abandoned ruins, and solving the mysteries of this ancient world. Amplitude continues to flex is development muscle with it's intricate Unit Customization tools which are incredibly simplistic yet allow for all sorts of loadout variants for your troops and heroes.\n\nWhat's wrong with the game you ask?\n\nThe worst thing (which isn't even that bad) is the combat system. From the time I have put into it, it really seems like it plays itself, just like Endless Space. Essentially, I spend far more time autoresolving the battles rather than playing them. The tutorial is also not incredibly effective at explaining a lot of the economic portions of the game or even explaining the finer points of the battle system.\n\nAll in all, this game is freaking awesome and has proved to be one of the best modern 4x games to date!

And it's still in testing. First of all, this game looks gorgeous: from landscapes to unit design. The world can be aesthetically changed and physically changed through pre-game options, meaning that random seeds just got more random. Units actually change how they look depending on armor (to be implemented in the future, review written as of Alpha Test on 6/3/14) equipped and weapons equipped (already implemented), meaning I can have some wierd bug guys with claws, or wierd bug guys with spears. While not at all necessary in a 4x, it really adds a sense of personality (which is something that Amplitude usually lacks in their games) and a feeling that what you do is actually impacting your empire. Secondly, the game's speed is perfect. It feels faster than most 4x games (I can play a 5-man game on a small map and win through elimination in under 200 turns, and I'm a complete noob at this point), but it's by no means limiting strategy or creating pressure. Thirdly, every faction ingame so far (Wild Walkers, Vaulters, Necrophages, Broken Lords, and soon the Cultists of the Endless) is very unique. They have both positive and negative traits, which usually work to somewhat even eachother out. For example, Necrophages have decreased food gain, but they can turn corpses into stockpiles of food; Broken Lords use Dust to heal instead of food, and in turn gain increased Dust production.\nOn another hand, combat in this game is no AoW3, and it is somewhat repetetive, however, the ability to manually adjust your battle formation is something really cool. First of all, it allows you to better organize your units for either an increased success rate or survival rate or both. Secondly, it makes the game more challenging if you don't know what you're doing or if you don't know what type of enemy you're facing or the type you're good against. In multiplayer when it's released, two people customizing layouts will be doubly intriguing as they'll have to both predict what the enemy does and what they should do to counter it. On top of that, simply, it adds more graphic options. In auto battling you'll miss your giant demon unfurling his wings, jumping onto the foe, and slamming his giant axe into some poor flying unit's face. Another reason I find this manual adjustment cool is that, similar to armor and weapon changes, it lets you feel like you're in more control of the game. I mean, you are the battle leader right? So you should be able to, let's say... actually lead the battle, right? In Endless Legend, you can.\nI'd like to edit this review in order to post about some concerns I've been reading about. Some people are very unsatisfied with how diplomacy currently is (posted as of 6/15/14) and are trying to use this as a major factor in order to downplay how good this game is. The game is currently in Alpha testing and as such does not feature everything it will have upon release. The AI will be sure to improve (for anybody who seems unable to find this information, based on my experiences, the AI are overall a little bit silly. The first game or two you might get demolished when you just meet two people and they both declare war on you, but not eachother, however, once you see how the bots use an entirely militaristic route with mediocre strategies, you'll be fine against them.). Another complaint is the difficulty of the AI, there is currently only one AI setting, Alpha, and this will of course evolve into more and more difficulties when the developers want to focus on that instead of the founddation of the game. Also, this game is intended to be a multiplayer game, and people are (usually) more strategic than bots, which will immensely ramp up the difficulty of the game. Another concern, in the form of a question, I've been hearing is about how long turns are. As I mentioned, this is a fairly fast-paced 4x, and to go with how fast you might go, the AI are not slow at calculating what they'll do this turn and next. I can't give an exact time for how long they plan, but it felt shorter than Civ 5 to me. If anybody has concerns or questions feel free to ask me below and if Steam gives me that notification, I'll be sure to respond.\nOverall, I'd give this game so far an 8/10, and unless the developers do something stupid, it'll be a 9 at least upon release. The developers are working with the community to make the game better (in fact right now they just concluded a player-made Faction contest, go Cultists!) and they seem to be listening to the player's feedback, complaints and all. If you're into 4x games, I would say you should give this game a chance. Or two. Maybe three, third time's a charm. Though 4th is no less fun.

Endless Legend plays off an randomy generated  map world a la Civilization. Currently there's 4 different factions inside the game.

It would seem as though all the factions start off with 1 major and 1 minor perk along with a few pre-researched techs and a few basic units. Ofcouse, all of this is different for each of the 4 factions currently present.\n\nThe game play map is fully relealized filled with interesting zones that influnce your city building ways.

You develop your civilization through a tech tree, update your cities with buildings, and build armies for exploration and extermination. Armies in this case are more hero and item driven than Civ. Similar to say, Fallen Enchantress, you develop heroes and units with weapons, armor, and trinkets, which can be found in the world, aqcuired through quests, or created in a city. This all feels good, but it's not what keeps me playing Endless Legend.\n\nI find the world building in Enless Legend to be supurb. Here's why:\nEvery faction is unique. Each one of them has it's own back story, and purpose for being on this world. Each unit has back story which explains why it has the abilities it has, and often why it looks the way it does. A campaign has been built for each faction to provide a steady drip of objectives and story to go with it. Also, each faction plays quite differently from the next by having different strengths and resource needs.\nThe look of the game is striking. It's the type of game you could buy based on the sole belief that it is an interactive and evolving piece of visual art. The color pallet, unit and city design, and way the topography of the map is depicted is beautiful.\nThe soundtrack is quite nice. Again, the factions have a unique feel and tone articulated in the ambient music. This does a great job of pulling you into the world.\nFinally the UI. It may be the best I have ever used in a turn based strategy game. The overall design is greyscale and filled with very clear icons. Color is used to great effect to represent resources, factions, regions of the screen, and actions which can be done with the mouse pointer on specific objects. Everything is meticulously and clearly described through tool tips, and the UI can be collapsed and expanded in several ways. The tech tree, which is more like tech pools, where you research so many from Age 1 to move on to Age 2 is a great addition to the genre. The diplomacy screen is split into a semi-circle, which radiates outward. Depending on your standing with an opponent they will physically be closer or further away from you, and spaced relatively to their own allies or enemies.\nThere are a couple places I could see improvement in this game, and it would be easy to do in an expandion.\nThe first is the combat. The way "combat mode" is integrated with the living world is great, but I wish I had a little more control over my individual units. Some uniqe skills which I can choose from and actively use would draw me into the world even more. They do a great job integrating every unit into the world and a few unique skills and art to go with it would be great. There is always the option to automate or spectate the battle, and I often feel like manually controlling a battle, and spectating it is about the same thing.\nThe next is a small hickup in usability and it only stands out because everything else is so fluid. Adding a created unit to a nearby army stack. It appears you have to put the new unit into an army to leave the city, and then walk it to the stack. Sometimes this can be done by selecting the unit, and right clicking the stack. Othertimes it doesn't work. I have wasted many movement turns trying to get this accomplished.\nIf you are looking for a great turn based strategy game set in a fantasy/sci-fi world I would highly recommend Endless Legend.","November 3, 2014","true","34.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The beginning game is a lot of fun (if somewhat daunting for newbies), but the game starts to bog down in the late game. The problem is that the challenges don't scale as you level up, so combat becomes inconsequential, and the game goes from being a fun turn based strategy game into an excruciatingly boring "resource management" chore.\n\nMaster of Magic struck the right balance, with high level enemies and challenges to keep the player engaged. Once you've reached a high enough level in Endless Legend, there is little reason to move your armies around the map, and the game devolves into just allocating your city populations between resource priorities.\n\nStill a very good game, if you love spreadsheets.","August 15, 2015","false","40.3"," 91 of 157 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","91","157","3","0"

This is the game to beat Civilization. I've put only a decent amount of time into Civ V and am by no means excellent at the game, but have extensive experience with it. This game simply trumps Civ V in almost every category I can think of. The two biggest improvement are the minor factions compared to barbarians and the combat system. Both are much more in-depth and have nice interactions. In Civ V for barbarians you simply stack units and win, but Endless Legend, while has that option, you can conduct diplomacy, bribe them, or attack them. The combat system is by far the biggest advantage over Civ V. You don't simply stack units. You have to strategically and constantly reposition your units. You have to customize your units to beat specific enemies.

In Civ V I would get bored with nothing really to do while waiting for research to finish and things to build. Just Next Turn until something happened. So much more going on here with EL:\n\nGreat Quest system that keeps things interesting with many different quest types - including a Quest victory condition.\nFactions that are much different from each other. Or customize your own.\nMultiple different ways to upgrade and tailor your individual units with gear - some of which are quest rewards. Another good use of strat resources too.\nAddition of luxury resources you can accumulate and fire off for multiple diffferent boosters.\nThe minor factions are such an improvement over the Civ Barbarians. You can get quests to pacify them, or you can bribe or crush them. The Cultists main faction actually depend on converting them for troops since they are a single-city faction. However, they are not nearly as involved as Civ's City-States. No such equivalent exists in EL.\nThe tech system is much better. Pick any tech within an era -- you do not have to follow the 'railroad.'\nI like the Empire Plan much more than Civ's Social Policies. More flexible and can be changed to react to your game.\nAbsolutley gorgeous game map with a great soundtrack. I love the UI in this game too.\nMoving multiple unit armies in Civ V was such a chore due to one unit per tile. In EL, the army stacks, but the separate tactical combat mode then changes to one per tile. Plus you can auto-resolve impending facerolls. Your's or their's.\nA truly great 4X game. Do not hesitate to buy it you are fan of the genre.","January 18","true","72.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

You can't just ignore subsystems you don't normally focus on - you'll have to become familiar with the diplomacy system and upgrade your units manually and consider each of these choices in detail. So if you're used to relying on a automated manager system for some of those mechanics, you'll be in for a rude awakening -- because there either isn't one, or the AI isn't very good -- but one that'll make you a better player even as you're having fun failing.\n\nif you want a fantasy-setting 4X game that's a little leaner and a lot sharper, pick it up.

The asthetics are amazing and the lore and storytelling is far and above the competition.\nHowever there are several mechanics i don't like that actually manage to make me hate the game dispite all its good points. Examples would be the terribly implemented combat, where you assign orders before the turn. This is stupid as when the AI moves before you (different units act faster than others), all your strategy becomes pointless. Its a sort of 'guess what the opponent will do' mechanic similar to endless space, but a lot more frustrating.\nThen there is the occupy-a-region mechanic. On paper it sounds good, but there are times where it will annoy you to no end. This game requires large investments for a city to make a settler, and if you are one turn away from placing your settler on your chosen spot ant then bam an opponent has settled the opposite end of the region and all your effort is up in smoke.\nThere is also an impression that this game was released once all the features were ticked off as complete and bug free (which tbf they are), but that the devs skipped over the polish stage. At the end of combat all units still waiting to move have co 'cycle' a do-nothing action. When building a settler all population you assign to food have to be moved out (you cannot produce food when building a settler) and then back on completion, manually. And so on.\nIn short, this is a very well made game, but just isnt for me. However it is extremely deep and different to most of the genre (especially civ), so if you are looking for that go ahead.","May 2","false","18.5"," 39 of 63 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","39","63","0","0"

I have chatted with the devs and other EL players with great response.\n\nWith the backing of a great team emerges a fantastic game, Endless Legend.\nThis 4X turn-based fantasy strategy is the best of it's kind. EL has set the water mark standard.\n\nFrom the 11 factions that have fantasic stories behind them. To the rich music, sharp graphics, beautiful intros and deep skill tree. EL is the best!\n\nAny Gripes?\nYeah, minor gripes....\nFirst off, you cannot rotate the camera to look at the land. The camera will only allow a "Pan to the left" and "Pan to the right" There is no looking at the situation freely and it does cause a gripe. I just wish they would fix that!\n\nWinter is coming. This is a gripe the devs intentionally placed in the game and it's the change of seasons. When winter hits.... IT HITS! Everything slows down. Production, movement and the price of things go up. Food and profit drop. Population will starve and die. It really makes one dread winter. So should the devs change this? Heck no! It adds character to the game because it will cause a player to really play your moves right on minimal resources and movement. (Don't leave your troops to far away from shelter)\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DESTINY. okay fight. The battles scenes are kinda weak and leave much to desire. Like the camera limitation, I just wish there was more to the battles and even throw in a troop cheer at the end of a victory. After all the planning, after all the building, thats the outcome when they battle? Again, a minor gripe.\n\nWow the clock is slow man.....Yeah like any 4x strategy game it is slow going so be aware. If you are unable to deal with thinking games, go play GTA or something to hold your attention.\n\nNone of these gripes put the game down enough to not recommend.\n\nYES, I do recommend Endless Legend and YES get all the DLC's and YES goto AMPLITUDE Studios web site to be in touch with the devs.\n\nDon't forget Dungeon of the Endless made by the same people!

When I first learned this was an indie game I was blown away. It is better than most AAA I have seen. It's graphics are simply beautiful! It's gameplay is addicting on the same level as Civ! It's lore is compelling! Everything about this game will pull you in and before you know it, you are hooked! "How does this compared to Civilization though?" I hear you ask, "It looks like a copy cat to me!" I hear you cry. But that simply isn't so! Here's a quick comparison.\n\nCivlization V:\n1 unit per tile\nExpanding borders worked by citizens and improved by workers\nTwo diplomatic stances; war and peace\nSpecial units that quickly go obsolete\nForced to get all technologys, even ones you probably won't use, just to progress\n\nEndless Legend:\n1 party per tile. Under normal circumstances, 4-8 units in a single party\nStatic borders and can only work tiles surrounding your city. Citizens act as multipliers. Can extend city's reach within borders.\nFour diplomatic stances; war, cold war, peace, and aliance.\nUnits don't go obsolete. Instead you can give them better equipment.\nTech web that doesn't force you to get all the techs. Only x amount to reach the next era. Meaning it's very possible to only get the one's you will actually use.\n\nAll and all, I am not saying Civilization is a bad game. I infact, still play it time to time and enjoy it's historical setting. However, I think it could learn a lot from this game. Endless Legend does it's own thing. Worth every penny you spend.\nThere is most deffinitly room for improvement. I think the game could highly benifet from extending naval aspects of the game. And like most games, there are bugs. My final verdict, I give it a 9/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatiel/recommended/289130/","Nosferatiel","Nosferatiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nosferatiel/","377 products in account","Endless Legend (EL) is a very ambitious simultaneously turn based new 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) strategy game in a fantasy setting by Amplitude studios (Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless). The general setting is unusual, as you're stranded on the planet Auriga that has been a favoured laboratory of a powerful precursor race, the Endless, until they erased themselves from existence in a large civil war.\nNow, you take control of one out of 8 standard factions or any custom faction you create in an editor, using the basic gameplay of one of the 8 with some modifiers. Your goal is to survive as Auriga is slowly drifting towards an everlasting winter that will snuff out all life left on its surface. There are several victory conditions you can fulfill, ranging from "bucket"-type conditions like gathering enough currency or being the highest in score at a configurable turn limit to fulfilling a quest and building an expensive wonder, exterminating all concurrents or researching yourself to victory. Not all of these victory conditions are equally fun to reach as "filling a bucket" can be quite tedious, but the different factions are also specialised at reaching different victory conditions.\nAnd this is where EL is ambitious in the sense that its 8 factions are very asymmetrically designed:\n- The Wild Walkers are the not so usual Elves of the game, using woods to boost their industrial proficiency. They get to be the production powerhouse of the game.\n- The Vaulters are the survivors of the Dungeon of the Endless game, stranded on the planet. Hightech-dwarfs of a sort with heavy armor and the best science output.\n- The Rowing Clans are supposed to be the traders of the planet. They cannot declare war, are better than the NSA at finding out who's selling or buying what to a common marketplace you can get access to by research, and can actually even trade-ban people, bleeding them dry, economically.\n- The Drakken are the peacekeepers, a draconid race interested in achieving diplomatic victory by using their influence to force whole empires into peace or alliance with them.\n- The Ardent Mages can use spells on the map and in combat. Given enough currency, a weak army of them can still beat a superior foe with enough magic support fire.\n- The Necrophage do not do anything but feed, war and reproduce. Peace is not an option, as is not conquering. The Zergs of the planet, indeed.\n- The Broken Lords are living armors thinking of themselves as paladins and leeching life like vampires. Lorewise, one of my favourites, their gameplay is centered on currency to buy population with.\n- The Cultists of the Eternal End have only one city and expand by converting minor faction villages across the planet to generate troops for them and to harvest resources for them.\n\nIn general, this asymmetry is what makes the game nice, but it is also its vulnerability. As each faction plays differently, the AI also has to account for that. During the Early Access phase, the AI made huge jumps and has become a threat to the unwary at higher difficulty levels, now, but still fails in the endgame. It doesn't recognize that, given it is close to winning, the human player in the game will go to lengths to eradicate them. On the other hand, in the beginning, different AI personalities shine through. Around the Ardent Mages, there's always a lot of scorched earth destroyed minor faction villages, while Wild Walkers spread and pacify, instead. I'm quite confident that this will improve, further, but I rate what's present, now.\nTherefore I downright recommend to play this game in multiplayer. The simultaneous turns allow for fast games, compared to other titles. You can set turn timers and therefore force people to be fast, or give each and everyone as much time as they want, but a long game would last 4 hours, at most, on fast speed settings.\nEven there, though, the asymmetry of the game design has its dangers. You can equip your units with better and better equipment through the ages, having to use strategic resources on the map to get the very best, but there's a clear preference for some attributes being far better than others. Some units you gain by assimilating minor factions (you can then build their units and get some bonus per controlled village of that faction) are better than standard units and certainly better than most other units on the planet. I'm thinking of e.g. Kazanjii demons or Haunts of the Ended here, both having a chain hit special ability.\nOne thing I have to add about the techtree: It is not linear, there's no clear progression. In each "era", you have to choose at least x technologies, then you progress to the next era. Each time you research something, the cost for the next research increases, no matter the era its out of.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of depth for someone who favours empire management over combat. There's still lots of balancing and AI-tuning to do, but the game is fun and I recommend it.","September 18, 2014","true","48.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I had fun with Warlock: Master of the Arcane and stumbled with Heroes of Might and Magic. I was appealed but bored by Age of Wonders III, but this Endless Legend...\n\nI went straight in without going into the tutorial first. Exploring this wonderfully complex ressource and economics system that is untypical for this genre of Fantasy 4X allows a play style for everyone - which leads to war being the faster and in early difficulties the more viable solution. However, war is not always the same. While each factions is pretty much unique and has access to their very own units, minor factions and tribes can be indoctrinated to fill the roles you need. Which is awesome. Endless Legend gives freedom to the player and I commend this game for this bold, but very well executed move.\n\nEndless Legend does a lot of stuff right. It has its minor mistakes, for example: You can have multiple AoW-styled battles going at the same time, but you can't properly move two armies the same path. Moving units out of cities required one button click too much - and sometimes they leave by accident. But these minor complaints from my side cannot possibly compare to the gorgeous experience, lore and mashup Endless Legends provides.

The world art has a "Game of Thrones" feel to it.. and it isn't over done. Seems to fit well and looks great.\n\nCons:\n\n-Pacing. The game is incredibly slow. I have started a few games and other factions pretty much never attack. On top of that it is difficult to ramp up your economy to field an army. I found my self restarting or quiting games because my one and only Army would get wiped out by neutrals (which are very aggressive).\n\n-Unit Variety. Each faction gets 3 units. Sure you can create and upgrade units but they all look the same and only vary slightly. Compare this to the unit creation in Fallen Enchantress (for example) where you can make virtually any unit you wanted AND change the colors of their clothing. Also there only seems to be "damage" not broken down to different types (fire, shock, cold, etc).... in fact the entire unit creation seemed very tacked on and shallow.\n\n-Bugs. Lots and lots and lots of crashing. Especially after about 30 turns or so. The long a game is the more frequent crashes occur.\n\nIn conclusion the game has an amazing world and some good art direction but the game play is fairly pedestrian. The AI seems weak and bland, with aggressive factions just wondering around (seriously even the corspe-eaters didn't attack). The more I played the more I found myself just playing to see how I could build up a city or exploit a resource... or just explore the world while my neighbors just flounder around.

This is a gem in the making, it has become one of my favorites in my library.\n\nI have played a full session of Endless Legend. The game is pretty far ahead for its early access tag (wish others would follow their example).\n\nThe game is still buggy here and there, but most issues can be corrected by reloading when they happen. I have played only the Broken Lords faction, but fought against all others in the same session (4 out of 8 available for now), went epic with a large scale map. I enjoyed the mission structure in this game, it can be ignored, but if you dive into it you will earn serious rewards (main quests in particular) and learn a little more of the lore. The story of my character for the Broken lords is actually well written, I wished there would be a little more to it as it caught my attention and imagination as it is mostly original which is rare now days.\n\nGameplay is fun and has a dinamic feel to it despite its turn based structure. Army deployment for each battle gives a nice touch as pieces of the board spread to fill the section of the battlefield, battles play out as expected but are more tactical (which in my opinion is great), leaving strategy to the empire portion of the game.\n\nThere is a summer and winter season. During winter your troops and empire struggle until the next summer season, making managing resources important as they are more limited. Fraquinly this creates some elaborate strategies as you need to prepare for winter and try to advance during summer when troops can see and walk farther per turn, you can push thru during winter, but it can be challenging getting back to defend a point if needed.\n\nMinor factions can be assimilated and there are a lot of them already (there seems to be more coming, hopefully a lot  more as I got spoiled by them and need more!), they add a lot of flavor to a session and are very different one from another (lore/looks wise, unique units will fall into infantry, cavalry, support, ranged or flying). Loved this concept and is the first time I see minor factions in a game like this one working the way they do, they are more than just background, some territoies need to be taken from them by force and they do put up a nice fight or you can negotiate peace and solve issues via quest or the good old captalism bribe, dealing with them in battle can sometimes be difficult, which is awesome for the small challenge they present aside from the main empires (its possible to completely crush your opposition if you are like me, playing to become "ultimate", but its a lot of turns and by then nobody will mess with you!).\n\nDiplomacy does not seem to be working well yet (seems not to respond most times aside from declaration of war and close/open borders), which is a pitty, but again the game is barely out and we already got some decent patches to address some problems, my guess is that diplomacy fix will follow soon.\n\nThe experience was so good that I decided that they have earned my time and a positive review from me, in all honesty I did not expect such a great game. If you have played Endless Space, I must say I enjoyed Endless Legend a lot more, a lot more indeed.\n\nI will give a few days for next patch and try another session, the game is really addicting to me under the one more turn syndrome.\n\nIf you have the time and want to try / create an incentive for something different, then by all means give this one a chance, it still needs a lot of things which are not available yet, so keep this in mind. Still its amazing how far along this game is.","May 3, 2014","true","59.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It has taken everything the developers did right with their previous attempt, Endless Space and mixed with the best parts of Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic. While the game isn’t perfect, there’s very few things that can’t be fixed with patches and what is there now is absolutely amazing (and super addictive).\n\nThere is one small exception that might turn a lot of people off so I’ll get that out of the way first:\n“Spreadsheeting”\n\nLarge aspects of the game does in many ways rely on you looking at various numbers and trying to make the right numbers bigger. This is a turn off to a lot of people but I think it works well particularly as which number you are trying to make bigger can change drastically from each play through based on current circumstance and race selection (more on this later). But, you can’t deny the fact that the glitz and glamour of the graphics and the great flavour of the game simply hide a form of database management. FYI, that is totally, leaning towards unjustifiably harsh phrasing but a good summary of what you’ll be doing from mid-game onwards.\n\nBut, you still love every moment of it.\n\nWhy?\n\n1)	Fantastic Flavour\n\nThe story, the art, the settings and the music all come together in a fantastic way to make Endless Legend have a world that is both interesting to explore and “live in”. In particular, each of the factions have extremely distinct visual styles, units and play styles that really make you want to experience the game through each of their eyes. Add to that a reasonably interesting quest chain unique to each faction, and you have a lot to grab your attention for the first many playthroughs.\n\n2)	Great Gameplay\n\nQuips about spreadsheet simulation aside, the game dresses up the numbers enough so you won’t feel it unless you really hate numbers in your games. Otherwise, you’ll be quite happily:\n- swapping people through the five different production (Food, Industry, Dust/aka Wealth, Science, Influence) types and managing construction queues trying to optimise each cities outputs to match your current objectives;\n-	Producing enough Influence (while still trying to maximise other outputs) so you have enough to buy bonuses when you have a chance to change your 20-year empire plan;\n-	While also using that same resource to bargain for peace and technology from enemies;\n-	Fiddling with the equipment load-outs of your heroes and infantry units making sure you have the optimal balance of damage, skill, speed and defense;\n-	While also making sure you’re not sacrificing better special abilities in favour of better stats;\n-	Trying to figure out  which minor AI faction would be optimal to incorporate into your empire for the best passive bonuses vs which factions give you better mercenary units;\n-	Working out how to get elevation bonus during the actual battles and trying to get your hero in range for the point blank bonus without coping a poisoned hit from a –GAH, THIS GAME!!\n\n3)	Compelling Campaigns\n\nA follow up from point 1 is the play styles of the playable faction. As mentioned before, most of them play significantly differently so the game always stays fresh. There’s a faction that doesn’t produce food but instead consumes wealth to grow and heal. There’s another where you flat out can’t declare war but you can ban people from using the global market restricting them from buying/selling resources or recruiting heroes. There’s another which is the only one that allows you to cast spells on the global map while another will only allow you to have ONE city the entire game. Though these seem like the extremes, even the ‘somewhat’ more normal factions such Vaulters or Necrophages have strange and interesting quirks (holy resource vs corpse consumption) that make small but interesting and important changes to their gameplay.\n\nBut this game is still far from perfect. On top of the spreadsheeting problem mentioned earlier, this game still has a very steep learning curve and a tutorial that explains very little beyond the basics of gameplay. For example, only during my third of fourth play through during the early access period did I figure out how to trade with other empires. Another example is the aforementioned Vaulters with their holy resource. I had to google what that implied as nowhere in the game was I clearly told what it was, what it did and why I was an idiot for trying to play the campaign without selecting a holy resource (and how to do that!). The game also crashed at least 1-2x each play through but this as well as some of the problems I mentioned can and hopefully will be patched over time.\n\nAll in all, this game is fun, flavourful and addictive as all hell and I very highly encourage fans of the 4x/”grand strategy” to check it out. Just make sure you don’t have anything important to do anytime soon…\n","September 23, 2014","true","51.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

And since this is a turn-based 4x strategy game with a fantasy theme, I'm going to compare to others like Age of Wonders and Elemental.  Endless Legend gives a lot of variety in choices for progression and andvancing your faction.  I really like that city expansion is a planned purposeful event.  Not, I crossed the influence threshold and POOF my city is twice as good as it was before.  Research is not as linear as Civ.  You have to research about half of a lower tier before the next higher tier opens, but you don't have to research them all.  There are only a few unit designs available, infantry, ranged, cavalry, support,  buy you can change up there gear and they get much more powerful.  I haven't decided if I like combat yet.  The game is not as combat focused as AoW so you don't have complete control.  Each turn you give your units a plan and the AI executes.  I haven't played any other games like this so I'm still ambiguous on this piece.  But they did a nice job balancing granular control with avoiding tedious end-game management.  You can que up your production and movement and research and then just keep an eye on it.  The game give good alerting and you can use the alerts to access the management panels you need.  Which is good, because there are a lot of them.\nIf you like the 4x Turn games you will want to give this one a try.  Its different enough that you won't feel you've played it before.  If you are more the fast-paced RTS strat gamer, you won't like this.  Hope this helps!","September 22, 2014","true","65.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It is far more than that, however. The game mechanics can at first seem a little daunting to get into, and the first time I tried it I uninstalled the game not long after starting because there really isn't much of a tutorial to speak of (at least there wasn't back then). A few hours in, however, and I was completely hooked.\n\nEach faction plays the game in a very different fashion, making replaying the game several times pretty much a necessity. The storylines of each faction are just okay, and the sudden 'jump' to the endgame missions (which are the same across the board) is a bit sudden. Nonetheless, the special abilities and units of the factions in addition to the victories which most suit them make up for the shortcomings.\n\nThe combat system is also pretty interesting, allowing you to win difficult battles on skill and positioning, while at the same time not making you suffer through whitewashes if you don't want to. A fantastic game overall, and I can't wait to try out the expansions I've just purchased to explore the new aspects of the game.","April 8","true","71.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

There is so much detail in every aspect of this game that it doesn't matter if you're looking at the map, a city overview menu or staring at a loading screen, you will have something beautiful to gaze at.\n\nThe game play is a fantastic blend of strategy games like the Civilization series and Lords of the Realm series. The map is laid out with hex-grid tiles filled with amazing beauty and detail. All having different qualities, terrain type, resources, anomalies and FIDS output (Food, Industry, Dust (money) and Science). Then the map is fractured into regions which, when settling a city, the player takes control of including any resources and Minor Factions that fall inside the regions borders. The Minor Factions are neutral creatures that, if left unchecked, will gain in strength and launch attacks on anyone near by. These factions can be attacked, bought out or parlayed with in order to pacify them. The player can then assimilate the faction of that region to gain useful bonuses to their empire.\n\nCombat goes beyond the Civilization unit verses unit battles. Combat is played out in a hex-grid turn based mini game inside the actual game itself. Allowing for far greater strategy involved in the battles, as a weaker army may lure a stronger army into terrain that will be an advantage for them.\n\nThere are other aspects and features in Endless Legend that are pretty much on par with other games of this nature, building structures in cities needs little explaination, as does researching new technologies. Though one very interesting feature is the way cities 'grow'. The player is able to chose where to build expansions to their cities by building a certain structure. The area gained by the completion adding to the cities over all FIDS output.\n\nThen you have the different Races. If you have at all played Amplitude Studios other great strategy Endless Space, you will undoubtably know they have a knack for creating fantastic and interesting Races, with different strengths, weaknesses, play styles and stories. Endless Legend goes a step further, with some Races having entirely unique playstyles to others. For example, one such faction has no food output what so ever, instead Dust (or money) is used to 'buy' population for their cities. Slow at first, but an economic player will find that they can quickly become very industrious. Then there is a Race that CANNOT be at peace with anyone. They can remain in the 'cold-war' state OR go to war with everyone they meet because their units gain strength and power the more players you are at war with.\n\nNeedless to say, i was amazed with Endless Legend. For the price you can not go wrong, assuming you are into turn based strategy games. It is beautiful. It is different and feels unique. It is easily worth every single cent it's modestly asking for.\n\nEndless Legend.

You start out with military units, a settler, and explore your surroundings to find if it is suitable for the cornerstorne of your future empire.\nLike Civilization, if it is not to your taste, you might want to start over. One minor complaint here : there is no “regenerate world” feature.\nUnlike Civilization though,  you won’t battle for borders. Why so ?\nBecause here you own one region (the map is divided in a number of regions depending on its size) of the map by having a sole city in it.\nThe catch is that you can only have one city in a region. A nice tweak, inducing interesting aspects :\n- You don't need tons of cities, an empire with four regions is already considerable, wich makes the game more streamlined, but not less rich in possibilities.\n- More than ever, you need to colonize fast and carefully. Sometimes, it will be be better just to leave alone a region.\n- Cities can grow. At the beginning, they only take the six hexes surrounding them, but you can build districts on one hex to exploit up to three more hexes. So it can be a decent tradeoff to colonize a barely average spot in order to grow to better but “badly” placed spots. You will find a wide array of anomalies, grantind diverse bonuses.\n\nThe base ressources are the same as in Endless Space : FIDS (Food, Industry, Dust, Science) where the dust is like gold, only with mystical properties.\nIn Civilization, you use your units of population to exploit tiles or to become specialists.\nHere, the system is different and, in my humble opinion, more interesting : you can allocate any number of population to one of the FIDS, in order to boost its output.\nOf course, various buildings will enhance the FIDS production, giving greater bonuses.\nIt allows you to perfectly balance the production for the current needs, on a macro or micro scale\nWhen you start, you will be interested in a quick population growth, if you’re at war, boosting the industry might be needed, if one of your cities becomes idle for a lack of interesting things to produce, why not allocating most of the citizens to produce dust, or influence ?\n\nThe thing is that influence can't exactly be harvested and only be gained via buildings and some quests.\nInfluence dictates what you can do in two ways : diplomacy and empire plans.\nEvery diplomatic action (treaties, technologies exchange, trading...) requires influence points to be done. So no nasty stuff like capturing a city very early game, you must have enough influence to declare war.\nAnd if you feel like accepting a truce just to viciously attack again, know that the cost in influence will go up the roof !\nSo, you need to think carefully about spending your precious influence, wich is not as easily\ngained as FIDS, but not less precious.\nWhat about the empire plan ? It is a bonus, that can be decided every 20 turns (on a normal speed game) in one to four disctint areas.\nFor example, the first bonus in the economic area grants +3 dust for each population unit. Of course, the more advanced the bonus and the more bonuses you choose, the more influence points you have to spend.\nIt’s not permanent- you can change each time, and might have to because the cost goes up and must paid again if you want to keep the boosts.\nIt allows a nice flexibility (having +4 movements obviously helps in time of war !), wich makes up for the absence of an Ideology feature.\n\nEndless Legend also shows its fantasy side with the quests. It is a nice touch, each faction having its own main quest, with background and rewards each time you complete a step. The different factions are nicely differenciated, be it “RP” and “GP : the Broken Lords are souls living on in suits of armor, vying to find a more noble purpose than to feed on mortals, they do not need normal food anc produce more dust than others (the only way to make their population grow is to spend dust), the Wildwalkers are  tribes united in organic-like cities, able to sense any ennemy in their regions, the Roving Clans cannot declare war, but have trading buffs and can use privateers to attack others, unbeknownst to them, etc.\nThe custom faction feature is not implemented yet, but the seven factions available are enjoyable.\nFor now, I would just say the Necrophages may be weaker thant the rest (-1 food on every hex doesn’t help) and the Drakken are a bit overpowered, with an easy way to the Diplomatic victory.\nWhile I’m at it, the victory conditions are the usual ones - wonder, science, conquest, domination, economical.\nIn addition to main quests, you can discover sidequests by exploring ruins on the map, with various benefits, like luxury ressources (spending a certain number of it gives a temporary boost to your whole empire), dust, equipment.\n\nThe heroes are back, and most useful to lead armies. No gigantic battles : you cannot design units, each faction has no more than 4 unit types, and the maximum number of units in one army is 8- and you can only achieve that late game !\nSo, early on, two armies of four units each is a serious threat. I found the battle long and boring, the autoresolve works fine most of the time.\nJust be wary not to engage a battle in a difficult spot, like down a cliff...\nHeroes can also  beappointed as governors, wichever you choose, they will gain XP, levels and abilities to make them better warleader or city managers (bonus for units’ defense, boost in industry production...).\nPacifists  will strive to keep a decent army : roving armies are loose, threatening cities. As bribing minor faction villages becomes costy, one solution is to just raze them, then rebuild to get +1 population, and if you assimilate them (through influence points), you will get their unique unit and a special bonus.\nEach region can have between one and three minor faction villages, and it’s useful to deal with the ones just outside your borders, the longer they stay unchecked, the more dangereous they are.\n\nOne last “big” thing in EL is seasons. Summer is the “normal” season, while during winter, food and dust production are crippled, industry is slightly paralyzed, people are less happy, movement and vision on the map are greatly reduced.\nYou only have a rough indication as to when the season switch will happen, but this must be\nfactored in : if you’re planning a war, doing so in winter will be rather... Unpleasant.\n\nWell, I think that covers most of it. You can see the lacking parts (two technological eras are lacking) but you have the main meat.\nOf course, there are problems. Early game, you can only have few influence points.\nLuxury ressources aren’t such a big deal. Mayhap too many technologies are devoted to gear (4 for each era) knowing that their impact is far less noticeable than, for example, having +2 slots in your armies.\nFor now, my main gripe would be with the AI. I know it’s in development, but after seeing ES' AI in action I am a bit worried.\nOn normal difficulty you stomp your foes, and even on hard the AI is fairly incompetent : slow to colonize, quite behind technology-wise, having troubles fending off the roving armies in its regions, most of the time unable to muster serious forces...\nPlus, witnessing cities placed in a corner of a region  or in mediocre spots is a bit jarring.\n\nWell ! I have to thank  you if you kept reading till this point, if you are still on the fence, I do not know what to write. EL, albeit not totally complete as of now, is a very solid 4X with some really interesting twists for the genre.\nI would say it is superior to ES, wich I find enjoyable but bland compared to Galactic Civilizations II.","September 7, 2014","true","165.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/recommended/289130/","TormakSaber","[LUE] TormakSaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/","509 products in account","After the disappointment for me thta was Endless Space, I picked up Endless Legend with a  bit of trepidation: I had picked up a lot of fantasy 4x games recently (Eador, Age of Wonders 3, Warlock 1 and 2, there's been a lot lately...), but I'd heard great things about Endless Legend. Plus it was on sale.\n\nGlad I picked it up. It's easily been the bes tof the lot for me, and a lot of my issues with Endless Space are either not present or solved here.\n\nEndless Legend is a fantasy 4x game where you play as one of 8 distinctly different playing races, trying to complete one of many victory styles (Score, Economic, Diplomatic, Science, Supremacy, Elimination, Expansion, Wonder). Each race has its own array of traits and units, and you can also make Custom Races based on the foundation of one of the main races, creating something you'd enjoy playing the most. The races range from diplomatic Drakken (dragon people who can enforce diplomatic treatises), to fast expanding Zerg style bug-men (unable to use diplomacy, Cold War is the best you cna hope for), to Broken Lords (who dont't use food, instead using Dust [Gold] to create new population and heal units!), to the Cultists of the Eternal End (who are a "Single City Challenge" civ, unable to settle new cities, but can convert minor civs [city-states, for civ 5 players] to their cause, creating more worked tiles and free units.)\n\nThe game plays out like most 4x games, on an overworld map, where you deal with thing slike happiness, luxury and strategic resources, making new towns, researching tech, exploring, etc. Endless Legend adds heroes to the mix, which do the usual things you'd expect. They can be made governors of cities, or generals of armies, and will level upa and learn skills to make them better at these things. Endless Legend also uses "Regions" to compartmentalize the map and show where you can place cities. Since only one city can be in a region, you find yourself competing for distinct places on the map, rather than a nebulous "this area by the iron and 2 diamonds". It lends theme to the game. Cities also develop interestingly: Rather than a simple influence array that increases, you build physical additions to your city, Boroughs, that will expand the circle of worked tiles. A larger city actually takes up half a dozen tiles or more on the map, which give sit a pysical presence, both out of combat and in combat (more on this in a bit). Building tightly packed cities also levels up your districts, making your cities happier and even more efficient. You cna also find special ruins around the mpas thta will give you quests to perform, giving direction to your expansion actions, and rewarding you for completing them. Minor civs also give quests as one way to pacify them, the other methods being bribing with money, ror simply defeating them.\n\nCombat in the game plays out like a middle ground of Age of Wonders/HoMM and Civ. Your armies enter battle, you cna give commands, but your units will perform the command sthemselves, moving and positioning how they please and then firing. Their AI takes over via a player-set stance (Aggressive, Defensive, Hold Ground) if your desired action can't be performed.  The AI is competent in this, and generally tries to keep ranged units in cover and uphill, and flanks and surrounds with melee units, buffing with support units. A human can generally do better, of course, but the AI is good enough to where you never feel like you need to really worry, which is nice. Auto-resolve is also there, of course. A neat thing I enjoyed aobut the combat is that the battlemap is actually the overworld map itself, overlaid into a combat grid, meaning a chokepoint or defensible area on the overworldmap is actually a chokepoint in battle.\n\nTalking about combat leads into units... Eahc civilization has three units, but each unit can be equpped with several types of weapon, armor, and accessories, allowing you to customize counter units as needed. Strategic resources are used to create extra-powerful, specialized weapons and armor at the cost of consuming these resources for your elite units.  Minor Civs (city states) can be assimilated into your empire to allow you to create their unit as well, like axe weilding minotaurs, spear using centaurs, chain lightning blasting Haunts, and massive skeletal demons. You can also purchase mercenaries from the marketplace from other civs: Any unit you disband or sell actually oes to the market, where it can be bought by any other player in the game. Unfortunately the marketplace is EXTREMELY expensive for units and heroes, and I found that unless I was playing the trade focused Roving Clans or the money-loving Broken Lords, I mostly ignored the market.\n\nVictory Conditions are hit or miss for me. Most of the non-combat ones feel "boring".\n-Score is score. Highest wins.\n-Diplomacy simply relies on an invisible "diplomacy points" counter, where you get extra points for being at peace or an alliance. There's no United Nations, no Apostolic Palace, no civs to influence. It falls a bit short.\n-Economic victory is much the same - once a player passes a threashhold for total dust gathered across the entire game, they win. Nothing to do with trade routes or global markets or resources.\n-Science victory relies on researching 5 of the 6 "super techs" in the game. To be fair, not much else you can do with a science victory, especially when your "space race" victory style is tied up in...\n-Wonder victories. This is the hallmark victory of the game. Every race has a unique 8 part questline that,as you complete, gives you special race specific techs, unique buildings, hero items, and in some caes heroes themselves. When you complete the questline, you are able to build a unique Wonder that, when completed, gives you victory. Some questlines seem inherently easier to complete than others, and some come off as contradictory: For example, the Roving Clans, a race thta actually cannot declare war themselves (only defend) must conquer another city, often far away and already held by an opponent. You must then passive aggressively annoy the other civ into finally declaring war on you first. The Drakken, a race of peaceful lorekeepers, must also do the same, although here you cna at leats declare war yourself. These are a few small places where the lore of the game and the mechanics don't quite seem to mesh, and it's a shame, because a LOT of work clearly went into this victory.\n-Expansion victories rely on you colonizing a certain percentage of the entire map. I cannot possibly fathom doing this on even the middle sized maps, or rather: Cannot comprehend doing it without already having wiped out the entire rest of the game militarily. Your happiness would plummet so low it hardly seems worth it to expand that much.\n-The military victories are the usual lot. Supremacy is being the last civ with a Capital City, and Elimination is the complete destruction of all others.\n\nThings the game does not do well: Aside from the victories above, this game maintains a few of the Endless Space oddities that I dislike. Many diplomatic actions are tied up in the tech tree, taking up valuable science from researching thing slike, say, science boosts, or food, or dust, or strategic resource extractors. The market, both resource and unit (thye are separate techs) are also techs, and I find myself ignoring the market in almost eveyr game that I don't start with it as a free tech. It's a shame, really. I also do not often find myself researching the unique strategic resource weapons and armor techs unless I'm the Vaulters, a race that gets bonuses both to their collection, and for units using the Resource Weapons.\n\nI would, even with these minor complaints, recommend picking up the game for any fan of th 4x genre.","February 5, 2015","true","80.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/recommended/289130/","comradewinston","ComradeWinston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/","302 products in account","There isn't any way around it, this is a much more in-depth fantasy version of Civilization 5. Aside from all the depth and such, the setting feels far more fitting than the "insert X historical leader as the figurehead of X nation" of Civilization. The "world gets periodically buried in an ice age" lore simply works well, where that historical stuff is fun but wears quickly; at least in my experience. It generally helps the diversity of the world, factions, and even is a gameplay element with the onset of a punishing winter for elongated periods of time.\n\nCity placement isn't dictated by distance between cities but rather they're divided by generated provinces you can claim with a single city, entirely doing away with gamey nonsense and weird broken borders typical to Civ5. Technology is organic, only divided into tiers rather than mandatory lines of progress more like a loading bar as a manifestation of your needs. After having played a number of Paradox strategy games, I've come to appreciate a good UI and this game certainly isn't hard to navigate through; everything's where it should be, no hassle.\n\nDiplomacy isn't the typical limited rigid enemy/neutral/friendly set either. By default nations are in a state of "cold war" from which point they can either become friendly or fight their opposition's armies over control of neutral territory. You can also compliment and insult, among other things to decrease or increase the cost of certain types of diplomatic declarations and agreements. No longer are the days of "I really want to kill that guy's settler but I really don't want to declare war on him" as now you can simply slaughter them along with everything else.\n\nUnits are one of the finer points of this developer's games, at least compared to most generic units in strategy games. Each faction has three basic units but you can drastically alter them by creating(renaming kinda) a new unit with better equipment, along with any minor faction's units you pick up along the way. You could make your ranged units more durable than any generic mele unit, create a berserker unit, or even the most expensive upgraded thing you can get your hands on.\n\nHeroes play a role much like characters in more recent Total War games. They can be given the finest equipment your nation has like any unit and eventually level-up to be anything from a skilled administrator to a glorious commander through a very Total War-esq tree of passive boons. In battle, they also play a role as a most effective unit.\n\nFaction diversity's easily among the strongest features of this game, going against the current trend of making factions very much the same as each other. For instance, one of them can only build a single powerful city and subjugate distant minor faction villages which then occasionally supply that faction with free units. Another can only increase its population and heal units through using dust (magical money). The trader faction can even uproot its cities and set down somewhere else at will. This vast difference between factions is only further supplemented by the ability to create custom factions, with a limited point system providing you a series of boons along with crippling debuffs to choose from; ensuring balance.\n\nIf you've enjoyed Civilization, you'll probably find this game surpasses it in pretty much every way—though the character limit on custom names is truly criminal.","September 25, 2014","true","91.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Want something a little different? Try the Broken Lords, whose population is conjured with resources instead of grown, and produce no food themselves. Or try the Forgotten, who can't research, but can only advance technology from trade, purchase, or (best of all) grand theft. Or try playing as the Cult of the Endless and see how you faire with only being able to build a single city. You have a lot of options here.\n\nThe amount of support the devs have shown after launch is phenomenal, and their creativity is bottomless. I thought they had pretty much expended their ideas after the Shadows expansion, and now we have the Allayi...\n\nThis game breathes atmosphere, and each faction has its own reasons for wishing to save/exploit/destroy Auriga. The lore is interesting, as are the multitudes of minor factions\n\nA warning, though. The combat isn't bad, but it is certainly a little wonky. It seems to be a make-or-break system for a lot of people, but it's quite interesting if you can get the hang of it. Initiative is key. :)\n\nSecondly, the AI is pretty dumb. It's good to cut your teeth on, but after a while you'll grow tired of its lack of tactics. There are some factions (The Forgotten in particular) that I don't feel it actually knows how to play at all. Bring your friends. Stomp through them together. Or stomp each other. The diplomacy system is very well put together, and doesn't feel tacked-on to fill out a checklist like it seems in many others of its type, so you can use it to your full advantage.\n\nThirdly, the quest system is a little tiresome. After one long game, you probably won't be seeing any you haven't already seen the next time you play. It would be nice to have many more to enhance variety in individual play-thrus. Also, the addition of large-scale, world-changing events is cool, but they also lack variety. Once you know them all, you'll simply be waiting for them to happen again, and they will. Enjoy seeing Minor Faction, Major Pain pop up in every game you play, and hopefully not too early in it ;)\n\nA few minor gripes aside, there's an amazing game in here with endless (get it?) replay value.

The races while all different from each other, had many similarities to other Space Fantasy races we had seen before.\n\nWhen Endless Legend was announced; truth be told I only expected a simple background change to the Endless Space game we already had. Perhaps just moving from space to a single planet but keeping the core gameplay the same.\n\nThat is to some extent true; those familiar with Endless Space will find themselves at home here, city management, hero skills and army interface all remind us of Endless Space, the overall style of the UI is also very similar.\n\nHowever what makes this game fascinating and special is the amount of detail in it and the amazing atmosphere. Every single race is unique, not only in gameplay but in background and story; even their interactions with the basic currency of the game. This small gameplay element "currency" changes the morals and customs of these peoples.\n\nThere are Empire-stories, world-stories, minor faction-stories and all of them are told through quests that remind us of RPG classics. For the single World of Auriga; the developers managed to put in more story than all the systems in Endless Space ever had.\n\nVisuals are amazing, colourful but not cartoonish, absolutely cheerful and pleasing to look at, despite being a turn based game, I have never felt bored or disinterested, even during the periods of waiting for friends to complete their turns.\n\nThe final and dearest point has to be the music; I can safely say that this game has the best or at least one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. I have played it more than a day now in total and every track still takes me on an emotional journey. The use of Guitar tones together with the Harp is especially noteworthy. The fact that the Devs provide it for free is also much appreciated, would be well worth a fee to download.\n\nDespite the welcome popularity of 4x and strategy games causing a bit of a surplus of such games to pick from: I very much recommend this game to anyone that enjoys good strategy and story.","April 25","true","56.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

It takes the classic Civilization formula, refines and streamlines certain mechanics for improved gameplay, blends in some lite RPG elements like quests and gear upgrades, and adds sci-fi/fantasy lore for flavor.\n\nThere are only seven factions in the base game but each has unique qualities that alter how they play fairly drastically. For example, the Necrophages can convert vanquished enemies into drones to bolster their armies, and the Broken Lords consume dust (the game’s monetary resource) instead of food.\n\nEndless Legend tweaks the classic Civ system with a number of refinements, improvements, and new mechanics, like units that combine into easily maneuverable armies, a map carved into territories which only allow one city each, seasons that impact production and movement, and so forth. Where Civ often gets bogged down in micromanagement for larger empires in the late game, Endless Legend’s various refinements help keep things moving a little more smoothly.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing about Endless Legend is its overall polish. Anchored by an elegant and intuitive interface that gives you quick access to all features and info, the game has a great feel and every aspect of it plays extremely well. The lush musical soundtrack by FlybyNo ties everything together with a beautiful and at times haunting assortment of orchestral strings and vocals.\n\nThe base game is entirely satisfying without any expansions. Each of the DLCs adds something but at this point none are truly essential, it isn’t like recent entries in the Civ series where the base games feel unfinished without the big expansions... Here, the base game gives you a fun and balanced experience with more than enough to keep you busy, then you can look at the DLCs if you feel like adding a couple of extra features on top.  The developers have also been fairly active through the game’s first year and a half with patches providing minor improvements, tweaks, and fixes for the base game.\n\nLike all great 4X games, Endless Legend will keep you hooked for “one more turn” as the hours drift away and the day turns to night and back to day again. Highly recommended for 4X fans who are looking for a cool new take on the classic Civ style game.\n","January 15","true","290.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

The player spends far less time waiting and way more timeplanning & playing.\nAmplitude is the studio to watch.  ALL of their alpha / betas are solid & already *well* worth their buy-in pricing.

I am simply amazed. This studio really deserves the praise. The artwort is sooo beautiful. As a webdesigner I can say these are the most beautiful tooltips I have ever seen anywhere. Each one with nice concept art. The handling is also very good. I can´t believe I played a game for 6-8 hours without ever using the keyboard, just my mouse. I also love they didn´t take every single cliché from J.R.R. Tolkien and created something new and completely original such as the cultists. Each combat becomes interesting by using the actual world terrain unlike HoMM where you load into a combat screen. It gives each combat a new strategic variety.\n\nThe only thing that turned me off at first was, when I saw some early alpha footage and saw the weird landscape geometry and the ugly fog of war. I thought this is a b-title, a Civ wannabe with no original concept. I was so wrong. I decided to give it a chance anyway and I don´t regret it. I wish the studio will make some money to be able to continue this new IP. Imagine if they had more money to spend on voice actors for the AIs and you get a nice voiced cutscene when you achieve a victory. Some time and money invested in something like a Civilopedia would also be nice. Also more money to spend on advertisement because this is truely a hidden gem more people should know about.

Technology progression is a lot more basic, in that there are no dependencies. The only restriction is that you need to research 10 (I think) technologies before progressing to the next tier.  The combat system is really cool.  You can build armies consisting off multiple different units, and then actually control those units in battles. A section of the map is marked off, and all of the units are spread out.  But, if you don't want to take the time to control the battle yourself, you can skip this feature and have your army or unit battle it out like in Civ.  The graphics are great. They did a great job designing the world/tiles.  The terrain can play a big part in battles, which is cool and add a little to the strategy of how you engage enemies. The game is still a work in progress, but I think it's great and I'm looking forward to when it's completed.","June 21, 2014","true","21.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The dev team definitely set about creating an innovative 4X Turn-based strategy (TBS) here that will probably eclipse their Sins TBS alternative, Endless Space, in its sheer success.  It could potentially rival its closest mainstream competitor, the Sid Meiers' Civilization series.  I cannot overstate how pleased I am with its progress as May 20, 2014, and what is expected down the line.  Endless Legends is fantasy TBS expecting 8 major playable factions built into a randomly generated map.  It is part-simulation in a way with quests and a storyline quest specific to each major faction.  Each faction is absolutely distinct from the others in design, much like Endless Space, with exception of basic city improvements.  Playing them similarly would be disastrous as I discovered when I played the Broken Lords like Wild Walkers once because of differences in faction technologies and their relationships to minor factions.  On a side note, I love the art too.  This is still an alpha, so it is not close to finished, but I do want to outline what I like so far in the game by analyzing its 4X nature thus far.\n\nIt needs to work on its EXPLORATION aspect, but it is expected to be improved upon.  Vision and movement are important aspects of this that can be enhanced through tech and empire plan choices.  Roads, sea travel, auto-explore, and other functions are expected to crop up soon, so this will be cleared up.  Quests are an important part of this game either through their storyline quests or ruins, but I consider them perhaps the most critical part of the exploration aspect thus far.\n\nEXPANSION is where it shines with a new innovative approach to territory.  The use of expansionary districts and regions really sets it aside from Civ 5 and Endless Space, requiring not only continental and imperial management but also intense city management.  City expansion improves upon FIDSI and anomaly access while colonization of new regions accesses newer luxury and strategic resources and minor factions.  Technology advances over six eras, requiring increasing numbers of tech to reach the next era unlike Endless Space but not quite so linear as Civ 5.  City improvements work like Endless Space's system improvements.  Overall, I LOVE IT.\n\nEXPLOITATION is where the game also is expecting improvement.  At present the AI is dumbed down to simply declare war and conquer, but when it develops it is possible to create alliances, trade, and regulate borders.  Further, minor factions are important in this game.  Assimilating minor factions improves certain qualities in the empire in question as well as provides faction units.  For instance, Bos provide light cavalry Centaurs while Kazanji offer some wicked flying Demons.  There's also a marketplace for buying disbanded units, heroes, resources, and otherwise that can offer a means to get an edge on a close competitor.  This part needs help but it will probably reflect the same 4X exploitation basics with exception of the minor factions, which really do impact gameplay.\n\nEXTERMINATION is another innovative spot for the game.  Rather than doing the rock, paper, scissors approach from Endless Space or the unit-by-unit crawl across Civ 5 they chose to do a battle system based off stats such as initiative, defense, attack, and other such where stacked armies fight each other with reinforcements from nearby armies if available.  If the manual option is chosen, the player only chooses which units are attacked per unit, but heroes also get involved directly in the fight unlike Endless Space.  But the best part about using the manual option for a multiplayer match in the future is that you can direct the initial targeting and at the same time look elsewhere in your empire and take care of other business.  So, while your Necrophage necrodrones are taking out an army of Broken Lord Stalwarts, you can address your need to expand into the Tanoj region to grab the Mithrite there while determining where to put that next district in your capital.  Once you're done you can look back and redirect the targeting and do something else.  Overall, I like this style better than the other models and is the second most innovative aspect of the game behind the region-city model.\n\nThis game just in the alpha stages alone is fantastic but also needs some polishing here and there as is to be expected.    8/10 for the alpha compared to similar games, expecting 10/10 upon completion.\n\n","May 19, 2014","true","119.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

As a huge 4x fan I wanted to like ES badly, but the game felt very flat. I thought the galaxy was lifeless, military strategy is just an r/p/s guessing game and each play through feels pretty much the same after about the first 20 minutes.\n\nI mention that because this is what made me hesitate about buying Endless Legend. I need not have worried. EL is wonderful. It has all of the life and character that ES lacked and much, much more.\n\nPicking a "best thing" about this game is tough, but I would agree with many that it's the faction design. The factions don't just have a few different units or stat bumps, they obey entirely different game mechanics. They have their unit trees and city plans. You can't play the same game with two different factions, it just won't work. And that's awesome.\n\nAbove everything else, Endless Legend is original. The regional cities, tech tree "eras," expressing influence directly as a resource, redesigning units like you would in a space 4x, they make this game feel like something I haven't seen before. In a field that has been competing to become the next Master of Magic or Civ fantasy for the last 20 years, that's a breath of fresh air. Endless Legend is fun, it's original and it's incredibly worth buying.","October 8, 2014","true","106.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Came into this game thinking it was going to be similar to the new civilization game but was thankfully surprised as I grew bored of civilization fast. This game is immensely fun when playing with friends and unlike civilization has refreshing unique faction mechanics.\n\nPro: Graphics and art style are top notch, one of the best of seen implemented in a game of this nature. While not the best at doing so I find the way heroes and their skills work to be excellent. As mentioned before faction mechanics are unique and vary how you play the game out. Multiplayer games with friends are a lot of fun and produce good banter and by good banter I mean top kek banter.\n\nCons: There aren't many things I dislike about this game but they influence the game experience a LOT. The game bugs when playing multiplayer are great in number and nearly always game breaking. I can't tell you how much of actual game time I've spent trying to work out these bugs. I seem to see most bugs come from trying to reload saved games as host, from players disconnecting or god forbid players who have disconnected wanting to reconnect. Resyncing can turn into an absolute nightmare and EVEN WITH SAVING you can still lose that awesome game you invested 4 hours into. The other con is pretty minor and it's really only a preference thing but this game is time consuming.\n\nConclusion: This game is the bomb without the bugs but bugs can destroy your entire multiplayer experience with this game. The main reason I published this review is to provide visibility to the bugging problem and hopefully this will get the developers to act fast.\n\nPS. Still yet to finish a game with friends due to bugs.\n\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","112.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

However there's a lot of challenge on the way, including disapproval of extensions/expands and minus points to approval for certain things which makes the people in the current city unhappy and if you have really low they will go into rebellion, so make sure you keep up with all your resources and don't rush and take over lands right away. Since some things you can find in the research menu will help you get approval bonuses to your empire. Like lowering the disapproval percentage for example or adding for example "30+ Approval" research.\n\nResearching also includes new tier of weapons and gear and even bonuses to other things such as dust, food, specific ores like titanium, etc. But doing research also takes an amount of turns to get the things you research done so when you got some approval researches which you can build/add into your empire for a cost of resources you can start build up more cities in other land parts of the map, but you'll need settlers do to so.\n\nAnything you want to build... including settlers and army units. - You'll need to spend an amount of resources + the amount it takes to "build" something is based on a specific amount of turns, however it all changes depending on which order they go in the construction que. However you can also instantly put several of those constructions on speed up/instantly "buy" them with dust to make them complete in 1 turn. Which can help you get what you need quicker if there's emergency.\n\nEvery single map and cities you can "construct" addons or even rename cities into whatever name you want.\nThere is so much more you can do in this game but it takes such a huge amount of text to write in every little detail about this game, so this will be all I can share with you for now. But from the amount of time I've played this game I highly recommend it.

I was sold by the graphics and the artwork and I liked that it is a fantasy twist on other 4X games. I have to admit that I am not disappointed at all.\n\nI am a newbie in the 4X genre, and of course I tried the tutorial first. But that one didn't make it very clear to me, and it was pretty short. So I just started a new game and looked up some guides about the basics. I would recommend other newbies to look for guides instead of the tutorial.\nThe gameplay is good, I think the UI looks well-arranged as well. I found out that I enjoyed expanding cities and researching new methods. So your empire will grow bigger and stronger.\nA nice addition is the combat system. This works similar to the Heroes of Might & Magic combat. You can play these battles, or if you think there are repetitive, you can skip them to see the results.\n\nThere are multiple ways to win a match, with colonizing as many as possible regions or with completing your main quest for example. There are also multiple factions to play with, each with their own specialities. Every faction has their own main quest to complete.\n\nThe soundtrack is superpretty, I enjoy the in-game music a lot. I think it is maybe one of the best game soundtracks I heard. The graphics are very pleasing to look at, the same goes for the cinematics.\n\nI think Endless Legend will be one of my favourite games.

Firstly, despite having many similarities in the type of game it is and the way it's played it is actually very different. Secondly, in my opinion it is a far better game. The rest of this review will try to explain why.\n\nThe most obvious difference is that here you have a fantasy setting rather than a historical one - which you prefer will simply be a matter of taste.\nThe first major positive is that you can level up heroes and give them progressively better equipment based on what you have researched. Standard units can also be upgraded in this way (through the edit unit feature). This is FAR more useful and interesting than the single purpose you can give generals/great architects etc in Civ.\nThe second major positive is that the factions you can choose from are a lot more diverse and different in the way you go about playing each of them compared to the positives and negatives attached to factions in Civ. This gives more replay value whilst also making multiplayer more interesting. Attached to this diversification we have the fact that each faction has its own individual quest/mission thread making single player more varied by faction also.\n\nThe unit types, whilst very different at a faction level, are quite limited. Some may find this a drawback in comparison with Civ but, personally, I find that it is more useful in both highlighting faction difference and STREAMLINING what you can produce during multi-player. Whilst this is true, you can also assimilate various minor factions (of which there are many) that may make extra unit types available to you meaning that armies will almost always be different even in games with multiples of the same faction.\n\nOther, non-battle related, research is also limited in comparison with Civ - the research trees here are much smaller. Again, this makes multiplayer more viable and streamlines the whole process.\n\nThere ARE negatives associated with each of these improvements but also combat is more straightforward and less complex as is how you govern your cities. There is a lot less micromanagement in Endless Legend. Whilst this may be a big turnoff for dedicated Civ fans it will be a welcome difference for most players and, once again, aids in streamlining the game to make it viable as a multi-player experience.\n\nOverall I feel that whilst both games have merits and problems and neither are perfect, Endless Legend provides a more interesting experience in single-player due to faction difference, hero use, and quest lines. And Endless Legend's FOCUS and streamlining of research, production, and city management make it more viable for multiplayer. 82%","December 6, 2014","true","14.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

To let 6 of your units complete one round of moving and firing takes like a minute, it's insane. A single battle which should take no more than a minute, takes several minutes.\n\nIt's super unfortunate because in a lot of ways this game has many improvements over Civ, but its overall playability is nothing compared to any civ.

It's worth it's meager price tag of $40.  (Meager in terms of major games, which always have a baseline of $60.)  Put it on your wishlist and snatch it up when you catch a price break.\nIt's all about the factions.  Unlike in Civ 5, the factions play very differently from each other.  The Wild Walkers kind of focus on expansion, exploration, and harmonizing with the planet, while the Cultists focus on forcing everyone else in the world to join their cult.  This is far from the minor differences of, say, one faction getting +2 food in the capital, as opposed to +1 industry on water tiles like you would see in Civ.  The faction differences in Endless Legend are about PHILOSOPHY, and not about mechanics.  The Cultists are only allowed one city, the Roving Clans are not allowed to declare war, the Drakken can force other factions into peace and alliance treaties.  These are game-altering differences that lead to different game experiences and interesting cross-faction interactions.\nEvery little part of this game has been fleshed out and thought through.  Every little part of it makes sense.  It won't be the easiest thing to pick up right off the bat, since the guys at Amplitude Studios think just a little differently than you're used to, but they also like to reward you for your efforts.  The more you play, the more you see the big picture, and the more you realize just how perfect each piece of the puzzle is and what a beautiful picture it makes.  Somehow this game is more polished, more interesting, more diverse, and more fun than Civ 5, in which I've got a couple hundred hours logged.\nThe tutorial is excellent.  It brings you into their way of thinking without patronizing you like you've never played any kind of civilization game before.  The artwork is different and interesting, all the way down to the way the interface responds when you scroll in and out of the map.  The music and sound of the game somehow enhance the whole effect that they are trying to create.  Before you know it, you'll have hours and hours logged and wondering what you ever played before.\nThere are a few minor issues that keep this game from being a 10, but as it is a new title, I expect those things to be ironed out as time moves on.  For instance, if you accidentally (or intentionally) get ahead of yourself in the tutorial, and even sometimes in a created game, you could end up with a quest that you cannot complete.  Overall, this is usually no big deal, since you are given LOTS of quests during the course of your adventures.  However, if the quest you cannot complete just happens to be a faction quest, then you are effectively cut off from the rest of the storyline for your faction, short of resorting to a save state.\nAlso, there's not much in the way of naval combat.  This is a really minor gripe for me since about 96% of the time I never used my navy in Civ 5 for anything other than a deterrent, anyway.  But if you're a big fan of naval forces and/or combat, you may miss it here.  Quite frankly, I was many hours deep into this game before I even realized that there was no navy.  Somehow it feels like they told a complete story without it.\nI expect a DLC sometime in the future that will probably handle some sort of naval units and a few more factions, although there will never be a glut of factions like in Civ.  Each faction is so fundamentally different I imagine it would be difficult to maintain any kind of balance (or even to come up with a plethora of ideas) if there were endless factions.  (See what I did there?  I might have just named the DLC. )  I mean, unless you're playing Venice, there really isn't much difference between the 300 factions in Civ, anyway.\nAs it is, though, I am very happy with this game and highly recommend it to anyone who has that 4x itch, that civ itch, or anyone who just wants to play a really good game for a change.","November 30, 2014","true","104.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The most striking to me is that each faction plays very differently, most of them even bring some twists to the game mechanics to make them unique. One example is the Cultists faction, that can only be played with one city but have abilities to use tribes for growth, or the Broken Lords, that require no food but need money to sustain themselves.\nThe tech tree is actually not a tree at all, and this makes the technology evolution a lot less linear than usual. The idea of regions with only one city per region and local tribes is also welcome, and use of the tribes is quite fun without being time consuming.\nDiplomacy and combat are more standard, I like the cold war status that allows for aggression without being at war.\n\nEndless Legend is a great game and offers very good re-playability. If you like turn-based strategy it is very unlikely you'll be disappointed.\n\n","January 30, 2015","true","96.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I have put in a few hours now with zero crashes. Great work.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 16/02/15 - Amplimath update on 64bit issue AMD ATI, see below\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate - 29/11/14 Free addon released "Visions of the Unseen" new minor faction, 10 new quests and more. 64bit version still unstable. (64bit AMD ATI issues explained bottom of review)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the makers of Endless Space comes a stylish fantasy 4x. For anyone who has watched the intro to The Game of Thrones, the art style will be familiar, a quite unique look that I dont recall seeing before,\n\nThe gameplay is fairly familiar to anyone who has played a lot of 4x, with a few interesting mechanics to throw in there. Empire planning every few seasons allows you some customisation for your empire, allowing you to focus on say dust production (game resource) or reduction in costs to recruiting units. Strategic resources located within your territory enable you to create armor, weapons and equipment for your troops as well as provide mid to late game bonuses which again provide some nice customisation.\n\nYou are able to customise your units to some degree creating 1h shield or 2h for the basic infantry units for example. Further customisation in the material the weapons and armour is made from allow for further bonuses such as stuns and sweepback strikes (aoe).\n\nThe only problem I have encountered stability wise is the need to run the client in 32bit as suggested by the company on the forums as it was prone to regular crashing. I have had no problems since doing this altho it will crash on exit every time now, (will update if this is fixed or changes)\n\nOverall I would recommend this as a nice addition to 4x library.\n\nHere is a current playthrough I am running at the moment:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVKQE26VpEIBVlnxdBkU4v4hlioAYJCNZ\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phz9XZ9Li14&list=PLVKQE26VpEIBVlnxdBkU4v4hlioAYJCNZ&channel=letsplaykherny\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHi all,\n\nWe have not forgotten you about this issue. Unity has released a new version of Unity (4.6.2) with some fix which could concern the crash issue. We have generated a new build and I played for 65 turns without crash on a PC outfitted with an AMD graphic cards, in 64 bits, with the latest graphics drivers. Sounds promising, but obviously we need our QA to double check it.

I have contacted AMD again to learn their progress. I think it is difficult for them because the crash is random and it takes some time to reproduce. As the game works perfectly in other configurations, I can only assume that it is an issue between Unity 64 bits and AMD drivers.\n\nThere is a new version of Unity coming up in the next weeks/months, version 5.0, and its editor runs natively in 64 bits, as opposed to 4.X where the editor is 32 bits and we make a special build in 64 bits. My hope is that when people equipped with AMD starts migrating on Unity 5 and have the editor crash every now and then, the problem will become more serious for Unity and AMD\n\nAnyway I will update you when I have more news.\n\nCheers,\n\nAmplimath\nCEO\n\n\nhttp://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?38627-Random-crashes-with-ATI-cards-while-running-the-64-bits-version-of-the-game/page5\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAMD ATI Card 64bit problems:\n\nFrom this thread end of Oct 2014: http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?38627-Random-crashes-with-ATI-cards-while-running-the-64-bits-version-of-the-game/page2\n\nOver the past month we have tried to understand why the crash appended and it has taken us some time to found that it comes from the ATI hardware configuration.\nWe have asked the help of AMD some weeks ago because we had tried all our ideas and we had no way to find why it appends. We were really pleased that they answered us and started to look at it.\nApparently they have reproduced it for the first time in their lab some days ago. But they have no clue about why it append for the moment. They are trying to reproduce it again while tracking the "why"...\n\nAs for now, we have no more information.

It looks gorgeous, has nice music, a great interface which has a lot of improvements over Endless Space (although lacking in keyboard shortcuts), interesting stories and factions. But the gameplay just does not work out.\n\nNormal" AI is insanely easy. I just killed everyone on my first game. "Hard" AI is incredible cheaty. You can only scratch your head at how many cities they construct while you churn out your first settler. Enemy AI seems very weak and just wins with extra resources. No apparent AI strategy is visible.\n\nThe battle system is atrocious. You can place your units, set them to offensive, defensive or stationary and give them targets. As soon as you press the turn button they do whatever they want. In fact you can just autoresolve its the same. The same company made Endless Space where you could not control your units as well. But they put in a paper-scissor-rock-like system and made sure, that fleet composition and ship design is important. Here, you just need the expensive equipment, there is really no choice. I suggest Archers on stationary. The rules for reinforcements are completely unclear. I think it is based on movement range but the game will not show you any info about it. Why could they not adapt the system from Endless Space? This is beyond me. The battle system is the greates weakness right after the bad AI.\n\nDiplomacy is quite basic and costs too much "Influence" (something you can "gather" like science or dust points). You need quite a lot of influence to unlock Empire plans. Those a really powerful boosts and a must against the "hard" AI. Exchanging a couple of techs is just prohibitively expensive in influence as to render this option useless.\n\nThe market for heroes, mercs and resources is a nice idea but again very very expensive. You won't use it much if at all. For example the seasonal change between winter and summer is nice but as it affects (one faction as unique buildings against winter effects though) everyone it just slows the game down. Even more so as mid and late game has more winter than summer.\n\nThe game has certainly interesting ideas but the whole balance does not work out. And it suffers from the same fate as Endless Space....as soon as someone is in the lead with a  bit of a margin you can just stop playing. Nothing is going to happen until said player fulfills the victory condition. There are no shake ups in mid or late game.\n\n---\nHave a look at my channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/phoppe1980","January 22, 2015","false","18.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","2"

If it sounds familiar, that's because it is, but there's the promise of turn based battles rather than bumping your units into enemy units. However, its little more than you watching these battles play out on the hexigrid. The entire game amounts to little more than watching a gorgeous painting dry. Its a true time sink for anyone into the genre, but after spending 12 hours into it, I didn't start to "enjoy" Endless Legend until about six hours in once I had mastered certain nuances.\n\nThe game is like several others in the genre, you'll make settlements in regions and grow the settlements and chose their development. Then over time, they'll amass industry, science, food and "dust" or the game's currency. Industry gets things done quicker and I wish I had paid attention during the tutorial to know that. Science researches upgrades faster. Food keeps your citizens alive and dust pays for a lot of things. Each settlement will have a default yield of all four resources, including a fifth and that's influence that every so often you'll get to unlock more things that can be upgraded. If you'd like a higher yield, you need to balance your town's populous to put effort into each of the five. Its little more than clicking and dragging an icon from one grid cell to another. These citizens are never seen, its like a statistic that you have control over.\n\nNow that everyone is up to speed on these genre as a whole, you'll use these settlements to generate units. You can speed up any process by spending dust to get it done on the next turn. The nation / faction you select will determine the units you can use. Everything from dragons, to ogres, archers to knights and so on. The game breaks down into three different class types, infantry (melee), ranged and support. You can combine units on the world map into an army, so six units into an army, but then the icing on these little cupcakes are heroes, which you can buy for around 2,000 dust. The heroes are tougher than units, but they can still be killed. When they're killed they respawn after a battle with little health. If they're injured, they're disabled for a few battles and you can assign only one hero per army.\n\nYou'll move your armies around and engage in battles or attack settlements. That's when the army separates back into units. As a general you've moved your armies, and now its up to them to fight on the hexigrid. Before hopping into battle, you've got a choice, manual, spectate or auto. Auto will just tell you what happened, who died, who survived. Spectate will watch the turn based battle play out for a total of six phases. So each unit goes once and that's a phase. If you select manual, at the start of each phase, you'll get to point each of your units at an enemy to attack. Then they'll do what it takes to carry out your order. If they can't do it by the end of their turn, they fall back on your choice of either offense, defense or stand their ground. So if you want an infantry to attack a supporter way in the back, but they just can't reach them in this turn, they'll move as far as they can, and attack someone else instead if you have them set to offense.\n\nIf a unit is attacked, they'll defend or attack back right then and there, but that counts as their turn. Your units have all sorts of abilities, defense, offense and stats. Your units use the abilities, you don't. You're sitting there watching the whole thing play out up to six phases. After six, if there is no decisive winner its considered a draw and its back to the world map! During the battles, if you have other nearby armies, they'll join the fray as time goes on, so if there's an army two spaces away on the world map, they'll join the battle in phase three. It definitely makes things interesting.\n\nAnother thing that's interesting is troops from each unit will fall dead, but that doesn't mean they'll be any less effective. So if there are six archers in one unit, five of them are dead, that lone archer can deal as much damage as the six of them. The amount of troops per unit is only a visual aide.\n\nSo you're not just conquering your enemies, you're winning battles or at least your units are. You'll build boats to get them from place to place, or just walk them. When capturing settlements, you've got a choice, attack or siege. Siege will cut off their resources and weaken them for your attack.\n\nAttacking settlements can be difficult to the point that it made me think there was some sort of a glitch. You can keep attacking an enemy and see the damage indicator telling you that you've done 45 damage, but their health doesn't go down. This is the effect of being within city walls or even around a settlement in general.  You'll need to keep attacking them knowing that at some point their health will finally go down. Its a strange hidden mechanic with no reference that they're safely fortified. Settlements also come with extra militia in a garrison. If you can't capture a settlement on that turn, the militia will regenerate.\n\nConquering a new settlement will mean its people will hate you, but you can just arrange some morale boosters to be built. You'll also need to fix whatever problems the settlement has. A few of the cities that I had taken over had food shortages, so I had to reassign the populous from dust (gold) harvesting to food harvesting. The game will warn you if your people are about to starve so you can fix it. In fact the game notifies you of far too much with prompts that you'll need to open. These processes have been done, these units have leveled up, this hero needs you to select their perk.\n\nHeroes have perks, just like you as a nation have upgrades. To be honest, there was far too many upgrades and perks that my mind went numb and I just started randomly selecting things. Some of the upgrades boost your harvests. Other upgrades unlock new units. As for the heroes, they'll unlock skills and passive buffs, but again nothing felt like a game changer especially when you have such little control.\n\nOne interesting facet is the seasonal change. There aren't four seasons, no; here there are just the two. Summer and winter. The winter makes travel slow and starves your people, so if you don't have enough food stored up from the summer months, you might have to pull everyone off of other duties and assign them to food harvesting. It really forces you to use things that most wouldn't even think about when playing.\n\nLike most games of this nature, when you start, you can list a lot of specifics such as world size, climate, how many nations and difficulty. You can select random for most of them and hop into a new game generated just for you! The rival nations will watch your actions. If they feel threatened they can declare war or even offer a truce with some rewards if you're about to curb stomp them back down the hole they came out of. Its interesting seeing nation leaders so happy to trade with you or say hey we have common friends, let's be allies! No one asked to travel through my land though and that's usually a good sign that they're about to wage war on you and make a play for a city. There are neutral minor factions too that you'll need to either murder, bribe or negotiate with.\n\nI spent twelve hours staring at a beautiful painting and at some point I started auto skipping the battles. I discovered that an easy crushing victory on spectate turns into a draw when auto battling. You're almost forced to watch these slow battles play out and that's just part of Endless Legend. Even if it weren't for the battles, the game is dull, but still gorgeous to look at with beautiful music.  I'm not even sure that I can recommend it to fans of the genre, just because you've played this before, but its now time consuming with these battles you have no control over.","April 19, 2015","false","13.8"," 65 of 121 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","65","121","10","1"

I bought this expecting the same level of awesomeness as Endless Space... and was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nPros :\nIt's pretty, which isn't really a selling point for strategy games, but it's there.\n\nThe setup of resources is pretty self-explanatory - Food, Industry, Science, and Dust (money). It's basically the same as Endless Space. Sure there are other resources, but I like the simplicity here. If I wanted something more complex I would go back to the Hearts of Iron series.\n\nHaving seasons actually affect the game was pretty nifty. As far as innovation goes, this is a good one. I wish it was more controllable in the game setup, but maybe that'll come later.\n\nDesign your own faction and play against them is pretty great. I've loved this feature ever since GalCiv II.\n\n\nCons : (this might take a while)\nAI is immune to the approval penalty for expanding AND building burroughs. Sure, human players are ALWAYS gonna be smarter than a video game's AI, but handicapping me in this way kinda made me feel like they took the "eXpand" out of the "4X," which is my primary problem with the game. You get penalized for expanding while the AI doesn't, and since the AI likes to just burrough their cities in whatever random direction they want, if you capture that city, your approval rating plummets. Again sure I understand the need to beef the AI so it's a challenge, but this kind of handicap makes me feel like I'm playing a 3X game instead of a 4X one. I'm certain there are other, better ways to handle this. OR the other option is to not advertise it as a 4X game, which I'd also be ok with. On a side note, GalCiv III is out and they're always seeking new ways to tweak the AI so it's a challenge and thus doesn't really need these weird buffs.\n\nUI is completely WTF. Some elements are good, but I shouldn't have to search for stuff like "how long do I have on this siege?" Also had to dig for how to activate buffs.\n\nCombat is clunky. as. hell. Go play Fallen Enchantress or Master of Magic to see how it's done. Seriously, everyone wants to be Master of Magic. The concept is so simple, but somehow everyone misses the target.\n\nImmersion is meh. The seasons were nice, but nothing else was compelling about the storyline or the gameplay. For good immersion, go study Emperor of the Fading Suns - while it's a terrible wargame, it does an amazing job of immersing the player in said terrible wargame. Even Endless Space sucked me in - I would play for hours and not realize that it's past midnight. What happened here guys?\n\nDifficulty. It's pretty standard that I play the tutorial, which was moooostly good, though it left out some key info. Then my first game I pretty much always set on "easy," or whatever's just below "normal." Learning curve. That said, and the fact that I'm not a newbie to strategy games, I still get my ♥♥♥ handed to me. Like it's not even a contest. This isn't my first time juggling villagers between production and food, nor is is my first time moving armies around. On easy the game claims that "the French could win Agincourt." Still, the AI wipes the floor with me. Did I maybe miss something crucial in the tutorial?\n\nSlooooooooooooooooooooow animations. Even if you win / lose a combat, you have to sit through watching the surviving units on the board do a little shuffle. Moving around the map is pretty slow too. Maybe a speed slider for that? I mean I don't want to feel like I'm watching something in fast-forward, but being able to kick it up one notch would be pretty great.\n\nPathing is a complete crapshoot, and when certain spaces or actions cost you ALL the remaining movement, this is a BIG deal. Also if I mis-click an area, no matter how fast I click to correct it, there's no going back. On a side note breaking sieges is pretty wtf too. I had to path clear around my entire city, which took a while during winter, to break a siege. If the attacking army is only on one side of the city, that's not really a "siege." That's "hey let's everyone sneak out the back where it's unguarded."\n\nSo yeah, if you want a good 4X fantasy, go give Fallen Enchantress a shot. Or if you're an actual wizard and can get Master of Magic running, play that - it's the original "weird races + FIDS + fantasy strategy." If you want a good space 4X, Endless Space is good. For some reason though, they really extra failed with this one. It turned me off enough that I'm proooooobably not gonna buy from Amplitude again.","December 23, 2014","false","180.1"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","30","54","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fnard/recommended/289130/","Fnard","Disco Lemonade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fnard/","118 products in account","I will compare this to Civ 5 since most people will probably have had experience with that title, due to the fact it can be considered one of the most popular 4x games out there right now.\nEndless Legend is a 4x game similar to Civ 5 but with many changes and improvments that makes it really stand out from Civ.\n\nFirst off, I always found the nations in Civ 5 to be really similar to one another. Two things would be differnt between them all, like a unique unit or building and a special ability that most of the time I don't really notice and thats it, everything else is pretty cookie cutter and the same.\nNow I can understand why it's like that, human civilizations did develop and have similar technologys at around the same as eachother.\n\nBut since Endless Legend is set in a fantasy setting they could develop these really unique factions. They all play and look and feel differnt. For instance, one faction is a cult of creepy living doll like beings who can only build one city,but they can pretty much build it into a super city and can convert minor factions to there cult to do there bidding!\n\nOr how about another faction where you can't really do much diplomatically and you are just one big war mongering swarm of blood thirsty zerg-like insects who spread in a fashion similar to the zombie plauge that feed on your fallen enemies? And on the opposite end of the spectrum, You have the opportunity to play as dragons that use there vast knowledge and prestige to force people to do what you want them to do through the power of diplomacy? And who says actions speak louder than words?\n\nAlot of thought as gone into this game, not just gameplay wise but lore wise aswell. This game boasts a very deep and interesting lore that shares the same universe with 3 other games this developer has well...developed. Not only are the factions histories deep but the worlds is too. It's an absolute joy to read up on the lore of this games and those connected to it. If you like deep lore I am sure you will enjoy what this game has to offer.\n\nThe graphics are nice too, they are not next gen or anything, but they are good looking. They use them very well too and make a world that looks very imaginative such as trees shooting blazing flames from its branches, large forbidding pits that lead down to dens which contain giant spider women hybrids. And so on and so fourth. The game also contains 2d art aswell which looks stunning. Some of it is even animated and is very nice to watch.\n\nSome gameplay elements that differ from Civ 5 and this game is that this game got rid of manually telling what tiles you wanted to be worked,now every tile that is in the cities range is automatically being worked on. So instead you can now put your workers into these little check boxes that will increase the amount of resources you gain that that particular check box represents.\nSome people may have liked the micro management that civ 5 had in that respect but I personally found it tedious and boring and much prefer this system of doing it which gets you the same outcome but with alot less time wasted.\n\nAnother change is the research tree in this game. You dont have to know specific technologies in this game to get more powerful versions of previous ones, or to advance to the next era, you just have to research enough of the current era to advance to the next era.\n\nBattles are differnt too. When units fight they take a small portion of the surrounding map and then have turn based tactical fights going on. Using the terrian is important since it gives you boosts in combat and you have to be weary of your units stats since they matter quite a bit in these skirmishes.\n\nThere's alot more to this game that I haven't touched, and it would take a long while to explain it all, but I hope that you get a good idea of what this game is about and its quality. If your a fan of 4x games, fantasy or just strategy games in general I think you wont regret giving this game a try.","September 27, 2014","true","35.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I picked up a few basics from those videos so I quickly managed to get the basics.\n\nHere's how my first playthrough went (Normal, Pangaea with 6 civilizations) playing as the wild walkers:\n\nI focused on my main city for a bit researching and building until I found myself in a position to expand, which I did. At this point I encountered a neighbour next to me and another a bit far from where I am.\n\n50 turns in one of them declares war on me suddenly with a smaller army than me, but more advanced. I lost my capital. So I reload the save, upgrade my army and still lose it, except he lost most of his as well and was forced to withdraw.\nSeeing how I have 3 towns to his 1 I quickly rebuild my army and fight him again. Tie again, and again I rebuild. This time I slowly take ground until I reach his capital, where I notice his army is at sea RIGHT next to my capital. What to do?

I'm a huge CIV, Master of Orion fan among others and I never had so much fun since Civ 4 loaded with Mods and expansions and Endless Legend is still Vanilla.\n\nThe universe is story-rich, the graphics are really good, the soundtrack is immersive and the gameplay is nothing shy of Civ 5. I should say, there is a sense of deepness in this game that was lost a long time ago with the Civ Series. The different ressources you can get and their potential effects, the extended political and trading systems, the Hero and armies customizations. The different factions bring several ways to play the game and eventually win. I'm only 10 hours on this game so far and I'm still doubtful about to what extend the replay value will be lets say past when you won with every factions. I'm hoping there will be lots of good Mods and maybe expansions to push the limits of this game in the future.\n\nSome people complained about the game crashing, so far I've experienced only one crash and thanks to the auto save feature, I was able to reload the last save without hassle.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is great, It's like a mother's caresss on a Civilization fan that felt left down by the last games they offered. Endless Legend HAS that one more turn feeling. Every turn brings its piece of action, being at war or at peace, there is plenty to manage and enjoy. It does not re-invent the genre, but it takes a well established concept and brings it in a Fantastic universe with a lot to explore and control.

I picked up a few basics from those videos so I quickly managed to get the basics.\n\nHere's how my first playthrough went (Normal, Pangaea with 6 civilizations) playing as the wild walkers:\n\nI focused on my main city for a bit researching and building until I found myself in a position to expand, which I did. At this point I encountered a neighbour next to me and another a bit far from where I am.\n\n50 turns in one of them declares war on me suddenly with a smaller army than me, but more advanced. I lost my capital. So I reload the save, upgrade my army and still lose it, except he lost most of his as well and was forced to withdraw.\nSeeing how I have 3 towns to his 1 I quickly rebuild my army and fight him again. Tie again, and again I rebuild. This time I slowly take ground until I reach his capital, where I notice his army is at sea RIGHT next to my capital. What to do?  I try to negotiate peace but he won't budge. So I start a race to his capital, I attack it about a TURN before he reaches my capital city. BAM I win.\n\nNow I meet some other neighbours.

Broken Lords dont need food resourse but dust(like gold in other games). Necrophage are evil, they don't have diplomacy with others etc. Each faction are way too diffrerent from others.\n\nThere is a wide range of resourse on the map. Some resourse is common, some are rare,Titanium etc. consider those rare resouce will be a main factor causing war in later game. about these common resourse tiles,  they really make the world beautiful and give player more choices for settlement\n\nbesides player, there are nature factions, they are not simply barbarian in Civ V , some of them can offer quest for player. And more interactive in future game maybe?\n\nAbout battle system, well, it not just a simple frame so far, your  multiple troops take one tile when peace, when encouter enemy, all the units spare out and you can deploy them on the world map. Frankly I'm not satisfied in combat, yes my units just running cross the battle field like fool= =Devs team really need more effort on this\n\nAnyway, not so many early access have game give me such a surprise, EL is a amazing game\n\n","May 1, 2014","true","22.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Factions play completely different. Interface is ungodly slick and gorgeous.  Impossible and higher difficulty are some BS, but I think you can find good games on Serious.  Apparently not very well balanced in multiplayer from what I've heard but for singleplayer it is worth a look.  I love a lot of what it does.  Just some examples of some of the factions:\n\n- Bugs who can only make war. Use dead bodies from battles to boost food production in a city.\n- Crazy puppet dudes who are only allowed to make one city\n- Gypsy like faction who can move cities and isn't allowed to declare war and focused on trade, and mercenaries.\n- Diplomatically inclined dragons\n\nEach faction has a main quest (not sure what happens when you beat them but along the way you get cool rewards.).  Minor factions you can assimilate into your army.  There's a fully working stock market esque marketplace although I wish the AI would use it more.\n\nThe map is ungodly gorgeous and theres a cool tilt shift effect when you zoom in.  Battles take place with stacks of units meeting and then fighting on the actual hexes of the world for 6 phases.  You can give pretty specific orders to units as far as who to attack and buff and where to move but they are not garuteed to be followed. I get a Heroes of Might and Magic Vibe for some reason from the battles even though they're different mechanics Overall it is an interesting system.  You upgrade your units with gear you aquire through research and moving through the ages if you wish.  I do wish there was an 'ultra' unit for each faction, as each faction only has I believe 3 units (which can be augmented by minor factions you asimiliate, or mercs).  Apparently the lore is pretty deep and all of the Endless games tie in to eachother (Endless Legend, Dungeon Of The Endless, and Endless Space).\n\nBasically a really gorgeous, slick take on the 4x genre which might not be the deepest 4x around but has tons of stuff going for it.  Not to rag on Civ:BE which I don't have anything against, but comparing BE to Endless Legend and the uniqueness of the factions is quite a change of pace.  Civ V is still probably the game to beat for most players, but Endless Legend definitely deserves a look if you are a fan of the genre.\n\nI've addressed the pros.  And seriously, Civ:BE's interface can only fantasize about being as good as Endless Legend.  You right click to back out of ANY screen, it's a beautiful thing.\n\nCons would be -\n-Unit variety (any way you slice it a faction really only has 3 units), the AI has almost always spammed 1 type of unit against me.\n- Multiplayer Balance (which is made up for in singleplayer uniqueness)\n- Animations are really slow for battle, you need to speed them up in the map options BEFORE you start. Trust me start with the animations turned all the way up or late game battles will drag on for minutes and minutes with not even much happening.\n- Really really bad AI cheating on the 2 highest difficulty levels, but what can you do?","January 1, 2015","true","69.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(3? 4? 5? 6?) if so, then great, you'll probably love this game. Do you like any of the Civilization games? great too!\n\nThis game is basically a mashup of Heroes of Might & Magic and Civilization, a healthy "just right" dosage of both in my opinion. You can roll out the big guns, create a massive army and wreck everyone to win, you could instead expand your empire by building cities and then conquering other people's cities until 80% of all lands on the map belong to you.\n\nYou can achieve a diplomatic victory by keeping your relations with other countries at peace or in alliance for a long enough amount of time (you get peace points, 1 for any country in the game, 2 for any country at peace with you and 4 for any country in an alliance. You win at like 3000 points; these values can be adjusted)\n\nYou can win by finishing your factions main quest (everyone has a main quest to follow; side quests can be earned by visiting certain locations on the map, quests give rewards. Nice rewards.) which will award you with the ability to build a "Temple of the Earth's Core" which is a so called "Wonder", and you will win when you have it.\n\nYou can win by being the most technologically advanced country (research 5 of the 6 most advanced technologies)\n\nOr you can play a bit more strategically than just kicking everyone's ♥♥♥, and capture all your opposing player's capital cities which will give you the Supremacy victory.\n\n\nAll of these are viable ways to win, besides maybe expansion victory (80% is a lot) but this sums up what the game is about. It's difficulty level is somewhere right between Heroes and Civilization, but the fun I'm getting here is a lot more than in either one of these other two classics.

Not everyone enjoys the quest aspect of the game, but for me it ties in quite brilliantly with the universe lore (even across other Amplitude titles) making it a unique feature in comparison to other civ-like games -albeit that as a victory condition consecutive playthroughs make it less interesting, but you can disable the victory quest when that happens because the side quests are plenty as well.\n\nThe faction traits are pretty radical but the balance between civs is reasonable. There are obvious easier and more difficult factions to choose from IMO, but in the hands of someone that wants to invest time into figuring out the best strategy; every faction and respectively every victory is viable.\n\nThe DLC mechanics: wonders and deeds, covert ops, pearls and winter altar,,, improve on the base game in such a way to make it a very complete and full experience.\n\nThere are still some caveats though. Due to the nature of the very different faction system, multiplayer is probably more difficult then say Civ5. To win against someone playing Wild Walkers on a warm climate map, you'll have to come prepared. Don't expect to be able to win against upgraded rangers with any army. And talking tactical battles: don't underestimate these in thinking that it is only an automated process. A lot of success involves in learning to read battles and prepare accordingly. For example where do you engage an enemy? Or which unit stance should you choose? What units should you upgrade? And so on. And then advanced tactics like poking with mercs to see the stats of enemies' armies, or infiltrating with spies are all very important to check the exact initiative values of their units for instance.\n\nAlso, there are some issues with AI difficulty. There is a tendency to snowball in late game and the AI empires sometimes make dubious and even bad unit choises compared to my Uber armies (30% the damage output of mine for example).

If you enjoy either of these games I strongly recommend snapping it up; the combat options are excellent, the cities requiring less micromanagement than most 4x type games, and the game storyline and history that you unravel through each of the races is not only unique but incredibly detailed.\n\nThere are a few quirks with the game (trade, diplomacy, city placement), so I do suggest that the tutorial game be played through, even by the more experienced 4x gamers, just to familiarise yourself with them. The only real beef I have with the game is that there are a couple of race options that require some serious rebalancing; in the game's current state they'll kick you to the curb if you have a human player running them properly no matter what you do... except ganging up on them, which is never fun...\n\nSo all in all, I give this game a 8.5/10.

This is the initial draw for me, as other games (Civ, Endless Space) have a tendency to devolve into a click End Turn fest towards the end of the game.\n\nFirst off, the factions of the game not only are different in terms of advatages and disadvantages, they each have a wildly different playstyle. My first game was as the Necrophages, and I felt like I was literally devouring the minor tribes and faction cities that I encountered. I produced little food on my own, but pacifying vilages gave me a boost, and I could feed my slain foes to a city for a growth boost.\n\nThe second thing I like about the game is how it forces the player to think long term and also consider his opponents when decided tech choices. Each level of tech has several choices, but every 9 techs researched opens the next level, forcing you to consider stay at the lower level to reseach those magic swords you need, or going up to the next level to research the wonders of the next age. Furthermore, the overall cost of technology increases with each researched, so any time spent on low level tech beyond the necessary gain slow your progression into later technologies.\n\nThirdly, I enjoyed the game's use of resources. Endless Legend has a resource system that I feel is much better done than Civ. All tiles immediatly surrounding your city are gathered, and you can expand your city to talk advantage of strange and unusual tiles. Also, as your city grows you can assign workers who can be focused on any of the 5 major resources. This means that you can found a city where you know you will make money and use workers to compensate for the food shortage. The game also sports 6 strategic resources that are used for building unique buildings and producing advanced armor and weapons for your troops, as well as 10 luxury resources that can be gathered and then activated for empire wide bonuses.  This means that you will rarely find a resource and not be able to make use of it.\n\nEndless Legend is a run and well designed game that I will probably play long after I have beaten it as all the major factions. It sports the expected unit and faction customization, so the possibilties are limited only by your imagination. I have not yet tried multiplayer, but I hear the experience is improving. This is a solid game I can easily recommend.\n\nBarter?

I'm reviewing this at patch 0.48. With the exception of occusional crashes this game amazes me! I haven't played any previous games by these developers. Being a Sid Meirer's Civilization fanboy I loved the fantasy and diversity this this turn-based strategy game has to offer. The combat is alright but my favourite part about this games is exploration, building, settling, technologies and improving your empire. There are many resources and unqiue tiles that offer certain yeilds. Upgrading your hero (physically and with the skill tree) is essential for winning battles and exploration. Technologies are very interesting and fun to research. So far I'm loving Endless Legend!

I love 4x, but I thought Endless Space was bland and uninteresting.\n\nBut let me make this clear: Endless Legend is an incredible game that I strongly recommend.\n\nArt design, music, and worldbuilding are all fantastic.  Game balance is great considering how distinct the factions are, with many difficult decisions (unfortunately, still a lot of no-brainers as well).  There is a strong focus on war, with a chess-like wargame minigame that has incredible potential-- AI isn't quite up to par yet, but updates are promised.\n\nThis is the kind of game that has design written across it in boldface with indelible marker.  I started out scratching my head at some of their choices, but as I played, it became clear that every mechanic was carefully considered.\n\nEndless Legend is more game than simulation.  Play is streamlined.  That's a plus for some folks and a minus for others.  I generally prefer simulation, but found Endless Legend has more then enough depth,\n\nWhat's the bad side?  Frequent crashes, at least on my machine.

This is really something. Its in a completely different league from Civ or any of those space games, and not (just) because its super polished, bug free, and has awesome replayability. It has a story that drives the gameplay and factions that are unique in ways that go beyond "+5% construction bonus" and "+10 army morale bonus".\n\nThe AI is really good. Like, really good. You will be able to win on normal, but it won't be because you're roflstomping the AI into doing stupid things like sending its armies into baitstacks and declaring wars it can't win. And the difference between when you first play and when you know what you're doing will be day and night.\n\nThe bonuses in this game stack in a positive feedback kind of way--if you have enough money to buy that extra resource, you will more than make your money back, allowing you to buy that other resource to increase diplo point production so you can get that more advanced empire plan and have more money.....etc.\n\n1. Each faction really plays differently. Especially the cultists. You could win almost any kind of victory with almost any faction, but you definitely have tools available to you to make one way much easier than others. This is all draped in some really good lore that you're rewarded with by completing quests.\n\n2. The winter mechanic really drives home the whole "end of times is coming" theme.\n\n3. Battles are amazing. There is a lot of awesome character animations, tons of units, and lots of different strategies to try. Why? Because battles don't just take place on one hex, they take place on a unique battlefield every time that is drawn from the terrain of the surrounding squares. You can look up on youtube what that means, but in gameplay terms it means your units getting caught in a narrow bottleneck, archers firing down death from cliffs, armies being hemmed in so tight they can't reinforce, and flying units getting into your rear to wreck your archers are all things that can happen.\n\nBattles are also on a timer, so a smaller high quality force can definitely give a larger army some trouble. Said larger army can also then counterattack on their turn and wipe them out if they're not careful.\n\n4. Army customization is awesome and based on resource acquisition. Proper planning to get said resources, research appropriate techs, and balance costs/benefits of more expensive units are much more important than in other games. You could try to just make an army of all juggernaut titans, but it may not be the best thing to do, as they may be too slow to destroy any units in battle.\n\nBad Things:\n\nA. The endings are pretty hollow. Its like the ending of a paradox game, there's a screen that says you won and then a score screen, and thats it. I'd like at least a recap screen like civ had where it shows you how the game went over all the turns or some kind of reward, like additional lore being revealed depending on how you win. Something like WH: Dark Crusade, for example.\n\nB. The UI is good, but not excellent. Not really a bad thing, but its definitely not the smoothest interface I've ever seen.\n\nC. Thats it! I can't think of anything else bad about this game.","May 26","true","93.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Then, out of nowhere, simply because he was envious of my high standard of living and exceptionally tasteful decor, the Roving Caravans leader banned me from the Market. I was shocked to say the least. So I did what any good Vaulter would do. I killed his family, his extended family, his friends, his animals, and when he tried to diplomatically allow me access to the Market again, I razed his last city to the ground and swept his civilization into the ashpit of history.\n\nNeedless to say, I love this game. It combines all of the elements of a great 4X game, without a lot of the garbage that goes along with it. It's tough to not compare it to the Civilization series, I've been playing them since the first one came out so long ago, but to be fair, it matches up or exceeds them in most every category. It doesn't help that I was appalled with Civ 5. Having to purchase DLC to include things that were Vanilla in Civ 4 (the most well-rounded and enjoyable Civ, imo) made me weep. That and the horrific return to Civ 3 style of city building and playing... I won't touch another one unless I have a rather huge demo to try first. Personal choice though, everyone has their opinions.\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different, I highly recommend this game. The only mars on an otherwise perfect surface are the inability to raze a city immediately (there's workarounds, but it can be irritating when combined with other game mechanics), the diplomacy is pretty basic, as usual the AI hates you a lot, but I haven't experienced a Diplomatic style victory yet so I have some learning to do there, and the map can hurt you 200 turns (Endless length) in when you're looking for a specific resource and can't find it anywhere.\n\nHere's a short list of the good:\n\nExcellent music! I can't stress this enough. It's reminiscent of many other games, and I haven't had a single desire to turn it off (something I do immediately with most other 4x games).\n\nThe battle system is fun. You'll see a lot of complaints about it here and there, but I really enjoy it. There's some very minor tactical choices involved (offense vs defense), and you can ramp the speed up to high which makes them fairly speedy.\n\nThe graphics are good. I have mine set a little higher than normal and haven't had a single framerate loss or glitch.\n\nIt's stable. No crashes to date, not even a minor bug (knocks on wood).\n\nThere's enough upgrading and adjusting for your armies to keep you occupied until the endgame. Early on it can be a bit frantic making sure you have resources and dust for your troops, but it evens out later.\n\nThe UI is fairly friendly, imo at least. It offers a nice overview of your units, cities, empire, depending on your choice. There's a lot of stuff that isn't gone over in the Tutorial, but most of it is easy to figure out. I'm still finding little things here and there I didn't know about, and enjoying every minute of it.\n\nThere are a ton of ways to win the game, and each Faction is geared towards a couple of them. You can also create your own Faction, which adds more replayability than I have ever seen in a 4X game. You only have the base Factions to build from, but the options for each are pretty big.\n\nThe storyline quests for each Faction are pretty neat. Something different than "You are X leader. This is your History. Now kill someone." that is the basis for most 4X games.\n\nThe technology tree is nuts. It's basically a free-for-all setup into Eras, once you have researched X techs in Era I, you can now research Era II. There are NO PREREQUISITES! I love it. Although it is amusing to gain Tier 3 weapons when I haven't researched Tier 1 yet (quest rewards and/or I just wanted them).\n\nThe Happiness modifier for your cities is well balanced. As you research techs and improve your cities, you can grow larger. It gives the game a pretty realistic feel as far as expansion and growth. Also certain leaders (Heroes) can make your city happier along with various anomalies on the land, so careful consideration of city placement is key.\n\nIf you are still unsure, try it on one of Steam's free weekends. That's how I got hooked on the game.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","April 23, 2015","true","232.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","6","8","5","0"

You start with nothing, you end up with spaceships. Not literally, but you know what I mean. But it flips the script because you don't pick a nation with minor benefits, you pick an entire race that is completely different from the others. And these races tend to lean towards a certain playstyle, so you can choose the one you that suits how you want to play for that game.\n\nAs an example, there is a market in the game where, with the right research, you can buy the resources you don't have for that next city improvement. One of the races controls this market, and gets a cut of all the sales that go through it, and they can even ban you from it as a diplomatic tool.\n\nThe even crazier thing is you can just mix and match parts of races you like and make your own, because why not? And this gameg handles combat very interestingly. Each race has its own set of 3 units that you keep for the entire game after you research them, but you keep them upgraded with new items and you can have multiple versions ready at any time. Got a type that you made three hours ago that suck but can be pumped out in a turn? Keep it. Then make a new version that has a sword that can kill that weaker guy in one hit. Anything is possible.\n\nIts a good game, its got a lot of concepts that I haven't even touched on here, but for a short list:\nArmies can consist of multiple units that move together\nCombat works by two armies fighting, but nearby armies can join in as reinforcements\nCombat is turn based, runs on a zoomed in version of the map, and runs for 6 turns of each side\nIts basically DnD combat, with initiative and all that jazz, but it can be skipped with an automatic calculation\nHeros can be assigned to armies as an  extra super unit that give extra benefits or to a city to boost its production values\nThe world map is split into regions, and only one city can exist per region\nThere are minor factions like the city-states of Civ that can be pacified to join your empire. They then help boost production in the city of the region they are in\nThese minor factions can also be assimilated to have an empire-wide benefit and allow you to produce an entirely new type of unit that can be upgraded like the rest of your army\nA quest system, with quests being available from ruins found around the map and from minor factions to pacify them\nEach race has a main quest that, when fully completed, is a victory condition\nMany ways to win, including just making a certain amount of money or performing enough diplomatic actions\nIts a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPharazon/recommended/289130/","RPharazon","RPharazon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPharazon/","270 products in account","Cons first!\nThis game still bears the scars of being an early access game, and being developed on Unity. The 64-bit version is crashy (likely due to Unity), it has unnecessarily high system requirements (also Unity), there's some bits of the game that are still broken like a bunch of the text with the events and quests, and there's a weird sort of general feeling that the game is still not 100% complete. Unity is an awful engine and anyone reading this would be wise to avoid it if they're developing a game. On that note, I'm amazed at how well the devs of Endless Legend managed to polish that turd of an engine. Great effort.\n\nNow for the good stuff, and there are a surprising amount of good things about this game!\nThe art direction is simply fantastic. I absolutely love the art in this game, and the artists who worked on it are the best I've seen on any video game. Forget all those pretentious indie games whose main goal is to be art. This game is art, it knows it, and it feels no need to draw undue attention towards it. It's confident in what it is. It even helps the gameplay, and even though the game is hex-based, the landscape art simultaneously removes any jarring inter-hex transitions while also making a hex-grid helper overlay unnecessary. Simply amazing.\n\nThe gameplay reflects the care and attention they put on the art. It's solid 4X gameplay, every single faction plays very differently, and there's the option to make custom factions to play with and play against. The FIDSI mechanic and the way this game treats land grabbing and city/land improvements is a surprisingly good innovation on the old tired Civ-like mechanics. All strategic and luxury resources are produced on a per-turn basis with different modifiers depending on your faction and any events or quests. Very nice since it avoids the civ-style limited resource wars to prevent being locked out of certain buildings and units, but it also requires you to practice effective resource management.\n\nThe combat! I saw a lot of grumbling on reviews of this game and it made me hesitant to get it. Originally it seemed as if it was going to have combat like Endless Space, mostly just rock-paper-scissors doomstack-pushing. It was surprisingly different! On combat, armies spread throughout the surrounding landscape and it plays very much like a hex tactics game. Each unit type has different abilities, different strengths, different weaknesses, and these are all modified by your faction type, your technology, your heroes, and your customizable equipment. Equipment and heroes are customizable and you have to pay either production per unit or gold per hero, so you can have cheapo combat troops pushing forward while your expensive combat troops stay behind to finish them off. There's a surprising amount of flexibility here and it's better than most 4X games.\n\nThe quest system and the minor factions are locked together in terms of mechanics, and overall their random spread gives you something to worry about in the early-game. Not as completely horrendous and violent as pirates or barbarians or aliens in other 4X games, their pacification through quests, bribes, or destruction gives you direct bonuses if you colonize that region, and killing someone else's minor faction villages removes their bonuses from your enemy. They're another interesting strategic facet of the game.\n\nThe victory conditions are quite odd in that there's 8 of them and they cover almost every possible way you could think of winning a game like this. There's the requisite kill everything, love everything, research everything, and discover everything victories, but there's also a few odd ones like having loads of money and doing your faction's questline. Generally you'll be doing the faction questline or research victories, or an economic victory might sneak out of nowhere and win the game for you. Sometimes the AI will suddenly win an economic victory or pull a diplomatic victory off if you stop watching it. It's all very fun and has a lot of replayability compared to the conquest-dominated or research-dominated victories of Endless Space, or the conquest-dominated victories of the Civ series.\n\nOverall this is a very very solid game made by developers who have clearly shown that they can and have improved. Vastly better than Endless Space, much better than pretty much any 4X made in recent years, and overall a very good game. That's coming from someone who liked the civ series (even 4 and V), BE, and Distant Worlds. Endless Legend is a better and more solid game than any of these. Less flashy, perhaps, but excellent in its gameplay and unified direction.\n\nIf Endless Space was any indication, there will be tons of free DLC packs and patches coming out in the next year or two, followed by an expansion or two, followed by more free DLC packs and patches for people who got the expansions. A very hearty recommend! Get this game if you enjoy 4X games!","December 26, 2014","true","50.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's a few issues with buying items and sieging cities that are resolved primarily by reloading from the last autosave. A bunch of the later tier technology tree  branches are unimplemented, but honestly, you really never get a chance to reach the last era in most cases. If you're playing for an elimination victory, the game is quite likely to be over before the end of the third era (~200ish turns). I do hope they add more races and perhaps additional strategic depth as development continues. I found manual hex-combat not-that-interesting and switched to auto-resolution after the first 10 or so battles.","May 5, 2014","true","66.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll goo through things I find important.\n\nFirst off, all these features about bonus factions and mini factions like Drakens that you can get through early access will not be given to you DURING early access. You will have them, but not until later on. I decided this was important because I spent 3 separate games trying solely to find the little mini factions and all that.\n\nSecond off, there are multiple features in here that are shown, but not yet accessible- namely the tutorial mode. Thankfully, there ARE tutorials out there on youtube, and pretty good ones at that. If you're not one for tutorials, I figured out most of what the game has to offer by the time I finished my 5th game. Also not available are little things like adding friends into your game, setting your army to standby until an enemy enters it's vision, and so on. Pretty much the only feature I found to be excrutiating when left out was the tutorial, but that was most certainly due to the fact that I've never really played a game like this before, actually.\n\nThirdly, I never needed to use the CD keys-yes, there are two for the founders- so I'm not sure if I'm actually playing the most up to date version or anything.  The game still works, mind, but I'm just wondering if I'm breaking any rules. I HAVE the key. I  would LIKE to put it in, but the game isn't asking for it.\n\nNow that those three extremely important details are over with, let's go over what I like and dislike.\n\nCompliments:\n1. For a non-gaming rig like mine, the graphics are still gorgeous. Seriously, the detail in the land you will see is astonishingly good.\n\n2. The music is very much focused on ambience, except when you are manually taking part in battles and such. That said, it creates the PERFECT feel for the game.\n\n3. For an early access, they really did well with the settings. There are a ton of options focused solely on adapting the notifications system (which is so, so nice.... really, it's amazing.), but it is extensive in other areas as well. Suffice it to say you will be able to adapt the game almost entirely to your liking, when playing against AI's. I still am not sure how playing against other players will change things, but I'm looking forward to that.\n\n4. Despite the lack of tutorial, it was easy enough someone entirely new to the genre to pick up and puzzle out. After my third game (and I hadn't finished any at that point, I was just trying characters until I unlocked the 3rd Age), I was comfortable in my knowledge of it. So it's pretty intuitive if a guy like me can learn the ropes in such a short time.\n\nFor the most part, that's all I want to reveal about this game, as I sincerely want those reading to have plenty left to discover when they play it.\n\nComplaints:\n\n1. No tutorial. My biggest, most important complaint.\n\n2. This game does crash every once in a while. On the bright side, it autosaves quite often, and I'm never forced to backtrack very far when I load the game up again, so it's really just a minor inconvenience.\n\n3. I find it VERY hard to make peace with other people. For some arcane reason, they just never take that option, so it always ends up being a war. Quite annoying. That said, it's probably MY fault, I just haven't figured out why yet.\n\n\n\n...That's it. Three complaints is all I can muster against an ALPHA version. This game is so darn good that once the bugs get ruled out and all the features are there, this game is pretty much a must-have. If you read this long review, I thank you for sticking with it, and I hope it persuades you into buying it as soon as possible- it's so worth it.","May 24, 2014","true","87.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If anyone is familiar with the internet personality Angry Joe, one of his favorite things about games like this and Xcom is the ability to easily craft stories of your own. The light story elements that each race has throughought the game is a perfect setting for your own legends. For example, in my first game I played as the Broken Lords. Even as the years went on and my empire grew and flourished and waned, I had many units that lived and died. However there was one that never did. There was one group of Stalwarts that I started with when I booted up the map for the first time. This group of soldiers became a Legendary figure to my people, being the icon of our strength to all.

I love turn-based strategy games because you control the pace of play so much. In a sense this reminds me of Civ V with MUCH better graphics. The combat system is far superior to Civ as well as you (as the player) can develop the strategy for attack. It also feels much deeper than Civ as it seems (please remember, I'm only 11 hours into play thus far so my thoughts are very early...) that there are more intricacies to take into account. Bear in mind, I LOVED Civ V and could lose myself for hours in it. I have done the same with this game.\n\nI have had a couple of crashes mid-game but it is to be expected as a early access game.

Well it is just another one, with its own little spin. I'm talking about gameplay mechanics which set this game apart from the likes of Civilization or other 4X games - A few of these features might actually come as a surprise and make this game worth its while. Think of it as Endless Space, well just that suddenly different nations, alien to one another, crashlanded on a planet which already harbored life, bound to be integrated into the empires, so that one may reign supreme.\n\nRight from the start of the game you notice the differences, instead of singular troops you move whole armies, sometimes accompanied by Heroes with their own set of skills and items. Talking about items, you can create new troop layouts with better equipment throughout the game and change up the game with the resources you harvested, suddenly your basic archer squad that died to the roaming armies, now takes them on with ease.\n\nCombat itself works a lot like it does in Endless Space, just that you position your troops on uneven terrain, target your enemies and roll for iniative! - Combat itself is simulated and several armies, which stand nearby can partake.\n\nThe roaming armies I spoke of are the native races of the planet, which can be integrated to gain a minor bonus for your empire and will follow you willingly into war against your enemies.\nThe main important feature that I wish to talk about however is the founding of cities. It is alike that of Civ yet very different at the same time: The land is split into regions filled with different encampments, resources and important structures. A region becomes yours as soon as a city is founded in it. So expand your territory wisely, otherwise you might not be able to gain supremecy over your enemies, be they bots or since a recent update human players, fulfill your quest to find out the truth (Yes there is an actual storyline for each nation) and immerse yourself in a beautifully crafted game, which keeps on getting better.\nThe devs certainly know where they are going with this.\n\nCheck it out, it really is more than worth the money,\nEnoTeK.","July 12, 2014","true","82.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Period.\n\nThe Maps are broken up into regions, these regions are usually quite large and you can only build a single city in a region. However that city can be expanded multiple times until it takes over most of the region. Not sure if there is a limit to how far it can expand, have not tried it yet.\n\nCombat is very much like Civilization in that you can just let the combat take place and sit back and watch or you can fight it manually and go into a Final Fantasy Tactics like battle mode.\n\nResearch is rather streamlined and not as confusing as Civilization, you know what you are researching and what it does. There does not seem to be research chains just research what you want as long as you are in that era.\n\nAll in all I can't wait for multiplayer to get in this game.

I expected the battles to be similar to CIv 5 when I looked at the screenshots. But this is not the case. I prefer to play this game with auto battle resolution and this is no bad thing here.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable empire builder game with the focus on decision making and exploring. Which technologies do you skip and what do you research first? How fast do you expand your controlled regions and cities? How much money do you put in your defenses? Do you strive for peace or war? There are many alternate paths to victory and I enjoy the faction diversity.\n\nIn my first game I was a little disappointed with the crispness of the graphics, but thankfully this was only due to the low graphics settings that are selected by default. So my advice, crank up the settings before your first game.\n\nI stayed up late for my first game and could not wait to get up in the morning to continue my next one.

There are some differences between the two.\n\nIn Endless Legend, you have 9 aysmmetrical (completely different) factions to choose from (with the exception of 2 as far as I know), each have their own ways of obtaining victory in an easier way, much like Civ, there's Expansion, Elimination, Science, Diplomatic, and so on...\n\nUnlike most RTS's and TBS's/4Xs (Turn-Based Strategies), In Endless Legend, each faction only has 3 different military units.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: Where's the diversity?!?! BUT, the COOLEST thing about your armies is that you can change what weapons, armour, and trinkets they can have equipped, depending on what you have researched at the time, and then retrofit your current armies to have the newest equipment, adding in an RPG-like element! Also, better equipment made from different alloys you research have special properties to each of them that add damage to certain enemies (flying, infantry, etc...) or that buffs your unit or army (regen, health boost, etc...). Same goes for heroes, in which you start out with one hero, then can buy more via in-game marketplace you have to research to unlock first. Also, all armies and heros level up over time, making them more powerful, and for heros, have a skill tree.\n\nALSO, so that just 3 units doesn't discourage you; There are what's called "minor" factions that are basically neutral camps all over the different regions. If you have a city in that region, and destroy the minor faction's little base, you can assimilate them, thereby being able to produce the combat units that they create as well, so there's a lot more to it than just the 3 base units you have!\n\nPersonally, just having 3 units is so much better, so you don't have to build a crap ton of different units and worry about "what is strong/weak against what" and have a huge ordeal over it.\n\nThe combat is supremely better than Civ, being that, there's actually combat (lol sarcasm...sorta). The combat is completely tactical, meaning once you initiate a battle, you get to organize your force on the board, and then take turns targeting and attacking/defending attacks, it actually takes some tactical knowledge to win a battle! Unlike Civ, where you just send a gajillion people into one square/hexagon and hope for the best.  But if you know you're going to win a battle without any casualities (in which the game gives you statistics before you go into battle), you can auto sim the fight so you don't waste time on your turn.\n\nThere's a lot more that I would like to say, but most people won't read this far anyway.... SO:\n\nPros\n___________\n-Beautiful Graphics\n-Aysmmetrical Factions\n- Very, Very Solid Gameplay\n- Fantastic Combat System\n- The "Endless" Universe, which is freaking sweet\n- Simple Army System (3 diff military) With Awesome Equipment Interchangeability\n\nCons\n____________\n- If you haven't played Civ, it's going to take a little bit to get used to the interface and everything....but that's common sense. No turn-based game is easy the first time around.\n-There's only one faction that is preferred to win by elimination, which is perfectly fine, but they can't go to peace, an alliance, or even trade things with other factions. If you're using that faction and playing with friends you want to ally with, you're not going to be able to, unless you can pre-organize teams in the menu before starting the game (whether you can or not, i'm not sure, haven't had much time to play to find that out yet).\n- I can't think of anything else.\n\nOther Thoughts\n____________\nIn the past, I would've totally recommended Civ and I have played it a lot with a bunch of friends over time. But, Endless Legend changes everything. Don't buy Civ, buy this game, it's just better. I highly recommend it.","December 20, 2014","true","27.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's really difficult to stop playing this game!  It's not like any other 4X game I've played in the past, although it has similarities with many of my favourites, including Civilization, Heroes of Might & Magic, and Warlords 2 (an old game I used to play when I was growing up).\n\nI love that this game puts a heavy emphasis on quests, because I get bored of 4X games that are just about city spamming and conquering all opposition.  Endless Legend does not include very in-depth combat, but I feel the combat system is just right for this style of game.  In fact, almost everything in this game feels just right to me, including the excellent soundtrack.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the game is that you can rename your cities but not your heroes.  I sincerely hope they will add that feature, because it would enhance the role playing element of the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a great 4X fantasy genre game that will entertain you for countless hours, this is definitely the game for you!  Also, if you're interested in playing with a friend, I highly recommend the "Guardians" expansion pack, because it adds co-operative quests.","July 3, 2015","true","45.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Here's a short list. And don't take my word for it, you can see this stuff in countless, nay endless, reviews:\n\n-Beautiful map inspired by the opening to Game of Thrones. Best map in strategy gaming? Surely a contender. It's crack to the map lover/model builder/graphics head.\n-Factions are unique. Can't declare war with one. Feed off the slain with another. A third makes pillars and casts spells based on pain. Another can force peace on opponents. Their play is unique, and how they fit together to form the world is compelling.\n-New fangled take on the tech tree that really works and doesn't shoehorn you down avenues of research.\n-The integration of quests and other rpg elements that link to a deep lore in a way not done before. It's good writing.\n\nIf they got just one or two of these things really right, EL would deserve a spot in your library. They do all four with finesse and polish. Then theres the different approach to regional management and settling, the unique combat system that I really enjoy, the immersive story elements, and the ways that fighting can take place even in the absence of all out war, which empire builders have sorely needed.\n\nFor all these changes, Endless Legend is definitely a 4x game. You plant cities, explore the terrain looking for treasure but also questing for adventure - as the minor civs have villages that issue quests that provide rewards, allocate workers, grow your research and economy, confront other civs, make nice or make war.\n\nSomething about the world really sucks you in. There is funny mix of sci fi and fantasy elements. I am not a particular fantasy fan, but the lore and the world really feels inhabited and compelling.\n\nThere have been a number of good 4x games that have come out recently. My point here is you: can't go wrong with this one.","April 20, 2015","true","333.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has all of the staples of the 4x genre - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate and it executes well on all of those with perhaps eXterminating being the weakest of the bunch.\n\nNew innovations like wildly different tile yields combined with one city per zone makes even the placement of a new city a challenging decision. The lore is different and imaginative and each faction really requires a very different play style. Playing as certain civs in this game actually is like trying to re-learn how to play the game - they're that different (and this is a good thing). Other innovations are cool, like a more innovative tech tree. Other things may seem small but add to the enjoyment like goodie huts providing quests but these things help to provide a player some direction and the satisfaction of achieving a short term goal.\n\nI really love the graphical style of the game. It looks very different than anything else and it is very attractive. It's bright, colorful and the terrain can be used to your advantage. Music/sound is\nOK but nothing to write home about.\n\nSome players hate the winter because it's almost a forced "down time". This is somewhat true. But it also provides a sense of urgency to achieve your goals before the next winter sets in. And if you really plan correctly you can make the winter really the factor that weakens your biggest rival, making them easier to destroy the next summer.\n\nIt's by no means a perfect game. Combat is kind of dull, there's no esponiage (since fixed in an expansion), the AI can be dumb (improved in expansions) and a few other minor issues like some late-game boredom. But these don't get in the way of a truly enjoyable playing experience.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone with a passing interest in 4x games.","October 14, 2014","true","169.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Units all feel balanced (even if it IS possible to get some OP roaming armies kicking down your door in the first 20 turns) and the ability to customize heroes and units feel similar to unit customization of other 4x games by this studio, but again, more robust. To go into detail, you upgrade individual items through research, you equip basic unit types by creating new units off of your base units, then giving them equipments of differing tiers, like if you could create armies in a similar way to equiping a WOW character.\n\nAssimilating nearby cities feels like a great way to add unique races to your population, I've never seen a strategy game that had that system before.\n\nFor how the ame feels and handles, it is VERY inuitive. You never feel like its holding your hand throughout, but 4X games are plagued with hard UI and steep learning curves, something this game doesnt have. The tutorial can be skipped altogether and most people could play without issue.\n\nThe theming of the game is also very fun. I personally enjoy high fantasy lore, and this game definately feels unique while still staying true to the Tolkien feel of most good fantasy games. Monsters are varied, quests and history are detailed, and the world generation is robust and fun to explore. It is also very beautiful.\n\nFrankly it doesnt feel like an alpha stage game. Perhaps I'll run into some issues later, but for the first hour, nothing has gone wrong, and I've been having a blast.\n\nThe only thing I would suggest for this game is to include at least twice as many races to choose from, as the worlds can be massive (up to 8 players suggested) while there are only 7 player races. The studio who created Endless legend also brought one of my favourite space strategy games to life with a similar race selection, and it felt limited in the same way. There is only one race with a conquest suggested victory condition, similar to econemy and diplomacy, while there are two science races. Seems like this could be expanded, especially when the game feels so replayable. It would feel stale fighting across the ages with the same 7 races. As this game feels so much like a fantasy Civilization game, perhaps 14-20 unique races could be written (not a hard request as the requirey only a unique city, some faction art, 4 race specific units, faction questline, and traits, which is not much compared to most strategy games).\n\nThis game is also a bit of a CPU hog, for slower computers you may want to play more limited maps, but again, I experienced no great framerate drops or lag, or even freezing that I experience on comparable strat. games.\n\n\n\nReview at a glance 8/10.\n\nGreat art\nEach race feels  unique\nNew concepts that work well\nSoundtrack is sexy\nQuests are pretty metal\nUI is intuitive and easy to learn\n\nDifficulty can be erratic\nFeels limited in regards to races and units\nAI is pretty stupid, for now (think civ5 mixed with any game from this studio)","September 13, 2014","true","26.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It plays somewhat like a blend of Civilization, Endless Space and Age of Wonders 3 except it has a lot of unique mechanics going for itself with regards to how you grow your cities aswell as each in-game race having its own mechanics pertaining. For example there is a race who can only grow in population by spending "Money" or "Dust". This gives you far greater control over the growth of your empire, but you must also have to consider when and where you spend your Dust, as population is not the only thing you can spend it on.\n\nThere are also minor races in the game that you can incorporate into your empire, they give bonuses to your units depending on how many settlements of theirs you have pacified within your borders but they also give you access to other bonuses like a unique unit or two pertaining to that particular race.\n\nThose of you familiar with Galactic Civilization and Endless Space aswell as quite a few other 4x/Grand Strategy games you can fully customise nearly every aspect of your units, aswell as the technological goals of your empire.\n\nThis level of control is fairly unique and extremely engaging.\n\nI can't wait for the updates to flesh these systems out further and implement new races.","May 3, 2014","true","26.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The kind of troop management, and the variety of troops, villages, natives and vastness of the world is commendable.\n\nThese people seem to like this "endless" setting, having done a 4x fantasy, a 4x sci-fi and even a sci-fi dungeon crawler. Next i'm expecting a visual novel just to round up the genres. XD\n\nSeriously, though. The only problem that i find in this game is that it seems very forgiving. I mean i have a race  that by design is limited to >A SINGLE CITY< which i took just to see how screwed i could get in a single playthrough, yet i'm in the third era (out of 4) an i yet have to be obliterated into oblivion. And i only have the 4 troops (plus 3 militia) that you are allowed to keep in the city (plus a few roaming ones). And yes, it's the first time i'm playing this game.\n\nSo... yes, a tad too easy. But if you can forgive this thing the game itself is strangely enough full of lore to explore and full of strange sights, resources and friends to meet. It even has (weirdly enough for a 4x title) a quest system that allows you to pacifically annex neutral cities. It's weird but i dig it.","December 22, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Here's why!\n1. Graphics and Visuals: The game is beautifully designed, from the styles of each faction, to the world map. I have no complaints here, it's very well done. Not much more to say, take a look at screenshots or videos if you want to see for yourself.\n2. Soundtrack: I'm not very experienced when it comes to talking about songs, but the music of the game is as well done as the graphics. Surprisingly, a good portion of the music is relaxing, soothing even, making this a very comfortable game to play and take your time with.\n3. Lore: Each faction you play as has a story that unfolds while you play. I thought this to be a great mechanic, after playing Civ V where there wasn't much personality to who I played.\n4: Gameplay: There's a plethora of things to be working on in this. You'll have plenty to manage, from your cities to your armies, diplomacy and research. Build an army, customize each unit of the army. Hire a hero, and customize him to suit your needs. Have him become a mayor or a great leader or warrior. In combat, you can choose to play it out, or auto-resolve. When you play it out, there's actual strategy to be taken into consideration. Which units you send against who, who counters who, who has the best equipment. And yes, units get equipment. You need to make sure you've given your warriors the best armor and weapons you can. In Civ where you'd have to keep upgrading units to a more modern unit, here you get to keep your unit, but you need to make sure you're outfitting it with modern gear.\nOverall, this is a game I can feel safe about recommending. It has an occasional hiccup, but nothing too serious. (In one playthrough I ignored error messages and then when I achieved victory all I got was an error instead of victory. So don't be silly, pay attention to things like error messages popping up.) It's plenty of fun, alone or with friends.

You might say, there is no campaign, but you are missing something. Each faction has their own major questline, along with amazing lore. For instance you have to parley with 2 villages to find out more about your brothers death ( ardent mages faction). It is plain old amazing. The multiplayer is fine, as long as the host is a baby and disconnects when you start seigeing him( That sucks), but the game is in beta... They will improve multiplayer.

Erst in BETA, vorher nicht. Also wer jetzt kauft kann "nur" Singelplayer spielen. (Soll keine Kritik sein nur als Info fuer alle)\n\nUm es einfach zu sagen, dieses Game ist fuer mich der Heilige Gral dieses Spiele Genres. Nach Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilizations X-X, AoW3, traue ich mir doch zu ein wenig Ahnung von den Games aus diesem Genre zu haben. Und das was Endless Legends bietet ist einfach nur sau gut.\n\nWas auf jeden Fall mal raussticht hingegen zu allen anderen, es ist zu 100% im Fantasy Bereich anzutreffen. Keine Menschen, Zwerge, ... Ritter, Musketen, ... Volle Dosis Fantasy in diesem Game. Insekten Monster, Geister Kaiser und und und.\n\nDas Gelaende Design = DER HAMMER.

Es ist ein guter Mix gefunden worden, wo man tiefer gehen sollte, und wo eher nicht. Es ist fuer meinen Geschmack zwischen Casual und Hardcore eingereit.\n\nDie eigentlichen Staerken in meinen Augen sind Dinge wie:\n\nDiplomatie (Man braucht Einfluss um Krieg zu erklaeren, man braucht Regions um maechtig zu sein, ...)\nKampf (Man wird nicht auf ein virtuelles generiertes Kampffeld gebaemt. Man kaempft auf dem wo man steht und was man sieht.)\nWinter/Sommer (Im Winter ist das ueberleben nicht leicht und man muss sich auf seine Stadt fokusieren)\nDas Questsystem (Einmalig wie ich finde)\nMinion System (Von ausruestung bis ueber Skills alles dabei)\n\nUnd noch vieles mehr.

Endless Legend is gorgeous to look at, plain and simple. From the terrain to various info and quest pages, it all looks great. A lot of care went into making this game look good.\n\n2. There is more to a good 4X than killing the other guy, and Endless Legend delivers with complex Empire Management. From tweaking production, to long term tech planning, you can control in detail more than just where your armies are going.\n\n3. Usually, combat tends to be a chore, but no with Endless Legend. With Auto-Resolve for the "easy" battles, you can focus on the important ones instead. The Tactical battle is a hybrid of Disciples and Age of Wonders, where you control your troops, but not everything they do. Also, new techs allow you to upgrade your armies with better equipment, and you can pick different bonuses as well, but all of it done in a non-time consuming way.\n\n4. Factions do not just look different, but they actually feel different, and not in just subtle ways. At the same time, they feel balanced against one another, so every game never feels like one faction will always win. This extends to victory conditions, as each faction features their own unique quest line for victory!\n\nCons:\n1. The A.I. can be a bit bi-polar sometimes, but it is by no means stupid (usually). The A.I. can and will kick your sorry hide if you let it, so for those looking for a single player only experience, you will find the A.I. to be more challenging than the A.I. in Civilization (which I have hundreds of hours in, including Deity wins).\n\n2. Digging for information can be a minor chore, as some things are not really well explained, or obviously laid out. However, there is a lot of information and guides done by the community that are readily accessible to help you out.\n\nSummary:\nI strongly recommend Endless Legend to anyone that is a 4X fan looking for their next fix. I play both Multi-player and Single-player, so this will easily continue to be one of the games I will be pouring many hours into. It takes all of what makes a good classic 4X strategy, and adds in some refreshing twists that will not disappoint.\n\ntl;dr If you are familiar with losing an hour or more when you said "just one more turn", then Endless Legend will not be kind to your sleep habits!","March 28, 2015","true","62.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However, this game takes many of those general ideas of civilization-style games and turns them on their heads. I'll go through each of the above ratings ones by one below.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nThe first thing you notice about this game is how polished it looks. Typically, 4X games have clunky graphics, outdated UIs, and seem like they're trying too hard and failing at providing a beautiful experience. This game, however, is easy on the eyes. With wonderfully layered graphics and a depth of color, Endless Legend takes the bland look of Civ V and turns it into an artistic masterpiece. Everything is vibrant, even in the winter, and it's impossible to grow tired of the battle animations, city growth animations, etc. The integration of the world map into the playing field is also very intuitive (when you scroll out, the gameplay view slowly shifts to a tactical world map view). The world lives and grows continuously, unlike in Civ V where animations and graphics are executed in discrete, clunky motions. Endless Legend creates a world that looks and feels alive.\n\nStoryline (by itself): 7/10\nStoryline (in context of the game): 9/10\nThis game has a storyline. Strange for this type of game, but Endless Legend fits it in perfectly. In fact, if you don't want to follow the storyline, you can completely ignore the quests. However, the lore adds a sense of depth to this world much like the graphics do. Instead of feeling like an invader or a foreign entity on a playing board, the quests integrate the player into the world. As a story alone, it lacks some depth. However, the way it is integrated into the game, and compared to other games, the storyline is definitely a rare one. If you enjoy fantasy/rpg elements, then you will definitely enjoy the storyline. However, if you do not, the lore does not detract from the playing experience.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nClarification: by gameplay, I mean the "plot" of an individual playthrough. I am NOT referring to lore, controls, etc., I am referring to the events and cohesiveness of a single playthrough.\nThe gameplay is wonderful. Like all 4X games, the infinite number of possibilities in this game makes replay value extremely high. Each time you play through the game, new things happen and new interactions between other countries occur. Unlike in Civ, where AI interaction is predictable by civilization or by design, the AI in Endless Legend is less predictable from game to game. The way they react is dynamic, taking into account how you and the other players react, and not necessarily tied to their race. Thus, playing the game is a lot like being immersed in another world. As in real life, you do not know how other players are doing; you can only react to what you see (army movements, city developments, etc). Other than that, you must play diplomat and make smart choices. Once again, the gameplay is unique in that you can be in another world making your own choices; you develop your civilization to your specifications, not to the specifications that history has told you to follow.\n\nGame Mechanics: 8/10\nThe city mechanics are solid, but they lack some depth. For example, when building trade routes, the routing and trading is automated, and the only benefits you can get are gold and science. Additionally, the tech tree is less interdependent than the one in Civ V, resulting in less planning needed (and fewer conequences for researching something you don't need). Buildings also belong to the entire city, and upgrades to the city are provided throughout the entirety of the city (with the exception of wonders and strategic/luxury resources). Thus, less city planning is needed. Other than this however, the variety and scope of city upgrades, buildings, planning, etc. is huge.\n\nUnit mechanics, on the other hand, are absolutely mind-blowing. There is so much depth to heroes, including skill trees, a ton of equipment, and synergy between different types of units, land, etc. The tile control in Endless Legend is very developed, especially during battle. Battle mechanics are also very fun compared to other 4X games - it's hard to describe without trying it out yourself. Each battle, especially as they scale up to larger and larger ones, immerses you in the action.\n\nControls: 7/10\nThe controls are quite natural. Left click to select, and right click to deselect or exit a menu. Left click for unit/city actions, right click for unit movement. Scroll out for tactical/world map, scroll in for gameplay map. Drag or use your mouse/arrow keys to move the camera around. Simple and more intuitive than most 4X game controls.\n\nThe reason controls gets a 7, however, is because they can be buggy. Sometimes, when scrolling, i'll have my units pop up when I merely want a view of the territories. Other times, I'll select an army unit and pan out to plan tactical moves, and my screen will be flooded with other information. Most importantly, unit movement is buggy when not in gameplay view (i.e. when I'm in tactical/world view).\n\nMusic: 10/10\nNo need to explain. Listen to the music in some of the videos, or look it up on youtube. Absolutely sublime.\n\nContent: 8/10\nLots of content. And I mean LOTS of content. However, it is still not at the content level of Civ V (probably because it is a newer game). After around 25 hours of exploring the game, however, I feel as if I have seen most of what this game has to offer. While this game certainly has high replay value, the lack of deep content, more varied AI, etc. makes it peter out. However, the lore, faction quests, and DLC quests provide quite a lot of extra content to explore. On top of that, the different combinations and orders of building, exploring, fighting, etc. makes the content more than enough. The depth of the gameplay and immersion makes content an 8 because the buildings, terrain, tech, etc. that the game provides are extended upon through their varied uses.\n\nSummary:\nOverall, a great game. For me, even at $10 more than Civ V for the full game + DLCs, this game would be a must-buy purely for the immersion that comes from the music, graphics, rpg aspect, lore, etc. However, if you are more into games with depth of content and strategy and do not care as much for immersion, buy this when it is on sale (for $50 or less for Endless Legend Collection). One final note: if you care, even the slightest, for feeling like part of the game, whether it be due to music or graphics or rpg aspect or lore or anything for that matter, then this game is a must-buy. Otherwise, it's still highly recommended that you try it out.","January 31","true","24.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It is comparable to Civ in some senses but the differences are what makes this game worth it.\n\nThe graphics are amazing and the varying visuals for each faction gives the feel you would want from a fantasy game.\nThere are less factions than there are in Civ, but each one changes the gameplay so much that it makes the race to victory different every time you play. For example one faction gains less food but makes up for it by being able to earn stockpiles (worth ~100 food) by killing enemies. Another faction can only build 1 city but can recruit minor factions to work for them.\n\nThere are many paths to a victory and it can range fom 150 turn games to 300 turn games or even more.\nEach faction has their own quests in addition to the general quest that everyone recieves, and there are even group quests that all factions can take part in or sometimes race over.\nYou can also choose wether you want to control the fights or if it is a clear win you can automate the fight.\n\nA learning curve as it is a very complex game. A point system shows how far each team is in their development, but do not fear if you fall behind a few points as there will be chances to catch up by paying attention to the strong points of your faction and work with that.\n\nThere are also regions that you settle in, and once that region is taken it is owned by the person who owns that settlement. That is until another faction takes over so making sure to have units defending the base is essential, since if they attack and you only have the militia to defend then there goes a while city of income.","May 25","true","101.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

While unit Type A defeats unit Type B in Civilzation, here you create and customize your own army, equipping them with a variety you receive from quests and from production. While Civilization's focus isn't on combat and more on build order and adapting to the environment, Endless Legend keeps in stride with interesting land improvements and incredibly unique races to play as.\n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of the Broken Lords. They look pretty sweet, and they grow from dust - the currency like gold you'd normally use to just hurry production. As a result, you don't need to worry about food but instead need to constantly manage dust, which is now used for everything from hurrying production and gaining citizens to healing your troops on the field and improving their gear.\n\nIt's a hefty price-tag for something in alpha, but the game is very playable and has yet to crash / glitch on me. I'm honestly having more fun with this than I am in Civilization V.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=780Fu2V_17U","April 25, 2014","true","32.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I don't write very many reviews, more than likely because I generally haven't felt compelled enough to rate mediocre products or I simply haven't been captivated enough to say yay or nay; but this product definately deserves attention.\n\nFor those of you out there who are used to the typical 4k-esk game, prepare to have your minds blown with concepts that are some of the most interesting means of progression I have ever seen. Research is done in teirs, every single technology costs the exact amount of research points to aquire, and you can aquire any of the researches in a teir in any order you want, no wasting time learning military tech to unlock useful social tech; if you're not the combatant type. But, here's the catch: every time you research something, the cost for the next thing gets higher, and when you research enough of one teir, you unlock the next, allowing a form of non-linear progression that I've frankly never seen in any game to date.\n\nCity Progression and Expansion have also taken an extremely unique approach as well, In Endless Space, a common issue was being unable to expand your empire fast enough to have enough planets to defeat larger expansionists, Turtling or having a small but strong empire was not really an option. In this game, there are two very unique ways to expand, Either by spreading out and colonizing, as per usual; or city growth. Unlike in Endless Space, your cities can in theory grow to unlimited sizes by building expansions onto them, when you surround an expansion with 4 other expansions, it levels up. To get a level 1 city to level 2, put 4 expansions around it, to get your city to level 3, put 4 level 2 expansions around it, which require another 4 level 1 expansions around that. Each level exponentially increases the power of your city's output, so focusing on making one city a super city is compeltely viable, and can really pay off.\n\nConsidering for a moment this game isn't even halfway completed, It's probably the best investment you could make in early access on steam, assuming you like empire ruler 4k type games. I haven't even scratched the surface of explaining all the interesting but easy to understand mechanics of the game. Let's just say the rest are just as mindblowing and interesting by comparison to other games. This is no clone title, there's no repitition here, instead an entirely unique and utterly interesting fantasy empire building experience that you will not be able to stop playing once you start.\n\n10/10, I will eat my beard if you buy this and don't immediately love it.","April 28, 2014","true","193.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's the blandest combat system out of any 4X fantasy or medieval game I've ever played in my life: from early games like Master of Magic and Lords of the Realm, to Dominions, Warlock, Eador, Stronghold, Total War, Age of Wonders, Disciples, even Civilization in the early ages - they're all better combat systems, where I get to build at least some units that I enjoy fighting with.\n\n3.

The research feels unbalanced and fairly game-y: the cost increases with each previous research item you get, so you can never use your superior research power to clean up the simpler items you've skipped. It's somewhat like an RPG where the enemies always feel the same because they're scaled to your level. Meanwhile many late-game techs are inferior to early game items.

Combat is also different and more interesting, with armies moving as one and then breaking up into their component parts when a fight starts. So rather than just click to attack, there is a 6-round battle that requires strategy and tactics.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to recommend as well. The game is simply gorgeous.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marianneasteri/recommended/289130/","marianneasteri","Mari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marianneasteri/","164 products in account","Endless Legend is like Civilization but not really.\n\nIt does use the same hex tile map system as Civ does but the gameplay itself is rather different. For instance, the combat is not just command unit here, numbers decrease and something dies.\n\nYou get the option to command your individual units as they fight and the battle itself takes place on the world map. The commands themselves are rather limited but still involving and your decisions may change the course of the battle since the AI is a bit questionable at times. Or you could just select autoresolve.\n\nThe factions are also interesting. Every single faction is unique in aesthetic and lore and each comes with their own questline which you can complete or ignore. Their story is told through the questing and is done in a way which adds to the gameplay; you are not punished if you don't complete the quests but you are rewarded if you do. The quests also break the monotony somewhat by giving you a goal to build toward.\n\nAsymmetric gameplay is also implemented very well. All factions have handicaps and bonuses, some of which seem rather extreme at first glance and yet, if one plays them skillfully, each has an equal possibility of winning.\n\nThe main complaint that I have with this game is the learning curve. Certain mechanics are not explained very well like the district levelling system where your city districts level up when there are three or more districts built adjacent to it. I only found that out after doing a little reading on the Amplitude Studios forums. And at the time of writing, I still haven't figured out how to traverse the oceans even though I know there are ships in the game.\n\nIn summary, I would definitely reccommend this game if you enjoy a good Civ style 4X turn-based strategy game or would like a Civ style 4X strategy game but found it a little too dull.","October 1, 2014","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/recommended/289130/","TBoneBeaurone","Gentleman T-Bone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/","297 products in account","This game kind of resembles a fantasy version of Civ in the Endless universe that Amplitude has created. There are a lot of cool tie-ins with their other games which is great if you were also a fan of Endless Space. This game plays a little bit like civ, but instead of trying to force your armies through choke points over a span of countless turns, you can group your units similar to creating fleets in Endless Space. While there is a limit to how many in a stack, this greatly reduces the headache of managing large forces.\n\nThis brings me to the excellent combat system. When an engagment occurs, the units stacked in your army get set up in your half of the battlefield. The battlefield is just a part of the map which gets sectioned off for the battle, so the terrain you fight on is still the map terrain itself. Things like height and tile type play a role still but it allows armies to be set up specificially for engagements. The battles use a turn based system which allow you to give orders that more resemble suggestions ( there's a degree to which units will decide what to do when reaching a tile you command them to, or set a default stance when an order can't be completed because of the simultanious turn system ). Despite that sometimes your forces will do things that make you cringe, it has never been a problem for me to take advantage of terrain with smaller forces and win by exploiting it in this system. Additionally, any forces in range will slowly join the battle if you have secondary armies available in the area. This immediately put this game well above Civ in my books. Not that warfare is necessary. It is still usually a large part of the 4x experience.\n\nAlso excellent, is that while unit variety is lacking on a per/faction basis. You can buy units from a market from minor factions, or assimilate them into your empire allowing you to customize and train their units. The lack of variety is also made up for by the ability to fit them with weapons and armor to suit your requirements for them ( including multiple fit types on the same unit model ). If it becomes obsolete, when you edit their design you can pay to retrofit just like in endless space. This allows for a fairly wide range of approaches.\n\nIf you played Endless Space, a huge difference you will notice is that heroes commanding armies take up arms on the battlefield. They can be combat or support oriented allowing you to play with their tactics a fair bit. They can be equiped with different weapons and armor as well. They will have some stats that influence the entire army ( some equipement serves this purpose as well ) in addition to their more direct involvement. They can be taken down requiring a player to pay to have them revived.\n\nThe factions are diverse, but explaining everything would be better left to a guide. That said, you may also customize a faction by picking a base faction then choosing attributes. Most will have a cost associated and you can pick up negative traits to give you a bigger budget for positive ones.\n\nIf you enjoy fantasy and 4x games, you can't possibly go wrong with this game. It's a ton of fun with several elements that eliminate some of the minor annoyances I've had in games like Civ. This and endless space will probably remain top of my list regarding 4x titles for quite some time.","September 27, 2014","true","176.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plenty of developers try new twists on the standard formulas, with mixed success.\n\nAmplitude, the studio behind Endless Legends, has had some pretty good results with some of their changes. Their "tech web" from Endless Space has clearly influenced Civ:BE, and I think they're on to some really interesting innovations in Endless Legends that we might see pop up elsewhere in the future.\n\nTheir region and city-building system is really interesting and complex. It takes a lot of getting used to. They also have fully customizable units - you can really specialize your unit choices to your own needs. It's really well-done. Even their approach to the tech tree is innovative... you'll often choose many important techs each time through, but I can't imagine always using the same optimal path like you would in Civ for example.\n\nHeroes and missions are also interesting and well-implemented. The reliance upon minor factions to round out your army, provide empire buffs, and bolster your workforce is also very cool. And have I mentioned that there are a ton of resources, each with unique qualities, that are actually relevant? It's crazy.\n\nOf course the game isn't perfect. The AI needs some work, it does well at the start but before long the player can easily out-perform the computer. Amplitude was very good about supporting Endless Space and improving the AI and other features, so I am confident in the future. However if you chose to exploit the AIs weaknesses you can run them over pretty easily. Of course, there's also a lot of customization that can be done in the pre-game menu, so an argument could be made that you could set paramaters up enough to hinder yourself and boost the AI... but really that's a big workaround for what should be in the game already.\n\nThe game has huge potential but currently (9/28/14) it still has some room to grow. I'd recommend buying it if you're a fan of the genre, although waiting for the AI to improve wouldn't be the worst decision. It shouldn't take too long.","September 28, 2014","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even after sinking hours and hours into the game, the background music still hasn't gotten old, and I often zoom in on the map as far as I can to examine the landscape and units.\nSecondly, each faction brings a unique style of play that adds a lot to the replay value of the game. Each has a focus (industry, science, war, diplomacy, money, etc.), like what you would expect from different factions in a 4X game. Endless Legend takes it a little bit further, however, to make the gameplay much more asymmetrical. For example, the Necrophage, a zerg-like bug race, has no diplomacy options, and is always at war. On the other end of the spectrum are the Roving Clans, who cannot declare war, and focus on trade and controlling the market. In addition, the factions in Endless Legend avoid typical fantasy cliches very well. Many of them are familiar races with a twist to them. For instance, the Wild walkers, the game's elves, are focused on industry and construction, and the Drakken, or dragons, are great diplomats.\nSpeaking of which, the only main grievance I have with Endless Legend is with its diplomacy. It seems very bare-bones, with only limited functionality. You can trade, declare war, make peace and alliances, trade and research agreements, and compliment or denounce other factions. However, it is not possible to ask for one faction to interact with another. For example, you can't ask a faction to denounce or declare war on another, like what you can do in the Civilization games. Additionally, the decisions the AI makes often make little sense. I was 'blood brothers' (very friendly) and allied with a faction once, but only several turns later they declared a cold war on me, and I couldn't even find out why. Along the same line, the AI's dialogue is often very generic, and gives little to no hint of why it is deciding to reject my treaty proposal, or leave the alliance, or warn me about my 'attitude'.\nDespite the flaws of Endless Legends, its pros far outweigh its cons. The game's eventually mod support will definitely help with some of its lacking aspects, as well. Overall, this is a great game that is well worth the $35.","September 24, 2014","true","134.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri was the last one I can remember.) So bear with me.\n\nI got started here the other day and loved the concept instantly. I started a city in a decently rich environment and expanded to the south.

Right now the art of what is implemented is there and it looks impressive. Learning the game and each race you should feel pretty good and it definitely has more to do than AoW3 even at this early stage. However, once you put in the time and you figure out a good build order and expansion balance, this game will quickly be very easy and boring to play. Right now by the time you get into the 2nd tech tree, you can create two armies and just go rampage the AI.\n\nWhen this goes live, or as it develops, however some things are going to have to happen to make this even worthy of comparing it to Civ 5. The aggressive AI is admittedly not implemented yet, but it will need to consistently challenge the player. Currently there are no victory conditions other than military dominations, something that will change. Currently there are no settings that increase the difficulty at all. You can barely get through the middle of the tech tree before the game ends on turns.\n\nAnother problem that good players will struggle with is the differences between the races. When you first start they are huge differences. Broken lords do not use food at all and rely on dust. Necrophages have to kill to get food. Others get science bonuses. However, when you get to the point where you are good at this game, the differences between the races merely alter where you focus your population at each stage of the game. The differences are really minor at best. The quests and goodie huts get stale and repetitive as you play a lot of this game as well. Hoping that the minor factions play a bigger role as time goes on.\n\nIf you are used to a Civ 5 type game, where you use the terrain, leader and terrain type to gauge what victory condition you're going to go for..... this is going to be disappointing to you at this stage and the potential is still probably going to fall short. However, some things are going to be much better than Civ 5, such as the ability to create custom units using any of the basic (or assimilated) unit types. There are some terrible balance issues right now (i.e. ranged units dominate currently), but you can equip your units with serious fire power (at a cost, however). The map turns into your battlefield and the manual combat, when implemented properly, has the potential to make the strategy of moving about the map just as important as the battle itself. In civ 5 the game is won or lost in the first two eras. This game, however, picks up steam and has a lot of better late game potential if it didn't end so early.\n\nMicromanagement is a 4x "flaw." In civ 5 worker and population management can be a downside for some. The same is true for this game. Standard exploits are present already where if a building/research project is one turn away, you literally have to go into the city and move population from production to another area so you can take advantage of the 1 turn bonus in that other area from moving them. THEN, once the project is completed, you have to move the population back. This gets tiresome when you have over 5 cities, and this game (unlike civ 5) benefits from as many cities as you can manage without going into rebellion.\n\nI can definitively say this is already better than AoW3. But I can also say that it will never have the depth of Civ 5. Time will tell whether they get close enough to make it worth a fraction of the 1000+ hours I've already put into Civ.","May 6, 2014","true","27.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have to say, they have really knocoked my socks off with this game; the UI is crisp and clean, easy to follow, and will be easier when the tutorial is added.\n\nThat being said, it does lack a tutorial at the moment, so not having experience with Endless Space would be a bad thing with this game. The two games play very much alike, although I prefer the lore and atmosphere of Endless Legend far more than its sister.\n\nAs of this moment my pros for the game are as follows:\nEasy to get in to\nAmazing Lore and artwork, as to be expected.\nBeautiful terrain\nFar better combat systems when compared to Endless Space (my opinion)\nWell-implemented Empire quest system\n\nThe current cons are few but present:\n\nLaughable Diplomacy: I excuse this on the grounds that this is early access, but as this game nears release I will start harping on it more frequently. The current cost of diplomatic action (devs and current players will know what I mean) is a grand idea, but the system seems rather broken at this time. I have often encountered AI empires and attempted negotiations with them, only to have war declared on me a few turns later. AI seem to ignore any attempts at diplomatic relations, as far as I have seen.\n\nLack of Victory Condition Options: I assume this will come in the future, but for the past three games I have lost due to one of the AI reaching a score limit. The scenario is set to default, however the setting leaves out what victory conditions that entails. Conquest is a given condition, but score capacity? I'd like to know what the max score is that players have to reach to win.\n\nSieges: Sieges are a great addition, but they don't make much in the way of sense. They cut off all benefits from the besieged city, but sicne cities don't seem to ever be conquered by them (as far as I have noticed), they seem rather pointless.\n\n\nIn closing, this is an amazing game that has some flaws due to it being in development. Amplitude is an awesome studio that makes awesome games; furthermore, this game has a TON of potential, and they seem to be doing most everything right for now. I can dream that this becomes a well known 4X, since it has already consumed some number of my personal hours with its immersive lore, quests, and warfare. I believe this game is a worthy investment, especially in the Founder's edition, which I purchased myself. Great game, great mechanics, it's like someone in Amplitude is making their own universe a reality, something I can appreciate and admire.\n\n9.5/10(InDev Score)","April 29, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For instance, technically there are only 4 units per race (one of those being a settler unit, which doesn't quite count). You aren't even guaranteed to have one of every type of unit (flying, infantry, ranged, and cavalry). However, you are able to absorb minor native races into your own, granting you access to many new units. Plus, rather than all units being the same, you are allowed to pick and choose items for them, as well as making entirely new styles of a unit based on the basic unit blueprint. So you could have one cavalry meant to move fast and hit hard, while another is meant to soak up damage. So in this way, compared to Civ there is an infinite number of units, in a slightly less straightforward way.\n\nA couple of other features take getting used to, even if you have played Endless Space before (though it does carry on a quite a few things from Endless Space). There are a few things I don't entirely agree with (the diplomacy mechanic could use some work), and definitely some things that need some work or expansion, but based on Endless Space I would say the developer will patch the game quite a bit. Plus the graphics are very, very eye-catching. I think this is the first game I’ve actually paused to look at the graphics.\n\nEdit: Thought I would add this about anyone who was concerned about things that are lacking at the moment. In the forums, they did a Q&A and answered a number of questions about where the game was headed and whether they will continue updating and expanding it like they have done with Endless Space.\n\nhttp://forums.amplitude-studios.com/showthread.php?36196-Q-amp-A-Ask-us-(almost)-anything","September 29, 2014","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/recommended/289130/","TBoneBeaurone","Gentleman T-Bone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/","297 products in account","This game kind of resembles a fantasy version of Civ in the Endless universe that Amplitude has created. There are a lot of cool tie-ins with their other games which is great if you were also a fan of Endless Space. This game plays a little bit like civ, but instead of trying to force your armies through choke points over a span of countless turns, you can group your units similar to creating fleets in Endless Space. While there is a limit to how many in a stack, this greatly reduces the headache of managing large forces.\n\nThis brings me to the excellent combat system. When an engagment occurs, the units stacked in your army get set up in your half of the battlefield. The battlefield is just a part of the map which gets sectioned off for the battle, so the terrain you fight on is still the map terrain itself. Things like height and tile type play a role still but it allows armies to be set up specificially for engagements. The battles use a turn based system which allow you to give orders that more resemble suggestions ( there's a degree to which units will decide what to do when reaching a tile you command them to, or set a default stance when an order can't be completed because of the simultanious turn system ). Despite that sometimes your forces will do things that make you cringe, it has never been a problem for me to take advantage of terrain with smaller forces and win by exploiting it in this system. Additionally, any forces in range will slowly join the battle if you have secondary armies available in the area. This immediately put this game well above Civ in my books. Not that warfare is necessary. It is still usually a large part of the 4x experience.\n\nAlso excellent, is that while unit variety is lacking on a per/faction basis. You can buy units from a market from minor factions, or assimilate them into your empire allowing you to customize and train their units. The lack of variety is also made up for by the ability to fit them with weapons and armor to suit your requirements for them ( including multiple fit types on the same unit model ). If it becomes obsolete, when you edit their design you can pay to retrofit just like in endless space. This allows for a fairly wide range of approaches.\n\nIf you played Endless Space, a huge difference you will notice is that heroes commanding armies take up arms on the battlefield. They can be combat or support oriented allowing you to play with their tactics a fair bit. They can be equiped with different weapons and armor as well. They will have some stats that influence the entire army ( some equipement serves this purpose as well ) in addition to their more direct involvement. They can be taken down requiring a player to pay to have them revived.\n\nThe factions are diverse, but explaining everything would be better left to a guide. That said, you may also customize a faction by picking a base faction then choosing attributes. Most will have a cost associated and you can pick up negative traits to give you a bigger budget for positive ones.\n\nIf you enjoy fantasy and 4x games, you can't possibly go wrong with this game. It's a ton of fun with several elements that eliminate some of the minor annoyances I've had in games like Civ. This and endless space will probably remain top of my list regarding 4x titles for quite some time.","September 27, 2014","true","176.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plenty of developers try new twists on the standard formulas, with mixed success.\n\nAmplitude, the studio behind Endless Legends, has had some pretty good results with some of their changes. Their "tech web" from Endless Space has clearly influenced Civ:BE, and I think they're on to some really interesting innovations in Endless Legends that we might see pop up elsewhere in the future.\n\nTheir region and city-building system is really interesting and complex. It takes a lot of getting used to. They also have fully customizable units - you can really specialize your unit choices to your own needs. It's really well-done. Even their approach to the tech tree is innovative... you'll often choose many important techs each time through, but I can't imagine always using the same optimal path like you would in Civ for example.\n\nHeroes and missions are also interesting and well-implemented. The reliance upon minor factions to round out your army, provide empire buffs, and bolster your workforce is also very cool. And have I mentioned that there are a ton of resources, each with unique qualities, that are actually relevant? It's crazy.\n\nOf course the game isn't perfect. The AI needs some work, it does well at the start but before long the player can easily out-perform the computer. Amplitude was very good about supporting Endless Space and improving the AI and other features, so I am confident in the future. However if you chose to exploit the AIs weaknesses you can run them over pretty easily. Of course, there's also a lot of customization that can be done in the pre-game menu, so an argument could be made that you could set paramaters up enough to hinder yourself and boost the AI... but really that's a big workaround for what should be in the game already.\n\nThe game has huge potential but currently (9/28/14) it still has some room to grow. I'd recommend buying it if you're a fan of the genre, although waiting for the AI to improve wouldn't be the worst decision. It shouldn't take too long.","September 28, 2014","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The timeline is unclear, in case you are interested in the backstory) of Endless Space and bears distinct similarity with its predecessor. Basically, it is a mixture of Civ5 and HoMaM set in a fantasy world (an industrialized fantasy world).\n\nThe game itself is more oriented towards empire building rather than combat; however, you will fight a lot, especially on higher difficulties, where the beefed up AI tends to rush you. EL utilizes the same resource system as ES, also known as FIDS (food, industry, dust, science); this time, we also have an additional resource called "reputation", which you can spend in dealing with other factions, minor factions or on focusing your empire via long time buffs. The strategic and luxury resources are also present - strategic resources are spent on upgrading your units and heroes or building particular structures in your cities; luxury resources, when activated, give a 10-turn long buffs.\n\nThe world map is divided into regions you can colonize. Each region can hold only one city and a player in control of such settlement controls the resources in that region. As the city population increases, you have an option to expand the borders of your city (not the region) to make the city more productive. Also, the city sprawl looks very quaint :). There are season changes present in Auriga - summer shifts into Dark season. As you progress through the eras (research and development of your empire), the Dark season ultimately lengthens to a point where summer lasts only a few turns (kind of a soft cap).\n\nCombat is more engaging than in ES, though it is clearly not a main focus of the game. Every turn, you can give orders to your units and when you are done, your minions try to carry those orders. You are unable to interfere when the combat round is proceeding, therefore you need to consider the initiative (the order in which all units act) and terrain - if you order your unit to attack an enemy unit that acts first and retreats, your unit can end up in the middle of enemy army trying to pursuit its target.\n\nEach race can build and deploy three unique units (and a settler); by assimilating a minor race into your empire, you get an option to produce the respective unit (upgrade it, too). If you have enough dust, you can hire mercenaries from the marketplace, but those cannot be upgraded.\n\nHeroes have three skill trees now - army focused (blue), city focused (orange) and general (green). An experienced hero presents a significant boost to your city output (based on the skills taken of course) or for your army. When leading an army, the hero doesn't take a spot in the army cap, but is still deployed on the battlefield as a "free" (an powerful) unit.\n\nRaces are quite diverse, with their own unique storylines and special abilities. If you are not happy with the options presented to you, you can create your very own race.\n\nThere are currently two big flaws with the game:\n\n1. Optimalization - the game runs smoothly until you attempt Impossible or Endless difficulty on any of the 4-8 maps. The computer tends to stack massive amounts of dust and other resources, along with building large armies. Having a few AI opponents alive doing this results in game freezes, when the game simply refuses to load - I was once waiting for 40 minutes for a safe to load, since it was a scenario on endless difficulty where I was doing well. After said 40 minutes the game still did not load and thus I gave up. Mind you, I have a decent computer that runs smoothly significantly more advanced games. Apparently, this is a known issue, so hopefully a patch will be issued soon.\n\n2. AI - on lower difficulties, AI tends to be sloppy, not building proper defences to its cities, not maintaining decent armies or researching military projects. The AI will still attack you, but if you survive the initial onslaught, you are likely to take all the cities you desire at your leisure. In ES, I liked the fact that in order to conquer a planet or the whole system, you need a large invasion fleet along with your warships - in EL, you are usually opposed just by rather pathetic militia units. In my latest game on serious difficulty, each of my army stacks took one big sprawling city IN ONE TURN, destroying the whole AI empire that had more score points than me in 5 turns.\nOn higher difficulties, namely Impossible and Endless, the AI is ridiculously buffed. Forget about overtaking the AI economically or scientifically, unless you keep conquering its cities, which is not easy, given the units and heroes are buffed as well. Civilisation used this way of managing difficulty too and I do not like it - it is a lazy way how to provide you with some degree of challenge instead of programming smarter AI.\n\nAll in all, a worthy successor of Endless Space; Endless Legend can proudly stand on its own and provide you with hours and hours of good, turn-based fun.\n\n8/10","September 26, 2014","true","182.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pantsmotronian/recommended/289130/","pantsmotronian","Tontoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pantsmotronian/","244 products in account","Reviews? I do those?\n\nI’m a big fan of Amplitude Studios. Actually, I’m a big fan of Microprose which is what Amplitude Studios dresses up as every Halloween.  When Microprose failed and took fan favorites like Master of Orion or Master of Magic with it, they left an enormous gap in the 4x turn based strategy world.  Endless Legend fills that gap, but it doesn’t do much more with it.  This is the evolution that genre fans will appreciate, not the revolution that 4x games need to reach beyond their predecessors.\n\nAny Civilization player will appreciate the basics of Endless Legend. The player starts off with a small army and a settler with which to found an empire and explore the world of Auriga.  The army, with a hero unit in the lead, explores ancient ruins to gather crucial resources for the opening turns and becomes a powerhouse army later.  Battles are grid based affairs which the player can also auto resolve should they face overwhelming odds.  Meanwhile, the city back at home is researching technology, developing resources, building units, and generally focusing on whatever victory condition the player has decided to go for.  Victory conditions are the fairly standard with only the quest based version offering any substantial difference.  If you’ve played Civilization or Stardock’s Fallen Enchantress, you have a good idea of what to expect.\n\nThis is not to say that Endless Legend is totally derivative. It has a number of small and large changes that keep it feeling fresh.  Among the most prominent is the division of the world into territories.  Each territory may host one city and that city reaps the benefits of the resources within the territory.  Territories also host minor races which generate monsters if unpacified and or provide workers for the territory capitol if pacified.  Another twist is the winter.  Auriga’s winters last for a varying number of turns and grind production and movement to a halt.  In the early game, reduced movement and production are frustrating, but later in the game the player gets some tools to adapt and thrive.  Winters can have game changing effects by slowing wars in full swing and slowing building momentum.  Adapting to this mechanic is one of the key ways to regain the advantage in a losing conflict.\n\nFactions deserve special mention as they are varied in their aesthetic design as they are in their gameplay. Each faction has something beyond the usual focus on a given victory condition.  For example, the Cultists only get one city, but they can convert minor races to provide resources and produce military units.  The Drakkan can force opponents to accept truces and other diplomatic proposals.  The powers feel unique and help set the races apart.  The different play styles, combined with the story telling quests, encourage repeated playthroughs to see all that Endless Legend has to offer.\n\nA few problems do creep up. The AI isn’t particularly aggressive, even when it has a substantial advantage.  I played most of a game having only a small army on hard and wasn’t challenged until I had almost won.  This is aggravated by the ability to upgrade units.  Like Endless Legend’s predecessor, Endless Space, the player can upgrade their units with new equipment to create a more powerful unit. I often created a single upgraded doom stack which scared away most of my competitors.  Combined with a powerful economy to purchase units and an aggressive AI can become a frightened kitten with one round of army buying.\n\nThe issues are ultimately small and don’t address the broader issue that 4x games face today. As much fun as Endless Legend is, it still feels like a contemporary of the 4x masterpieces from long ago.  It’s becoming clear that developers will need substantially new ideas to push the genre forward and prevent it from stunting….eventually.  For now, Endless Legend is a polished and fun experience.  Go play.\n\n\nhttp://minddecline.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/review-endless-legend-pc/ [/url]","September 22, 2014","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was easier to understand than Endless Space though I do like that one also due to the very good tutorial in Endless Legend.  I went through the complete tutorial as it explains how to do everything in the game.  The game is very much Civilization like in that you build the buildings and military you want in your city.  You can also grow your city larger by building Boroughs.  Each section or area of the map can contain only 1 city so there is no need to figure out the spacing between your cities.  There are a variety of races to choose from.  Each Race only has 3 different Military units that you can build but if you Assimilate a Minor Faction you can also build their military units also.  You can also upgrade the 3 Different Military unit choices you have with better weapons and armor and items which all the units of that type that you build in the future will have.  Your Armies or cities can also be led by heroes who level up and gain new abilities when they do through the assigning of skill points.  You can taylor your Hero to be better at giving a city food, dust or production for instance or you can make your hero a Military killing machine by making the armies he leads have greater life or attack , etc.  Heros and other units can also engage in quests through exploring ruins which adds a small role playing element to this beautiful 4X strategy game.  Everything is turn based and you can fight combat in turn based mode to have more control or just put it on Auto combat.  At first I fought everything in turn based combat to micromanage my troops but I found it sped up the game by going to automatic combat and the computer did a pretty good job of accessing losses.  You also have faction quests you can complete and if you finish them you can build a wonder and win the wonder victory.  I highly recommend this game for any gamer but especially those who like Sid Meier's Civilization games.  This game is far better than Beyond Earth and Endless Space is far better than Beyond Earth.  This games compare more favorably to the actual Civilization titles like Civ 5, civ 1, 2,3,4.\nI have played 236 hours and have all the achievement now so I  am moving on to another game.  I have enjoyed my playtime on this game very much however.  The game at first had many lock ups and bugs when the game would go on longer but I think the developers have been doing a very good job fixing bugs and I haven't had a game lock up or kick me out in some time now.  GREAT GAME.  Also the game has a Summer and Winter season and you have to plan for the winter season or you could be in trouble as production, dust, etc go down during the winter and movement is slowed.","February 21, 2015","true","242.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Relevant text removed.\n\nEndless Legend isn't totally without flaws, but it's nonetheless a great fantasy 4X that's well worth your time and money. It's one of the most creative strategy titles I've seen in a long time.\n\nPros:\n\n- The battle system. Battles in this game play out on a grid laid on top of the area where the armies met. Each side then gets 6 turns to destroy the other in a TRPG-esque battle. Dramatically more powerful armies are still practically guranteed a win, but the extra level of control is nonetheless appreciated versus the random chance combat common in other titles.\n\n- Faction creativitiy. All of the games 7 distinct factions (The Mezari and Vaulters are just a reskin) have very different playstyles and interesting traits. The Roving Clans, for instance, are unable to declare war, but are able to unilaterally ban opponents from global trade and to pick up and move their cities. Other creative abilities include the Ardent Mage's productivity boosting temporary towers, the Draken's forced diplomacy, and the Vaulter/Mezari teleport.\n\n- The Summer/Winter system. The game world has two seasons that alternate in inexactly predicted intervals. Summer has no effect on the game, but Winters penalize nearly every aspect of the game and grow increasingly harsher and longer as time progresses. They're completely capable of destroying your economy or wrecking a military action if you don't plan ahead during the summer.\n\n- The tech tree. It isn't actually a tree. The game is instead divided into eras. When you're in an era, every tech in it or an earlier one is immediately researchable. Advancing to the next era requires discovering a number of technologies significantly lower than the number you have available, and each tech discovered increases the cost of every other one. This creates a very interesting dynamic where equally advanced players can have almost no shared technologies. Choosing what to research and when is extremely important.\n\n- The UI. Anyone who's played other Amplitude games was likely expecting this. They've once again done a fantastic job in making everything quickly accessible without over cluttering the screen or making anything too small. Other devs could learn a lot from them.\n\n- Lots of other mechanics I can't adequately describe here. City management, diplomacy, graphics, and sound are all quite nice.\n\nCons:\n\n- The AI. I'll edit this after playing at higher difficulties, but so far it's inconsistent. AI players can be very dangerous for score or expansion victories if left alone, but they're pretty useless militarily. Diplomatic relations with some factions are seemingly random. Update: The AI is still kind of crap at war, but diplomacy is much better now. Higher difficulties can be challenging.\n\n- The tutorial. It gets the basics across, but a lot of the more minor mechanics aren't explained at all. Some of it is intuitive, but there's more than a few things that won't make sense until your first game is over.\n\n\nOverall it's a very fun strategy game. If you liked Endless Space this is a must-buy, and even if you didn't I still highly recommend it.","October 1, 2014","true","37.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So around six months went by without another until a few days ago when I fired it up after enjoying a game of Endless Space (I had a similar experience with that too). This time I resolved to play through an entire game and then make up my mind. Six hours and a heavy defeat later I can safely say - Endless Legend is great. One of the best measures of a game is whether you have fun even when you lose and, while I came last in my play-through (I'm not very good at EL or ES it would appear) there came a point around three hours in when I sat back and thought 'This is really good'. I won't go into why because a lot of the reasons have already been covered in other people's reviews, but I did feel compelled to put my appreciation on record.","March 12, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's better than Civilization, better than Endless Space, and better than even Galactic Civilizations. Here's why:\n\nThe game takes place on the planet of Auriga, also featured as a bit of something special in Endless Space. From the moment you start exploring the world of Auriga from your top-down perspective, the game starts subverting your expectations with a beautiful world, incredibly diverse factions (Both in visual and gameplay terms) and a couple of new twists that distinguish it strongly from its ilk that stick strongly to the Civilization formula.\nThe game takes some getting used to if you're 4X veteran like me, but it is sweet and absorbing as homemade jam when you get into it. The learning period is not at all helped by a fairly rudimentary tutorial that fails to explain more advanced concepts within the game, but does get you used to the interface and combat mechanics. The AI is quite adequate, but hardly a mindblowing challenge, but this is something the good folk at Amplitude are working to upgrade, so i won't give too much stick for it. The positives of this game far outweigh what few ♥♥♥♥♥slaps i can send its way.\n\nBottom Line\nIt's a wonderful game to play, look at, and listen to, and if you're at all interested in turn based grand strategy, you owe it to yourself to play this.","October 28, 2014","true","31.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They do it in the same way: with hero units that can lead your armies (and here, cities), gain levels, use equipment, etc. This adds a ton of new possibilities. Combat is also different and more interesting, with armies moving as one and then breaking up into their component parts when a fight starts. So rather than just click to attack, there is a 6-round battle that requires strategy and tactics.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to recommend as well. The game is simply gorgeous. It's a pleasure just to watch the map rise out of the fog. The lore and factions are all interesting, with diverse playstyles and quests to shape your goals.  I have played thousands of hours of civ over my life, and this game now makes it all seem new again.

Futuristic Fantasy you ask? Well there are demons, as well as high tech exploitation of resources. Cool stuff if you ask me.\n\nThe game looks absolutely fantastic, and is probably one of the best looking strategy games I've played. Further, the download is under 2gb! Gameplay is deep, and rewards forward thinking and planning of city positioning.\nThe A.I. is pretty good, more predictable and more realistic than the Civ A.I., however it seems a little too passive and generally won't engage in a war unless provoked or absolutely necessary.\n\nLeading onto that, the combat system in this game is very unique and while a bit odd to come to terms with, is very intuitive and ultimately fun.\n\nSome negatives are it is a hard game to pick up. The tutorial isn't bad, and does a good job and teaching the basics but it took me a few games to fully understand how to play the game properly and well. Furthermore, the endgame seems a little messy and it's difficult to understand what needs to be done to achieve victory, but again this will come to the player who spends a few good hours tinkering with the game.\n\nOverall, a very solid game and one every strategy and 4X fan should look into!","November 7, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/recommended/289130/","TBoneBeaurone","Gentleman T-Bone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TBoneBeaurone/","297 products in account","This game kind of resembles a fantasy version of Civ in the Endless universe that Amplitude has created. There are a lot of cool tie-ins with their other games which is great if you were also a fan of Endless Space. This game plays a little bit like civ, but instead of trying to force your armies through choke points over a span of countless turns, you can group your units similar to creating fleets in Endless Space. While there is a limit to how many in a stack, this greatly reduces the headache of managing large forces.\n\nThis brings me to the excellent combat system. When an engagment occurs, the units stacked in your army get set up in your half of the battlefield. The battlefield is just a part of the map which gets sectioned off for the battle, so the terrain you fight on is still the map terrain itself. Things like height and tile type play a role still but it allows armies to be set up specificially for engagements. The battles use a turn based system which allow you to give orders that more resemble suggestions ( there's a degree to which units will decide what to do when reaching a tile you command them to, or set a default stance when an order can't be completed because of the simultanious turn system ). Despite that sometimes your forces will do things that make you cringe, it has never been a problem for me to take advantage of terrain with smaller forces and win by exploiting it in this system. Additionally, any forces in range will slowly join the battle if you have secondary armies available in the area. This immediately put this game well above Civ in my books. Not that warfare is necessary. It is still usually a large part of the 4x experience.\n\nAlso excellent, is that while unit variety is lacking on a per/faction basis. You can buy units from a market from minor factions, or assimilate them into your empire allowing you to customize and train their units. The lack of variety is also made up for by the ability to fit them with weapons and armor to suit your requirements for them ( including multiple fit types on the same unit model ). If it becomes obsolete, when you edit their design you can pay to retrofit just like in endless space. This allows for a fairly wide range of approaches.\n\nIf you played Endless Space, a huge difference you will notice is that heroes commanding armies take up arms on the battlefield. They can be combat or support oriented allowing you to play with their tactics a fair bit. They can be equiped with different weapons and armor as well. They will have some stats that influence the entire army ( some equipement serves this purpose as well ) in addition to their more direct involvement. They can be taken down requiring a player to pay to have them revived.\n\nThe factions are diverse, but explaining everything would be better left to a guide. That said, you may also customize a faction by picking a base faction then choosing attributes. Most will have a cost associated and you can pick up negative traits to give you a bigger budget for positive ones.\n\nIf you enjoy fantasy and 4x games, you can't possibly go wrong with this game. It's a ton of fun with several elements that eliminate some of the minor annoyances I've had in games like Civ. This and endless space will probably remain top of my list regarding 4x titles for quite some time.","September 27, 2014","true","176.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pdxsean/recommended/289130/","pdxsean","pdxsean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pdxsean/","111 products in account","4X has always been my favorite genre in PC games, luckily it's a popular one that has had a lot to choose from over the years. Plenty of developers try new twists on the standard formulas, with mixed success.\n\nAmplitude, the studio behind Endless Legends, has had some pretty good results with some of their changes. Their "tech web" from Endless Space has clearly influenced Civ:BE, and I think they're on to some really interesting innovations in Endless Legends that we might see pop up elsewhere in the future.\n\nTheir region and city-building system is really interesting and complex. It takes a lot of getting used to. They also have fully customizable units - you can really specialize your unit choices to your own needs. It's really well-done. Even their approach to the tech tree is innovative... you'll often choose many important techs each time through, but I can't imagine always using the same optimal path like you would in Civ for example.\n\nHeroes and missions are also interesting and well-implemented. The reliance upon minor factions to round out your army, provide empire buffs, and bolster your workforce is also very cool. And have I mentioned that there are a ton of resources, each with unique qualities, that are actually relevant? It's crazy.\n\nOf course the game isn't perfect. The AI needs some work, it does well at the start but before long the player can easily out-perform the computer. Amplitude was very good about supporting Endless Space and improving the AI and other features, so I am confident in the future. However if you chose to exploit the AIs weaknesses you can run them over pretty easily. Of course, there's also a lot of customization that can be done in the pre-game menu, so an argument could be made that you could set paramaters up enough to hinder yourself and boost the AI... but really that's a big workaround for what should be in the game already.\n\nThe game has huge potential but currently (9/28/14) it still has some room to grow. I'd recommend buying it if you're a fan of the genre, although waiting for the AI to improve wouldn't be the worst decision. It shouldn't take too long.","September 28, 2014","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was easier to understand than Endless Space though I do like that one also due to the very good tutorial in Endless Legend.  I went through the complete tutorial as it explains how to do everything in the game.  The game is very much Civilization like in that you build the buildings and military you want in your city.  You can also grow your city larger by building Boroughs.  Each section or area of the map can contain only 1 city so there is no need to figure out the spacing between your cities.  There are a variety of races to choose from.  Each Race only has 3 different Military units that you can build but if you Assimilate a Minor Faction you can also build their military units also.  You can also upgrade the 3 Different Military unit choices you have with better weapons and armor and items which all the units of that type that you build in the future will have.  Your Armies or cities can also be led by heroes who level up and gain new abilities when they do through the assigning of skill points.  You can taylor your Hero to be better at giving a city food, dust or production for instance or you can make your hero a Military killing machine by making the armies he leads have greater life or attack , etc.  Heros and other units can also engage in quests through exploring ruins which adds a small role playing element to this beautiful 4X strategy game.  Everything is turn based and you can fight combat in turn based mode to have more control or just put it on Auto combat.  At first I fought everything in turn based combat to micromanage my troops but I found it sped up the game by going to automatic combat and the computer did a pretty good job of accessing losses.  You also have faction quests you can complete and if you finish them you can build a wonder and win the wonder victory.  I highly recommend this game for any gamer but especially those who like Sid Meier's Civilization games.  This game is far better than Beyond Earth and Endless Space is far better than Beyond Earth.  This games compare more favorably to the actual Civilization titles like Civ 5, civ 1, 2,3,4.\nI have played 236 hours and have all the achievement now so I  am moving on to another game.

Futuristic Fantasy you ask? Well there are demons, as well as high tech exploitation of resources. Cool stuff if you ask me.\n\nThe game looks absolutely fantastic, and is probably one of the best looking strategy games I've played. Further, the download is under 2gb! Gameplay is deep, and rewards forward thinking and planning of city positioning.\nThe A.I. is pretty good, more predictable and more realistic than the Civ A.I., however it seems a little too passive and generally won't engage in a war unless provoked or absolutely necessary.\n\nLeading onto that, the combat system in this game is very unique and while a bit odd to come to terms with, is very intuitive and ultimately fun.\n\nSome negatives are it is a hard game to pick up. The tutorial isn't bad, and does a good job and teaching the basics but it took me a few games to fully understand how to play the game properly and well. Furthermore, the endgame seems a little messy and it's difficult to understand what needs to be done to achieve victory, but again this will come to the player who spends a few good hours tinkering with the game.\n\nOverall, a very solid game and one every strategy and 4X fan should look into!","November 7, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of the biggest problems with the genre is that it scales poorly - a game of e.g. Civ is typically tons of fun during the early-mid game, and turns into a slog once you really get going, with previously fun and consequential elements (choosing which terrain to enhance with a worker) losing their significance once you've got dozens of workers doing the same thing per turn.\n\nEndless Legend partly fixes this problem - it persists in a few areas of gameplay, but in a few others, it's fully solved.\nThe biggest area where it persists is city building construction; like civ, there are buildings you can construct inside cities.  Like civ, you've gotta fight with a whole list of the same buildings over and over across all of your cities; whilst they may matter during the first few core cities, they rapidly become rote by the time you've got 6 or more.\nArmy management has this mostly solved; rather than moving dozens of individual troops around the world every turn, you instead have a few hero-led armies, and in the wildest game, you've got maybe 4 or so, tops.  There are also no mobile workers besides a single unit that "can found cities, and nothing else", so there's no micromanagement of moving workers around every turn.\nTerrain improvement has been simplified about as much as one could hope to, without removing the feature.  Cities expand by, themselves, taking up more tiles (each added tile being called a "borough".  All adjacent tiles to these automatically get worked (there's no micromanagement of picking which tiles to work).  There are a few special tile enhancements that can be done at a distance from the city, and instead of being done via a worker moving out onto the tile and building them, these are done via a city construction command as you would do to build a building inside the city.\nCombat only needs to be manually managed when it's on the fence whether you're going to win or not.  If you're moderately stronger than the enemy, you can safely click the "automatic" option and have the game resolve combat for you immediately without taking time.  Moreover, this actually does a full simulation of the combat in question, rather than approximating it with a few numerical weightings, so it actually plays out as you'd fairly expect, rather than having powerful troops get lost because their on-paper numbers don't look great (despite their potential in actual combat being excellent).\nThe game does slog a bit if you pull ahead early; you can achieve fairly strong dominance over AI opponents and have a more or less assured victory about half the game-duration before any of the victory conditions (besides domination/eliminaton) become feasible, which is a bit of a shame, but in spite of this this is still a wonderful game, overall.","July 25, 2015","true","604.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've played games like Elemental or Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes you'll love this one and if you've played Endless Space a lot of the mechanics will seem very familiar even though it's a completely different setting.  It does everything right and far as I can tell only one thing wrong. There is no way to achieve a multi player co-operative victory. I mean you can ally with another player and just go until one of you wins or you kill off everyone else but only one player will be awarded victory.\n\nSo if the issue I listed doesn't turn you away here's some of the things I really enjoy about it.\nLegendary buildings that can only be built once, period.\nOther legendary deeds that only one empire can obtain.\nAwesome quests, both competitive and co-operative with sometimes great rewards.\nVery diverse factions.\nA victory condition for every play style.\nThe option to toggle on/off any victory condition or DLC. (this should be in every 4x game)\nThe legendary buildings always have a relatively large bonus to whatever city you build them in.  The legendary deeds always give a really good reward (usually just the legendary building you made that nobody else can at that point) and sometimes just a large amount of a resource.  There are also quests that give a great reward like an amazing piece of equipment for a hero that only one empire can get the reward for.  There are also quests that everyone works together to complete (usually to get rid of a terrible global effect that is randomly thrust upon everyone) and the highest contributor gets a good reward that's sometimes more valuable than contributing 100% yourself.\n\nLots of different ways to achieve victory, if you've played Endless Space most of them will be familiar.  Victory by annihilation, conquering 75% of the world, conquering each other empire's capital, getting massive love (diplomatic points) from your friends, getting a certain amount of resources, researching 5/6 of the final technologies, having the high score at the end of the specified turn limit OR for those of you with size issues you can just build that big ol' "pillar" in your city that lets everyone know you're boss.\n\nAll in all I'm thoroughly impressed with the game and I highly recommend it.  But again, keep in mind I have only played with all of the DLC enabled.  And I can't say it would be worth the... $73? getting it all at full price but it certainly was worth the $30 I paid.","April 11","true","73.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Factions are balanced and unique. Maps are beautiful. There is immense replay value. You can play the same faction on the same map 10 times and still have a different experience each time. It has a similar structure to Heroes V. You hire a hero recruit units and explore the map founding and upgrading cities along the way. It has much more depth and polish than that game however. The DLC is pretty cheap if you wait for sales and adds nice touches to the game. Another nice thing is that the DLC unlocked is based on the host, so if one person in the group has everything unlocked and he hosts his friends only need the basic game.  The music is fantastic and I play it all the time when doing homework or browsing the web. The art is very good and I use it as wallpaper often. It looks great.\n\nThe only downside to the game is matches can take 10 or 12 hours to complete for larger maps. The game can be saved so this is not all in a row, but still it can be hard to coordinate with friends to finish a game. The other downside is you are going to need to play about 3 matches to learn the game. I've played several matches and several partial matches and there are still things I need to learn.

From gameplay to lore, from artwork to music, this game is one of the few that I can say I adore.\n\nI won't go too much into its gameplay, as many reviews point out both the great mechanics of the game, as well as its flaws. In short, I believe that Endless Legend is a very polished, and still growing, 4x game that is complex, fun, relatively easy to access, hard but enjoyable to master, with unique factors to consider (like winter), while also being unique in its diversity of factions with substantially different playstyles.\n\nRather, I wanted to delve more into what makes Endless Legend a unique 4x experience to me that has not been seen since Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. I am, of course, talking about immersion, narrative, and lore. Though Endless Legend does not have a story campaign, I found myself instantly engrossed and invested in Auriga, a dying planet, with its myriad of children scrambling to secure their survival.\n\nIts roster of factions is unique and highly creative, with ideas and concepts that are seldom seen or approached in such a way in fantasy. From honorable vampiric knights torn between expedience and honor to Insane robot cult bent on destroying the legacy of their creators, Endless Legend provides a breath of fresh air to the fantasy genre (by in large part, infusing healthy dosages of Sci-Fi into it without compromising the Fantasy aspect).  Each faction's lore and story is explored through faction quests, a unique aspect in 4x, providing for those who wish it, a narrative experience and objective that goes beyond the traditional victory conditions present in 4x games. Each new game on Auriga is a new story from a different and engrossing perspective.\n\nThis immersion into the narrative of Auriga and its children is supplemented by minor quests which add much to the lore of the minor factions of the planet, in addition to an exceptional and beautiful artstyle that is, to me, incomparable. This is all topped off with an incredible and amazing score by FlyByNo, who perfectly captures the ambience of Endless Legend and its lore with every track.\n\nGameplay wise, Endless Legend can proudly claim a high seat among the best of 4x games, with an active development team that constantly listens to feedback and improves the game. But if one is interested in complementing a fun gameplay experience with immersion and fascinating lore, then Endless Legend stands unrivalled with its head held high.","January 22","true","268.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game takes the 4X system of control in slightly different ways, some of them well done, others, well, it's still Alpha, so they could be cleaned up later.\n\nCombat is definitely a change, as you don't micromanage armies, and as others have pointed out, the combat occurs on the world map you've been running you're army around on.  No 'seperate' field of conflict in this game.  They've definitely nailed the 'Feel like a general managing a conflict as opposed to a lieutenant managing a squad' sense to the combat.  You get teh choice of where to start your armies, and who they focus on, but after you click that launch button, the whole thing is no longer in your hands or control.  And, as you've not been pulled to a seperate screen, if the battle seems the kind to be a while, you can manage you're empire by simply scrolling the map.\n\nEmpire building is different, as you aren't looking to just cluster yourself as much as possible to ensure a firm holding, as you've now got Regions to focus on, and each region you settle gives you all but the field goodies without need of actually having a city touching them.  This means less cities to hold larger swathes of land.  And the inclusion of the Watchtower structure gained in Age II helps to further this mechanic.  And since friendly minor factions in the regions provide bonuses to your cities in teh regions, you get even more for less.  And with science being non-linear beyond needing Age X for Tech Y, you can develop in teh ways you feel will most benefit your empire's growth.\n\nThe troop 'improvement' system is very much Endless Space feeling, though currently the unit types and selection feels very basic from what will be available in the final game.  The weapon and armor selections also feel sparse to start with.  With only a small number of factions as well, it gets quick to identify what units are what, and which faction they belong to.  Though, currently there appears to be some issues with some unit models not being in the game in a working state for manual battle control, as I had a couple of game halting error logs pop up that required reloading the turn from an autosave to get around, so don't expect to see the troops in combat in all their glory just yet.\n\nThe quest system feels clunky at this time, but definitely looks to be on the right road.  It feels head and shoulders above Elemental: Fallen Enchantress's system right now, what with the quests actually feeling like they're part of the world as opposed to just thrown in to extend play-time.  the fact that each faction has a 'Main Quest' chain that's tailored to their culture and mythos (what there is available of it right now) definitely helps with the idea of this being a deeper world.\n\nOn the whole, this IS in alpha, so expect a lot of changes to come, but so far, they've done a fairly strong job of building a mythos of the world that helps tie it to Endless Space, and Dungeons of the Endless, and I can't wait to see more of the story brought forward, further revealing how the three games are tied together.  I'm also hoping some of hte mechanics that feel very empty get filled soon, especially has there are a large number of commands and options, from technologies to hero skills, that have the whole 'NOT YET IMPLIMENTED' icon strung upon them making me hope that what's available now is just the tip of the iceburg we've found.","April 26, 2014","true","28.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Endless Legend might only be in the alpha stage of development, but it's already incredibly fun to play. I recommend this game to anyone who loves fantasy or strategy games. There are cons to this game, as expected, and most of them come from the fact that it's an alpha game. As of this moment, as I'm writing this review, there is no tutorial to the game. Many features such as mulitplayer and the abillity to automate some of your unit's development are not yet implemented. I only just realized on turn 150 or so of my first match/game that you need to manually increase your city's population, thus enabling you to create settlers to expand. Becauset there wasn't a tutorial, it took me 1.5+ hours to figure out how to properly expand your empire. However, believe me when I say that this game is truck-loads of fun. Despite the fact that I couldn't figure out how to play correctly, I'm still immensely enjoying this game. It looks awesome, it feels incredible, but the updates can't get here soon enough.

There are tonnes of map features and terrain types and everything is backed up by rich and interesting lore.\n\n- The map itself is split into regions so that - in contrast to Civ - you don't end up with a cluster of cities all over the place. Here you place 1 city in a region. It's an interesting choice which means territory is quickly claimed in bulk and there's a realistic and exciting rush for land which also reduces the risk of another faction placing a city in between two of yours!\n\n- The game has great depth, but there's lots to be refined and balanced so that decisions acually matter and tactics really come into play. An example is the coming of winter; a cool Game of Thrones style feature which should be an ominous reminder to stockpile resources, but at the moment only noticably slows your units down and reduces the land yields a little.\n\n- The combat is good - it can either be automatic or manual (like in Endless Space) but here the manual combat feels more interesting. I like that your hired heroes also progress in skills and gear; plenty of room for expansion.\n\n- Some more advanced features like trading and diplomacy are often missing or implemented in a basic way, but that's only natural. Ultimately the devs have organised the roadmap very well - the game is not only playable but greatly enjoyable and full of depth, even at this early stage.\n\nIf you like 4x games and want to try something new and exciting then give it a whirl and support the development. If you're looking for the finished thing then this - obviously - isn't quite there yet. But when finished this could easily be another 600+ hour game.","April 27, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This isn't positive or negative, I just figure it to be something to take into consideration.\n\nEndless Legend is great but it suffers the early access. Four big things sucker punched my experience:\n\n1. AI is half baked imo.\n\nOnly one faction (bug people) was tough because it focus spammed units at me, the other factions were a cakewalk considering they were made up of archers or came from a less developed civ.\n\nYou might overlook this until suddenly all the factions gave up half way through the game, by turn 100 out of 200 turns I ended up capturing all enemy cities with absolutely ZERO resistance.\n\n2. Forget about politics.\n\nOther factions immediately hate you and demand waaaay too much to become neutral, even when you're about to completely annihilate them (I wished for a diplomatic win).\n\n3. Storyline quest bugged right at the end.\n\nBugged as in I met all the, very nit-picky, requirments to proceed, yet it still wouldn't let me (like getting to third base in a relationship, only to give you the middle finger). This is probably just me being Broken Lords and having reached the 200 turn maximum (you can continue after 200 turns so it may have been a glitch). I just consider that if their's going to be a storyline, it should be thouroughly looked over.\n\n4. Awkward fighting system.\n\nPerhaps the most intended problem. When you choose to initiate moves for your units, they play out the option twice. So say I want my infantry to hold a line and my archers to hide behind it. If an enemy is out of range for my archer, there is no way to tell them to run in front of the infantry, shoot, then run back behind the infantry. More of an understanding if you exp the game, but this is very irritating.\n\nSum it up in a sentence: I loved the game, there was alot to explore in both map and content, but, in its current state the mystery is short lived after 50 or so turns - support the game, but I'll be waiting for extra content to make the current content relevant.","April 28, 2014","true","39.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You are always given a quest line dedicated to the faction you are playing, and if you complete that quest line, you win the game.

And overall, I'd have to say my experience has been a positive one-- but not without numerous potholes.\n\nFirst, the positives: The graphics are gorgeous. Just totally amazing for a 4X game. Units move fluidly, resources sparkle invitingly, and the transition from summer to winter and back again is just lovely to watch. Then there's the level of customization you can get into with your armies.\n\nIt's basically the massive level of outfitting you could do with your ships in Endless Space... but with people! Mix-n-match older tech with new, or just put everyone in the shiniest stuff you can find, and upgrading is nice and easy (if ludicrously expensive sometimes). And the game is definitely engaging; my first playthrough was of the "okay, one more turn and THEN I go to bed-- oh, wait, I just won a score victory. Huh. That was 300 turns?" variety.\n\nThe quest system keeps things fairly fresh throughout the game as well, as it gives you something to actually work towards instead of just the standard "build stuff, build armies, kill everyone" or "build stuff, research things, wait for end of game" ideas. You have a series of tangible goals, with rewards, and can even get massively advanced technology through them. And it can make pacifying those locals with parley much more of a rewarding endeavour than just beating them until they stop moving.\n\nHowever, there are a fair amount of balancing negatives to look out for: Remember those gorgeous graphics? Yeah, I'm going to be turning those down for my next playthrough. The transition effect for the season change is lovely, true, but it also causes some lag when you've got the graphics maxed out. And maxing the graphics also doesn't help with the next complaint...\n\nThere's no mini-map. At all. You would think that a mini-map would be standard for a 4X game, yes? Well, you don't get one. In order to move around the map, you can either drag the viewpoint around (which, on high graphics settings, causes the aforementioned lag), or zoom all the way out to the 2D map representation, scroll to where you want to be, and then zoom back in. A total waste of time that could be avoided with a simple mini-map somewhere.\n\nBattles are also...odd. After playing through several of them, I fail to see why anyone would use anything other than ranged units. For any battle. Ranged units with high enough initiative, on high ground, can slaughter anything else. Even if not on higher ground, they're still going to take out most of the opposing army before anyone else even gets a turn. It just seems fairly broken. I acknowledge this may need more playtesting on my part, though.\n\nThen there's the problem that Endless Legend has with giving you information on how to actually PLAY it. Don't feel like reading the manual? Then you, my friend, are going to have a VERY hard time playing this game. "But the tutorial will tell me everything I need to know, right?" Wroooong. The tutorial completely leaves out several important things, not least of them the highly important district/city center upgrade procedure, how trade routes happen, how to use ANY of the special abilities for the various races (And no, they're not particularly self-explanatory. For instance, the Vaulters information in-game just says that they can designate a Holy Resource. Several techs say they need a Holy Resource. Nothing bothers to tell you that you have to activate a booster effect on a resource to designate it as "holy".), and the rather important bit of information that only one city can be placed per region, so you'd better be dang sure that you're putting it in the right spot. Or even what a "region" is, other than just referring to them.\n\nAnd if you try to open up the Archives in-game, thinking it's the equivalent of the Civilopedia? It minimizes the game and takes you to the Endless Legend Wiki. And that may or may not have anything useful for you.\n\nThere's one more major thing that I've decided counts as a negative, and it's enough to warrant an edit to my original review. I originally just thought that the tech tree idea was "original, but a bit rubbish", and not terribly impressive, but after further thought and a few more tests, it is my opinion that it really does need an overhaul. Now, I realize that many players treat the tech tree as an afterthought, merely a way to get their new weapons to beat other civs over the head with, but to me the tech tree is one of the main parts of the game. And Endless Legend downright punishes you for using it.\n\nThe tree is split into six ages. You start in Age 1, obviously. After nine technologies are researched, you advance one age. This seems all well and good, but there's a catch; it's not just "nine technologies from the previous age." It's ANY nine technologies. Research nine technologies from Age 1, unlock Age 2, and then want to get the rest of Age 1 that you haven't researched yet? Congrats, you're progressing towards Age 3! That may not seem so bad at first, but then you hit the second catch: every time you advance an Age, the technologies from the PREVIOUS ages become MORE EXPENSIVE. Yes, that's right. Suddenly, in the more advanced ages, it becomes harder to learn how to make more primitive things.\n\nNow, I'm guessing they put this feature in to make sure that people couldn't rush to the Sixth and Final Age just by researching lower-end techs, but you know what would've been an even simpler fix? Make it so that the nine techs you have to research to advance an Age can only come from the Age directly prior to it. Not particularly difficult to implement, one would think. And it would allow you to have a little more time to actually get all of the techs your civilization needs, rather than having to rush through and try to pick out nine per Age before they skyrocket in price.\n\nNow, you may have noticed that one of those negatives is fixed by reading the manual, another is (potentially) fixed by turning the graphics down, and another may not be a problem if more playtesting reveals other strategies to work better than just all-ranged-all-the-time. So yes, overall I'm rather happy with Endless Legend. It's no Endless Space, and it's no Civ V, but it is something sort of halfway between the two. I'm not terribly impressed with how they messed up the technology tree, and I'd like quite a bit of refinement with things like starting position and a few other minor gripes, but overall it's a good way to spend the time until Civ: Beyond Earth comes out.\n\n...c'mon, you know we're all thinking it.","October 2, 2014","true","93.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The largest and most obvious difference happens before you even start the game. Instead of "customizing" your civilization a la Civ:BE, or just randomly picking one from Civ 5, you have the option of picking a prebuilt race or making your own using a point-buy system. The differences are huge and actually define the race, instead of being restricted to a unique unit or hardly game-changing mechanic. You can play as the dead dudes who are sealed inside their armor who live off of dust, granting a huge bonus to income and negating the need for food, or play as the wandering merchants who can literally move their cities around the map if needed.\n\nOnce you fire up the game, you start with a military and a settler, much like Civilization. The difference, however, is the fact you are restricted to colonizing a "region" instead of just placing a bunch of cities in a crazy pattern to try and min/max your coverage. Strategic and Luxury resources don’t even have to be inside your city limits. Instead you build a building on them, no matter where they are in the region. Instead of harvesting and "having" x resource, you now harvest a certain amount of x resource a turn. This makes it extremely hard to go back to Civilization because I like this system so much better.\n\nThe armies in the game are exactly the same as Endless Space. You have a limit based on your technology on how many units you can fit into an "army" and you can assign a hero to guide them. Combat turns into a miniature battleground like a stage from many other games, and has a miniature system that is serviceable and interesting in its own right. Units themselves are interesting. Instead of having a crazy large selection of units (civilization), every cavitation has 4-6 units. Each unit can be customized greatly, though, by choosing weapons, armor, and accessories depending on your level of technology.\n\nAll in all I'd definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of the genre, and I'd recommend it twice as much if you loved Endless Space and wanted to see a land-based version.\n","December 14, 2014","true","35.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It looks very nice. The zoom controls seamlessly run from a overview-from-orbit kinda map to 'hey look, that soldier actually changed his sword on that upgrade' close ups.\n\nThe UI is well thought out, easy and intuitively. I would have liked a few more overview screens (like, in what region can I find what resource/minor factions/number of villages) and it works - which is a nice change from some games.\n\nThe backstory is okay - I am curious enough to find out more, yet it isn't something thrilling like SMAC had. Still, it's cool enough, different enough, but nothing that stands out.\n\nThere are a few things I find lacking. Not 'don't buy it' lacking, but more curious-raise-eyebrow lacking. For instance - why are there different movies for introducing each faction, but no ending movies for the various ends?\n\nNow - to the caveats.\n\nAt first glance, I thought that the different factions played REALLY different and was pleasantly surprised. I started the game with the Broken Lords and the the Necrophages. I liked how I as a player was more or less forced to adapt a game srategy that 'came with' the faction - more or less. But, I now have tackled all but the Cult - I am rethinking my earlyer observation. As it turns ou, almost all factions with the possible xception of the Necrophages can just use the same strategy - focus on dust (the currence of the gameworld) and buy your way out of everything. The faction differences are very minor. Roving Clans move their cities. WHy bother? The pillars of the Mages - influence on the game minimal.\n\nHandling the minor factons too - first I ran around doing all the quests, only to find that razing the villages gave me more XP, was quicker and less of a fuss. On account of all factions being able to use the same strategy, chosing which minors to incorporate into my empire becomes a no-brainer. + dust (Delvers) + regeneration (Sisters of mercy) + loyalty (Eyeless Ones) and expansion can be doen at its fastes - or I found. Picking a fight wiht a minor factin seems to have NO effect hwatsoever or those reamining on the map. They do not become more militant - so there is no consequence of an agressive policy ot ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe techtree - I seem to find a few issues with it. For instance - there is too little advantage in the military units you can field - improving them through research is not really an option. Level them up is much, much more effective. Sure, there is the different gear, but there is little use for the various ones made of different materials. And with strategic resources being not that rare when (remember - focus on Dust) you can just buy them off other factions or the marketplace, it's not a real 'weighing of options'.\n\nThere are AI issues too. Why does any AI faction completely ignore the ruins/ Why, after I have taken 80% of their regions, do they still (all of them! refuse flat out a truce, unless I pay them a massive amount of resources/tech/whatnot? Thta's just stupid.\nWhy do all AI factions rush into peace, treaties, map exchange and whathave you only to retreat from those without any obvious provocation? If an AI faction is stated as being 'terrified' of me because of its lacking military forces, how on earth does that compute in "hey, we had peace, we had trade and research treaties - this means war!" and that's always. I purposefully tried to remain at peace with all but no matter how I placate the AI, war is the end result. It makes no sence.\n\nAm am ignoring the few remaining bugs - they are nothing more than a nuisance and will be solved anytime soon, so that's not the issue here.\n\nAll in all - I think this is a work of love, it has potential out the wazoo, the combat system is nifty, but consider this if you are looking for your next 4X fix.\n","December 14, 2014","true","86.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/289130/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Endless Legend, developed by Amplitude Studios, is a turn based strategy of conquering, discovering, and surviving. You will get your choice of seven preset races, and each of them have benefits and shortcomings. It is all in how you choose to take on the game when it comes to selecting one of these races. If you are a warlord there is a race for you, if you want to be the scientist, there's a race for you, etc. There are also different conditions to win in the game, some are for conquering your enemies, some are for taking over enough of the world, and I think you know at this point that there are even more ways to win.\n\nGraphically this game looks amazing. I love the fact that as you zoom out the map becomes simpler, but doesn't lose any of its importance, and that of course is the boundaries of your cities. Until you play the game you will never know how important those can be. I just have to say that I was blown away on all fronts when it came to the look of the game. The differences in land type, the units that you will be using in the game, the buildings you will explore, protect, and create, all of it looks polished. There's also something else that looks amazing, and is usually a sore eye when it comes to games, and that is the load screen. It will depict a scene for the race you are currently playing as, and it looks amazing. So I guess what I'm saying is that graphically there's no way you can be disappointed in the game.\n\nThe sounds of the game seem to blend in to the game. I can't say that anything blew me away, but I can tell you that I had no issue keeping the volume on in this game. I say that because there are definitely games that when you put a serious amount of hours into, you are ready to mute the game because of repetition, this is not the case with Endless Legend.\n\nThe controls consist of hotkeys to get to different game screens, such as your research screen, your unit screen, the marketplace, etc. You will be spending the majority of the time armed with your mouse to make decisions ranging from selecting what to put in your research queue, building queue, and of course where you want your units to move.\n\nThere really isn't a story to this game, I mean everyone is out there trying to carve out something for their race. It's really up to the player to determine how the story goes. You maybe the savior of your race and you'll be able to protect your borders and slowly grow your foothold on the world. You may also be a tyrant who only sees red and all that lie before you must be destroyed. The thing about this game, and most turn based strategy games, is that it all relies on the strategies that you employ. Now of course this is more than just a war game, there are other aspects to the game that should not be ignored.\n\nOne of them is research, this is where you can set a certain path to show what you are trying to accomplish. You will get to choose what your race researches and what upgrades or enhancements your race will receive once the research is done. The only thing that I didn't really find that impressive about this was that I was either spoiled or trapped by the way Civilization does its research and I felt like Endless Legend's way was as sophisticated or complicated with prerequisites and what not. All you really need to do in this game is research enough subjects to advance to the next ring of subjects.\n\nAnother thing that you are going to need to pay attention to in the game is that each race has a set of units, and you are not going to be replacing them as you go along with brand new units. What you will be doing is retrofitting old units with new stuff. In something that I really enjoy, you get to customize your units with newer armor, weapons, and trinkets. You also get to do this with the heroes that you hire during the game. Not only can you customize your heroes this way they also have different upgrade tracks that will allow them to not only level up but become specialized in a way that you choose.\n\nThis is a solid game throughout, and the really cool thing is that this is also a game that is ever evolving. What I mean by that is that there is still stuff getting tweaked and added by the developers, but the really cool and interesting thing is that they are doing it based on gamer feedback. So I guess in the end if you are looking for a fantasy themed turn based strategy, where you are definitely going to find yourself locked into playing the game, you are going to want to get this game immediately. This game easily gets a 9.4 out of 10.","October 23, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can equip units and heroes with different gear, giving them different abilities, making them hit more or able to take more damage or move sooner in battle, for instance.  Each faction has only 3 unit types that are specific to them, but there are plenty of subfactions to conquer, that you can then assimilate into your empire, and gain their unit types.  The idea of regions and not being able to build more than one city in each region took some getting used to, but it actually ends up working rather well.  All of this and everything else the game offers leads to a really enjoyable experience.\n\nThat being said, I think the overall story of the game could use some fleshing out.  I've now beat the game with 3 different factions, all of them by going through that faction's storyline to the end (I like story).  All of them are well-written and interesting, but it feels like I'm now done with that faction: there's no reason to play them again.  The story is the same each time you play with that faction, with no variance.  The story always ends with you getting a faction-specific tech and being able to build a specific building (trying not to give plot away here).  All of it's great, but no questions get answered.  Do the cultists succeed in their plot?  Do the drakken figure out what caused the war of the Endless and how to save the planet?  None of these questions are answered, so it ends up feeling really anticlimactic.\n\nI do recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good, solid twist on Civ-type games with a fantasy setting.  Plenty of buildings to build, plenty of terrain to exploit.  I just wish the story was more solid at the end.","October 23, 2014","true","89.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love the way the cities look, and expecially the visuals of the cultist faction. Gameplay wise, the single city per region requires a very nice ounce of thought as to where you will place the city. It isn't too difficult to learn the basics for the game. However learning the combat system is very tricky. The Combat system is highly unique. You can choose between Automating your battles like Civ, or controlling it manually. Manual Combat takes a long time and might not be suited for everyone, otherwise you can just do auto attack like any other 4x game. City Capture/Attacking is very basic, it is very easy to raze cities if you have enough armies, there is also no reaction delay to whom ever is being attacked which can be problematic. It is too easy to steamroll a massive cluster of armies onto every city of your opponant and wipe them out within a few turns. There is very little need to siege a city, as a large enough army can demolish any militia within.\n\nMoving on to the Questing system, Each unique faction has a main storyline quest which can be used to unlock Dust, research, and resources. Ontop of that each minor faction has quest chains to pacify them in a region giving you unit buffs in each city. Unless you are the Cultists which have One Massive City then you convert villages after either pacification or by destroying them. Once converted they basically become mini-cities that auto-produce units once every 15 turns, the tiles add to your city's production and provide a citizen onto your capitol. Pretty impressive.\n\nYou are also able to get unique Techs from exploring and looting ruins that dot the map. You can even search ruins investigated by other players, and have less chances of finding valuable items. Hero weapons can also be found inside of these ruins, they are stronger then average weapons you research and can provide interesting bonuses to armies commanded by your hero.\n\nThe game does have some issues. Running a larger map can take a toll on your FPS if you have a massive multitude of armies all moving around at one time. Along with FPS drops over some cities if they get large enough. Some mechanics aren't explained at all in the tutorial, including city upgrading. Which is something that should be highly hinted at. (Spoilers, if you want to upgrade a district you need to surround it with 4 other districts to level it up, there I saved you some headache). I personally haven't played around enough with the customization of unique factions, but I would assume it would work much like Endless Space.\n\nHowever, I do reccomend that people buy this game. Inspite of its flaws, it is still a very solid game with a lot of replay value.\n","October 24, 2014","true","59.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Extremely engaging if you like fantasy and turn-based strategy,it gives you the same "just one more turn" feeling the Civ games do but with a more advanced combat system and focus on customization.\n\nIt has a lot of similarities to the other Endless games, like the customization of your faction traits,troops and heroes (pl)  and minor factions,giving you the ability to make specialised troops and change their equipment with several tiers of weapons,armor parts and trinkets with special tier weapons made of Strategic resources and even unique equipment found through quests or in ruins. These different stats and traits on equipment and units give you some interesting combinations and possibilities. Plus the ability to "assimiliate" a few of the minor factions gives you unique troops that you can customize too,each with different base traits,stats and abilities. Giving your troops different weapons and trinkets gives them different traits, so you can customize your Archer unit into a crossbow-wielding close ranged fighter that gets buffed when attacking at close range with a shield or long-ranged Archer with a bow that has bonus damage against certain unit types. Your Spellcasters can reduce different stats on enemies depending on the weapon you give them and your melee units can focus on striking before your enemy does,dealing or tanking damage or being mobile skirmishers to take out ranged troops. Your faction essentially has 3 "template" units unique to them from which you create this specialized troops which will cost more depending on what you add. Want cheap cannon fodder or elite units,a mix of both?Want your settler units to be able to fight well? The customization gives you a lot of playstyle options, not quite as much as Endless Space (yet) but it's a really engaging system once you get into it and in my opinion one of the strongest features of the game.\n\n\nOn to the issues:\nThe AI needs a LOT of work to give it some longevity. As of right now,the AI is still really lacking,I would almost say it's broken as they're very passive and never attack or even defend their lands properly. It takes a while to notice this and apparently some people don't notice or have this issue (?) but it's very noticeable once you've advanced several eras and begin expanding into AI land. The minor factions,quests and micro-managing and customization of your empire and troops obscure this issue as they keep you engaged for a long time and there never really is a *need* to fight the AI leaders for a very long time unless you had a start close to each other or play an offensive Faction.\nThere is still plenty of content without fighting the other leaders with the tons of quests,customization of troop equipment,research and expansion but unless they fix the passive AI there isn't much of a point to most of what you're doing as you won't really have any opposition or motivation to stand out on top. Also,diplomacy is possible but not really that advanced. Research agreements and trade routes are pretty much it,and as the AI doesn't really do much on it's own you essentially have to do it all yourself.\n\n\nBut I have hopes that the devs will keep updating and hopefully improving the game as they did with Endless Space.\nThe game is already very well polished in most aspects apart from the AI so the foundation already shows lots of potential. Once the AI issues are resolved (again,some people have said they don't have the issue which I can't really explain) this would be a definitive recommendation for fantasy and 4x fans.","September 24, 2014","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game takes the 4X system of control in slightly different ways, some of them well done, others, well, it's still Alpha, so they could be cleaned up later.\n\nCombat is definitely a change, as you don't micromanage armies, and as others have pointed out, the combat occurs on the world map you've been running you're army around on.  No 'seperate' field of conflict in this game.  They've definitely nailed the 'Feel like a general managing a conflict as opposed to a lieutenant managing a squad' sense to the combat.  You get teh choice of where to start your armies, and who they focus on, but after you click that launch button, the whole thing is no longer in your hands or control.  And, as you've not been pulled to a seperate screen, if the battle seems the kind to be a while, you can manage you're empire by simply scrolling the map.\n\nEmpire building is different, as you aren't looking to just cluster yourself as much as possible to ensure a firm holding, as you've now got Regions to focus on, and each region you settle gives you all but the field goodies without need of actually having a city touching them.  This means less cities to hold larger swathes of land.  And the inclusion of the Watchtower structure gained in Age II helps to further this mechanic.  And since friendly minor factions in the regions provide bonuses to your cities in teh regions, you get even more for less.  And with science being non-linear beyond needing Age X for Tech Y, you can develop in teh ways you feel will most benefit your empire's growth.\n\nThe troop 'improvement' system is very much Endless Space feeling, though currently the unit types and selection feels very basic from what will be available in the final game.  The weapon and armor selections also feel sparse to start with.  With only a small number of factions as well, it gets quick to identify what units are what, and which faction they belong to.  Though, currently there appears to be some issues with some unit models not being in the game in a working state for manual battle control, as I had a couple of game halting error logs pop up that required reloading the turn from an autosave to get around, so don't expect to see the troops in combat in all their glory just yet.\n\nThe quest system feels clunky at this time, but definitely looks to be on the right road.  It feels head and shoulders above Elemental: Fallen Enchantress's system right now, what with the quests actually feeling like they're part of the world as opposed to just thrown in to extend play-time.  the fact that each faction has a 'Main Quest' chain that's tailored to their culture and mythos (what there is available of it right now) definitely helps with the idea of this being a deeper world.\n\nOn the whole, this IS in alpha, so expect a lot of changes to come, but so far, they've done a fairly strong job of building a mythos of the world that helps tie it to Endless Space, and Dungeons of the Endless, and I can't wait to see more of the story brought forward, further revealing how the three games are tied together.  I'm also hoping some of hte mechanics that feel very empty get filled soon, especially has there are a large number of commands and options, from technologies to hero skills, that have the whole 'NOT YET IMPLIMENTED' icon strung upon them making me hope that what's available now is just the tip of the iceburg we've found.","April 26, 2014","true","28.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Endless Legend might only be in the alpha stage of development, but it's already incredibly fun to play. I recommend this game to anyone who loves fantasy or strategy games. There are cons to this game, as expected, and most of them come from the fact that it's an alpha game. As of this moment, as I'm writing this review, there is no tutorial to the game. Many features such as mulitplayer and the abillity to automate some of your unit's development are not yet implemented. I only just realized on turn 150 or so of my first match/game that you need to manually increase your city's population, thus enabling you to create settlers to expand. Becauset there wasn't a tutorial, it took me 1.5+ hours to figure out how to properly expand your empire. However, believe me when I say that this game is truck-loads of fun. Despite the fact that I couldn't figure out how to play correctly, I'm still immensely enjoying this game. It looks awesome, it feels incredible, but the updates can't get here soon enough.

The largest and most obvious difference happens before you even start the game. Instead of "customizing" your civilization a la Civ:BE, or just randomly picking one from Civ 5, you have the option of picking a prebuilt race or making your own using a point-buy system. The differences are huge and actually define the race, instead of being restricted to a unique unit or hardly game-changing mechanic. You can play as the dead dudes who are sealed inside their armor who live off of dust, granting a huge bonus to income and negating the need for food, or play as the wandering merchants who can literally move their cities around the map if needed.\n\nOnce you fire up the game, you start with a military and a settler, much like Civilization. The difference, however, is the fact you are restricted to colonizing a "region" instead of just placing a bunch of cities in a crazy pattern to try and min/max your coverage. Strategic and Luxury resources don’t even have to be inside your city limits. Instead you build a building on them, no matter where they are in the region. Instead of harvesting and "having" x resource, you now harvest a certain amount of x resource a turn. This makes it extremely hard to go back to Civilization because I like this system so much better.\n\nThe armies in the game are exactly the same as Endless Space. You have a limit based on your technology on how many units you can fit into an "army" and you can assign a hero to guide them. Combat turns into a miniature battleground like a stage from many other games, and has a miniature system that is serviceable and interesting in its own right. Units themselves are interesting. Instead of having a crazy large selection of units (civilization), every cavitation has 4-6 units. Each unit can be customized greatly, though, by choosing weapons, armor, and accessories depending on your level of technology.\n\nAll in all I'd definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of the genre, and I'd recommend it twice as much if you loved Endless Space and wanted to see a land-based version.\n","December 14, 2014","true","35.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And overall, I'd have to say my experience has been a positive one-- but not without numerous potholes.\n\nFirst, the positives: The graphics are gorgeous. Just totally amazing for a 4X game. Units move fluidly, resources sparkle invitingly, and the transition from summer to winter and back again is just lovely to watch. Then there's the level of customization you can get into with your armies.\n\nIt's basically the massive level of outfitting you could do with your ships in Endless Space... but with people! Mix-n-match older tech with new, or just put everyone in the shiniest stuff you can find, and upgrading is nice and easy (if ludicrously expensive sometimes). And the game is definitely engaging; my first playthrough was of the "okay, one more turn and THEN I go to bed-- oh, wait, I just won a score victory. Huh. That was 300 turns?" variety.\n\nThe quest system keeps things fairly fresh throughout the game as well, as it gives you something to actually work towards instead of just the standard "build stuff, build armies, kill everyone" or "build stuff, research things, wait for end of game" ideas. You have a series of tangible goals, with rewards, and can even get massively advanced technology through them. And it can make pacifying those locals with parley much more of a rewarding endeavour than just beating them until they stop moving.\n\nHowever, there are a fair amount of balancing negatives to look out for: Remember those gorgeous graphics? Yeah, I'm going to be turning those down for my next playthrough. The transition effect for the season change is lovely, true, but it also causes some lag when you've got the graphics maxed out. And maxing the graphics also doesn't help with the next complaint...\n\nThere's no mini-map. At all. You would think that a mini-map would be standard for a 4X game, yes? Well, you don't get one. In order to move around the map, you can either drag the viewpoint around (which, on high graphics settings, causes the aforementioned lag), or zoom all the way out to the 2D map representation, scroll to where you want to be, and then zoom back in. A total waste of time that could be avoided with a simple mini-map somewhere.\n\nBattles are also...odd. After playing through several of them, I fail to see why anyone would use anything other than ranged units. For any battle. Ranged units with high enough initiative, on high ground, can slaughter anything else. Even if not on higher ground, they're still going to take out most of the opposing army before anyone else even gets a turn. It just seems fairly broken. I acknowledge this may need more playtesting on my part, though.\n\nThen there's the problem that Endless Legend has with giving you information on how to actually PLAY it. Don't feel like reading the manual? Then you, my friend, are going to have a VERY hard time playing this game. "But the tutorial will tell me everything I need to know, right?" Wroooong. The tutorial completely leaves out several important things, not least of them the highly important district/city center upgrade procedure, how trade routes happen, how to use ANY of the special abilities for the various races (And no, they're not particularly self-explanatory. For instance, the Vaulters information in-game just says that they can designate a Holy Resource. Several techs say they need a Holy Resource. Nothing bothers to tell you that you have to activate a booster effect on a resource to designate it as "holy".), and the rather important bit of information that only one city can be placed per region, so you'd better be dang sure that you're putting it in the right spot. Or even what a "region" is, other than just referring to them.\n\nAnd if you try to open up the Archives in-game, thinking it's the equivalent of the Civilopedia? It minimizes the game and takes you to the Endless Legend Wiki. And that may or may not have anything useful for you.\n\nThere's one more major thing that I've decided counts as a negative, and it's enough to warrant an edit to my original review. I originally just thought that the tech tree idea was "original, but a bit rubbish", and not terribly impressive, but after further thought and a few more tests, it is my opinion that it really does need an overhaul. Now, I realize that many players treat the tech tree as an afterthought, merely a way to get their new weapons to beat other civs over the head with, but to me the tech tree is one of the main parts of the game. And Endless Legend downright punishes you for using it.\n\nThe tree is split into six ages. You start in Age 1, obviously. After nine technologies are researched, you advance one age. This seems all well and good, but there's a catch; it's not just "nine technologies from the previous age." It's ANY nine technologies. Research nine technologies from Age 1, unlock Age 2, and then want to get the rest of Age 1 that you haven't researched yet? Congrats, you're progressing towards Age 3! That may not seem so bad at first, but then you hit the second catch: every time you advance an Age, the technologies from the PREVIOUS ages become MORE EXPENSIVE. Yes, that's right. Suddenly, in the more advanced ages, it becomes harder to learn how to make more primitive things.\n\nNow, I'm guessing they put this feature in to make sure that people couldn't rush to the Sixth and Final Age just by researching lower-end techs, but you know what would've been an even simpler fix? Make it so that the nine techs you have to research to advance an Age can only come from the Age directly prior to it. Not particularly difficult to implement, one would think. And it would allow you to have a little more time to actually get all of the techs your civilization needs, rather than having to rush through and try to pick out nine per Age before they skyrocket in price.\n\nNow, you may have noticed that one of those negatives is fixed by reading the manual, another is (potentially) fixed by turning the graphics down, and another may not be a problem if more playtesting reveals other strategies to work better than just all-ranged-all-the-time. So yes, overall I'm rather happy with Endless Legend. It's no Endless Space, and it's no Civ V, but it is something sort of halfway between the two. I'm not terribly impressed with how they messed up the technology tree, and I'd like quite a bit of refinement with things like starting position and a few other minor gripes, but overall it's a good way to spend the time until Civ: Beyond Earth comes out.\n\n...c'mon, you know we're all thinking it.","October 2, 2014","true","93.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Plus the ability to "assimiliate" a few of the minor factions gives you unique troops that you can customize too,each with different base traits,stats and abilities. Giving your troops different weapons and trinkets gives them different traits, so you can customize your Archer unit into a crossbow-wielding close ranged fighter that gets buffed when attacking at close range with a shield or long-ranged Archer with a bow that has bonus damage against certain unit types. Your Spellcasters can reduce different stats on enemies depending on the weapon you give them and your melee units can focus on striking before your enemy does,dealing or tanking damage or being mobile skirmishers to take out ranged troops. Your faction essentially has 3 "template" units unique to them from which you create this specialized troops which will cost more depending on what you add. Want cheap cannon fodder or elite units,a mix of both?Want your settler units to be able to fight well? The customization gives you a lot of playstyle options, not quite as much as Endless Space (yet) but it's a really engaging system once you get into it and in my opinion one of the strongest features of the game.\n\n\nOn to the issues:\nThe AI needs a LOT of work to give it some longevity. As of right now,the AI is still really lacking,I would almost say it's broken as they're very passive and never attack or even defend their lands properly. It takes a while to notice this and apparently some people don't notice or have this issue (?) but it's very noticeable once you've advanced several eras and begin expanding into AI land. The minor factions,quests and micro-managing and customization of your empire and troops obscure this issue as they keep you engaged for a long time and there never really is a *need* to fight the AI leaders for a very long time unless you had a start close to each other or play an offensive Faction.\nThere is still plenty of content without fighting the other leaders with the tons of quests,customization of troop equipment,research and expansion but unless they fix the passive AI there isn't much of a point to most of what you're doing as you won't really have any opposition or motivation to stand out on top. Also,diplomacy is possible but not really that advanced. Research agreements and trade routes are pretty much it,and as the AI doesn't really do much on it's own you essentially have to do it all yourself.\n\n\nBut I have hopes that the devs will keep updating and hopefully improving the game as they did with Endless Space.\nThe game is already very well polished in most aspects apart from the AI so the foundation already shows lots of potential. Once the AI issues are resolved (again,some people have said they don't have the issue which I can't really explain) this would be a definitive recommendation for fantasy and 4x fans.","September 24, 2014","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I spent alot of time and money on various selections and when I fired this game up and sunk my teeth in, I was thoroughly impressed. It has elements of all the things that I enjoy while maintaining its core in the 4x realm. It brings intricacy and tactics to military battles that is so sorely needed in this genre. It removes the stale taste of "here's my unit" and brings a refreshing diversity to combat and Hero mechanics. With each research "era" you gain a dust equipment improvement. However, the player can choose to specialize in certain equipment that is built through other strategic resources, which while providing a noted advantage, do not in any way erode the fair playing field. Research is non linear and offers the player a REAL choice to capitalize on their strengths, or improve their weaknesses whether that is due to terrain or circumstance. The graphics are absolutely stunning. You can zoom in for detail, or zoom out for tactical, both are gratifying. My only annoyance is that character models do not change through the improvement of armor. The marketplace is very intricate and offers a HUGE side-game that can be exploited to the player's advantage, or ignored entirely without much ill-effect. Winter comes to the land more and more frequently as the game progresses, and ensures that if you aren't prepared for it, then you will suffer the consequences. People complain about it, but it evens the playing the field and allows certain tactical advantages to the player that hasn't quite had the best of luck throughout the game, but at the same time, if you are powerful, it really shines in this stage. Factions are diverse, and every aspect of that is customizable if you so choose. Hands down and without a doubt, support this group of developers. They are doing all the right things in all the right places, and I sincerely hope they continue to support and develop games similar to this one.\n","July 20, 2015","true","52.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So even though I was very fimiliar with the quality of Amplitude Studio's Endless Space, I hesitated on Endless Legend believing it to probably be "more of the same ol' 4X".

Absolutely beautiful game, great empire building, and entertaining gameplay.\n\nPros:\n+ The game looks incredible\n+ Very fun empire building (none of the empire building aspects are terribly deep, but overall theres a lot of things which lends it depth).\n+ Interesting array of units.\n+ Resources and diplomacy are easy to understand.\n+ Map is somewhat self ordering (its actually a challenge to find and place cities in optimal ways).\n+ Quest system is interesting, and for the most part entertaining.\n+ Game is very smooth and streamlined if you desire it to be.\n+ Improvement system for units is interesting.\n\nCons:\n+ Not a lot of unit diversity. You can recruit units from minor tribes, but in reality its somewhat of a letdown that each empires armies boils down to 3 different units. The game would really benefit from a larger roster of empire specific units (at least one for each type of role) or more units opening up when you recruit a minor faction (the haunts give both flying ghosts and infantry ghouls for example).\n+ Combat is a mixed bag. It looks pretty, can be fun at times, and is relatively simple - but by and large is something I mostly skip over.\n+ Hero trees are flat out boring.\n\nNeutral:\n+ Game sometimes feels like it plays itself at times. Its not a con, because you can always find ways to occupy yourself, but the feeling is still there.\n\nOverall great game. Mostly a empire simulator to be honest.","April 3, 2015","true","27.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well, other than the fact that I think it is fantastic.\n\nNow, hear me out. This game is a 4x Strategy game with a hex based movement system and all that jazz. That comes with it's own sense of comparison cliches and mechanical trappings, but if you really do enjoy games like Civilization, and AoW and all of those, you will find somethere for you here within the bounds of Endless Legend.\n\nWhat draws my attention about it the most, is that it really does it's best to make every single game you play feel dramtically different. Each individual aspect can make or break your game, and will have you changing playstyles on the fly. To the random terrain sometimes not giving you the dust you need as a Broken Lord, or the first minor faction you get being absolutely useless, you have a whole host of things that will mess with your style, and keep you on your toes.\n\nThat being said, the main issue I have is just how non-confrontational the A.I. is.

I have always been very impressed with Amplitude with the quality of their titles and their constant communication with the player community which actually has a say in how their games develop.\n\nThe graphics at this stage are wonderful with awesome tilt-shift effects (selective depth of field blurring) that make the game seem like a tabletop miniatures session when you zoom in (check some of my screenshots)! There is so many little neat details to look at and explore - so many great little finishing touches (like how the playing field becomes a hand drawn hex map as you zoom out) that you just wouldn't expect at this stage of development. Even more amazing is that Amplitude has indicated that they will be making improvements to the graphics as development continues - awesomesauce!\n\nAudio at this stage is above average - not as great as the graphics but totally acceptable at this stage.  Think string quartet kind of stuff - it can get a little sleepy after a long play session but thats just a nitpick. They plan to totally rerecord the audio at a later stage.\n\nGameplay is a lot like Civilizations V in a fantasy setting. Currently, this is the area that is lacking the most features - auto-development of cities, more in-depth diplomacy, a tutorial, roads and trading, half of the factions (currently 4), etc... it's a long list of features they intend to put in but have not yet at the Alpha stage. Understandable. Anyone familiar with Amplitude knows they are a great studio and will certainly include these missing features as development continues - they just want to do each feature right and give them the dev time they deserve. That said, there is a TON of content already in the Alpha - outdoing many a beta or even finished product I've played. Setting up and equipping armies and adding heros and outfitting them as well are all present and quite intuitive. Combat is fun, even if you let the game auto-resolve. It's still very satisfying. City development, while not fully fleshed out, is quite deep. Random and faction-related quests are present. It PLAYS very much like a game much further down the development road. Kudos!\n\nEL is very intuitive to play, even for players who aren't huge 4x junkies (like myself). Don't be intimidated and not buy this game because of the tag 4x - it's accessible and fun to play with a surprising amount of information that is all easy to get at and digest.\n\nBugs - sure. There ARE bugs. It's an Alpha. I have encountered FAR less bugs so far in EL than I have in some finished titles. Some are a little annoying (I had one crash the game - once in several play sessions) and some are just minor little things (like variables showin in text instead of unit names).\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in playing 4x type games or anyone looking for a great, fun to play, awesome looking strategy title. Once you get it, you can head over to Amplitudes website and start voting on future development features and take an active role in EL's development.\n\n","April 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The first thing being, I am not a huge fan of 4X games. Games like Sid Meiers do not appeal to me too much. However, I am a fan of the combat system this game has, so I purchased this for what ever reason. I was not disappointed in the slightest. The movement system is very well-crafted and enjoyable. The addition of tribes and smaller races are very appreciated.\n\nOne thing that is very interesting about this game is the major factions to choose from. The ability to choose from several unique, aesthetically-pleasing factions is great. Forming armys with several different units is a good ability. Also, there is a type of character called a Hero in this game. Heroes are a more powerful unit that lead an army. They are a cool addition to these types of games.\n\nOverall, this was a very pleasureable game to play, and I could recommend it to everybody. The basics are easy to learn but hard to master.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teslas/recommended/289130/","teslas","teslas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teslas/","114 products in account","This game is fantastic.\n\nThink Civilization 5, but with a truly workable narrative based on your faction, and perhaps a bit deeper in strategy.\n\nThe city management/construction system will be immediately familiar but turns out to be deceptively deep and enjoyable. The tech tree allows a ton of freedom on what paths you decide to go down. You equip your units with what items you choose, which harkens back to the days of Alpha Centauri. You have options for units, but it's not so many that it bogs you down--it strikes a great balance.\n\nThe combat system is merely alright. It is by no means is bad, but compared to the other facets of the game that are wonderfully polished and/or pleasantly original, the combat, which would seem perfectly in place in a game that was merely good or great, seems to lag behind the otherwise stellar showing of the other aspects. Again, combat is not bad, to be clear, just a bit different and slightly clunky.\n\nI'll mention the narrative once again and also the flavor texts because I like that kind of thing if done lightly. You never get blasted by walls of text, and you can ignore any and all of it if you wish, but taking a few seconds to read the extra sentences of fluff, I've found, really ties the world together. In my first couple of games I actually almost felt as if I was playing a scripted campaign, not a compeltely random map. The music even has me humming along occaisonally, and further adds to the atmosphere and respectable production quality.\n\nI bought the game on sale, then a couple of days later bought most of the DLCs just because I felt like I owed them more money. The base game is worth full price, and I'm a bit ashamed, as a fan of the 4X genre, that I hadn't gotten this when it was brand new.\n\nI don't know what else is left to say other than that at 20+ hours in, I am sure I'll be spending quadruple that in the next few months in Endless Legend. I am looking forward to starting up the next game as a new faction to see how the game plays through with them, as the two of them I've tried thus far are distinctly unique in their playstyle. Playing a multiplayer map with some friends is bound to be a good time as well.\n\nTruly solid experience.","February 19","true","38.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I just can't waste this opportunity.\n\nWho are we kidding, I am totally wasting this opportunity.\n\n________________________________\n\nSo, looks like Endless Legend is a game. On Steam.  No, really. I kid you not. There may be cows. There may not. I really don't know. Based on my experience of not owning and never playing this game, it is entirely possible you may like Endless Legend. Or not. Hey, what do I know of Endless Legend? I came here to read reviews just like you shmucks. Then I saw the big bold "Write a Review" header and ran with it.\n\nEndless Legend may be great fun. Maybe. I'm really not sure. Yea, let's just say it IS actually guaranteed to be fun for everyone, because it has a "Very Positive" User Review Rating thingy. And while we're at it, let's all pretend like THAT really means anything. Let's all pretend there aren't games on Steam with "Overwhelmingly Positive" User Review ratings that when you scroll down to read the immense praise for this miracle game, you find out the top 30-50 reviews are almost completely negative. Explain that and you win the prize. Uh yea, I'm afraid you will need to hop on down to the store and buy your own prize, I'm fresh out. I promise I had you something really good, but I ate it. What? I get hungry. Reading game reviews works up an appetite. And no, these are NOT my fat pants. I just like an expandable waist in my comfy pants.\n\nI really do hope it has cows. Space cows, bc apparently this thing is like Civ, in Space. So like Alpha Centuari, only hopefully much better. Or maybe not. Hard to tell, especially since I've never actually played EL. Now Alpha Centauri I bought on CD when it first came out. Hated it. It was truly terrible, which made me very sad. Also, FYI, it didn't have cows either. I really didn't expect it to. Just mentioning it in case you were wondering. I don't think Sid Meier likes Cows. He may in fact, be anti-cow. Sure, you can have a single Musketman take out an entire army of Apache attack helicopters, but noooooo, can't have an elite squadron of highly effective Cow Mercenaries now can we Sid!\n\nSo....Space Cows. How awesome would that be? Pretty freakin awesome! You keep those nasty Badgers out of this. We don't need no stinking Badgers!\n\nWe definitely need more games with Space Cows. H.G. Wells story "The First Men in the Moon" had space cows. No, seriously it really did. Well, technically they were Moon Calves, but still.\n\nDevelopers listen up: We need more games with Space Cows! But even Space cows wouldn't have helped Alpha Centauri. Hey, they can't all be winners. Whiners yes, we get a lot of those. Not so many Winners. But I guess you could give Centaruri a participation trophy just for showing up. Sure, you will still be ugly and no one will play with you, but at least you got a trophy! Isn't that great?\n\nNot as great as Space Cows.\n\nAccording to most of the real reviews for EL, the jury is still out on whether or not this game deserves a Participation Trophy or not. I was really hoping it would pull thru and actually be good. That way I could buy it on sale and enjoy the crap out of it. From what I'm reading, I'm not quite sold yet.\n\n\nSo I could end this review in the usual manner with something like:\nDidn't buy this game\nBought a Prius instead\nHonestly, what was I thinking?\nMade many other bad life choices12/10 Would Write fake review again.\n\nBut I won't. Because honestly, that was cute in what, 2012? Now, not so much.\n\n\n*So. Yea. How's your Mom & all them other folks? Doing good, yea? Hey, tell your sister I said Hi, & I'm sorry I didn't call. I really meant to, but you know how it is. Been busy. Oh nothing big, just reading reviews and stuff. Yea, you too.

It's probably the most well made and rounded 4X game I've played, and even the DLC is completely worth it, each adding great content fairly cheap, compared to many other games I can think that do neither.\n\nI want to point on what I've had in my mind on most of my games, which is the combat AI. It's really brilliant. The units don't just go to the target the shortest way to attack; they will find the best way for them to get a bonus, e.g. if they have to circle around a unit so they can get high ground, then they will. The only complaint I have on that matter is that it would be nice if the support Heroes would give their bonuses and heals to the unit that would need it most, instead of themselves in case they have no action against an opponent (in the case of holding ground).\n\nAll being said, I'd definitely recommend this for all fans of 4X games.

The biggest improvement, by far, is the combat.  Combat in Civ has historically just been [this number] vs. [this number].  Civ V did a lot to increase tactical play by removing unit stacking, but it still doesn't hold a candle to Endless Legend.  The city combat system is also leagues ahead of Civ.

Its very polished, looks great, the menus are intuitive, and its easy to get an understanding of what your empire is doing in a quick look.\n\nHowever, this game bored the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nMy biggest problem was the combat. I read reviews and from what I understood, combat was going to be like Age of Wonders 3. And while they share similarities, Endless Legend dumbed it down big time. In this game, you don't individually move your units and attack. Instead, you give a very, VERY general set of instructions. You tell a unit to attack an enemy, no matter if the unit can reach the enemy or not, and thats it. Your unit does its best to get within range and attacks if able. Automatically. There is no tactics, no skill. Its purely who has the most units, who has the smartest units, and who has the best equiped units.\n\nNo special powers, no tactical positioning to flank an enemy cause there is no bonus for such things. You can't select one unit, move it out of the way so another unit can move to its spot and attack. You can't even really tell your unit where to go in most cases. While it is true that you can tell your unit to move to a specific place next to an enemy and attack, if that enemy moves before that unit, the unit isn't going to do anything except move because now the enemy isn't where you told your unit to move.\n\nCombat in this game has been dumbed down to "Everyone attack this one guy! And if he dies, then attack whatever guy you feel like! But be sure to trip over yourselves trying to get within fighting range!" You make sure the red lines are all pointing towards one guy, hit play, and watch your units try their little hearts out to attack whatever the red line pointed at.\n\nMy next issue is equiping and upgrading your units (I.E. the RPG aspect of this game)\n\nFirst, I have an issue with having only one infantry, archer/support, and calvery unit per race. In order to get more units, you have to convince a minor faction (Either by destroying their village in your region then rebuilding it, bribing them, or completing a quest for them) to be assimilated into your faction. Then you get their one unit. Which I must admit, was pretty lame to me. I like to have multiple units with different abilities so being restricted to less than a hands count sucked.\n\nI was fully expecting to find magical gear like powered up swords or armor and having to choose which units or heroes to give it to. Instead Endless Legend makes you choose between having your one racial infantry unit hold a sword or spear (Doing extra damage to infantry or calvary respectively) and just getting the next "Tier" of armor your technology level allows.\n\nI will admit, I liked being able to upgrade or "Retrofit" as the game calls it my units after adding my newly researched better armor to them immediately. But again, the upgrade itself is nothing more than equiping the next level of equipment rather than making any real choice as to how to upgrade them.\n\nThe heroes was something I liked however. Your heroes have a skill tree with 3 different trees with abilities that can affect them if they are the general of an army or the mayor of a town. Or both in some cases. It did make you have to choose if you wanted a powerful unit or to give a city huge bonuses.\n\nThe city building was interesting. Its a mix between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic 6 I believe. Maybe 5. I don't remember. But you build a city anywhere you want in a region, which are randomly cut out areas on the map. But you can only have one city per region so once you build a city, that region is considered yours. Along with everything in it. So enemy players can't build a city directly next to your land and take it via influence like in Civilization.\n\nI'm not a real fan of the thumbs up or down method steam uses to rate games because this game itself isn't bad. It was just incredibly boring to me which is why I cannot recommend it.","October 6, 2014","false","2.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

What killed this game for me is the combat... it just plays so clunkily. You tell a unit to hold position and then they run two spaces away into range of the enemy, but not into their own range? I don't really understand anything except that I can't control my units how I want to and it's cost me more than a few victories in my limited play time. That and there's no way to disengage from a battle, so if you happen to click on an enemy party that displays 2 units and they have 12 units of reinforcements, you can't back down. Good luck surviving six turns of reinforcements.\nThe units and mini-factions are even more diverse and unique than the major factions; I would argue that the strongest selling point of this game is the ability to experiment with so many different unit (through various faction assimilations) combinations. However, the individual major factions, to make up for all this diversity, really only give you three units each, which is a bit disappointing. The heroes for each major faction (thankfully you can recruit outside your faction) are essentially all the same, too... also disappointing.\nIt's worth dinking around with if you're a big RTS fan, but nothing every gamer must own. Game plays a little too slowly for me, even for an RTS. It's probably gorgeous, if graphics attract you, but the combat is awful and hard to control. Oh, and the clicking in this game drives you bonkers after awhile. Have to click on things four to five times occasionally to select it.\nEDIT: There is a retreat button, but it only seems to appear if you have a distinct unit advantage... at least, that's the only time I've seen it. Also, the soundtrack is pretty, but gets repetitive quickly.","December 16, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They also have different styles to obtain victory\n+ The possibility to make custom races based on pre-existing ones.\n+ Every race has their own, interesting storyline.\n+ More victory types than in Civilizations V\n+ Beautiful graphics style\n+ Amazing music with a unique sound to it\n+ The pace of the game is quicker than in Civilization. You do not have to wait for ages (literally) for just a monument to be built.\n+ Immersive fantasy-world\n+ Unit customization\n+ The game has in-game quests that grant you rewards upon completing them. Also, each faction itself has its own main quest and they are really rewarding since the benefits they give you can be quite large.\n+ The combat system is interesting and actually challenging and although it may feel you have little influence at first, there is really a lot you can do to influence it. It is more like telling your units what to do instead of controlling them perfectly.\n+ Made by a developer that continues to add new content. For free. Yes. Here, you do not have to buy a ton of silly downloadable content or expansions to make the game more fun. *Winks to Firaxis*\n+ Good city building style and management\n+ Conquered cities do not lose 75% of the existing buildings like in Civilizations, the same with population. Because of this a conquered city still has value. Also the cities that are founded later in the game are not necessarily behind in the development, because you can buy buildings from the early game for a relatively low price and so the new city can quickly go to the same level of  your older cities.\n\n-+ Science. It is interesting and also non-linear. But it feels a little weird for me. Also, most researches are often focused on just one type of advantage. So, things that purely give you more food, or more Dust (= money), or purely militairy things.\n\n\nSome negative:\n- May be overwhelming in the beginning. Because it can be a little complicated and the game itself provides few explanations.\n- The game can get a little laggy near the end of the game. Especially when the winter comes.\n- If you compare waging wars in this game to waging wars in Civilization V, then I must say that in Civilization V it was better. Because an army was not a single entity like in this game. There was also nothing more satisfying than rolling several catapults supported by a ton of swordsmen and archers up to an enemy's city and than bombarding the hell out of it. It was rather satisfying. Although sieges in Endless Legend are also good (and I like the idea with units being granted extra health points for defending in a siege) it is simply less exhilerating.\n- In continuation of the above. War music. Declaring war on someone and then getting to hear adrenaline-filled songs may be one of the reasons why I always ended up being called the ''warmongering menace'' in Civ V, unfortunately these war/peace themes are not as present as in Endless Legend or do not exist.\n- Small variety of units\n- No naval combat. The seas are not used for anything more than transporting troops.\n\nI cannot think of more negatives.\n\nIn short, I would say that this game is rather innovative and beats Civ Beyond earth any day in the history of mankind, or the future for that matter.\n\nToo long; did not read: simply buy this game.","November 27, 2014","true","117.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite a few missing features it plays like a finished product.  Players will have to get used to the concept of not having as direct control over their troops in combat, but this actually helps the game flow as it means you aren't so afraid to use Autocombat since the results will be close to what you could have managed manually, which keeps the game moving fast.\nResearch moves at an excellent pace and the story quests behind each faction remain interesting.

Just because it plays like the basics of civ5 mean it is civ5, there is in my opinion many more things that this game has then civ5 does. Each faction is totaly unique and plays completly different then the others, they each have their own lore and each unit looks and acts different from another. Each faction has 4 unique units that have different strengths and weaknesses. Also players start with a "hero" which is basically a general from civ5 but that does way more then adding a buff to a unit. There are tons of heros from each faction and each one looks different(heros from same faction has small differences but have different uses) and plays differnetly, one may be used for leading a army by giving it +2 damage while one could be used to govern and town and give it +6 industry. Also every unit can be customized with different equipment to make them stronger as the game goes by, this is simmilar to civ but instead of the unit become a differnet teir(as a musketer becomes and rifleman) the units in this game stay the same except their equipment changes and you can see the difference in appearance do to this change. Also like civ5 there is small factions that are ran by ai, you can add these to your empire by either attacking and defeating them, bribing them, or by completeing quests given by them. Once they join you then you can assimilate them into your empire and then produce their unit that can only be used by assimilating them. The unit is based off that small faction and its appearance is completely differnet to any of the playable factions, there are lots of these small factions that can be conquered by the player.

If youo're looking for a 4x game with a really intriguing story and a neat take on the 4x formula, this is a great game. Also, be prepared to do a lot of micro managing. If you're into that (as I am) you'll have a lot more fun with it. The story behind each of the 8 playable factions is deep enough to get invested in, but open enough for the player to make their own story out of it.\n\nHowever, there are some very frustrating things with the quest system. Quests are a very important part of the game, but they are by far the weakest part. There are many quests whose completion requirements are overly specific in what is required, and yet strangely general in how they are told. Many times I thought I completed a quest and hadn't because of some minor detail which wasn't fully recounted. For example, one quest required me to grow a city to the size of 8. The city was already at a size of 14, but the quest didn't complete. I had to starve the city down to 7 population, and then re-grow it to get the completion on the quest. Possibly that was intentional, but it was extremely frustrating. Twice, the game actually bugged in such a way that completing a quest was impossible.\n\nThere have also been more than a few crashes, but the game autosaves every turn so it's not that much of a problem, and with luck that will get fixed in a later patch.\n\nOverall, mostly great 4x game that could use a few patches. If the quests are fixed and the crash bugs are removed, this game is very solid.","January 5, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

A lot of 4x games (not including space 4x) tend to be heavily modeled after the Civilization series, not Endless Legend though. This game is very much its own game.\n\nPros:\nEach Faction plays very differently from each other. Necrophages can't have peace or alliances, Broken Lords don't need food. Drakken can force peace upon another player, Roving Clans can't declare war etc. Each faction truly is a vastly different playstyle.\n\nThe game is beautiful. A minor thing that just makes it more enjoyable.\n\nThe battle system is interesting. More in depth than Civ's smack two units against each other, but not as in depth as Age of Wonders 3 where you control each unit on the battle field.\n\nThe world is very diverse and there are quests, ruins, minor factions etc. that make exploring both profitable and enjoyable.\n\nUnit Customization. You can alter your units with different armor, weapons and trinkets to suit your needs. You take a basic unit from your faction (or assimilated minor factions) and equip them with different equipment to make them stronger or more specialized. For instance you could have a lance weilding Stalwart that does a lot of damage, or one that can take as much damage as you throw at it.\n\nHeroes: Strong units that lead armies or govern cities. Very useful and very cool.\n\nMixed:\nThe region system is somewhat strange. When you settle a region with a city, you own that whole region. However, only the tiles directly around your city are worked. You also can only found a single city per region. This means that many areas that would make excellent cities are wasted. On the other hand all the strategic and luxury resources in the region can be harvested by the single city. You also don't get AI settling right next to your city to steal a resource like in Civ.\n\nCons:\nLimited number of Units. Each faction only has 4 base units. You can assimilate different minor factions for their units but there is a limited number of slots to do this. Compared to other games there aren't many units around. However each faction has three unique units (the settler is common to almost all the factions).\n\nAI can travel into your territory automatically and can attack your units outside of your territory without declaring war. You have to declare peace for them not to be able to attack your units and declare closed borders to keep them out of your territory. Both of which cost influence.\n\nDeclaring war costs influence. Severely annoying and pointless. The other diplomatic stuff makes sense. This does not. You don't need to influece someone to declare war, you just attack them.","September 27, 2014","true","46.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Lots of people say this is endless space in a fantasy setting. I disagree. Although some of the mechanics are similar this game is different. Its also different and a lot more fun than many other fantasy based 4X titles.\n\nSo far I am into my first game and practically did not stop for 14 hours. Yes this game does an excellent job of keeping you in it. The game has a brief tutorial which does a great job of familiarising you with the basics. At first the game does appear a bit daunting with so many options and things to remember. After a couple of hours I became comfortable and then everything just seem to get better as my Empire slowly came to life. Breaking my 4x tradition I decided to start with a faction thats focus is on economy. I have to say  its really been good. It makes a change to buy your way to success instead of relying on churning out a constant army. With this faction I buy my army and its ready in an instant. The game consists of several varied and interesting major factions and then you have numerous minor factions.  Whichever major faction you choose they will have their own unique background story and quests.\n\nUnits vary but are basically broken down into heroes, support, infantry, cavalry, ranged and flying. You can even make your own units. To conquer regions you need cities and growing your city is a long process. In fact as your research grows you will enter several different ages unlocking even more ablities for the city. As well as battles this game is very much about resource management. I love the way every single hex in the game produces some kind of resource in different quantities. This makes it especially important when deciding where to place your city.\n\nThis game is pretty much all about time and planning. I really like it that at the beginning of the game you will be in whats known as a 'cold war' with all the other factions. At this stage there can be no peace treaties and you are quite exposed if you end up next door to an aggressive neighbour. Diplomacy in endless legends takes a long time to bear fruit. One thing I do like about the AI on easier settings is that it doesn't tend to attack you the moment it stumbles across you. I've played too many 4X's in the past where you literally get jumped on by the AI before you have started. The great thing about endless is that you start off with a limited number of diplomatic options. The others only come later if you research them. All the other AI factions in the game behave in a specific way. Some are expansionists while others are pacifists. This becomes apparent over time when you see how the factions behave towards each other and the size of their territory.\n\nOn to the map. Its one of the best and most intuitive I've seen in a 4x. Randomly generated hex landscapes with varied environments from cold wastes to desert. Each will effect how units interact with it. Scattered across the landscape are numerous weird anomalies, exploitable resources, explorable ruins and minor factions. At any point you can smoothly zoom right in and out of the map to get an overview of the empires. The map is big and takes a long time to fully explore. Minor factions play a role in that you need to pacify them early or they will become a threat with their wandering armies. You can even assimilate a limited number of pacified factions which will give you access to one of their units.\n\nBattles are fought on a zoomed in version of the region it takes place on. Then its a simple turned based hex battle which goes through a number of phases before the outcome is decided. The environment your units are in at the time will have an effect. Some may think the battles are too simplified with limited options and no spell books like with HoMM games. To be honest I think it works just fine for endless. After a battle if you win your units will earn experience points and gradually level up. This makes keeping veteran armies alive essential for the later game.\n\nThe music score is superb and blends into the game perfectly.\n\nThere is a lot more to this game than what I have touched on in this review. Be sure that once its got your attention you will be sinking endless hours into it.\n\n10/10","September 28, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The screenshots and overall favorable reviews is what sold it to me.  I'm a huge fan of the 4x strategy games and with that being said, I was NOT disappionted in the slightest way with Endless Legend.\n\nSome of the pros with this game include the graphics.  Great graphics, especially when compared to games like Civ and Fallen Enchantress.  The units and factions are also completely fresh.   There are your typical archers and melee units which are both essential to any 4x game but take my word for it, a lot of units are at least slightly different and most are really cool (Especially on your first few play throughs when you first encounter them).  Another pro for me is the added involvement regarding the city building aspect of the game.  Each time your city gains population you gain a "Worker" that you can place in specific parts of the building/production within your cities.  If you need buildings or units produced more quickly put more of your "Workers" in the production.  Technologies not getting researched fast enough place them into the science slot etc.\n\nWith this being said, the game isn't without it's downfalls (In my opinion).  I prefer to have more control over my units during combat.  I would rather control each unit for each move.  This isn't the case in Endless Legend.  When your units are involved in a a battle you basically follow the certain steps.  First off, the battle map is basically a zoomed in portion of the current location of the map that unit is currently on (This for me is actually a plus and definitely a welcomed change).  However, the battle sequence leaves a bit to be desired.  To start you basically have to place your units.  Then you select what you want them to do whether it be to attack a specific unit or if you have a healing unit etc. you decide who you want them heal etc.  The battle then ensues until the next turn where you have the option to change your strategies and the battle sequence proceeds as previously mentioned.  Some may prefer this method as it is simplified but I prefer battle sequences like Age of Wonders 3.\n\nThe modifications also leave a little to be desired for me as well.  Personally I love that fact in Fallen Enchantress where you can outfit your heroes with anything and it shows on the character, not only on the character screen but when you see them in the world too.  With Endless Legends this portion is true in regards to the weapon and Shield only.  Any new armor etc can be equipped but you will not see them.\n\nOverall I do recommend the game and it has kept me busy for about 16hrs since purchase and I'll be busy for many more hours because of the differences it offers to the genre.  It is fun and when I want a slight change in units/factions/city buidling I'll be starting this one up!","September 28, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played through several full games as the different factions and found that each of them is very unique. I'd say that this is the biggest thing that the game has over Civilization V. If you're at all interested I recommend you read up on each of these because it would take too long to explain here. The other two big differences are a quest and combat systems. Unlike Civ5's city state quests, they don't involve racing other factions or killing another city state(there are none). They're a bit more interesting and present some semblance of a story for each of the factions. Of course, there's not much depth to be expected of quests in a 4X game, but they do make the game a bit more interesting. The combat system, on the other hand, isn't very good and is kind of tedious, especially because of the slow animations. So I wouldn't recommend picking this game up just becasuse you like turn-based combat. But still, it's there and does add SOME depth to combat which would otherwise just be RNG-based.\n\nI recommend this game, but I'm also not sure if it feels done yet. I've been playing on the 'Hard' difficulty and I've found that diplomacy and other AI behaviors are a bit irrational. I hope this is something that will be addressed in a future patch. I expect it to be.","September 28, 2014","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Autosaves happen every turn to rescue you from this. If you get errors without a crash then it is best to exit the game as re-opening the game can fix the errors. Hopefully these issues will be fixed in a future patch but be warned if you see an error the game may crash in a future turn but your save is probably fine if you restart.\n\nSome of the features I like from this game:\n\nSeasons mean winter suddenly drops your food and other production, poorly designed empires can find them selves starved. Troops move slowly in winter and it gives a sensible pause in war efforts. Once you have troops with winter resistence via high level skills you can gain advantages in the winter.\n\nDiplomacy has a default state of cold war, one step from peace or war. Peace and Alliances must be researched before being offered and military players can not only ignore diplomacy but also ignore chunks of the research options.\n\nTroops can be edited to give them the latest equipment, then troops built on those original builds can be retrofitted to the current build.\n\nHeroes stationed in cities earn experience as quickly or faster than combat Heroes. The earn experience for everything built at the city so defensive and peaceful empires can still build powerful heroes. Heroes also have a whole chain of skills focused on city boosting.\n\nEach faction has a recommended victory type to aim for.\nCultists for example can only build one city and expand through village conversion instead. Each village gives them resouces, an extra city worker and troops are generated for free in the village. The city can grow a level higher than any other faction and numbers of workers in the end game can be very high due to all the villages converted.\nTo play each faction to the full you need to embrace there game mechanic and just playing each faction gives a lot of replay.\n\nDifficulty is simpler than other games in the ilk as long as you follow the correct playstyle for your faction and utilise your heroes fully. Anything below normal should be treated as training and normal may be to easy if you play a lot of strategy games.\n\nMy first playthroughs with the Wind Walkers took 15+ hours and my second play with Cultists taking less than 8 hours.\nIf you ignore the story line quests and focus on a quick win on maps other than huge you could do this in a much shorter time.\nPlaying the remaining factions I expect to spend another 30-60 hours trying out the other 6 main factions.","September 28, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the past the 4x genre was an interesting and innovative hybrid of strategy games. Unfortunately many have been taking the "safe" route. (Read UNinteresting and UNinnovative.)\n\nThen Endless Legend walked into the room like a boss, announced that it didn't like the tried and true. It told us that it didn't care what people thought of it.\nAnd it truly doesn't, and I love it for that.\nIt brought us many new or semi new features, some that it came up with on it's own, some that it borrowed.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind, is the region system.\nGone are the days of spamming cities on every open piece of dirt, whether valuable or not, (Cough-Civ series-Cough) Now every section of the vast continents of land is divided up by regions in which only one city may settle upon. Certain factions are even penalized for expanding onto them too quickly.\nIt creates an atmosphere that makes each and every one of the cities in your kingdom seem more unique and important.\nInstead of thinking of it as just another city, now I think of it by its name and history.\n\nSpeaking of regions, there are a wealth of resources in them, both strategic and luxury that can implemented in different manners. Sell and trade them or use them as boost for different affects. They apply different bonuses for your cities, troops and for you kingdom overall.\nResources not enough for you? How about natives? Each region has different native populations that can be assimilated, either by force, bribery or peaceful means. Different species bring interesting boosts to the region and can even be recruited. Ever felt like fielding an army of wolf/human hybrids? Now you can.\n\n---\n\nAll layers of the standard 4x are here, diplomacy, economy, expansion and combat. All are done well.\nI really enjoyed the diplomacy, and that happens to be a vastly overlooked feature in most strategy games.\nBut not here. My only wish is that many of the features were not locked behind technology research.\n\nNow that I mentioned technology, Endless Legends has its own view on research trees. It is rather standard with only a few minor twists, there being 6 different ages, all bringing new technologies to research.\nSometimes it seems cluttered and sometimes big decisions must be made. I'm not a huge fan and I hope they rework it through patches.\nBut it's not big enough of a problem to really detract from the game overall.\n\n---\n\nThat's racist.\nWith only 8 different races to choose from, it may sound like their aren't a-lot of options there.\nBut instead of 40 different copy-paste races with a few minor bonuses to switch things up with, Endless legends 8 races all play vastly different from each-other and make each play-through seem like you're playing a different game altogether.\nIn the wise wise words of Lloyd Christmas, "I like it alot".\n\n---\n\nTroops and heroes. The backbone of every 4x, at first glance it appears that this is one of the down failings of Endless Legend, when in fact it is a strong point.\nYour standard kingdom only has 4 different soldiers, which sounds like a bummer. That is until you realize that they can be upgraded in many different ways and the aforementioned native and independent troops that can be bought, traded or assimilated into you kingdom. All customizable.\nTrue, they aren't as customizable as some games have striven to make theirs, but in Endless Legends, your choices on each piece of gear is strategically important.\nMy only complaint here is that upon equipping a new piece of armor, one cant visibly see a difference in the character sprite, that is slightly disappointing and will hopefully be patched later on.\nOn to heroes! While they can be leveled up, perks and bonuses chosen, extra gear and and gadgets equipped, they seem rather dull.\nDon't get me wrong, they are very important to a successful army, just the heroes themselves have no real personalities or real distinctiveness, which in a unique game full of personality, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\n---\n\nMusic and graphics.\nWhile these two are less important for a strategy game, they really do need mentioning.\nRarely have I seen or heard such a beautiful game. The graphics are georgeus and relay a real sense of immersion. I believe this may be the most graphically lush 4x I've ever played.\nThe music is phenomenal. I've never bought a game's soundtrack before, but I will this one.\nThe music is rendered in the up-most quality, I can't say I've heard such a soundtrack since Arcanum. and that is the biggest complement I can fathom.\n\n---\n\nOverall, I give this game a high recommendation for any fan of 4x strategy games. It managed to pull me deeper than many of its peers in the gaming market. I do not regret this purchase in the slightest, and that coming from a poor man, well that means a-lot.\nThere are some balancing issues here and there, but with Amplitude-Studios track record, it's safe to say that they will be fixed shortly. That and the addition of modding support, the only direction this game is going, is up.\nI've seen what dedicated moders can do with the proper support and that has the potential to add years and years of playability.\nIf your into 4x and you want something that doesn't come from an assembly line, you couldn't do better than Endless Legends especially for the price.\nFor those poorer gamers like myself, Christmas time at Steam is coming!","November 1, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/recommended/289130/","aspaceotter","aspaceotter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/","104 products in account","Endless legends is a game unlike any I have played before. It begins much in the way a game of civilizaiton would, you place a capital and branch out to new cities through the use of settlers, conquests, bribes, and even an intriguing quest system. If you enjoy games like civilization revolution then you will love this unique twist and style that endless legends brings to the genre.\n\nWhile this game is one of the best games of the genre it does have its draw backs. Throughout my play through I began to notice a few irritating things that I feel are necessary to understand about this game before purchase. My first point would be to say that this game is not one that encourages variety. Every faction has three basic units that are unlocked fairly early on, and then they are allowed to assimilate a few minor factions along the way in order to broaden their unit scope. While this may not seem like a big deal to many people it does put certain factions at a major disadvantage against experienced players. My most recent encounter with this is that the Mezari start the game with ranged units that are able to move and shoot all in the same turn, this allows them to kite early game fights and put almost all other factions into the dirt early game. While this may seem like something that many people see as counterable you have to realize that certain factions such as the drakken and the broken lords have no way of countering a ranged unit as they have no late game ranged units of their own without using a valuable assimilation slot.\n\nWhile this game does have its flaws, it is almost impossible to pass up. Its unique quest system sets it apart from the other titles in this genre, as you now no longer have to build a final building but instead with each faction you are encouraged to follow a specific path that will also allow you win the game. Knowing these paths for each faction you are offered a very interesting way of now denying your allies victory, without having to declare war. We also see the hero system in this game help to further its path to the top of my list of most played games. This game rewards those who use its heroes correctly, offering multiple skill tree paths and roles for heroes. A fully leveled hero in this game could be the difference maker in a battle, as a support hero might be what is needed to keep one militia group alive against multiple titans.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to any lovers of the civilization series, it sticks to the basic city building aspect of the civ series, all the while giving a unique spin on the battle system and diplomacy system.\n","March 6, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crispy52/recommended/289130/","crispy52","Crispy52","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crispy52/","229 products in account","Endless Legend took me by surprise. I have been a huge Civilization 5 player, with 263 hours on file at the moment, and my heart had always belonged with that game. I recently found interest in Endless Legend and purchased it and I think its a game that every fan of the 4x genre should play or at least look into.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful, intriguing world. Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game.\n2. Emphasis on effective empire management. City-building, economy balancing, and researching the tech-circles are really fun. There is also a great emphasis on resource management, each worker you unlock can be placed in different points of emphasis for more resource gain. If you are play a science victory you may want more workers placed in science production to research quickly. If you are playing a supremacy race you may be more interested in placing your workers in industry so you can build units/city expansions quicker, etc...\n3. Combat is done nicely. You can choose to tactically face your opponent in a way that sort of reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic. It is turn-based and there may be some strategy. If you don't like that you can choose to spectate and watch the computer make your moves for you or you can just auto-resolve and move on. If you auto-resolve or spectate, you can choose for the computer to be aggressive or passive as well. You can also upgrade units with new weapons that you can craft through the research tree, or find in quests.\n4. Different factions that actually play quite differently. Some factions just simply cannot do certain things. Such as the necrophage, they can't create peace treaties. They are simply a faction that is meant to kill everything. Playing as the necrophage you may want to push all your workers into industry in order to build your improvements/milita quicker. Playing as the ardent mages you may want to move your workers into science production so that you can rush through the research tree and race to a science victory. There is even a faction that relies solely upon Dust (the games gold currency).\n4. Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre. For example: race-specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc.\n5. The seasonal affects may actually impact some factions play. I know that whenever I enter the winter my production slows greatly. I end up losing roughly 60 gold per turn and most of the units can only move 1 space or so.\n6. You can assimilate with minor factions and build/upgrade their units once you acquire them. They also have bonuses that they will provide to your city once you control them.\n7. The artstyle is very intriguing.\n8. It isn't like other 4x titles. In fact it does a very good job at seperating itself from other 4x titles (civ 5, age of wonders, etc..)\n9. You can create your own factions with all the different perks and army units that are provided in the base game. So if you don't like the factions that are in the game you can customize your own from the bottom up.\n\nCons:\n1. A.I. is kind of bad with certain factions. With the Drakken they are really strong but with some of the other factions they act kind of stupid. This is the game's greatest downfall. But with the modding community helping this out and patches still being worked on (i think) this will come to an end hopefully.\n2. It would be cool if there were more factions. I'm sure there are other factions you can download through mods but it would've been cool to see more than just 9 factions in the base game.\n3. To some this is a con: The game is not as easily learned as something like Civ 5. Each turn you have to remember where your units were, you have to remember which direction they were heading, and what they were doing. There is more micromanaging in this game with emphasis on what workers produce which things. There are some things you may even have to wiki as well. There is a lot of things you will just learn the more you play considering the game doesn't really hold your hand at all. Even the tutorial is very basic and doesn't quite go over everything you will face in the game itself.\n\nSummary:\nWhen i play this game i instantly compare this game to an RPG. There are very many RPG like elements that are fused with the 4x style and this game does it VERY well. The artstyle is very unique and the way it plays is somewhat similar to what HeroScape was like back in the day. In my opinion it is more smooth that Civ 5 and there is more thought that is required within each turn. There aren't many situtations where you will just sit there and continuously hit the end-turn button. There is always a goal in each turn whether it is working towards the factions quests, trying to parley and assimilate with a minor faction, or expand. Yes, the AI needs improvement, but overall I think this is a great game. I wouldn't even say that the AIs mistakes are as noticeable as some of the other strategy games that exist. Playing on higher difficulties even create a loss more often than not so I think that creates a nice challenge sometimes.","March 14, 2015","true","97.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After being disappointed by Civilization: Beyond Earth, I feel like Endless Legend scratches all the itches that Beyond Earth should have. It borrows a lot of the good things from Civilization V, and fixes a lot of the bad things. Combat consists of tactical battles between two armies of multiple units and possible reinforcement from other units in the area. Where Civ 5's combat is cramped and tight, Endless Legend has found a decent compromise between "one unit per tile" and the ridiculous stacked armies of Civ IV. At the same time, walls and cliffs between tiles adds more tactical variation to the maps.\n\nThe world is beautiful. Where Civ:BE all feels a little bland and samey, this game has individual regions which each have their own visually spectacular biome. Also unlike Civ:BE, the factions in Endless Legend all feel distinct and interesting. Leader portraits are animated in this really cool oil painting style. Even the hexes have variance to them, looking like randomized, striking geographical shapes rather than identical hexagonal tiles. This game may not have the greatest graphics of all time, but the excellent art direction and attention to detail more than make up for it.\n\nIt does seem a little barebones compared to games like Civ in terms of sheer numbers of factions, units, and technologies. In the end though, everything combines to create quite a deep experience. My only real complaints are that a few parts of the user interface are counter-intuitive, and that it can be difficult to find your units in the clutter sometimes. It can be annoying, but I've mostly gotten used to it. I recommend Endless Legend for anybody who enjoyed Civ V. Just play the tutorial and it'll be simple to figure this game out.","March 5, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game map is the most beautiful I've seen in a strategy game, even more so than Civ V. They've also managed to do a fantasy strategy game right, each faction (all EIGHT of them) is very distinct and unique. The game plays like a mash up of Civ and Elemental Fallen Enchantress, taking all of the best parts from each. The tech tree is broad and you'll make meaningful decisions about which techs to pick up and which to skip. I do wish heroes had a bit more oomph in their leveling. It is also a shame that changing armor load outs on units/heroes doesn't affect their appearance in any way.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is that it's fairly complex, and despite having a good tutorial to introduce you to the UI and basics of the game, some more advanced mechanics are not explained, and the game's wiki is pretty bare bones.\n\nThat said, overall the game is great, you should play it if you're a strategy/fantasy fan.","September 25, 2014","true","91.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I half-expected a game that only feels like it's jsut trying to be another Civ game, but what I got was a game that does draw inspiration from Civ 5, but doesn't really feel similar.\n\nFirst off, alot of the things that really annoyed me about Endless Space are no longer here. Actually none of them are.\n1. The AI is actually less stupid and basic and WAY less hard to fight at Easy difficulty.\n2. The game's combat system uses none of that stupid freaking card crap from Endless Space which is always better to go without in my opinion, making victory more about strategy and less about chance. Combat has about as much chance as Civ 5 or any 4X game has.\n3. The game doesn't feel or seem like it's trying to be Civilization 5, or trying to sell itself as such, instead this game feels like it's actually on it's own ground, although connected to Civ 5, that's not remotely bad however.\n\nThe UI from Endless Space is the only reason I still occasionally played it, but now that this game is out and has an even better version of it, which has only very tiny differences to make it all the more better, I've got no reason to play Endless Space anymore.\n\nThe game's handling of city's makes things much less complicated in one way while allowing more complication in another way.\n\nEach region can only have a single city, but the game is set up into multiple regions. Each city's limits are capped at the edges of a region, and the city limits are expanded using burroughs.\nThis makes a sort of promise that you'll be spending less time worrying about city placement in relation to the other cities on the map, but it makes he same promise that you'll be spending more time in macro managing your cities over time.\n\nThe game (like Civ) has many resources and special tile benefits that (if worked) bestow huge bonuses to a city, and ofcourse in turn, your empire.\n\nUnlike Civ however, there are no gimmicky things which give you bonuses over others or makes your life more difficulty if not utilized, such as Culture, Tourism or Religion, there also is no ability to move over water tiles however as the regions always end after the first water tile of any palce's coast.\n\nThe usual difficulties from endless Space are there, and if anything, this game has a bit of a sense that it's like a prequel to Endless Space, most likely intended due to the title of this game and Endless Space.\n\nIn my opinion... This game is fun, it's rather challenging with the Minor races sometimes getting very aggressive at random times, the other civilizations seem to be less warmongering (unless you're the Necrophages, you know... the Krogan disease from Mass Effect, only with undead) in comparison to their previous game, and that is honestly really quite nice.\n\nThe way the game handles technology is awesome, and I wish other games did such. The game's technologies are split up into 4 Eras. researching 9 in one era will unlock the next and advance you to it, and so on until the 9th (where I imagine techs to get a science victory would be possible.\n\nThe game has none of the dead wonders you could find in Space, thank the gods as in my opinion, they detracted and were often not worth restoring unless you could manage 20 turns of getting something that would boost only approval, or would boost science just a bit.\n\nMy first game with 5 others took 4 hours and it's not even over yet, I've yet to get past the 2nd Era, but that is mostly due to the fact i spent 100 turns with 1 city, and that's never something you wanna do honestly.\n\nOverall, the game's very fun, original in it's own ways and has enough bits from Endless Space that it enhances what's already there, as certain aspects of Endless Space were already great, and... well why not use what's already great in another Turn-based game right?\n\nThere's some things I haven't said like the factions, or how there's heroes and how they're awesomely powerful, but I highly recommend you to atleast play it for yourself, you will enjoy what you see and experience. If you have doubts, then just ask a friend to play their copy, or do some research with gameplays and other reviews.\n\nMy final Verdict for this game, is an 8/10, it's honestly one of the most fun 4X games I've played in a while for the first time.","September 25, 2014","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I even recommend to go for the founders pack for the little etras and higher support to this great studio.\n\nA must in any steam collection.","September 20, 2014","true","63.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With a universe created in Endless Space (go check that out too), they bring the 4X turn-based strategy to a single planet with eight unique and interesting factions all readyto do whatever it takes to survive. The art style across the game from the anamoly-filled landscape to each factions' buildings, units, and their abilities are superb and enhanced by an enjoyable soundtrack.

You build towns and armies, develop them and conquer the world or become the world's leader through the several other victory types. However the implementation is better, with clever changes to many of the mechanics:\n\nCombat is handled through tactical battles on the world map. Once hostilites start an area of the map is sectioned off to be used as the battle field, allowing you to know the terrain beforehand. though exploiting that is a little difficult. Rather then precise commands you give broad directions or targets in combat, which makes battles quick and brutal compared to other 4x games with tactical combat.\n\nTowns hold a territory/province stopping town clustering though town placement is very important since the town only gathers resources from ajacent tiles, though extractors can be built on far away strategic or luxury resources. Additionally provinces have minor factions who can be convinced to join you via quests or bribes, or wiped out and built back up. These minor factions provide free workers and can be incorporated into the empire to give faction wide bonuses along with new units.\n\nUnits are quite customizable. You can choose from a few different armor and weapon types that vary depending on the type of units. The factions only get a few types of units which can then be customized to fit different roles and more unit types can be gained from the minor factions.\n\nThe factions themselves have quite a bit of variety from some factions which don't take food, to others that can't declare war, to another that cannot not be at war and even one that can only build one super town. Factions can also be customized, though the default factions seem to use more points then you get. Additionally the factions have interesting backstories that are fleshed out more on their faction specific quests.\n\nSo far the only real complaint I have is that the game is not balanced towards large maps. Expanding is punishing until high level techs are researched making much of a larger map unused. Otherwise this is probably the best 4x game I have played in awhile.","September 20, 2014","true","60.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Check to see if your computer meets the requirements. Double check and triple check it even. I neglected to thinking my computer could run it since it can run a lot of more demanding stuff but turns out it can't so the game crashes a lot at random. I can still play the game but it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to have to watch for crashes and restart the game. 2. You'll get much more enjoyment out of this game if you are already familiar with the Endless Space universe and lore. It's still a fine 4X strategy game but it's not too special if you don't appreciate the Endless Space lore.\n\nThat being said here's some pro con action.\nPros: Excellent soundtrack, keeping in tradition with Endless Space the game is has a very comfy atmosphere with it's music\nIt's damn pretty for a 4X game even on low end settings I'm impressed, I'm not sure there's another game out there that compares to this game on the graphics level in the same genre.\nThe AI is challenging but fair, it tends to make some really petty decisions though like "oh I see your army has visited my lands! you're banned from the market now lol" but each enemy empire has unique personalities a la the civilzation games\nAs mentioned earlier the lore and universe of Endless Space is important here and if you can appreciate it you'll get more out of the individual faction quests. The quests overall add something unique to the 4X genre and even though all of the sidequests tend to be random the main quests for each faction adds something cool to do when you're not doing other 4X activities.\nAlso keeping in tradition with Endless Space each of your units are completely customizable, well as far as weapons,  armor and accesories affecting unit stats goes.\n\nThe cons: AI is basically cheating at higher difficulties, this could be considered a pro depending on how you look at it but I don't really like it.\nThe combat, when you aren't auto-resolving, is a bit shallow. It basically boils down to changing positioning and firing orders each turn and watching two armies' numbers roll against eachother. Also if you build ranged units with maxed out initiative you can't lose really it's kind of disappointing. The only counter to this being beefing up the HP of your units so they can survive a couple combat rounds to get in close. You have all these other stats but really it boils down to initiative vs HP.\n\nOverall I really like this game. 7/10 would be higher without the crashes.","December 18, 2014","true","109.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just because it plays like the basics of civ5 mean it is civ5, there is in my opinion many more things that this game has then civ5 does. Each faction is totaly unique and plays completly different then the others, they each have their own lore and each unit looks and acts different from another. Each faction has 4 unique units that have different strengths and weaknesses. Also players start with a "hero" which is basically a general from civ5 but that does way more then adding a buff to a unit. There are tons of heros from each faction and each one looks different(heros from same faction has small differences but have different uses) and plays differnetly, one may be used for leading a army by giving it +2 damage while one could be used to govern and town and give it +6 industry. Also every unit can be customized with different equipment to make them stronger as the game goes by, this is simmilar to civ but instead of the unit become a differnet teir(as a musketer becomes and rifleman) the units in this game stay the same except their equipment changes and you can see the difference in appearance do to this change. Also like civ5 there is small factions that are ran by ai, you can add these to your empire by either attacking and defeating them, bribing them, or by completeing quests given by them. Once they join you then you can assimilate them into your empire and then produce their unit that can only be used by assimilating them. The unit is based off that small faction and its appearance is completely differnet to any of the playable factions, there are lots of these small factions that can be conquered by the player.

I'm always skeptical at fantasy clone of civ, because since Master of Magic back in the 90's no developer has ever managed to create a balanced 4x fantasy game. Even the recent Warlock series become way too easy in end game when powerful spells just break the game.\n\nEndless Legend however, althought being set in a fantasy world, avoids the "magic trap" (you can't research or cast spells) by offering a profound and refreshing approach to the 4x genre. The game revolves more around resource management, city improvement and map exploration, rather than combat. Think of it of as a Game of Thrones Manager 2014, where you keep control over regions by either dominating the minor factions that inhabit them by force or diplomacy. Aslo the graphical environment reminds me a lot of the GoT opening credits style.\n\nRight now the game is far from being finished now, and the two main reasons I haven't poured more hours into this game are the simplistic AI (no diplomacy, they keep just eventually declaring war to you and senselessy send some units attack you) and the lack of multiplayer.\n\nI don't want to spoil moreof the surprises that await you in Endless Legends, but let me tell you this: If you're a true Civilization lover, you can't do anything wrong with this game.\n\nOne last tip: there's no tutorial and the interface can be quite intimidating.

It's far from finished actually, though it already looks polished. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's still in Alpha as of writing this.\n\nHowever, the game has already seen a lot of growth and looks good enough to play anyways. There are parts of the game that still need balancing, such as military numbers, happiness, and well... a good number of things basically. However, it is very clear that the team behind this game is in it for the long haul, and it is evident they care a lot about their customers, including updates about ongoing progress to future updates to the game.\n\nI don't expect updates every four weeks. I expect updates that have meat behind them and that builds onto the game, especially for an Early Access Game. Even though I haven't played it for hours on end, I can feel it. Even before this game goes into final release, I will be fully addicted to it by Beta.\n\nFor those who are looking for fast paced gameplay or a simplified tactical play, this is not your game.

All infos you need to know are either blent into the HUD or can be toggled. (However, the UI doesn't accept shortcuts, you must navigate it with the mouse)\n\nOverall, Endless Legend plays like a fantasy Civilization with a combat system similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, though, kept as simple as possible (starting combat will form a battlefield directly on the world map and will begin with a tactical phase in where you can place your units strategically on the terrain while showing you the starting area of your enemies. The area both armies can place their units is affected by hero abilities). Combat can be fought manually, automatically or in a semi-automatic fashion. Nice touch: you can choose this in every turn of the combat, giving you the option to change commands for each unit in every turn if you feel that it's necessary.\nVery short turns, most of the time shorter than to the comparable Civilization 5.\n\nHeroes can be used as generals for your army or as mayors and can be specialized and equipped accordingly to enhance their abilities for their chosen position.\n\nThe most interesting resource in Endless Legend is influence, unlike other strategy games, diplomacy in Endless Legend needs influence for all actions. Declaring war or forming alliances costs influence.\nEven if an AI is traitorous and tends to backstabbing, it can only do so if it isn't wasting its influence, making diplomatic predictions possible.\nYour overall relation to other factions is cathegorized and can be seen in a 3D (rather 2,5D) UI, hovering over one of those cathegories, displayed as concentric areas will tell you the conditions and costs for actions you can take, and which there are. Entering one of those cathegories through diplomacy or actions will add penalties for violating them.\nYou swore localty to your allies? Well, you better stick to your words or you will lose influence! Awesome feature and the best solution for an immersive diplomacy I have seen so far.\n\n**One of the best features of this game is the creation of your own units. By conquering neutral factions on the map, you gain their unit-designs, from which you can create your OWN units, e.g. you talk some valkyr-styled, female knights into joining your empire, then take their standard unit and create a unit-template with their model and abilities as basics and now equip them with weapons, armor and accessoires according to your wishes, the accumulated cost for this will further be the cost for reproducing this unit - You can even name this new unit!**\n\nGraphically, this game can easily compete with its competitors. However, on max details, Endless Legend only reaches the average settings of AAA titles. To be more precise, there are no fancy shaders, no max-zoom - high-detail clouds for eye-candy and the basic textures for hex fields are low-res, however, this does not apply to resources on those hex tiles. The visual art style for buildings, ruins and everything else is absolutely fitting and marvellous.\n(You can, however, zoom out very far to see whole world where the map changes into an actual "map" with borders and region names, this has a very nice and immersive feeling to it!)\n\nFog of war covered areas are flat and rise from the ground level, like structures in the Game of Thrones intro, when explored.\n\nVoiced intros for all factions, compact lore-information for everything you discover, directly in the interaction menu.\n\n### For German players: Deutsche Lokalisation ist sehr gut. Keine uns so verhasste 1-zu-1 Übersetzung sondern mit "Flare". Gute Grammatik, Rechtschreibfehler fast keine vorhanden. Kein Text der über die Ränder hinaus geht. Sprachausgabe ist durchgehend Englisch, dafür aber von guter Qualität, Untertitel auf Deutsch und tadellos.\n\nTL;DR\nSummary:\n\n+++ Every 20 turns, you can assign your influence resource to a masterplan, which can be shaped the way you want it, to grant your empire bonuses for 20 turns, this is an extremely nice feature.\n+++ Research and building of strucutes and units can be queued and when finished are shown in a pop-up at the start if each round. For each finished unit/bulding/research, this pop-up will also list the next one in line, very clever feature!

Sparkly.\n- Factions play quite differently from each other.\n- Frequently updated, with an expansion coming soon.\n- Customizable factions, and lots of world generation options.\n- Minor factions (think city states) can give you passive bonuses and unique units.\n- Lots of win conditions.\n- Reinforces my opinion that winter is the worst season.\n\nMIXED:\n- The combat is weird. You assemble military units into armies, which can be moved around as a group, so you don't have to give orders to each of your fifteen thousand units. Then you smash your armies into other armies. You have very little control over actual fighting, which can be annoying, but if one army is much stronger than the other, you can just auto-resolve the fight to save time.\n\nBAD:\n- UI is too busy, and the text is too small.\n- No mini-map or strategic mode.\n- Diplomacy needs major changes, as any agreements you make can be broken immediately. (Market ban rage!!)\n- Almost nobody is playing multiplayer.\n- There's no way to tell a city to produce nothing (or just gold/science like Civ). It will nag you every turn.\n- The AI is mega stupid and unfriendly, even on the easiest difficulty.\n- The world is split into pre-defined regions, and you can only have one city per region.\n- Quests are too strict. I've had to raze several of my own cities in order to re-do stuff the quest demanded.\n- Certain sounds don't behave according to volume settings.\n- I have a good computer, and yet a duel between me and an AI lags worse than a six person Civ multiplayer game.\n- No steam workshop at the moment.\n- Very few characters for city/army names.\n\nThis sounds like a lot of complaining, but I actually like the game. It just hurts my eyeballs after a while. It's not better than Civ 5, however. If you've never played this sort of game before, seriously get Civ 5 instead. If you've already played Civ and want something new, this is a decent pick up.","March 25, 2015","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The artistry is top-notch. The UI is fluid, and importantly doesn't waste your time with animations that freeze your ability to navigate. Everything is responsive and satisfying.\n\nThe minor factions are a great addition - something Civ struggled with all the way through 5 (with the city-states). Endless manages to make the minor factions feel "just right", and conquering/parlaying/bribing them is a huge part of the game. Plus it's just plain fun to sometimes gain their trust through quests, and sometimes through conquest. Every option feels equally viable, you can't use just one strategy to get what you want.\n\nThe major factions are varied and (again) satisfying. Each one plays entirely differently, but not so differently that you feel like you're stuck re-learning the wheel. Some games with multiple factions make it seem as if one or two factions got all the developer's attention, but these factions are well-rounded.\n\nI could go on, but overall the game is remarkably well thought-out, well-executed, and engaging.

Even in the Early Access stage, the polish and promise of this game was unusual. Graphics? Gorgeous. Sound? Beautiful. Gameplay? So much fun. Difficult, but fun. (Maybe it's just the way I play, but I found the Newbie difficulty level to be similar to Civ 5's normal difficulty. It's very easy to fall behind, so get started early and don't waste turns if you can help it!)\n\nIt's also got some features that make it stand out from other 4X fare. The light RPG elements (similar to Endless Space, but more in depth), which include quests, are plentiful enough to keep you from getting bored, but not so deep that they bog down the game too much. Tech researching is also a little more involved and interesting than your standard 4X. Unlike in most 4X games, researching is a little more free-form. Instead of tech trees, there are more like tech levels. To get to the next level (which the game calls Eras), you have to research a certain number of technologies, which can be from any of the main categories (science/production, culture/influence, military, and agriculture/economics). So, if you like, you can choose not to research any low-level (Era I) agriculture/economic technologies and still be able to research Era II agriculture/economic technologies once you've unlocked that level. The anomalies and wide variety of hex benefits (e.g. 1 food, 2 dust, 3 production output if one of your cities extends to that hex) also spice up the game, adding extra elements to consider when making strategic decisions.\n\nThe only quibble I have is with the manual battles. While they're enjoyable enough, I've found the system a bit clunky and my units occasionally ignore my orders completely for no apparent reason (not even a terrain reason). Not sure if that's a pathfinding issue or what, but it can make manual battles a little frustrating at times. I've found that you're less likely to lose units in manual battles than the automatic ones (or at least that's what I've seen in my limited experience), so I wish they would take a look at that or somehow make it more clear why units are sometimes like "Oh, was that an order? You wanted me to do something/go somewhere that might preserve my health or life? How cute. I'm going to go get myself murdered now. kthxbye!" That said, that's not a huge part of the game and you can absolutely let the computer take care of it if you prefer.\n\nAnyway, this is a great game overall and shows that Amplitude Studios is becoming one of those rare Developers You Can Trust To Make Amazing Games That Are Worth Your Money And Will Probably Not F--- You Over With Early Access. (The DYCTTMAGTAWYMAWPNFYOWEA club is an admirable and exclusive one, but I think we can all agree that they need a little help with that acronym.)\n\n9.5/10\n","September 20, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do wish there was a more in-depth guide available (the manual is okay but really basic) because it did take a while to figure out how to parley and assimilate minor factions, as well as a few other gameplay elements. The combat is fairly simple, but I wish you were able to exercise more control over your units rather than the game moving them around and attacking your target. In a sense, you only semi-control your army and one wrong move (or rather, them charging at the enemy when you're trying to move away...) can cost the battle.

All infos you need to know are either blent into the HUD or can be toggled. (However, the UI doesn't accept shortcuts, you must navigate it with the mouse)\n\nOverall, Endless Legend plays like a fantasy Civilization with a combat system similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, though, kept as simple as possible (starting combat will form a battlefield directly on the world map and will begin with a tactical phase in where you can place your units strategically on the terrain while showing you the starting area of your enemies. The area both armies can place their units is affected by hero abilities). Combat can be fought manually, automatically or in a semi-automatic fashion. Nice touch: you can choose this in every turn of the combat, giving you the option to change commands for each unit in every turn if you feel that it's necessary.\nVery short turns, most of the time shorter than to the comparable Civilization 5.\n\nHeroes can be used as generals for your army or as mayors and can be specialized and equipped accordingly to enhance their abilities for their chosen position.\n\nThe most interesting resource in Endless Legend is influence, unlike other strategy games, diplomacy in Endless Legend needs influence for all actions. Declaring war or forming alliances costs influence.\nEven if an AI is traitorous and tends to backstabbing, it can only do so if it isn't wasting its influence, making diplomatic predictions possible.\nYour overall relation to other factions is cathegorized and can be seen in a 3D (rather 2,5D) UI, hovering over one of those cathegories, displayed as concentric areas will tell you the conditions and costs for actions you can take, and which there are. Entering one of those cathegories through diplomacy or actions will add penalties for violating them.\nYou swore localty to your allies? Well, you better stick to your words or you will lose influence! Awesome feature and the best solution for an immersive diplomacy I have seen so far.\n\n**One of the best features of this game is the creation of your own units. By conquering neutral factions on the map, you gain their unit-designs, from which you can create your OWN units, e.g. you talk some valkyr-styled, female knights into joining your empire, then take their standard unit and create a unit-template with their model and abilities as basics and now equip them with weapons, armor and accessoires according to your wishes, the accumulated cost for this will further be the cost for reproducing this unit - You can even name this new unit!**\n\nGraphically, this game can easily compete with its competitors. However, on max details, Endless Legend only reaches the average settings of AAA titles. To be more precise, there are no fancy shaders, no max-zoom - high-detail clouds for eye-candy and the basic textures for hex fields are low-res, however, this does not apply to resources on those hex tiles. The visual art style for buildings, ruins and everything else is absolutely fitting and marvellous.\n(You can, however, zoom out very far to see whole world where the map changes into an actual "map" with borders and region names, this has a very nice and immersive feeling to it!)\n\nFog of war covered areas are flat and rise from the ground level, like structures in the Game of Thrones intro, when explored.\n\nVoiced intros for all factions, compact lore-information for everything you discover, directly in the interaction menu.\n\n### For German players: Deutsche Lokalisation ist sehr gut. Keine uns so verhasste 1-zu-1 Übersetzung sondern mit "Flare". Gute Grammatik, Rechtschreibfehler fast keine vorhanden. Kein Text der über die Ränder hinaus geht. Sprachausgabe ist durchgehend Englisch, dafür aber von guter Qualität, Untertitel auf Deutsch und tadellos.\n\nTL;DR\nSummary:\n\n+++ Every 20 turns, you can assign your influence resource to a masterplan, which can be shaped the way you want it, to grant your empire bonuses for 20 turns, this is an extremely nice feature.\n+++ Research and building of strucutes and units can be queued and when finished are shown in a pop-up at the start if each round. For each finished unit/bulding/research, this pop-up will also list the next one in line, very clever feature! (no need to check your queues every time)\n++ Good tutorial\n++ Excellent UI and HUD\n++ Nice unitdesign\n++ Perfect hybrid of CIV and HoMM\n++ Seasons that can have a heavy impact on your strategy\n(marching into enemy territory just as winter arrives, can be catastrophic for your invasion)\n+ Good music\n+ Nice artstyle\n+ Short turns\n+ Seemingless blend into battles\n+ short loading times, excellent engine\n+ UI can be toggled between standard and big, making it easy on the eyes for big screens.\n(scaling instead of toggling would be nice, though)\n+ automatic naming of saves (like this: faction - turn >>> Imperium - Turn 1)\n\n--- no shortcuts, this is a mouse-heavy game\n-- Music, though nice, feels a little out of place | pauses and sudden start of music are slightly irritating\nNOTE: The pause can be adjusted.

It combines elements of a number of my favorite genres into one of the best-looking packages I've ever seen.  I especially recommend it to all my friends who love the Civilization series.\n\nThe entire game is gorgeous.  It may not be the most technically advanced game when it comes to graphics (though it makes great use of depth-of-field, and zooming in/out and discovering new areas are impressively smooth), but the visual design is top-notch, and not just with the art for character and environmental designs.  Hands-down, the UI design is the best I've ever seen in anything, period.  The menus look gorgeous and are easy to understand.  Complicated concepts like resources are abstracted and displayed in a way that really pops.  Even when I didn't understand the game, it was fairly easy to learn by doing, thanks to the great interface design.  Whoever did the visual design for Endless Legends should get a medal.  A really pretty medal.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's a 4x at its core, with a lot of similarities to Civilization 5.  However, it boils down a lot of the more obtuse and complicated aspects of the genre into something a little more manageable.  A smaller number of meaningful and balanced choices and tradeoffs is the name of the game here, and it makes for riveting gameplay.  The "one more turn" aspect of the genre is in full force here.  Every session so far ends when I finally look at the clock and realize it's 4 in the morning when I thought it was 1 at the latest.\n\nIt also adds a nice twist by having an actual battle system.  When two armies meet, their battle isn't decided just by stats.  Instead, you play a tactical turn-based game in the vein of X-Com and Final Fantasy Tactics, where unit positioning and targeting are just as important as the gear and levels you bring to the fight.\n\nEndless Legend also borrows some of the best elements of RPGs.  There are unique hero units you can customize with gear and skill trees as they level, and you can customize every single unit with gear as well.  This allows you to simply upgrade your base units as your technology progresses, or create totally different variations for different purposes.\n\nThe game also has a storyline for each of the 8 (or so?) factions you can play as, and it allows you to create custom factions.  Completing the story's questline leads to a victory condition while fleshing out the world and offering a few twists on the way.\n\nMan, this game is really good.  And really, really pretty.

Though this can also be fun--"Oh, *that's* how that works...."\n* The notification system--that a city is not producing anything, or that you aren't researching any tech, is easy to miss, leading to turns of no production and no research unless you remember to check it every turn.\n* The AI is pretty weak, and probably always will be, due to the complexity of the options available.\n* The UI can be frustrating and confusing.\n\nIf you're willing to learn by trial and error as you go, and have a high tolerance for bugs, there are some really good new concepts here.  If not, you might wait a couple of months until some good beginner's guides are written and the game is more stable.\n\nIf you do play it now--notifications appear as icons on the right side of the screen.  Make sure you click on every one every turn--they disappear as soon as you hit End Turn.  And the circle around End Turn has an arrow circle icon next to it--click on that every turn to move your armies, or they'll just sit where they are doing nothing.

Yes this game does an excellent job of keeping you in it. The game has a brief tutorial which does a great job of familiarising you with the basics. At first the game does appear a bit daunting with so many options and things to remember. After a couple of hours I became comfortable and then everything just seem to get better as my Empire slowly came to life. Breaking my 4x tradition I decided to start with a faction thats focus is on economy. I have to say  its really been good. It makes a change to buy your way to success instead of relying on churning out a constant army. With this faction I buy my army and its ready in an instant. The game consists of several varied and interesting major factions and then you have numerous minor factions.  Whichever major faction you choose they will have their own unique background story and quests.\n\nUnits vary but are basically broken down into heroes, support, infantry, cavalry, ranged and flying. You can even make your own units. To conquer regions you need cities and growing your city is a long process. In fact as your research grows you will enter several different ages unlocking even more ablities for the city. As well as battles this game is very much about resource management. I love the way every single hex in the game produces some kind of resource in different quantities. This makes it especially important when deciding where to place your city.\n\nThis game is pretty much all about time and planning. I really like it that at the beginning of the game you will be in whats known as a 'cold war' with all the other factions. At this stage there can be no peace treaties and you are quite exposed if you end up next door to an aggressive neighbour. Diplomacy in endless legends takes a long time to bear fruit. One thing I do like about the AI on easier settings is that it doesn't tend to attack you the moment it stumbles across you. I've played too many 4X's in the past where you literally get jumped on by the AI before you have started. The great thing about endless is that you start off with a limited number of diplomatic options. The others only come later if you research them. All the other AI factions in the game behave in a specific way. Some are expansionists while others are pacifists. This becomes apparent over time when you see how the factions behave towards each other and the size of their territory.\n\nOn to the map. Its one of the best and most intuitive I've seen in a 4x. Randomly generated hex landscapes with varied environments from cold wastes to desert. Each will effect how units interact with it. Scattered across the landscape are numerous weird anomalies, exploitable resources, explorable ruins and minor factions. At any point you can smoothly zoom right in and out of the map to get an overview of the empires. The map is big and takes a long time to fully explore. Minor factions play a role in that you need to pacify them early or they will become a threat with their wandering armies. You can even assimilate a limited number of pacified factions which will give you access to one of their units.\n\nBattles are fought on a zoomed in version of the region it takes place on. Then its a simple turned based hex battle which goes through a number of phases before the outcome is decided. The environment your units are in at the time will have an effect. Some may think the battles are too simplified with limited options and no spell books like with HoMM games. To be honest I think it works just fine for endless. After a battle if you win your units will earn experience points and gradually level up. This makes keeping veteran armies alive essential for the later game.\n\nThe music score is superb and blends into the game perfectly.\n\nThere is a lot more to this game than what I have touched on in this review. Be sure that once its got your attention you will be sinking endless hours into it.\n\n10/10","September 28, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The screenshots and overall favorable reviews is what sold it to me.  I'm a huge fan of the 4x strategy games and with that being said, I was NOT disappionted in the slightest way with Endless Legend.\n\nSome of the pros with this game include the graphics.  Great graphics, especially when compared to games like Civ and Fallen Enchantress.  The units and factions are also completely fresh.   There are your typical archers and melee units which are both essential to any 4x game but take my word for it, a lot of units are at least slightly different and most are really cool (Especially on your first few play throughs when you first encounter them).  Another pro for me is the added involvement regarding the city building aspect of the game.  Each time your city gains population you gain a "Worker" that you can place in specific parts of the building/production within your cities.  If you need buildings or units produced more quickly put more of your "Workers" in the production.  Technologies not getting researched fast enough place them into the science slot etc.\n\nWith this being said, the game isn't without it's downfalls (In my opinion).  I prefer to have more control over my units during combat.  I would rather control each unit for each move.  This isn't the case in Endless Legend.  When your units are involved in a a battle you basically follow the certain steps.  First off, the battle map is basically a zoomed in portion of the current location of the map that unit is currently on (This for me is actually a plus and definitely a welcomed change).  However, the battle sequence leaves a bit to be desired.  To start you basically have to place your units.  Then you select what you want them to do whether it be to attack a specific unit or if you have a healing unit etc. you decide who you want them heal etc.  The battle then ensues until the next turn where you have the option to change your strategies and the battle sequence proceeds as previously mentioned.  Some may prefer this method as it is simplified but I prefer battle sequences like Age of Wonders 3.\n\nThe modifications also leave a little to be desired for me as well.  Personally I love that fact in Fallen Enchantress where you can outfit your heroes with anything and it shows on the character, not only on the character screen but when you see them in the world too.  With Endless Legends this portion is true in regards to the weapon and Shield only.  Any new armor etc can be equipped but you will not see them.\n\nOverall I do recommend the game and it has kept me busy for about 16hrs since purchase and I'll be busy for many more hours because of the differences it offers to the genre.  It is fun and when I want a slight change in units/factions/city buidling I'll be starting this one up!","September 28, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played through several full games as the different factions and found that each of them is very unique. I'd say that this is the biggest thing that the game has over Civilization V. If you're at all interested I recommend you read up on each of these because it would take too long to explain here. The other two big differences are a quest and combat systems. Unlike Civ5's city state quests, they don't involve racing other factions or killing another city state(there are none). They're a bit more interesting and present some semblance of a story for each of the factions. Of course, there's not much depth to be expected of quests in a 4X game, but they do make the game a bit more interesting. The combat system, on the other hand, isn't very good and is kind of tedious, especially because of the slow animations. So I wouldn't recommend picking this game up just becasuse you like turn-based combat. But still, it's there and does add SOME depth to combat which would otherwise just be RNG-based.\n\nI recommend this game, but I'm also not sure if it feels done yet. I've been playing on the 'Hard' difficulty and I've found that diplomacy and other AI behaviors are a bit irrational. I hope this is something that will be addressed in a future patch.

Autosaves happen every turn to rescue you from this. If you get errors without a crash then it is best to exit the game as re-opening the game can fix the errors. Hopefully these issues will be fixed in a future patch but be warned if you see an error the game may crash in a future turn but your save is probably fine if you restart.\n\nSome of the features I like from this game:\n\nSeasons mean winter suddenly drops your food and other production, poorly designed empires can find them selves starved. Troops move slowly in winter and it gives a sensible pause in war efforts. Once you have troops with winter resistence via high level skills you can gain advantages in the winter.\n\nDiplomacy has a default state of cold war, one step from peace or war. Peace and Alliances must be researched before being offered and military players can not only ignore diplomacy but also ignore chunks of the research options.\n\nTroops can be edited to give them the latest equipment, then troops built on those original builds can be retrofitted to the current build.\n\nHeroes stationed in cities earn experience as quickly or faster than combat Heroes. The earn experience for everything built at the city so defensive and peaceful empires can still build powerful heroes. Heroes also have a whole chain of skills focused on city boosting.\n\nEach faction has a recommended victory type to aim for.\nCultists for example can only build one city and expand through village conversion instead. Each village gives them resouces, an extra city worker and troops are generated for free in the village. The city can grow a level higher than any other faction and numbers of workers in the end game can be very high due to all the villages converted.\nTo play each faction to the full you need to embrace there game mechanic and just playing each faction gives a lot of replay.\n\nDifficulty is simpler than other games in the ilk as long as you follow the correct playstyle for your faction and utilise your heroes fully. Anything below normal should be treated as training and normal may be to easy if you play a lot of strategy games.\n\nMy first playthroughs with the Wind Walkers took 15+ hours and my second play with Cultists taking less than 8 hours.\nIf you ignore the story line quests and focus on a quick win on maps other than huge you could do this in a much shorter time.\nPlaying the remaining factions I expect to spend another 30-60 hours trying out the other 6 main factions.","September 28, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What killed this game for me is the combat... it just plays so clunkily. You tell a unit to hold position and then they run two spaces away into range of the enemy, but not into their own range? I don't really understand anything except that I can't control my units how I want to and it's cost me more than a few victories in my limited play time. That and there's no way to disengage from a battle, so if you happen to click on an enemy party that displays 2 units and they have 12 units of reinforcements, you can't back down. Good luck surviving six turns of reinforcements.\nThe units and mini-factions are even more diverse and unique than the major factions; I would argue that the strongest selling point of this game is the ability to experiment with so many different unit (through various faction assimilations) combinations. However, the individual major factions, to make up for all this diversity, really only give you three units each, which is a bit disappointing. The heroes for each major faction (thankfully you can recruit outside your faction) are essentially all the same, too... also disappointing.\nIt's worth dinking around with if you're a big RTS fan, but nothing every gamer must own. Game plays a little too slowly for me, even for an RTS. It's probably gorgeous, if graphics attract you, but the combat is awful and hard to control. Oh, and the clicking in this game drives you bonkers after awhile. Have to click on things four to five times occasionally to select it.\nEDIT: There is a retreat button, but it only seems to appear if you have a distinct unit advantage... at least, that's the only time I've seen it. Also, the soundtrack is pretty, but gets repetitive quickly.","December 16, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Endless Legend is a whole other beast from Civ. So while they are botrh 4X, do not buy thinking it'll just be a fantasy Civ game.\n\nThat being said, it is an extremely satisfying game, with a complexity that i feel is much deeper than most recent Civ games. From the variety in the factions playstyle, to the absolutely beautiful graphics, the game hits on most points in a unique style not seen in any 4X games.\n\nIt does have it's flaws such as the heroes who seem similar across the board, to the lackluster AI. The AI is forgiveable due to most 4X games lacking a challenging AI. The Heroes will be addressed at some point as well i'm sure as the devs, seem to always be tinkering with little bits here and there.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable experience, and IMO the 4X release of the year. If 4X is your type of game, Endless Legend is worth your time to get to know. Learning curve is steep but worth it.","January 11, 2015","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it turns out, CivV grows slow the longer you play, and online connection with friends fails over and over again. That's why I started looking for an alternative.\n\nWith Endless Legend I've had none of those problems so far. Excellent for multiplayer, never lost any connection, very neat UI, and no slowdown symtoms thus far (and I've put 18+ hours into it already). So far so good.\n\nGameplay itself : the game does play much like CivV (that was a good thing for me, as I was simply looking for something better). It's refreshing to have diverse factions though, some play very differently from others. Supports different kinds of endings, so not just military ones, and I find the trading & diplomacy a lot more natural. Plays a bit faster too, for example, you can send units through tiles twice as fast. The tutorial sadly enough does not cover everything there is to know (so check out city planning online!) but everything is there. Combat is improved compared to CivV : there's either auto-battle (instant fights) or small Age-of-Wonders like sessions. The wonderful thing about it is that these fights occur on the world map itself : if you can reach through the fog of war you can actually see your neighboor doing these little battles, but all battles are executed asynchronously so there's no rapid switching from one to another (which occurs in civV if you enable animated fights during multiplayer). Combat animations are good enough, nothing too fancy, nothing too short.\n\nSoundtrack is ok, you get the mp3 files with the game, which is very nice. The graphics are very nice (although I did read somewhere they are out-dated, they are not, in 'fantastic' settings they are very beautiful). Which brings me to the conclusion this game is great, I find it better than CivV or CivBE (which did not improve CivV that much alas) so definately recommended!\n","January 23, 2015","true","87.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best features of this game are faction diverseness, the beautiful graphics, and the flavor (lots of text descriptions of various resources, unusual anomalies on tiles, etc) as well as the gameplay effects of seasons.  No two factions play the same and each faction has such radically different traits that gameplay is quite different.  For example, one faction lives entirely around Dust (money) and can only heal units, build buildings with money.  This faction does not need food.  Another faction only has one city and their goal is bring about the apocalypse.  They can rapidly build a military by converting lesser factions to their religion.  Graphics are great, reminiscent of the intro scene from HBO's Game of Thrones.  Unlike Civ 5, there are elevations in tiles which gives the game a boardgame-like look.  All in all, very pretty.  Lots of flavor in the game, every faction also has quest storylines that are all different in gently prodding you to expand your empire. These range from building a new city to aiding a lesser faction who will then pay tribute to your empire, etc.  There are also lots of other little interesting quests given to your Hero units that can undertake these quests to help your empire.\n\nGameplay mechanics are similar to other 4x games like Civ 5 or Warlock: Master of the Arcane.  You can do research, construct buildings, train soldiers, recruit heroes (who can fight in the field or govern your cities), etc.  The most unique mechanics are winter, which greatly reduces all tile yields and unit movement and generally make your life hell.  Think of it as ASOIAF's winter/summer cycles.  Summer is bounty and bliss, winter is hell and can last quite a while.  Another unique feature is that the map (which you can set as in Civ 5: continents, etc.) is divided into regions.  Once a city is placed, that region is locked into that faction until the city is destroyed.  So you're fighting over regions, though some factions have exceptions.  Within regions are little lesser factions, they can be destroyed (but you have to rebuild their stuff), given cash, or have a quest done for them to be pacified.  Once pacified, they can be assimilated into your empire and you can train their units.  These leser factions are important because they are uniqe and provide unit plans so you can build their units.  Your base units suck and you only have three: infantry, support, calvary.  The lesser factions can provide you with flying beasts, centaur creatures, etc.  So these lesser factions are important for your army.  Another interesting mechanic is that you can kit your units out with random stuff you find or build like a Sword of Badassness or a necklace of bravery, etc.  This adds a RPG style for your heroes, who can level up and be more effective.\n\nFor the bad stuff, the AI is not clever.  Not at all.  You're going to have to pump up the difficulty to mitigate the stupidity of the AI.  Combat is pretty atrocious and mediocre.  I guess it's realistic because a leader won't be able to give spot to spot commands to generals but I recommend autoresolve because you can't control anything besides the most general 'shoot the guy over here.'  You pretty much just end up watching little figurines walk up to each other and fight without much input from you.  For the laidback, I guess this is fine, but for the OCD micromanagers like me, it's not that fun, especially since the Battle AI can screw you over by moving your units poorly (a la Hearts of Iron 3 AI Takeover).\n\nAll in all, if you're buying this game, you most certainly are not buying it for combat.  To say again,  the best part of this game is the uniqueness of the factions and for that alone, having to use different playstyles (you can also make custom factions) to succeed makes it worth it if you have money to spend.  My opinion, wait a bit to buy it on sale but there's no harm in buying it full priced.","September 22, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it's hard to actually dislike a game like this, to me at least, or in general, an expierienced strategy game player. If we speak about the game, the simplest thing is, it's a combination of the tile system of Civilization Five, and the story, unit systems, and advancements of Endless Space.\n\nIf we get complicated...\nEndless Legend is to Endless Space, as Warhammer is to Warhammer 40 Thousand. Except Endless is actually relative to all the games. They all connect in some way, and they are similar. All Endless games are heavy on Strategy, and are difficult games in general, to most. If you liked Endless Space, or Dungeon of Endless, there is a fair chance that you will like, possibly love, Endless Legend.\nThe Good is -\nLovely UI, look wise\nSpecific Graphics, sharp edges except for units and some factions\nWell science trees and techs, if some are illogical\nAn EXP system for next to every unit, I think, anyway.\n\nNuetral\nEverything is explained by the magical essense called Dust.\nSmart AI\nEnough variety that a single strategy may not work every time.\n\nBad\nQuests, sometimes they require you to achieve or do something, that is not actually possible for a very long time.

It combines elements of a number of my favorite genres into one of the best-looking packages I've ever seen.  I especially recommend it to all my friends who love the Civilization series.\n\nThe entire game is gorgeous.  It may not be the most technically advanced game when it comes to graphics (though it makes great use of depth-of-field, and zooming in/out and discovering new areas are impressively smooth), but the visual design is top-notch, and not just with the art for character and environmental designs.  Hands-down, the UI design is the best I've ever seen in anything, period.  The menus look gorgeous and are easy to understand.  Complicated concepts like resources are abstracted and displayed in a way that really pops.  Even when I didn't understand the game, it was fairly easy to learn by doing, thanks to the great interface design.  Whoever did the visual design for Endless Legends should get a medal.  A really pretty medal.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's a 4x at its core, with a lot of similarities to Civilization 5.  However, it boils down a lot of the more obtuse and complicated aspects of the genre into something a little more manageable.  A smaller number of meaningful and balanced choices and tradeoffs is the name of the game here, and it makes for riveting gameplay.  The "one more turn" aspect of the genre is in full force here.  Every session so far ends when I finally look at the clock and realize it's 4 in the morning when I thought it was 1 at the latest.\n\nIt also adds a nice twist by having an actual battle system.  When two armies meet, their battle isn't decided just by stats.  Instead, you play a tactical turn-based game in the vein of X-Com and Final Fantasy Tactics, where unit positioning and targeting are just as important as the gear and levels you bring to the fight.\n\nEndless Legend also borrows some of the best elements of RPGs.  There are unique hero units you can customize with gear and skill trees as they level, and you can customize every single unit with gear as well.  This allows you to simply upgrade your base units as your technology progresses, or create totally different variations for different purposes.\n\nThe game also has a storyline for each of the 8 (or so?) factions you can play as, and it allows you to create custom factions.  Completing the story's questline leads to a victory condition while fleshing out the world and offering a few twists on the way.\n\nMan, this game is really good.  And really, really pretty.

Though this can also be fun--"Oh, *that's* how that works...."\n* The notification system--that a city is not producing anything, or that you aren't researching any tech, is easy to miss, leading to turns of no production and no research unless you remember to check it every turn.\n* The AI is pretty weak, and probably always will be, due to the complexity of the options available.\n* The UI can be frustrating and confusing.\n\nIf you're willing to learn by trial and error as you go, and have a high tolerance for bugs, there are some really good new concepts here.  If not, you might wait a couple of months until some good beginner's guides are written and the game is more stable.\n\nIf you do play it now--notifications appear as icons on the right side of the screen.  Make sure you click on every one every turn--they disappear as soon as you hit End Turn.  And the circle around End Turn has an arrow circle icon next to it--click on that every turn to move your armies, or they'll just sit where they are doing nothing.

Each faction that I have played has been very different from the ones that came before it, both in aesthetics and gameplay. The world is gorgeous, the art is gorgeous, the diplomacy screens are gorgeous. The game has this unique techno-fantasy feeling going on.\n\nFocus of the game seems to be more on the building than on the heroes, so on the 4x spectrum I would place it closer to civilization than to something like HOMM. The game is a fantasy setting, but there is barely any magic so it also doesn't exactly have the feel of Master of Magic or other fantasy 4x games. Large cities sprawl across the land in a satisfying way, reminding me of what Elemental tried to do but failed at.\n\nCombat is different than other 4x games I've played. It is kind of a tactical/real time hybrid. Each fight is six rounds of issuing orders to your units and then watching the orders resolve. Sometimes the way things play out make slower units unable to carry out their planned orders, so a wrench can be thrown into your movement/attack orders.\n\nI've been playing on standard settings and each game takes about six hours or so.

A lot of 4x games (not including space 4x) tend to be heavily modeled after the Civilization series, not Endless Legend though. This game is very much its own game.\n\nPros:\nEach Faction plays very differently from each other. Necrophages can't have peace or alliances, Broken Lords don't need food. Drakken can force peace upon another player, Roving Clans can't declare war etc. Each faction truly is a vastly different playstyle.\n\nThe game is beautiful. A minor thing that just makes it more enjoyable.\n\nThe battle system is interesting. More in depth than Civ's smack two units against each other, but not as in depth as Age of Wonders 3 where you control each unit on the battle field.\n\nThe world is very diverse and there are quests, ruins, minor factions etc. that make exploring both profitable and enjoyable.\n\nUnit Customization. You can alter your units with different armor, weapons and trinkets to suit your needs. You take a basic unit from your faction (or assimilated minor factions) and equip them with different equipment to make them stronger or more specialized. For instance you could have a lance weilding Stalwart that does a lot of damage, or one that can take as much damage as you throw at it.\n\nHeroes: Strong units that lead armies or govern cities. Very useful and very cool.\n\nMixed:\nThe region system is somewhat strange. When you settle a region with a city, you own that whole region. However, only the tiles directly around your city are worked. You also can only found a single city per region. This means that many areas that would make excellent cities are wasted. On the other hand all the strategic and luxury resources in the region can be harvested by the single city. You also don't get AI settling right next to your city to steal a resource like in Civ.\n\nCons:\nLimited number of Units. Each faction only has 4 base units. You can assimilate different minor factions for their units but there is a limited number of slots to do this. Compared to other games there aren't many units around. However each faction has three unique units (the settler is common to almost all the factions).\n\nAI can travel into your territory automatically and can attack your units outside of your territory without declaring war. You have to declare peace for them not to be able to attack your units and declare closed borders to keep them out of your territory. Both of which cost influence.\n\nDeclaring war costs influence. Severely annoying and pointless. The other diplomatic stuff makes sense. This does not. You don't need to influece someone to declare war, you just attack them.","September 27, 2014","true","46.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I had previously played the 4x Space Civ Simulator, Endless Space, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Both are made by Amplitude Studios and are part of their multiple-game and multiple genre universe spanning series that have been released in rapid succession over the last few years. Endless Space, Endless Legend, and Endless Dungeon, are the three games currently released from Amplitude. All giving their own slightly varied experience.\n\nEndless Legend is the most recent iteration of the endless universe. Starting the game up I was surprised to find a very sparse menu. This is something common between all of the Amplitude games. A minimalistic styled menu that gives you little to do but jump right into their game and get started. That's exactly what I was eager to do.\n\nWhat the Endless series also excels at is punishing mistakes. The first few times I played I was decimated by nearly every other civilization in the game. Still though, each time I played I made progress. This is one of my favorite parts about civilization builders. Failing and returning to re-build my civilization stronger and more robust. After about 4 times playing through, I finally conquered the world and won. In total this took about 20 hours just to give you an idea of how long it takes to become proficient.\n\nPersonally I won by taking the military route after I began falling behind other civilizations in points, however it caused my people endless unhappiness to be ruled by a dictatorial warlord. Still though it was a win even though it wasn't by the conditions I had originally intended. Most of the civilizations have conditions they are better suited to winning with, but every option is always open.\n\nThe science "ladder" you climb while playing brings you into several era as you play. Each era increases the power available to units and the technology but also increases the production requirements of each city. This adds a depth that includes time as a measurable resource that must be managed. After playing Civilization games I have to say that this is a small change but makes a large difference in how quickly you may want to uncover new technologies.\n\nThis combined with the happiness mechanic makes even advancing in production and technology a balancing act. Destroying facilities and units that require upkeep from previous eras can actually help you in the short run to recover and quickly produce more powerful units. Other regular resources are provided in the same way most are in 4x turn based games. They are however more difficult to balance and utilize properly. Running short on resources is common and so is having to make hard decisions.\n\nThe biggest draw that I saw in the game was combat, and the turn based mechanics. As far as I could tell, 2 people would take turns at 1 time. Which means you would be moving units at the same time and so there is at least a bit of real-time attention needed as if you are paying little attention to what your units are doing they can be attacked easily. Prioritizing movement over building can save or ruin opportunities. Combat between units is played out simultaneously on your turn between armies in a tiled strategy turn-based format. I know that this type of combat has gotten a lot of flak in reviews as a negative aspect to the game, but I consider it a positive.\n\nConsider for a moment that the entire "default" game takes place over 300 turns, the combat helps break up the repetition of the turns with something different and stimulating in a different way. Everything Endless Legend does seems fresh even though it utilizes formulas from many previous games. The fusion of turn based civ building and combat works perfectly with the way the game is paced in my opinion.\n\nI for one am eagerly awaiting the further release of games in the endless series. I can't wait to see what Amplitude studios comes up with next.\n\nYou'll like this game if: You like fully fleshed out universes with full stories for each faction that include an over-arcing mission to allow for victory. Highlights include great combat, wonderfully balanced civ building and well integrated mechanics that don't allow for much exploitation.\n\nFrom my blog at: bigdadgamer.blogspot.com","February 7, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While they have several things in common, mostly building an empire through diplomacy, conquest, and expansion, Endless Legend has several features that separates it from Civ 5.\n\nFirst is how different each of the factions feel and how they are played. In Civ 5, the difference between playing different\nfactions generally boils down to small percentages. While these can drastically affect the game, you will mostly play the way everyone else does. In Endless Legend, each faction has its own distinctive traits as well as playstyles. One faction can force peace on other factions while another can teleport their units to cities. These differences become even more interesting as you start creating your own factions. In short, if you find yourself playing the Roving Clans after finishing a game with the Necrophages, you probably won't be using the same strategy.\n\nSecond is the winter season. Periodically, winter rolls around and generally makes the game harder. Exactly what it does varies from game to game, which can provide a whole new set of challenges with each individual game. It also adds a good bit of difficulty. In Civ 5, the only thing that usually keeps your armies at bay are mountains and other rough terrain. While rough terrain is also in Endless Legend, winter will drastically slow an army down and effectively make combat a fairly rare occurence during winters (at least until the mid to late game as you find ways to become immune to winter's effects). As the winters get longer, the game becomes more difficult, with the actions you take during the summer becoming much more important when the next winter rolls around.\n\nThird is unit customization. In Civ 5, your units become better as you advance through the research tree and they are generally static throughout save for the upgrades they get when they level up. In Endless Legend, your units each have their own equipment set that you can customize to your liking. If you're looking to make your ranged unit zip across the map while hitting hard, you can give them the equipment they need to do that (after you research it, anyway). Unit customization also allows your army to adapt to the situation at hand. If you find that your army is equipped to handle flyers while the enemy sent in melee and ranged units, you can retrofit your army accordingly (provided they weren't killed off before you got the chance).\n\nThese are only a handful of the differences between Civ 5 and Endless Legend. Ultimately, if you're looking for a 4X game with some fresh ideas, you'll probably find it in Endless Legend.","April 5, 2015","true","248.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clumsychip/recommended/289130/","clumsychip","ClumsyChip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clumsychip/","89 products in account","I have to say that this is the only 4x strategy game that I have really gotten into, and it is seriously worth it!\n\nHere's the shortened version:\n\npros:\n- different races to play as that actually give a lot of diverse gameplay options\n- each race has its own (interesting) quest-line and (vibrant) history\n- quests really give you a purpose and a bit of story to drive you forward and keep you engaged with your faction.\n- combat system takes the best of Civ V and Total War to create a really fun system!\n- seasons!\n- relatively simple interface (you probably need to play the tutorial to fully understand it though)\n- customise your army units\n- very sassy AI!\n- beautiful graphics\n\ncons:\n- you can't see exactly how strong an enemy is before you attack (at least, i havent found a way yet)\n- tutorial is quite heavy, but also worth it so....\n- cities are a little hard to see clearly as there is a lot of stuff going on...\n- it is a little buggy and often crashes when I play multiplayer, but not enough to deter me from the game!\n\nThe long version:\n\nWhat I like most about this game is the sense of real diversity between each 'culture/races/people'. They each have very specific and drastically different ways of playing them. For example you have a race that is a cult - they can't build extra cities so conquering by force is useless, so instead of soldiers they have preachers who spread their influence and 'take over' other players' settlements through spreading their cult. Another clan is basically vermin zombies who don't even have the option of diplomacy - all they can do is attack other players and eat them or turn their enemies into zombies which they can then control. Or a third one is a bunch of metal armours with souls inside them so they don't require any food resources! There is much more than that but they all have advantages and disadvantages that are really well balanced and truly FEEL different and diverse!\n\nOn top of that the combat system is really interesting.\n\nFirst of all, each race only gets 4 different base units. That's it. But wait for it..... you get to customise them! As you level them up you get access to tier 2, 3 etc items like armour, weapons, and jewelery which all give you different stats which means you can create different units tailored to your own style of play or needs. For example I'm playing with the woodsland people (not their official name) and i have access only to archers at first. But I have created 2 different types of archers through this system - some are better at fighting infantry units whereas my second class is stronger against flying units. And now I also spent a while upgrading all my unit designs so that I can manufacture better units. There aren't THAT many different options, but there are enough to make it diverse and you can have a lot of fun with it. I also just like the ability to upgrade your units instead of simply receiving new units and you don't really know what they do. This way, I really am getting to know my army for once.\n\nSecondly, it's not like in Civ V where your units throw javelins from one hexagon to another hexagon or something like that. In battle you have your little units and they each take up 1 square, so you can control each of them individually, at first you need to decide where to place them (they get advantages or disadvantages based on terrain) and then you decide which enemies they attack. It's the same basic concept as in total war, but with less units and turn-based. You're also able to see the stats of your opponents and so can strategise pretty nicely without it taking forever or being overly complicated.\n\nThe only down side is that you can't really tell the strength of an enemy army until you have engaged in battle with it (which has meant that 1 and a half of my armies has been accidentally wiped out because of that. But i think that is mostly because i had only archers. Because i didn't have access to anything else at that point because i was focusing on production instead of armies.)\n\nFinally, quests. I haven't play that many 4x strategy games but I haven't seen quests like these before. And I love them. I tend to play mostly RPGs because I like story and my main concern with 4x games such as Civ V was that I didn't really care about my people. But not in Endless Legend. Oh no. The quests and bits of story you get gives you motivation and a purpose and that is what is keeping me playing this game! And I don't even have time for it! It feels like there is a story happening - you're not just developing your community for nothing, you've got a purpose and i love that!\n\nBasically, it's complex, but simple enough to understand - just the way i like my games.","April 19, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have very little control over actual fighting, which can be annoying, but if one army is much stronger than the other, you can just auto-resolve the fight to save time.\n\nBAD:\n- UI is too busy, and the text is too small.\n- No mini-map or strategic mode.\n- Diplomacy needs major changes, as any agreements you make can be broken immediately. (Market ban rage!!)\n- Almost nobody is playing multiplayer.\n- There's no way to tell a city to produce nothing (or just gold/science like Civ). It will nag you every turn.\n- The AI is mega stupid and unfriendly, even on the easiest difficulty.\n- The world is split into pre-defined regions, and you can only have one city per region.\n- Quests are too strict. I've had to raze several of my own cities in order to re-do stuff the quest demanded.\n- Certain sounds don't behave according to volume settings.\n- I have a good computer, and yet a duel between me and an AI lags worse than a six person Civ multiplayer game.\n- No steam workshop at the moment.\n- Very few characters for city/army names.\n\nThis sounds like a lot of complaining, but I actually like the game. It just hurts my eyeballs after a while. It's not better than Civ 5, however. If you've never played this sort of game before, seriously get Civ 5 instead. If you've already played Civ and want something new, this is a decent pick up.","March 25, 2015","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/recommended/289130/","aspaceotter","aspaceotter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/","104 products in account","Endless legends is a game unlike any I have played before. It begins much in the way a game of civilizaiton would, you place a capital and branch out to new cities through the use of settlers, conquests, bribes, and even an intriguing quest system. If you enjoy games like civilization revolution then you will love this unique twist and style that endless legends brings to the genre.\n\nWhile this game is one of the best games of the genre it does have its draw backs. Throughout my play through I began to notice a few irritating things that I feel are necessary to understand about this game before purchase. My first point would be to say that this game is not one that encourages variety. Every faction has three basic units that are unlocked fairly early on, and then they are allowed to assimilate a few minor factions along the way in order to broaden their unit scope. While this may not seem like a big deal to many people it does put certain factions at a major disadvantage against experienced players. My most recent encounter with this is that the Mezari start the game with ranged units that are able to move and shoot all in the same turn, this allows them to kite early game fights and put almost all other factions into the dirt early game. While this may seem like something that many people see as counterable you have to realize that certain factions such as the drakken and the broken lords have no way of countering a ranged unit as they have no late game ranged units of their own without using a valuable assimilation slot.\n\nWhile this game does have its flaws, it is almost impossible to pass up. Its unique quest system sets it apart from the other titles in this genre, as you now no longer have to build a final building but instead with each faction you are encouraged to follow a specific path that will also allow you win the game. Knowing these paths for each faction you are offered a very interesting way of now denying your allies victory, without having to declare war. We also see the hero system in this game help to further its path to the top of my list of most played games. This game rewards those who use its heroes correctly, offering multiple skill tree paths and roles for heroes. A fully leveled hero in this game could be the difference maker in a battle, as a support hero might be what is needed to keep one militia group alive against multiple titans.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to any lovers of the civilization series, it sticks to the basic city building aspect of the civ series, all the while giving a unique spin on the battle system and diplomacy system.\n","March 6, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's focused on tech research and city building and administration like Civilization but still has the very interesting tactical aspect of combat of AoW; moreover, you still have the possibility to upgrade your current units and heroes with the latest weapons, armor and artifacts you have researched -- a bit like what you can do in Stardock's Fallen Enchantress or in the classic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.\n\nA novel aspect of EL with respect of all the games I've mentioned is that the game map is divided into regions and each region can host upto one town only; this makes things a bit more interesting as the town has to be placed strategically in accordance with which resources the single region has to offer.\n\nThe graphics style is really appealing to me, and the music (that you get also in MP3 format bundled with the game download for free) really nails the mood and tempo of the game.\n\nThe only bad thing that I can say about EL is that the AI isn't very challenging at all; sometimes it could just stay idle in its initial territory for the most part of the match -- that's what happened to the Mezari in my first ever game. If this one issue is fixed, EL can become a true classic gem of the genre.\n\nMy vote: 8.5/10\n\nPS: I'm still waiting for the Linux release!","March 27, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Endless Legend is a beautiful game, with a unique visual style that sets it apart from Civilization V and others. The gameplay is as deep as you want it to be, with little to lots of micromanagement available. It is enjoyable to play once you understand the mechanics, but getting that far can be a little difficult.\n\nThe main drawback of the game is that it feel very hard to understand at the start. There is a tutorial, but it doesn't do a great job of showing you anything more than the very basics. It took more than one failed-start of a game before I was able to make any significant progress. It also sucks up your time - but with this genre of game that's to be expected.\n\nMaybe not if you're a newbie to the concept of 4X as it can be a bit information overload for a while, but overall, I would definitely recommend.","January 1, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If youo're looking for a 4x game with a really intriguing story and a neat take on the 4x formula, this is a great game. Also, be prepared to do a lot of micro managing. If you're into that (as I am) you'll have a lot more fun with it. The story behind each of the 8 playable factions is deep enough to get invested in, but open enough for the player to make their own story out of it.\n\nHowever, there are some very frustrating things with the quest system. Quests are a very important part of the game, but they are by far the weakest part. There are many quests whose completion requirements are overly specific in what is required, and yet strangely general in how they are told. Many times I thought I completed a quest and hadn't because of some minor detail which wasn't fully recounted. For example, one quest required me to grow a city to the size of 8. The city was already at a size of 14, but the quest didn't complete. I had to starve the city down to 7 population, and then re-grow it to get the completion on the quest. Possibly that was intentional, but it was extremely frustrating. Twice, the game actually bugged in such a way that completing a quest was impossible.\n\nThere have also been more than a few crashes, but the game autosaves every turn so it's not that much of a problem, and with luck that will get fixed in a later patch.\n\nOverall, mostly great 4x game that could use a few patches. If the quests are fixed and the crash bugs are removed, this game is very solid.","January 5, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

As it turns out, CivV grows slow the longer you play, and online connection with friends fails over and over again. That's why I started looking for an alternative.\n\nWith Endless Legend I've had none of those problems so far. Excellent for multiplayer, never lost any connection, very neat UI, and no slowdown symtoms thus far (and I've put 18+ hours into it already). So far so good.\n\nGameplay itself : the game does play much like CivV (that was a good thing for me, as I was simply looking for something better). It's refreshing to have diverse factions though, some play very differently from others. Supports different kinds of endings, so not just military ones, and I find the trading & diplomacy a lot more natural. Plays a bit faster too, for example, you can send units through tiles twice as fast. The tutorial sadly enough does not cover everything there is to know (so check out city planning online!) but everything is there. Combat is improved compared to CivV : there's either auto-battle (instant fights) or small Age-of-Wonders like sessions. The wonderful thing about it is that these fights occur on the world map itself : if you can reach through the fog of war you can actually see your neighboor doing these little battles, but all battles are executed asynchronously so there's no rapid switching from one to another (which occurs in civV if you enable animated fights during multiplayer). Combat animations are good enough, nothing too fancy, nothing too short.\n\nSoundtrack is ok, you get the mp3 files with the game, which is very nice. The graphics are very nice (although I did read somewhere they are out-dated, they are not, in 'fantastic' settings they are very beautiful). Which brings me to the conclusion this game is great, I find it better than CivV or CivBE (which did not improve CivV that much alas) so definately recommended!\n","January 23, 2015","true","87.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tried again this last free weekend with Endless Legend, and failed again.\n\nBUT I am keeping it on my wishlist, because in some hypothetical future when I have more time for gaming THIS would be the 4X game I'd try again to get into: the lore backdrop is engaging, the gameplay (seems) minimally arduous for a 4X game, while still providing the depth/complexity that fans of these games crave (I couldn't even begin to unpack a coherent/effective strategy for myself).","April 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game doses 3 things really well.\n\n1. Gameplay and Factions.\nThere are 8 different factions in this game. Each faction plays different than the others.\nFor example there is a faction that can not make peace with others ever. Or there is a faction\nthat gets a cut off of the market, because it controlls the market (lorewise).\n\n2. Lore and Gameplay\nWhat leads me to my second point. The gameplay is connected to the lore of the game.\nThe lore itsself is very rich and for fans it is also connected to the other Endless games, like\nEndless Space and Dungeon of Endless.\n\n3. Gameplay mechanics\nIts interface and game design is simple and complex at the same time.\nBut it is simple enough to be able to learn the complex stuff as you play the game over and over.\nI never got into CiV 5. I just didn't get it. Now that i played Endless Legend\ni finally know what these 4x games are all about.\n\nThat game got to be my game of the year 2014 period.","December 5, 2014","true","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Endless Legend is a beautiful game, with a unique visual style that sets it apart from Civilization V and others. The gameplay is as deep as you want it to be, with little to lots of micromanagement available. It is enjoyable to play once you understand the mechanics, but getting that far can be a little difficult.\n\nThe main drawback of the game is that it feel very hard to understand at the start. There is a tutorial, but it doesn't do a great job of showing you anything more than the very basics. It took more than one failed-start of a game before I was able to make any significant progress. It also sucks up your time - but with this genre of game that's to be expected.\n\nMaybe not if you're a newbie to the concept of 4X as it can be a bit information overload for a while, but overall, I would definitely recommend.","January 1, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has interesting mechanics and highly varied races, and is generally very well-designed and pretty to look at. Great for people who (like me) love thinking up their own strategies -- the game allows you to customise its races (which are each already fairly unique) pre-game, and customise your units in-game, which makes each round turn out quite differently and keeps you brainstorming new options as the game progresses. Generally speaking there are many viable options, some seeming absolutely bonkers at the outset, and it's a lot of fun to tweak races and units to min-max your game plan.","August 27, 2015","true","110.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have the usual supremacy/extermination/diplomacy victory conditions that you expect, but you also have access to some RPG elements. Each faction has a lore quest that leads to a victory. And along the way, you also have the opportunity to take on other lore based quests, and outfit your heroes and armies as you see fit.\n\nThe heroes are another interesting mechanic. Apart from leading your armies (think generals in Civ, or hero units in Warcraft III), they can also be assigned as governors to your cities, with a skill tree specific to governance.\n\nThe lore and worldbuilding is, in my opinion, some of the best in the fantasy genre I've seen in quite some time. Each faction is unique beyond their unit designs/builds, and each gives you specific goals to work toward.\n\nTHe only caveat - if you're coming from or prefer straight 4X games like Civ or Master of Orion, you may be put off by the focus on questing and lore.\n\nAlso - the devs are pretty great, with another upcoming faction expansion.

Sid Meier's Civilization is the only thing I can compare it to. The gameplay is relatively similar: turn-based empire building where every construction or unit costs a city's production to create or expand. But where Endless Legend differs is its focus on simplicity. In Civ 5, you see your armies splayed out on the map, each one taking up a space, which makes mass movement a very calculated process. However, Endless Legend allows you to merge your armies to make a larger one and the best part is that army only takes up one space on the map!\n\nOne of the highlights for me as an avid RPG player is the focus on customization. You can field heroes much as you can generals in Civ 5. However, instead of Civ 5's seemingly random bestowing of generals, you have much more control in how you obtain your heroes, what they carry into battle, and where they will function in your world. You can customize them using not only their individual ability tree, but also by their race to suit your needs.\n\n\nHaving only played the game for a few weeks, I haven't seen all there is to see in Endess Legend. But I can say it leaves me wanting more every turn I play. Also, the Easy difficulty is much more punishing than you think.","October 7, 2015","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a great TBS that has its good points far outweight its bad ones. So here ya go:\n\n\nPros\n\n- Very interesting factions, they're all really unique and only some are similar to the popular Tolken-kind of races (Wild Walkers as Elves and Vaulters could be somewhat similar to dwarves). Every faction has great lore behind them with a unique questline that can guide you if you need a goal. Also, their armies are completely different from each other. Say you're a Cultist. The two things you lack in your army are infantry and flying units. This is useful because you need to take this into account when fighting different factions as your strengths and weaknesses will be different per race.\n\n- Plenty of victory types. You need to decide which one to go after when you begin the game.\n\n- The customization of units is unique from most other modern TBS games and is something I've only seen since Alpha Centauri.\n\n- It can be viable to go tall or wide, although you may need to take down a few cities along the way.\n\n- Graphics are probably the best I've seen compared to other rival TBS games (Civ:BE). Also, the terrian layout is perfect, I love how there are choak points throughout the map that are made by cliffs and lakes.\n\n- Research is different from what you would usually see in the genre, with no tech trees but instead 'discs.'\n\n- I personally love the tile expansion system with the boroughs and districts. Makes you need to be strategic when expanding.\n\n- Smooth UI. If you learn how to use it, it is very helpful and advanced.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Tedious battle system. This is something you'll love or hate, kind of like golf. There is no middle ground really.\n\n- No naval combat, which is a bit of a bummer.\n\n- I've been sitting here trying to think of a third point. Bad AI maybe? Nah, I thought it was pretty cool when the Roving Clans were black mailing me when they took me off the market. Winters are pointless? Well actually they add a lot of depth and require you to time things perfectly when it comes to war. Yeah, I can't think of any other bad points.\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\nEndless Legend Vanilla is a fun and original game, and it's something fans of TBS should try. It puts plenty of great twists on the genre and only suffers from minor details that shouldn't really detract from your enjoyment.","October 6, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am enjoying it much more than either Endless Space (another by the same developer) or any of its competitors I have tried (Age of Wonders 3, Fallen Enchantress). I love the one-city-per-region mechanic. It cuts back on the number of cities while allowing them to grow naturally on the map, but also awards thoughtful placement. Also, the way units are upgraded is a big step up in user friendliness than Fallen Enchantress. Luxury resource mechanics are also an interesting change.\n\nThe only gripe I have is the fact that for every battle you have to select 'Auto' again and again if you don't want to go into tactical combat. A feature to remember the last choice, or even a feature to set the default would have been nice.\n\nOverall, great game.

As a huge fan of Age of Wonders and Civilization games I gave it a try and I had a good time with it for the most part. Liked the rpg elements, liked some new good ideas ( especially winter ), liked factions and small races, ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED the world of Endless Legend and how beautiful it looks.Hands down, Endless Legend is probably the best looking strategy game I've ever put my hands on.\n\nMy  problem with the game was the diverse in units of factions. Each faction can produce up to 3 different original units and adopting other smaller races' rises the number to 5. So yeah, only 5 type of different units was not enough for me to keep the game entertaining. At the end map was filled with the same kind of units which caused to repetition and decreased diversity.\n\nDon't know about you, but I like fast paced gameplay in turn based games. Endless Legend did not have that. Although sense of finishing quests was quite rewarding, game dragged on and on. Time passed and I still felt like I'm inside of a box in an exploration game, trying to get out. I know this is a different game, but with the given amount of time I explored more areas and fought more enemies in similar games (like Civ5 and AoW3), thus expanding faster.\n\n\n4x means: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate. Exploration and Expanding parts were good, but no good enough (at least for me) in comparasing with other 4x games. Exploit and Extermination in my opinion are done better, in a sense. Because combat was just like the game itself, it kept dragging on. However I liked it, because it was a new touch in the genre, something original.\n\nDid not try multiplayer, so can't say a thing about it.\n\nA flawed good game, but a good game nevertheless.","September 3, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Civilization series is one of my favorite of all time. About one year ago, I bought Endless Space (made by this company), and it completely redefined the genre. Amplitude Studios does an excellent job of creating new 4X games with a spin. You will spend a minimum of 50 hours playing each faction to mastery, and you will still not know it all. Endless Legend has yet again redefined what I think of the 4X genre.\n\nPros:\n-Factions vary greatly yet are somehow balanced to a degree.\n-Absolutely gorgeous world. I have spent 20 minutes looking at the planet Auriga.\n-Incredible lore. Who are the Endless? Where did they go? Will we ever find out?\n-Tech tree redefined. Technology is non-linear, but gated by 'eras' for balance and interesting civilizations.\n-Real-time economic marketplace. Prices for resources change based on player and AI consumption.\n-Fluid combat. Battles are highly strategic.\n-Reactive AI. That battle you just won with 6 archers? Well the AI created 6 cavalry with bonus damage to range.\n-User-based city evolution. You decide WHEN and WHERE your city expands (one of my personal favorite features).\n-Breathtaking soundtrack.\n-Equippable units and heroes. Complete customization of your army with different resources.\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes game saves are corrupted, but the game autosaves every turn so you just lose 1 turn.\n-AI movement happens during your turn, so you can cheese the AI and move twice before they move.\n-Embarking units requires a tech which can easily be missed. This is really only a problem for novices.\n-Flying and support units so far seem lackluster, making infantry, cavalry, ranged my go-to choices.\n-You can annihilate a faction within 20 turns if you rush them. Of course, you can just choose not to do this.\n\nI will edit this list as more ideas come my way.","October 16, 2014","true","71.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better than Civ. Buy.\n\nLet's start with the most important thing, the gameplay. For me, the features in this game are a lot more interesting than Civ. The factions are all so different, in a good way, each with their own completely different positives and negatives. Also, as of writing this review I have about 50 hours of game time and there are still cool little features that I am picking up along the way thanks to how different all the factions are. As a result of this, I feel like I am still playing a brand new game.\n\nThe game is smooth. I have an average build PC and I have never yet experienced lag or crashing, which I had to deal with on a regular basis with Civ. I play multiplayer a lot with friends, and yes the turns slow down as the game gets longer, but not by a huge amount.\n\nGraphics are great, the lore is brilliant for anyone who is into it, but you can also ignore the lore completely if you choose to do so, you are not forced either way and it won't affect your gameplay.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThere are a few small negatives. Not enough to give the game a bad review, but things that could be improved on.\n\nThe tutorial is usless and a complete waste of time. I tried to learn aspects of the game using it but the amount of features is so overwhelming and not explained well in the tutorial. I jumped straight into a game with a friend and learned the hard (but more fun) way.\n\nThe AI can be really good or really bad. Sometimes they perform an attack at a certain time or in a certain area (for example a faction that gets boost from forest specifically using a forested route to attack me, or settling their cities in forested areas) but then the AI can also be really dumb, mainly when it comes to researching techs. I keep seeing science tech factions not even bothering to researched the Age 1 science techs, or the economy based factions not even researching trade routes. Needs to be sorted.\n\n--------------------------\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game as it is. The current price is 30 pound which is worth it. If it goes on sale I would definitely buy it. However improve AI please.\n\n8.5/10","May 30, 2015","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, Beyond Earth was a bit of a letdown and I grew bored of it within a few days, deciding to give Endless Legend a try, and discovered a truly great 4X game.\n\n\nEndless Legend takes a lot of familiar 4X concepts, adds a few new and interesting features, and polishes the whole package beautifully. Some of the more unique features are;\n\n*Heroes & Quests - Your leaders are powerful combat units themselves (or alternately can become strong governers for your cities), and you can level them up with unique skill trees, and equip them with items to specialise them in certain ways.\n\n*Upgradable/Customised Units - In much the same way that your Heroes can acquire gear, so too do all your standard units. Each faction only gets a handful of different units throughout the game, but because of the way you can customise them, it never feels like there is a lack of choice.\n\n*Factions - In Endless Legend, the different factions play extremely differently. From a tribe who can move their cities around at-will, to one who are limited to only one city, to one whe are utterly incapable of any sort of diplomacy with other factions and is instead in a constant state of war with everyone. Every faction is unique and different, giving the game a lot of replay value compared with others of the genre. If this wasnt enough, you can create your own custom faction, loading it out with unique perks and weaknesses.\n\n\nEndless Legend is a gem of a game in a pretty fiercely contested genre. It combines the core elements of successful franchises such as Civ, and integrates its own features and additions. Well worth getting for any fan of the genre.","June 7, 2015","true","86.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better than Civ. Buy.\n\nLet's start with the most important thing, the gameplay. For me, the features in this game are a lot more interesting than Civ. The factions are all so different, in a good way, each with their own completely different positives and negatives. Also, as of writing this review I have about 50 hours of game time and there are still cool little features that I am picking up along the way thanks to how different all the factions are. As a result of this, I feel like I am still playing a brand new game.\n\nThe game is smooth. I have an average build PC and I have never yet experienced lag or crashing, which I had to deal with on a regular basis with Civ. I play multiplayer a lot with friends, and yes the turns slow down as the game gets longer, but not by a huge amount.\n\nGraphics are great, the lore is brilliant for anyone who is into it, but you can also ignore the lore completely if you choose to do so, you are not forced either way and it won't affect your gameplay.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThere are a few small negatives. Not enough to give the game a bad review, but things that could be improved on.\n\nThe tutorial is usless and a complete waste of time. I tried to learn aspects of the game using it but the amount of features is so overwhelming and not explained well in the tutorial. I jumped straight into a game with a friend and learned the hard (but more fun) way.\n\nThe AI can be really good or really bad. Sometimes they perform an attack at a certain time or in a certain area (for example a faction that gets boost from forest specifically using a forested route to attack me, or settling their cities in forested areas) but then the AI can also be really dumb, mainly when it comes to researching techs. I keep seeing science tech factions not even bothering to researched the Age 1 science techs, or the economy based factions not even researching trade routes. Needs to be sorted.\n\n--------------------------\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game as it is. The current price is 30 pound which is worth it. If it goes on sale I would definitely buy it. However improve AI please.\n\n8.5/10","May 30, 2015","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not in a bad way, but in the sense that there's room to add a seemingly infinite amount of extra mechanics and concepts that might never get the proper attention to balance they need. I feel this was apparent in the Guardian expansion that has yet to see the addition of a unit that is meant to kill said Guardians (despite it's announcement with the release of said expansion).\n-Compared to their other title, Endless Space, the sync issues are handled EXTREMELY well, with probably 1% of the games I've played being ruined because of instability. Huge improvement there.\n-Gameplay issues I have include city defense and siege, which I feel needs more appropriate fleshing out. One unit can siege a city with immense size and population, and while it only takes a moment to deal with this in reality, it still feels a little strange that one guy can shut down a whole city.\n\nThe pros:\nAs usual, Amplitude Studios delivered a 4x with a great variety of gameplay options. Each race in the game basically acts as a foundation and template for the custom traits the player wants to add on, individualising their faction. For example, one race can only have a single city, and this affords that race slightly more "trait points" in creating their full array of characteristics. Another race is the only faction capable of moving cities. Another race survives without food (thriving on "Dust," the gold of the universe). Another race survives without science (stealing knowledge or research). Therefore, these are simply the base of where you want to take your gameplay as any of these races can be tailored to a militaristic, economic, diplomatic, scientific, etc. style of gameplay.\n\nAgain I feel Amplitude nailed multiple victory types without any single one being the "one" way to win like in other games such as Sins.\n\nCombat is handled in real-time, locking out a section of hexes on the map for the battle to take place in what I consider a very creative way of managing battlefields.\n\nI'd keep typing but everything else is totally awesome, including the updates and balance fixes.\n\nAlso, the developers are active on the forums and actually have made several key changes to this game based on feedback from users. A huge plus in my book.","November 4, 2015","true","507.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a pleasantly addictive quality, although not to the actually-terrifying-I-need-to-eat-and-sleep-as-well levels you get in some games. Admittedly, some of that is in the "just one more turn" nature of the 4x genre, but the lion's share is in the solid execution of that premise. Like it's predecessor, Endless Space, and it's... sibling? Estranged cousin? Some kind of relative, Endless Dungeon, it has a great sense of world building and lore, and well designed game mechanics. Comparatively, however, it has a more serious tone than other amplitude games, and features a lot less of the absurd kind of humour that I personally enjoyed, (For instance, the description of the xenolinguistics tech in Endless Space: "For communications to improve, linguistics must advance beyond dropping pronouns and speaking more loudly") although admittedly this is a personal preference.\n\nIf you want a 4x game, i would recommend this, or endless space. ES is a more casual, streamlined experience: combat is simpler, influence points (think diplo points from EU IV) are not present, and the tone is lighter. EL is deeper, and a bit denser, for better and for worse. Combat requires more strategic input, resources have been reworked to require more micromanagement, and, as mentioned, diplomacy and empire management is more complex, as is the story.\n\nAn 8.5, perhaps a nine out of ten.","July 22, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a few major differences:\n\n1. Armies are far more personable. Each unit you create can be outfitted with equipment that can massively increase their stats based on how many strategic resources you have (think iron, oil, etc. from Civ5). This lets you create one "death stack" of 5-6 units that both get experience and equipment to allow them to defeat any group of enemies.\n\n2. Hero units are also available that level up into skill trees you put points in. They can either lead armies or command cities improving the stats of each.\n\n3. Combat occurs on a grid, similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, with turn based combat occuring based on the Initiative stat of each creature, it creates a whole new depth to combat allowing a weaker force to subdue a better one with good positioning.\n\nMost everything else is  similar to Civ5, if you were disgruntled with Beyond Earth, this may be a better choice for you.","August 10, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But what was my astonishment when I found that the game not only hasn‘t lost anything from changing the setting, but it has become even more versatile and deep.\n\nArtists and writers tried wonderfully, breathing sense into every little detail on the map. Those players who criticized the previous game of the series, for the impersonality of star systems, will find this little part of the Endless Universe - extremely attractive. Hard to believe that the world is entirely procedural.\n\nStylistics of global maps and winter concept, as if borrowed from Game of Thrones, do not look vulgar tribute to pop culture, but introduced an almost tangible sense of time. On large maps, and higher difficulty levels, you will have the desire to write involuntary chronicle of a three-year war, telling about the hardships of winter capital blockade.\n\nEspecially great game looks in contrast with the Civilization V, cleverly adopts the interface and making it functional, useful and effective tool. Now developers Firaxis should think about how to borrow some improvements from Amplitude Games. In the end, this is a worthy continuer of Endless Space ideas that set them to new level. Looking at the games of this series, I'm off to them the glory of Warhammer, from the world of computer 4X strategies.\n\nThis is the only downside is the same as the previous game - unreasonably high system requirements.

Running on the same system as Endless Space the game uses the 'FIDS' food/industry/dust(money)/science used in Endless Space, another critically acclaimed and frequently expanded and improved title from the same developer.\n\nInstead of space 4x this version is one planet 4x fantasy with a twist that the planet undergoes frequent horrible winters that has caused the myriad of unusual cultures living upon it to have to adapt.  In the single player campaign you will receive a unique set of quests related to each of these cultures and how their story evolves.\n\nI particularly enjoyed how the individual cultures have their own approaches and inner strengths in addition to having thorough and well worked back stories, e.g. the Broken Lords who do not consume food, but dust to grow and are internally conflicted about consuming the life of others to stay alive or the Vaulters who lived underground until a disaster which forced them to the surface while discovering they are settlers from space.\n\nThis game also enjoys a much more meaty hex based combat system when compared to Endless Space with its 'roll 3 cards to win battles' system, instead with individual units being controllable.\n\nI would recommend this game at any price to 4x strategy fans; on discount I would recommend it to all buyers to try it.  With the currently daily deal at 50% off you can't lose and you are unlikely to find it any cheaper on the christmas sale.","November 29, 2014","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not in a bad way, but in the sense that there's room to add a seemingly infinite amount of extra mechanics and concepts that might never get the proper attention to balance they need. I feel this was apparent in the Guardian expansion that has yet to see the addition of a unit that is meant to kill said Guardians (despite it's announcement with the release of said expansion).\n-Compared to their other title, Endless Space, the sync issues are handled EXTREMELY well, with probably 1% of the games I've played being ruined because of instability. Huge improvement there.\n-Gameplay issues I have include city defense and siege, which I feel needs more appropriate fleshing out. One unit can siege a city with immense size and population, and while it only takes a moment to deal with this in reality, it still feels a little strange that one guy can shut down a whole city.\n\nThe pros:\nAs usual, Amplitude Studios delivered a 4x with a great variety of gameplay options. Each race in the game basically acts as a foundation and template for the custom traits the player wants to add on, individualising their faction. For example, one race can only have a single city, and this affords that race slightly more "trait points" in creating their full array of characteristics. Another race is the only faction capable of moving cities. Another race survives without food (thriving on "Dust," the gold of the universe). Another race survives without science (stealing knowledge or research). Therefore, these are simply the base of where you want to take your gameplay as any of these races can be tailored to a militaristic, economic, diplomatic, scientific, etc. style of gameplay.\n\nAgain I feel Amplitude nailed multiple victory types without any single one being the "one" way to win like in other games such as Sins.\n\nCombat is handled in real-time, locking out a section of hexes on the map for the battle to take place in what I consider a very creative way of managing battlefields.\n\nI'd keep typing but everything else is totally awesome, including the updates and balance fixes.\n\nAlso, the developers are active on the forums and actually have made several key changes to this game based on feedback from users. A huge plus in my book.","November 4, 2015","true","507.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm also not really a big Civ player because Civ V puts me to sleep for some reason. That said, I find this game a lot more interesting to think about. It has no serious grounding in reality, so the races, units and mechanics are all pretty out-there and imaginative.\n\nI think this is a great strategy game. It has interesting mechanics and highly varied races, and is generally very well-designed and pretty to look at. Great for people who (like me) love thinking up their own strategies -- the game allows you to customise its races (which are each already fairly unique) pre-game, and customise your units in-game, which makes each round turn out quite differently and keeps you brainstorming new options as the game progresses. Generally speaking there are many viable options, some seeming absolutely bonkers at the outset, and it's a lot of fun to tweak races and units to min-max your game plan.","August 27, 2015","true","110.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This 4x has a lot of appreciable character and personality, and the only real downside is that unit variety feels very shallow.  I think the game is poorly paced, because there's just not enough content to justify going through large maps or long games: big tech tree, but a lack of paradigmatic unit progression within each race coupled with a low viability of non-military victory conditions.  This is quite disappointing given the epic(ly dank) atmosphere the lore sets up, but I think it's a fairly fun MP title to play with friends.  The quest mechanic is also a poor fit for this game, it conflicts too much with the strong 4x identity because of how random its progression is.\n\nThose criticisms aside, the game is still tremendous fun, and gorgeous.  Combat is well designed, racial variation adds a lot of depth, and the game integrates a lot of civ concepts well.","June 22, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm absolutely sure they never did get it, to understand the game mechanics...\n\nThat leads me to\n\nThird The ingame explanations (tooltips) are not as informative they should be. It's absolutely necessary to get additional informations from gameguides. Me myself played many months Endless Legend, but I'm far away from "pro-gaming".\n\nFourth If you want to play single player only, the AI is not a kind of challenge in late game. But you can make it much more difficult by changing difficulty level and map settings before starting map. I have to admit, that the AI was improved in many ways after last patches. I'm sure there will be more patches (but not as soon, because the developers are concentrating their ressources on "Endless Space II" at the moment). If you want to have a challenge, play multiplayer (with experienced players...) instead of single player. It's like in very game, humen are the real challenge. I see single player as "training" for multiplayer, to get an idea of the basic game mechanics.\n\nFifth You should visit the official Endless Legend Forum and post every question about game (technical, gameplay, etc.) there. The community is very nice and really helps fast and professional. The admins answer very soon (not the weekend...), what I can't say from most forums...\n\nlinks is here: http://forums.amplitude-studios.com/forumdisplay.php?30-Endless-Legend\n\nSixthThe game is not a kind of: "I play for two hours and finish it !" It's 4xgame...\n\nSeventh If you want to have an idea of the gameplay-dimensions from Endless Legend, you must have a look at the game guide from "Jojo_Fr". He's a "pro-gamer" (crazy guy^^) that wrote a gameguide which is really impressive:\n\nlink: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=635764665\n\nConclusion:\n\nPro:\n\n* random maps\n* multiplayer (up to 8 players)\n* many different factions (in basic game 8) what leads to very specialized and absolutely different gameplay from game to game (one more faction from "Shadows"-DLC and one more faction with next DLC "Shifters"). Look here: http://endlesslegend.gamepedia.com/Endless_Legend_Wiki\n* lovely fantasy setting/-graphics\n* really good support and communication from devs and engaged community\n* different tech trees from different factions\n* different diplomacy options, depending on chosen faction\n* really good fighting system (if you know what you are doing...)\n* weapon and armor upgrades, pushing items for city-governors\n* "missions" you can get from ruins on map\n* you can specialize heroes to city-governor and/or to general\n* heroes got special skill trees\n* you decide, if you want to pacify or fight the minor factions (unless you are allowed to parley/pacify... by tech research and/or chosen faction)\n- strategical and other ressources\n\netc.\n\nContra:\n\n* you need time to play Endless Legend (especially in multiplayer)\n* your partner/family could leave your life... (did not happen to me^^)\n* the ingame tooltips/instructions explain max. about 20% you should know about gameplay... it's necessary to get informations from gameguides and/or official forum\n* later in game (playing larger maps with about 6+ players) the game tends to disconnect sometimes (online game). Reload autosaves (often two or three rounds before) does help (and very useful is to have a look at official game forum about technical game optimization)\n* fantasy game setting (if you don't like fantasy)\n* no linux version (but possible to play on linux, by using additional programs, look official forum for info about)\n* if you play multiplayer game, containing "pro-gamers", you realize you know nothing about game, even after months of excessive gaming^^ this can be very frustrating...\n\nI hope the people that wrote bad reviews about game will find back to Endless Legend, by "studying" the links above. It's worthy, but in parts really work...\n\nHope we will see one day in Endless Legend multiplayer, as long as I have time for...\n\nFor people thinking about to buy the game, use google, bing or whatever to find best price for...","March 5","true","935.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself playing all the time and seeming to never get bored with it. Eventually though I managed to play it into the ground and had to set it aside. Beyond Earth did not evoke the same feelings that Civ 5 did and I have stayed away from the whole genre until now. Let me say this: Endless Legend looks like what I had always hoped the successor of Civ 5 would look like. If you took Civ 5 and expanded on and improved every aspect you would get something very much like this game. The world is beautiful, the combat is tactical and far more dynamic than civ because of fully customizable units, the different factions are actually DIFFERENT with their own units and distinct playstyles.\nThe only thing that is a little disappointing to me is the lack of noticable difference in gameplay as you advance through the tech trees. Your economy gets much stronger and unit stats go up but you are still using the same units, whereas in civ you go all the way from crude stoneage weapons to a modern military with an airforce and nuclear weapons. I suppose that is the result of having a game take place in a fantasy universe. That aside, however, the game is very fun and any fan of the civ series shouldn't think twice about buying it.","January 14","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself playing all the time and seeming to never get bored with it. Eventually though I managed to play it into the ground and had to set it aside. Beyond Earth did not evoke the same feelings that Civ 5 did and I have stayed away from the whole genre until now. Let me say this: Endless Legend looks like what I had always hoped the successor of Civ 5 would look like. If you took Civ 5 and expanded on and improved every aspect you would get something very much like this game. The world is beautiful, the combat is tactical and far more dynamic than civ because of fully customizable units, the different factions are actually DIFFERENT with their own units and distinct playstyles.\nThe only thing that is a little disappointing to me is the lack of noticable difference in gameplay as you advance through the tech trees. Your economy gets much stronger and unit stats go up but you are still using the same units, whereas in civ you go all the way from crude stoneage weapons to a modern military with an airforce and nuclear weapons. I suppose that is the result of having a game take place in a fantasy universe. That aside, however, the game is very fun and any fan of the civ series shouldn't think twice about buying it.","January 14","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You've probably worked that out by now.\n\nThere are a few really nice features that make it stand out more to me than Civ 5 did. First, the world is split into regions. Plonk a city down in a region and that region is yours, as are all the resources in that region (if you have the technology and buildings to harvest them). This means that you don't have to put down cities in awkward places just to secure your border, or nab a particularly important resource, which is a definite plus point. The combat is also vastly better than Civ, with a nice tactical map system when armies clash. Then there's the quest system, which nudges you towards exploration and towards playing according to your faction's theme. For example, the Wild Walkers get quests to build up cities, while the murderous Cultists get quests to raze cities and subdue minor factions. But it never feels intrusive, and the rewards are worthwhile. Overall the game has definitly got that Civ "one more turn" effect - I missed lunch today because I couldn't stop!\n\nThat said, there are a few things I'd criticise the it for. Firstly it does a terrible job of explaining itself, especially the victory conditions. My second play through I won a Supremecy victory, and I really have no idea what that even meant. I mean, sure I'd beaten the other factions into the ground, but the victory seemed to come out of nowhere. Secondly, the AI seem a bit passive - in my first play through I was hopelessly sandwiched between vastly more powerful factions who could have wiped me off the map very quickly, but all of them accepted peace treaties and alliances, and pretty soon I was running my own little UN; not a single war happened until one of the AI factions was close to an economic victory and I got everyone to declare war on them. That said, in my second play through, where I played aggressively, several factions were wiped out before I even met them, so perhaps the AI are more keen to go to war with each other than the player. Thirdly, the AI difficulty seems badly tuned. My first play through was on normal difficulty and the AI racked up well over 10x my score, and I was nowhere near any victory conditions by the end (when an AI won). So I dropped it down a level to easy, where the AI bumbles around hopelessly and is pretty much a punching bag in war. The difference between the two difficulties is pretty radical to say the least.\n\nAs an aside, be prepared to do a lot of fiddling around to get it to run on Windows 10. I had to set it to run in Windows 7 compatibility mode with admin permissions and no Steam overlay before it would even get past the first loading screen.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it to any fans of Civ, even people who, like myself, found the last Civ game disappointing.","April 25","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game and the faction quest feel like you are in an epic being told with stories of Glorious victories, tradgic defeats and the struggle to survive.\n\nPositives:\nBeautiful looking (dispite on lowest graphics)\nVery strategic, in city spots and army composition\nFun faction quests\nAn Interactive Dev (actually responded to my post in the beta in regards to a glitch I found)\nSound track, only two words to describe, On Point.\nBalanced and unique races (nothing is OP, and if so, they have a weakness that can be devistating if exploited)\nEnvironment is amazing and tactical as well (suck it Necrophages, you can't get to my dust bishop that are on top of this cliff >:D)\n\nNegatives:\nMinimum spec requirements make laptop playing....problematic at worst\nSound track while beautiful, can get repeatitive just like in Endless Space but, I mainly played Broken Lords (with any subsantial time) so I might be missing out on the other races default music.\nAI: The city manager AI is ok...i guess; when it comes to trading and treaties (mostly trades in tech) are douches as they even when I have 3 full stack of veteran units with a max level leader and 5 more full stacks in cities for reserves and I own halve the starting continent and with 60% control and expanding on the other one, think that a teir 4 tech from me is a slightly better than ok trade for a teir 2 tech I didn't bother researching. Also the Roving clan AI market blocking me 5 turns after we meet, can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.\nMultiplayer? Never experienced it (i.e. ♥♥♥♥ laptop with less power than a bootleg, kind of my fault for not giving parents specs but hey, beggers can't be choosers, so stay in school and get a good job kids), anyone with less than stable connection or poor computer "power" might find some problems and with no turn timer (from what I have seen of MP "let's plays") turns can gets stupidly long.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth it, though get it on sale because the DLC added on can get pricy but on its own, is worth every penny.","June 2","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The victory conditions and controls for game rules are unique and are, at least to me, the main draw for this game vs over 4X games. However, there is one area where the game feels like it falls flat: combat. Combat happens in a pseudo-simulataneous turn layout that, to me, feels exceptionally clunky and manual control is poorly implemented. A combat turn begins with you issuing general commands to individual units and once you hit go, the turn executes for all units on both sides of the conflict with faster units moving first. The problem with this setup is that if any other unit moves into the area you instructed a unit to move to, it disregards the order and re-assigns to whatever order the AI feels is the most important move. It would have been just as easy to begin a turn, rotating through the units in order of speed and issuing individual commands that execute and complete before moving onto the next unit in the turn. Instead, they threw this tried and true system to the wind to create this clunky, chaotic and often times infuriating system in which the actual player does interacts tactically with his units very little and the computer basically controls the entire flow of combat.\nOverall I'd give the game a 7/10.\nStrategic gameplay and lore: 9/10\nCombat: 5/10","April 26","true","88.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memorykiller/recommended/289130/","memorykiller","Memorykiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memorykiller/","79 products in account","Endless Legends has been an RTS game that has made me want to play RTS again and the last RTS I was this addicted to was Starcraft 1. I was never a fan of the civ type games, but the fantasy environment that endless has really draws me in and has gotten me hooked. I've played the game a lot now and feel comfortable giving my insight on it. My main experience comes from playing the Ardent Mages (Favorite empire) and secondly the Necrophages. I've dabbled in the other empires but mostly play those two.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique, distinquishable factions that all have a preffered playstyle\n+ Graphics/Art is beautiful\n+ Gameplay is smooth\n+ The combat is completely unique (Fighting RIGHT THERE on the map huge +++)\n+ Customize not only Heroes, but your actual units. And the equipment VISUALLY changes on them.\n+ Linear quest system unique to each faction\n+ Create your own faction\n+ Multiple ways to win games\n+ Extensive world generator options\n\nCons:\n- Crashes [11/2/2014] Since the latest patch, there has been significantly less crashes I can actually go a game without it doing it now, but they're still present sometimes\n- AI Decisions: I feel the AI still feels really robotic (ironic?) and doesn't really make human-like decisions. Example: I walk one hex into their territory, they close borders immediately when there was no threat presence. I've had the Vaulters end peace next turn right after THEY established it for no reason.\n- Diplomacy: The diplomacy is by far the most irritating thing and my biggest con factor in the game for me, I feel its the hardest thing in the game to get anything out of the AI. You could simply ask for a minisquel amount of a resource they have abundance of and no use for, and they'll require all the gold in the world for it. Especially research trading. I sometimes find it impossible to trade for a few things.

On the flip side, the combat is a step backwards from those types of games and you have no where near the ability to control your troops in manual mode.   That being said, the game is already on it's way to being great and looks amazing for an alpha build.\nIf you want a fantasy game that puts more emphasis on questing, research, and city building and less on the tactical combat side of things then I wsould highly suggest keeping an eye on it.

But it's still more fun than any 4x game I've played. Endless space is very good as well, but space based.\n\ncompared to the endless hype train and endless support the civ series gets from the press and fanbois, this game should get a 110% approval rating at metacritic, despite the few issues it has. bugs can be fixed, AI can be improved. but the flawed gameplay civ has, is unfixable and the company behind it has not innovated the genre for 25 years. Endless Legend is such a breath of fresh air.\n\nsince this is actually scifi based (not fantasy), as it is like a prequel to endless space, people who like scifi should turn to endless legend, not the new "civilization in space" title that is just the overpriced same old same old.","October 3, 2014","true","207.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memorykiller/recommended/289130/","memorykiller","Memorykiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memorykiller/","79 products in account","Endless Legends has been an RTS game that has made me want to play RTS again and the last RTS I was this addicted to was Starcraft 1. I was never a fan of the civ type games, but the fantasy environment that endless has really draws me in and has gotten me hooked. I've played the game a lot now and feel comfortable giving my insight on it. My main experience comes from playing the Ardent Mages (Favorite empire) and secondly the Necrophages. I've dabbled in the other empires but mostly play those two.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique, distinquishable factions that all have a preffered playstyle\n+ Graphics/Art is beautiful\n+ Gameplay is smooth\n+ The combat is completely unique (Fighting RIGHT THERE on the map huge +++)\n+ Customize not only Heroes, but your actual units. And the equipment VISUALLY changes on them.\n+ Linear quest system unique to each faction\n+ Create your own faction\n+ Multiple ways to win games\n+ Extensive world generator options\n\nCons:\n- Crashes [11/2/2014] Since the latest patch, there has been significantly less crashes I can actually go a game without it doing it now, but they're still present sometimes\n- AI Decisions: I feel the AI still feels really robotic (ironic?) and doesn't really make human-like decisions. Example: I walk one hex into their territory, they close borders immediately when there was no threat presence. I've had the Vaulters end peace next turn right after THEY established it for no reason.\n- Diplomacy: The diplomacy is by far the most irritating thing and my biggest con factor in the game for me, I feel its the hardest thing in the game to get anything out of the AI. You could simply ask for a minisquel amount of a resource they have abundance of and no use for, and they'll require all the gold in the world for it. Especially research trading. I sometimes find it impossible to trade for a few things. It would also feel more immersive if they inititated trade with me, rather than me always initiating with them.\n\n\n\nWhat I hope to see:\n+ Combat Depth: I like the combat the way it is currently, the only thing I wish that would change is if you could assign MOVE orders WITH the ATTACK orders, especially for ranged units. Otherwise I sort of feel like I'm playing Clash of Clans hoping my units behave how I want them to.\n+ Improved AI Diplomacy: See above in Cons\n+ More options in the Custom Faction list. I'm tottally fine with the "Affinity" attribute meaning you pick a faction for your custom faction to LOOK like, but currently I feel like the custom factions are just little add-ons/drops from the original faction rather than truly being one of my own.\n+ Ally Support: It would be nice to extent what it means to be in an alliance with another empire by allowing aid in combat. I may be wrong and this could already be in the game, but I've yet to see it exercised. I've been next to battles where I'm "At Peace" with that empire, but couldn't join the fight, I hope its the different if you're in an "Alliance".\n+ Mods: This is incoming there's even an option in the start menu for it, but I'm curious to what the mods will be.\n+ The Marketplace: I'd like to see the marketplace be a bit more meaningful and more player oriented rather than be a "bank" for the game. The supply vs. demand that is currently there is fine, but the marketplace should be more affected when players are buying/selling than it currently is. Almost as if an indirect way of trading with each other. The BIG one though, is I think that the Heroes market should either only be your empire type of heroes, or at least offer more heroes that belong to your empire. This is just immersion for me, I don't want to buy heroes from another empire I'd rather stick with my own affinity but there's almost never a hero from my empire in the list (Roughly 10 heroes are always up for grabs)\n+ Passing Turn: Something that definately needs adjusted is that when you're allied or have vision on a large portion of the map, passing turn takes A LONG TIME because the game has to process all the information and visual that you're able to see. Example: I'm in a game with 8 empires and I'm in an Alliance with 3 or 4 of them (So I get vision on their empire). The game stalls for a good while as it processes all the info and moves all the units instantaniously and simultaniously, sort of taking the immersion out of viewing the AI's actions.

You build your first city, exlpore surroundings and try to achieve vicotry wheter via technology supremacy, sword or wealth to name few. As you get more technology you can improve the infrastructure, and found new cities. The problem is: the other races are your rivals, and they like to win, as well.\n\nTechnology is separated in six eras. You advance an era once you have researched enough technologies from curren era. New era opens new research, and gives you some additional boosts. Other than that you can research more freely, and you are not restricted by Civ V-alike "tech tree".\n\nThere are also some "small factions" which can be harnessed for bringing bonuses for your empire. However, they start hostile towards you. You can make them less hostile and even friendly by conquesting, bribery or running their errands, which is: doing quests for them. Friendly (and assimilated) small faction villages increase your population.\n\nUnlike in Civ V you do not occupy fields with population. You gain more space to to work with by enlargening your city. City borders expand as a result and you can exploit more of the resources. The basic resources are food, dust (gold), science (to get researchs done), industry (productivity) and influence.\n\nFood helps your cities to grow, industry helps to increase productivity etc. Influence, on the other hand is different kind of "currency". You spend influence on "empire plans" and on diplomacy.\n\nEnlargening cities as well as building new cities creates unhappiness, much like in Civ V. You can combat increased unhappiness with "empire plan", building certain infrastructure or consuming luxury resources. Luxury resources will give you boost on various topics, depending on the resource. The catch is that they work only for few turns, so if you don't produce enough such a resource, you will run out of it.\n\nThere are also few strategic resources, which are required by certain buildings equimpent for your troops. you can have small armies and they can be led by a hero character. Heroes can be assigned on cities as being "governors". Heroes do have skill trees which can help a hero be a good army commander, a good governor, or both.\n\nCombat works quite straightforward. You place your army units (and if there are nearby other units, they can work as reinforcements), then you give each unit a target and run a combat round where your and your enemy units resolve the orders they got. If there is a victor within few such rounds they will get experience and both the heroes and troops can do level-ups.\n\nThere are two seasons: summer and winter. During winter season production is usually hindered, especially food production. You can manage each cities' population to work on either food, industry, science, dust or influence.\n\nGraphics are ok, but occasionally it is hard to recognise different resources from it. it becomes more clear when you zoom-out and get 2-dimensional "map" over regions. The lack of minimap is disturbing and scrolling over edges can be frustrating at times.\n\nAdditional cons for this game: at this point it crashes. A lot and on big variety of events. On bigger games the lack of information concerns assimilated minor factions. You can have a faction ready to assimilate that brings +5% influence per village of that specific faction assimilated. I haven't found information of how many villages I have befriendlied on each faction. The trick is that "slots for assimilation" are restricted so you need to weigh more careful which ones to choose. This can mean manual browsing every single village on your map and it is really annoying.\n\nIf you like 4X-games, for example Civilization V, this can be recommended pick, if you don't mind crashing. The developers have promised to fix issues, but right now it requires some "devotion to strategy games" to play. "Game rules" are highly customisable for different tastes so for 4x-fans this hits 87/100.\n\nHowever, if you dislike 4X games, you most likely don't like this one either.\n\nUPDATE 11th December, 2014\n\nLots of crash fixes. :) Scoring now 91/100.\n\nThe newest patch up to this point (11th Dec, 2014) fixes the uninformation about how many pacified small faction villages you are having, which makes planning more helpful.\n\nThings I'd like to add on the original review:\n\nYou can retrofit troops with new technology items such as weapons, trinkets and armour. You only first need to design such an upgrade. Additionally, pacified villages will provide one design each.\n\nDiplomacy is always a pain in such games, but here it works quite well. You can spend influence to send compliments and warnings, which can be used on your advantage. For example if you want to be friends, a compliment will turn negative diplomatic manners more expensive (on influence).\n\nYou can "close borders" (indeed, you need to declare war, which makes you more alerted - or negotiate closed borders off), trade various things once in peace, share on unshare map and vision range. You can earn influence points by killing shared enemies, while in alliance.\n\nThe more you invest influence via diplomacy, the more you earn points for diplomatic victory. Great feature!\n\nYou can also buy and sell stuff in-game market place, once you have researched technology for that. More heroes for sale, stockpiles, resources etc. You can also sell abundant resources to the market for cash.\n\nOverall, I start to like this game even more. :)","November 1, 2014","true","150.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguin1992/recommended/289130/","penguin1992","AirBear1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguin1992/","453 products in account","Great 4x fantasy game.\n\nPros:\n+ The art direction is fantastic and the factions and their lore are awesome. The factions get their own questline and their own intro videos. Many, many unique tiles that give their own yields really sell the fantasy setting. The overall universe that they've set up is really great.\n+ High amount of customization for your military units. You can pick various armors and weapons that have their own advantages (Higher chance for successful attack? Higher damage? More defense? More movement points? You can mix and match to your hearts content)\n+ The factions have highly unique abilities and units. One can use spells on its units in combat, one doesn't use food, another can force other factions out of the marketplace, one can turn dead enemy units in food supplies, and more. Also many minor factions (like city states if you have played Civ V) that all have their own unique unit and benefits.\n+ A tech web that forces you to debate on what to unlock. There are many options and after a (short) amount are unlocked, you unlock the next chunk of techs to pick from (called eras in game). This means that there will be many techs left from the previous era that you can still unlock, along with this new era stuff you just unlocked, making you choose between many beneficial techs. There is also a rising cost of all techs, keeping you from flying through 5 techs in only 7 turns.\n\nCons\n- The game crashes. A lot. I think I've had around 30 crashes in 50 hours of playing. Lowering the settings seems to reduce the occurrence of crashes somewhat. Fast loading times and autosave every turn keep this from turning into table flipping rage, but players still shouldn't have to put up with it.\n- There is a steep learning curve and the game is in desperate need of a better education system. It has a tutorial yes, but when you are done with that there is no "new player" option to add to matches, something to bridge the gap between brand new player and someone who knows all the systems at play. It has an encyclopedia that you can open, but it is bare bones and really needs much more content (also, it alt+tabs you out of the game and open it in your browser. Come on, put your encyclopedia IN the game). You'll pretty much have to do your own research with online guides and google. You'll struggle through your first couple games due to a thousand little things that you haven't learned yet.\n- A couple "nitpicky" cons: There is this thing in diplomacy (all diplomatic actions cost a currency called influence) where you can give a faction a compliment or warning to decrease the cost of future friendly or hostile diplomatic actions. I can see how this is trying to lean players away from making quick and abrupt changes to the relationship between factions, but in my experience it is very small decreases in the cost so I just never used it, instead paying small price increases just to do what was more convenient.\n- The battle system is...well it isn't bad but I don't particularly like it. When two armies fight it turns into a turn based battle lasting 6 turns (these 6 turns are within the battle system, so the battle will finish within 1 turn outside of the battle system). You can make precise decisions within the battle, like have my 2 archers attack this guy, have the pikeman mob the enemy leader, have my support unit heal my leader, etc. Except it can actually be pretty hard to make your army do what you want it to do. You and your opponent give all your units orders first, and then all those orders play out. This means you can have sometimes up to 10 or 12 units all going out and fulfilling their orders one after another. This means that if something unexpected happens, someone lands some critical hits and an enemy dies quicker that anticipated, your units won't be able to fulfill the orders you gave them and they will decide what they should do instead, which never seems to line up with what I would have wanted them to do. You can also just quickly auto-resolve battle without doing any fine details if you don't want to go into a long battle, but you take some risks with doing so.\n\n+/- Multiplayer. I have not played ANY multiplayer in this game. It might work flawlessly or it might be a broken mess. You'll have to get that information from another review.\n\nAlthough it seems I dragged on with some of the cons, I love this game and fully expect to get hundreds of hours out of it. The art direction/lore is phenomenal and some of the best I've seen in a game, and there are a lot of systems at play that allow for experimentation and that you can sink your teeth into. I would have happily paid a full $60 for this so whatever price it is selling at now, it's worth it.","December 14, 2014","true","153.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The story is fun, the graphics are good, and the pace of the game is decent.  Some of the factions are vastly different from each other, which I really like, and yet they are all playable and competitive.  Each seems to have its own character.  I do not really know why, but I keep coming back to this game.  There is something calming about it (the interface, music, grapics all combined).  Sometimes playing Civ 5 or Beyond Earth, I get a little antsy after a long session.  Something about the interface in the Sid Meiers games is jarring on occasion.  Not so in this game.

Each of the factions has an interesting and asymmetrical schtick. You can customize and/or upgrade your units. As you acquire more territory, you have access to minor factions which grant a passive bonus to your entire empire as well as access to a unit blueprint representing that faction.\n\nThe basics are simple— FIDSI are exactly what you'd expect. They compose with myriad other mechanics to produce an incredible level of nuance and complexity.\n\nDon't let the word "complexity" scare you off.

It's best points are also it's worst offenses.\n-The lore is deep but more plot holes will appear over time with each new piece of dlc they try to tack on.\n-The battles/armies are cool but seem woefully underwhelming in size. Only a few unit types to choose from for each faction also.\n-The economy leaves much to be desired.\n-No aquatic faction(more of an annoyance to me really and nothing to warn you off of the game)\n\n-Now the BIGGEST problem that plagues this game, really all of AMPLITUDES games(except dungeon probably), is the painfully stupid AI. For all the games graphical superiority it lacks just as much in the AI department. The AI is prone to doing odd things from only colonizing a few territories and spamming the same unit to never actually sailing the oceans in some cases. Once played a game were everybody but me was destroyed by roaming armies and won by default.\n\n-Diplomacy while not bare bones also suffers from AI stupidity. Really it's almost laughable how bad it can get. Endless legend has the same problem. One minute the AI is buddy buddy with me the next their out to wipe me off the map as soon as they get a small lead. Never trust the Ai.

Each faction so far that I've played: Broken Lords, Roving Clans, WoodWalkers, and Vaulters; have entirely different play styles and approaches and unique abilities respective to the faction that can make them a power house at specific victory types. Not only is each faction unique but they are incredibly balanced, I've had little trouble setting them up and even a rough start can be turned around, on easy at least.\n\nThe music and aesthetics that everyone talks about are truly top tier and absolutely gorgeous to listen to and hear. As someone  who played Civ V, I much better prefer Endless Legend simply because it is a more relaxing and comfortable enviornment. This game is 100% worth getting for those who don't mind a slow but pleasent experience.","December 5, 2015","true","92.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They actually include the player base when creating their games and they have a player created race in both endless legend and endless space.  The dev's care about the people that are going to be playing there games.\n\nThat out of the way the game:\n\nReally cool take on four x but not my favorite.  I'm not a huge fan of the combat in this game (Endless space combat would have been better imo) after it starts your troops deploy on the world map (I do like that) and then you decide if they move around and who they attack and it all pretty much auto resolves.  I've never really seen much use for tactics in the fights or felt that my decisions made a difference (thats why I don't like it much)\n\nThe fids system is back with an added i at the end. Science being non standard and customizable makes it feel more realistic and ensures that you can never play the same game twice if you don't want to. I like the one city per reigon part of the game but it really to me makes starting really important and I usually restart the game several times before I get a start I run with.  Overall the game is top notch.\n\nOne thing I was really impressed with is the number of races.  I was expecting 1 more from the original 4 in the early access but there is something like 8 races and like any good Endless game you can customize your own race.\n\nAll in all I love this game it is a lot of fun.

Each of the factions has an interesting and asymmetrical schtick. You can customize and/or upgrade your units. As you acquire more territory, you have access to minor factions which grant a passive bonus to your entire empire as well as access to a unit blueprint representing that faction.\n\nThe basics are simple— FIDSI are exactly what you'd expect. They compose with myriad other mechanics to produce an incredible level of nuance and complexity.\n\nDon't let the word "complexity" scare you off. If you play a game or two on Newbie/Easy, you have a chance to fiddle around with everything, and learn more about it. Personally, I do not enjoy complexity for its own sake. I assumed that (e.g.) customizing units was going to be tedious but necessary. It's not tedious, it's relatively simple, and I don't believe it's necessary to min/max.\n\nIf you enjoy turn-based 4X strategy, you owe it to yourself to check out this game.","April 29, 2015","true","65.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, this is not that game however thanks to all the bits that matters in building up your empire (diplomacy, marketplace, FIDSI, minor factions), it is a very good and exciting game.\n\nLot of posts describe that combat is lacking real control and becomes auto combat very soon. I agree with that. I have faith in the developers: considering the great ideas, I hope they will think about combat enhancements.\n\nI do not have the guardians DLC, yet, so I cannot comment on that. Also that could bring some improvements in combat as well.\n\nAnyone knows how to setup - is it possible at all - to have few areas to conquer and have small number of cities all over the map? Sorry to bring up HoMM4 again, but I really liked that I was not forced to either eleminate other players or rush with settlers and found new city as fast as possible.\n\nIn my recent gameplay I have 2 screens list of cities which is overwhelming and really tough to manage. That way it also looses to fun factor.\n\nI'm definitely going to buy the new DLC, recommending this game to everyone: very good price-joy balance. :)\n\nEdit:\nOne more thing to add regarding researches. They are kind of mess. They do not provide the feel of being tactical. Researching 9 in Era I... Next... Next... Done. I would separate the army units, buildings and enhancements. Units and buildings should be easy and fast to get while enahncements should be a long term goal to get (e.g.: buying plan with resources, reach specific places for plan, etc.).

I've been playing 4x games since I was old enough to load the original Sid Meier's Civilaization. Countless hours of my life went into both the Fall from Heaven 2 Civ 4 mod and following that, Fallen Enchantress. Then I picked up this game and never went back. This is Fantasy/Sci-fi 4x done right.\n\nThe pre-built factions are each unique enough that you really do have to learn new styles of play with each one. It kind of reminds me of Starcraft in that respect. You have your classic Civ-type cities and armies; then you additionally have Fallen Enchantress-like hero units, quests, spells, and a "zoom into the battlefield". The quest lines are really well fleshed out and at the same time it's possible to play without putting focus on the quests (though it can be pretty fun to get that awesome weapon artifact for your main hero).\n\nAs someone who doesn't necessarily like war in 4x games and instead chooses to build trade empires of doom, I've been incredibly happy with my options. There are plenty of ways to play and win without trying for conquest, and the use of tiles and leveling for city building adds a nice touch, allowing me to partially indulge in my huge love of city-builder games as well.","August 30, 2015","true","258.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, despite me saying it's Civilization 5-like, it is only similiar to the Civ games at the very base. This game is far more complex, with far more to do and to explore, and so on and on. But, even though it is not very similar to Civ 5, I still highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed those games, and hungered for something more demanding, as I had. This game, is prisitne. It is perfect. It is all I could possibly ask for in a game, and even though my profile says I've not put in a lot of hours into the game, I've probably put in several thousand offline hours. This game has a massive replayability factor, with completely randomly generated worlds, and many different ways for each faction to win the game. All the factions are very different from one another, and suit a different playstyle. However, they do not fit into a standard rock-paper-scissors format, as many other games do. Endless Legend excpects the player to work hard for victory, and it will push and shove you at every possible moment. This game is perfect.\n\nGame with DLC review: Me and this games DLC have a love-hate relationship. Basically, some of the DLC are things that should either be in the base game, or free updates, such as the DLC that adds more minor faction missions. However, it does add even more to the game, with which I am always happpy. The Guardians and Shadows DLC are very good, and you should definetly get them. They add new units, quests, mechanics, music e.t.c, and the Shadows DLC even adds a new faction that is actually VERY fun to play as. Overall, if you have some cash to spend, I highly recommend getting all the DLC. In the long run, it makes the game a lot more fun.","February 27","true","40.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have never played a turn-based game before this game certainly not for you.\n\nI started playing this game when I gifted a copy to friend.  Playing with another person against the A.I and each other is enjoyable it gets you away from the very predictable A.I. playing solo.\n\nBig thumbs up! on the artwork in this game.  Every race or faction has their own individual feel to them, the attention to detail and the little nuances that each unit has is rarely seen in games period and this is a good one.  The digital artists spent some time and the matte painting is superb.\n\nThe UI or user interface is fast, fluid and makes the game a joy to play.  The UI has a modern feel to it and it really helps the player navigate through all the micomanagement that is needed in this game.  In late game when you have a large empire you can easily manage your entire empire from just the dropdown city screen, fantastic.\n\nThe animation in the combat is also very good.  The characters, heroes, and the units each have their own way to surprize you.  The sound fx are very good and well timed.\n\nThe weapon assets are fantastic.  I enjoy the difference between the Iron, Titanium, Adamantium and Palladium metal weapons.  Each tier of metals weapons really change the way the units and heroes look and their animation in the combat system.\n\nThe combat system is actually also very good.  There is a learning curve but once you understand that you do have full control over all of your units, you will have fun with this game.\n\nThe FIDSI or food, industry, science, influence is the heart of this game.  This game is about diplomacy and empire management.  Your descisions are critical on the outcome of your empire.  Store some food for winter or you will starve.\n\nThe quests are plentiful and easy enough to accomplish.  The grammer in the writing for the quests and the details about them need a little work, but they are other wise fun and they keep you exploring.\n\nWhat I like best is the low-poly artwork for the units and for the map itself.  The low-poly keeps the game low file size and fast moving.  You have an option in the video options to change the quality to\n"fantastic" Whoa I just figured this out today after 200 hours in game, man now I have to play more map looks great!\n\nOverall this game is well balanced with managment and combat and one of the better turn-based games out for PC.
