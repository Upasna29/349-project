While this looks like it would be a fun game inspired by Tempest and Gyruss, I am unable to play it properly due to control issues. Keys are bound in a launcher pre-game, but the keybinding tab is the most confusing I've dealt with.\n1) The directional inputs are LeftHorz, LeftVert, RightHorz, and RIght Vert. I can figure out Left and Right, but good luck with up and down.\n2) Only some inputs can be bound to keyboard keys. Or rather all of them, can, but only if you click on it right, or only the "But" keys, or something. as I had some keys bound to keyboard, but not the direcitonals\n3) The Secondary Key column doesn't work, yet it is there. I think this may be an Engine Problem (Unity?) as I have seen this before in another game.\n4) The remaining keys are marked as But0, But1, But2 etc, but are never referenced in the game. If you aren't going to properly label the keys like this is some emulator, at least reference the button names SOMEWHERE in teh game. Have fun playing "Guess the key" in the launcher while opening and reopening the game (Hint: The first six buttons don't shoot)\n5) Keyboard bindings are possible as I have seen a Youtube video of the PC port being played and on the bottom of the screen, the game shows the controls, yet, I do not see it in mine. Perhaps it may be a resolution issue as I use the highest resolution (which is a problem in some games I play).\n\nI really want to give this game and honest chance and from what i've seen, I would probably love the core gameplay. But the controls issue is inexcusable, X-input (Xbox 360) pad support was added AFTER release (Mind you, Me and many other people had to get an X-Input controller just to play many Console Ports released on Steam), and reportedly, there are issues with a late game achievement that haven't been patched as of writing (unconfirmed).\n\nI feel scammed for my purchased, though if the game is improved in time, I may be able to re-review it in the future.","October 19, 2014","false","0.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshi_a/recommended/303880/","tenshi_a","tenshi_a","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshi_a/","2012 products in account","Very sad. As you might gather from the trailer / screenshots for this game, it's a Tempest type game. You control a little shooty thing that sits on the rim of a surface, enemies come towards you, and you shoot them. You can also jump, should the enemies get to the rim. There's also a beam laser, which is good for shooting tougher enemies.\n\nI started up the game... picked up my trusty 360 joypad... and started. Now, it's obvious what you do to move left and right, and there's a button that makes you jump, but the fire button? None of the buttons I tried would fire.\n\n"Perhaps it is a Space Giraffe variant?" I thought, and allowed the enemies to get to the rim, then tried shoving them. That makes you die. So, no, that wasn't it. :P\n\nThere was a menu for mapping controls in the game launcher, so I had a look, and all buttons appeared to be mapped. I ended up looking it up on the internet - and I will write it here for you in case you are similarly stuck - you need to hold down the "A" button. Pushing it and releasing it does nothing. I don't know why there is this delay. If anything, the game may as well have constant autofire, because there is never a point that it becomes useful to take your thumb off that button.\n\nSo I went into the game again, and had a go. This game is deathly boring. The game would be considerably improved if the first 27 levels did not exist, because it seems pretty much impossible to lose, and you just sit through them thinking "ok, when does the challenge begin?". If there had been one level to introduce each type of enemy up until that point, the pace would have been much better.\n\nLater on, it becomes a bit easier to die, but a lot of the time it is purely because there are some extremely wide levels, and the camera point for the game is a little too close to the player, so it is easy to run into an enemy on the rim just because you were not aware they were there, and you would have jumped over them if only you knew they were there.\n\nI carried on - because I don't like to deliberately get killed off; I would carry on with my single credit - and ended up dying on level 67, still quite bored, attaining #6 on the high score boards, which is quite embarrassing, really.\n\nAlso, it appears that some of the achievements are gltched. Despite getting 9 lives quite early on, it didn't award me the achievement until about the 3rd time I'd had 9 lives, and there are locked achievements for getting to level 25, and level 50, which I suppose I should have received.\n\nLast of all, it seems like the only way to exit the game is to press Alt+F4, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo - if you are a fan of this type of game, only get this game if you are really, really desperate. Get yourself a copy of TxK, or Tempest 2000, or some other version of Tempest. Even Pandora's Box on the C64, or Beamrider on the Atari 2600 - anything Tempest~ish you've never tried, before you resort to this.","January 29, 2015","false","1.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

I think it's best to compare it to Tempest as well. TxK was recently released and is way more interesting than this game. Made it to level 45 in my first playthrough and I'm pretty sure I died because I got bored with endless waves of more of the same enemies. Not my cup of tea.\n\nControl-wise this game isn't as bad as some in the reviews have you believe, but that's not enough to make it interesting.\n\nAlso, I didn't get the "Level 25" achievement, even though I made it to level 45.

Can get hard once you're at level 40+, but savepoints every 25 levels make it approachable. For four dollars, you can't go wrong. Only issues I've got is a sticky ctrl button, which doesn't allow me to use the beam. This happens every now and again and is remedied by pressing the other ctrl button. The other issue is that I can't find a proper way to quit the game. Alt-Tab > close works though.","July 3, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But this is a ‘retro’ game, so that’s how it’s supposed to be. The distortion transition effect and backgrounds look cool. The game is presented pretty well for what it is.\n\nYou control a triangle. You use the mouse to roll it around and shoot enemy objects. You can shoot a big beam which is cool.\n\nControlling your triangle can be difficult with the mouse. I found that it over rolled or just didn’t move when I thought I’d moved the mouse enough to put it where I want. I think the terrain is supposed to affect your movement as well which didn’t help. You don’t seem to be able to use the keyboard which kind of doesn’t make sense to me considering that it’s a retro game. I forgot that I could avoid hostile objects by jumping over them using space bar so I didn’t make it that far.\n\nIt’s an arcade game and so far it seems to be a competent one at that. It would be nice if they fixed up the controls a bit. It is $3.99 on steam which I would say is probably not too bad a price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 1, 2014","true","0.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

The baddies on the "web" are different enough flat-shaded polyhedral objects that Triblaster isn't much more than a poor copy with a bonus stage somewhat reminiscent of the final boss of the levels in the early flat-shaded arcade polygon game I-Robot.\n\nSound assets are lacking in a major way, but not missing, as far as I can tell. They sound pretty bad. The game has an attract mode which plays the game, which is a nice feature.\n\nLike the robot voice says when you fail to grab enough polygons during the bonus stages for a 1up, "hah hah hah"\n\n(You'll have that much fun when you play this game for kicks and giggles or if you have insomnia and a few minutes to waste between bedtime and sleeping supplement activation time.)\n\nOverall, I'll recommend this game with a 4/7 (57%), but if you're a millenial or another type without a love of similar Tempest-derivatives, you probably would rate it 2-3/7.\n\nBuy it on sale if you like the screenshots and the gameplay video.\n\nReview will surely change if Triblaster is pulled out of the back room in its unfinished state and given some replay value.","August 1, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, this game isn’t as bad or terrible as people say but I can understand where everyone is coming from.\nFirstly, before I tell you what positives and negatives I found within the game and my thoughts I want you to know I played this 100% with the mouse to move and shoot, spacebar to jump and control to laser beam.\nNow that you know my control scheme you can understand where I am coming from in this review, this is because I imagine playing with a joystick or controller or any other method would be vastly different.\n\nThe Positives:\n\n♦ Arcade style retro graphics (I’ve always loved these)\n♦ Awesome Game Concept (Shoot destroy survive)\n♦ Shooting sound is good\n♦ Good number of levels\n♦ Game only Highscores\n♦ Challenging\n♦ Great number of arenas\n♦ Random Cat Achievement (No idea how I got it, but it’s a comical addition)\n\nThe Negatives:\n\n♦ Once you get into the game and start playing there is no ingame music (This is lame as all you can hear over and over again is you either shooting, destroying enemies, dying or collecting health/laser beam, which isn’t the best sound. Music would have spruced it up)\n♦ Only way to view Highscores is when you first open the game or when you die (Really lame as you can’t scroll through them, view friends Highscores etc)\n♦ Control setup aka mapping seems dodgy (Seem to be able to map way more keys than needed to play the game for some reason)\n♦ Playing with a mouse sometimes seemed to lag for me when moving\n♦ Using two monitors the mouse would end up on the second screen a lot (This is bad as it would pause the game and you’d have to re-open it. Also annoying when at a Rechargzorb stage as it’d cause you to miss the triangles needed)\n♦ Seemed to me as though rechargzorb or whatever it was called sometimes threw the orbs off target\n♦ After a while it can seemingly get really really slow and repetitive (This happens especially around the time of level 75… where after ever level there is a rechargzorb level)\n♦ Level achievements don’t unlock properly even though you got there (Achievement for reaching level 25, 50, 75, 100 etc. Mine only unlocked upon verifying game files and they unlocked in the wrong order)\n♦ No save menu (If you are going to play it you must do 25 levels at a time or else you have to start from the previous 25. This is okay early on but later it just gets annoying)\n♦ No Quit on the main menu to get back to desktop (Must either alt+tab and right click close, put it in window mode and close or alt+f4)\n\nThings the game could have included:\n\n♦ Unlockable Endless Mode with choosable arena (Where you just keep playing the same level versing more and more units as time goes on until you die. This would be good soo you didn’t have to do the main levels over and over again with rechargezorb rounds after each round)\n♦ Timed weapon upgrades (This would add another thing to make the game that little less repetitive)\n♦ Ingame background retro music (Some really awesome retro background music would have made the world of difference!)\n♦ Steam Trading Cards (Would have made for some pretty awesome cards, badges, backgrounds and emoticons)\n\nOverall, even though I list quite a few negatives, I believe the main aim of the developers and publishers here was to recreate a look and feel as though you are actually on a retro arcade machine which I can say they have done really well. However, they need to also keep in mind this is the PC era and that they are releasing it for people with PC’s. Therefore, in my eyes the developers/publishers needed to think outside the box and think what can we do to make it have some of the qualities people love about PC gaming but still give it that Retro Arcade Machine look and feel? This I don’t think they have fully captured (No fully viewable/scrollable highscores, no ingame music, laggy controls, dodgy control mapping and no endless mode etc, to name a few things). Although, on a whole, if you ever played a retro arcade machine game like space invaders etc and want to relive one on your PC then I’d recommend this. Plus it’s a small price of $4 to pay to be able to essentially relive the retro arcade machine days. However, if you do end up buying this, don’t expect much outside of the basic retro arcade machine and be prepared for the game to get really repetitive really quick.\n\nPS: I don’t own a joystick, so I can’t confirm if it works, but this game would best be suited to be played with joystick in my opinion.","January 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
