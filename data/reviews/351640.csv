This game is FREE.\n\nIf that, plus the extremely high ratings from the reviewers isn't enough to convince you to try it, I'll just add my review as well. I suck at reviews so I don't write them often, but some games just deserve my recognition.\n\nTo begin with, it is worth mentioning that this game was built with RPG Maker, such as multiple other games released on Steam (and which accidentally, are overpriced and atrocious in the majority).\nWell, don't let that mislead you - Eternal Senia is in NO WAY even close to being considered a bad game.\n\nHere are the reasons:\n\n1. The combat system.\nNo, it's not using the usual boring turned-based combat system from RPG Maker. Yesss.\nInstead, the developer designed his very own ARPG battle system, which means that the combat happens on-screen, directly on the map as you encounter enemies. No button mashing either. You just walk into an enemy to fight it.\n\n"But wait, doesn't that get very boring very quickly?"\n\nNope. The developer didn't forget to add diversity to the combat system either. Firstly, different enemies you encounter will have different combat skills. Secondly, YOU will unlock skills as well. The combination of perfectly balanced skills and enemy difficulty makes this game's combat system extremely appealing and fluent.\n\n2. The story.\nDid any of you ever play a game which, although being fairly short, took you on a ride on a wave of emotions? Because this is an approximately accurate description of this game's story.\n\nI won't be lingering on talking about the story - after all, I'm not here to spoil anything.\nAll I'll say for now is that the game has a total of 3 endings, all very slightly different. However, remain reassured that luckily, all three endings will not require you to replay the entire game; saving the game when prompted is recommended if you want to go back and get all the other endings (which I HIGHLY recommend, by the way).\n\nThe only thing which may turn off a few of you grammar nazs is the fact that some words may be spelled incorrectly, and some grammar mistakes can be found in the text. But give the developer a break here - this is translated, you should be happy that you can have it in English language at all, right? Besides, it's not God-awfully bad, in fact it barely even annoyed me, a grammar freak.\n\nOverall?\nWait, you're still reading? You probably would have had the time to download the game already.\nSeriously though, give it a try. Come on! It's free for fu... For the love of video games. What have you got to lose except a few minutes, which is what you've just wasted reading my longer-than-was-supposed-to-be review.\n\nTL;DR: Definitely worth playing. And IT'S FU... It's FREE dammit.\nWhat have you got to lose, right?","July 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 754 of 795 people (95%) found this review helpful 230 people found this review funny","95","754","795","230","38"

They also just stand there. It would be great if they worked like mini-bosses or something\n- A little bit of Engrish here and there, but who cares\n- Occasional small bugs (barely even worth mentioning, but still)\n\nOverall, I think there's really no reason not to try this game out.

This story may very well draw you in from the start, as it did me I couldnt help but keep going to find out what will happen.\n\nThe combat for this game is a fairly standard for those who have played a lot of RPG Maker games and is much easier than most games not saying that thats a bad thing though. The battles can all be  won using strategy rather than sheer force, some grinding may be needed.\n\nFor the most part if you keep your wits about you, you will get through with no real trouble. However grinding can be very worth it, there is huge amounts of loot which can be crafted to make the game more enjoyable.\n\nLength wise Eternal Senia is not the longest RPG Maker games I have come across, but it doesn't need to be it tells its story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out so though some will be disappointed at its short length it is for the best.\n\nAs for replayability, the game has 3 endings These do not require the game to be replayed from the start, as you can just save before the final boss and change your accessories before the fight each time.\n\nThese accessory combinations will provide the various endings of the game. Having said that I replayed the game from the start each time as I found that more rewarding.\n\nOverall Eternal Senia is beautifully written piece of work it has an Interesting Storyline; It is visually appealing, the characters are interesting, a simplistic and fluid combat system, and  3 diferent endings which make those replays worth it.\n\nI'll leave you with this, I have replayed this game so many times, it is perhaps one of the best  RPG Maker games Ive played in a little while and given how much time Ive sunken into it I guess thats sort of evident huh?\n\nEternal Senia is just that good of a game and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free, if thats not a good reason to check it out I dont know what is....so why not give it a try.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","May 18","true","229.6"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

It has really nice menu, nice grephics, nice art, nice music, and of course, nice story.\nThe story revolves around on Seina, who’s searching for her sister, Magaleta, in the deep Tower of Eternity. The story progresses as Seina became stronger with a companion a forest fairy. The game itself is pretty simple, you grind, boss fight then move to the next stage. It doesn’t matter if you want to finish the game early or late, as long as you didn’t trigger the event, it won’t move to any more stages which is good, because you can actually overpower the bosses and finish the game easily. But that’d be a really long way to play the game.\n\nSo, judging from the graphic. The art are good, especially the CGs. It’s so awesome as hell. Did the dev illustrate it by himself? I dunno, it looks awesome, really. Except for the characters sprites, the pixelated one. The monster, forest and especially the last stage are beautifully crafted. The sprites are really good. Monsters too, even some got from packs, I think. The character sprites look off because it felt a bit too tall. But I don’t really care about that. Every interface that this game shows is amazing. A plus point for the last stage too. It’s awesome as hell.\n\nNext, sounds and music. I think the sounds got from some packs. I don't know. Maybe the dev also create some by himself. But it’s actually really good. The sounds are not off from the expectations of things. It’s not weird, not too exaggerating too. The music is fairly simple, the several seconds loop from the main menu is actually fits some of the scenes. There are also some piano solo thingy which is pretty nice. I hope I can download the soundtrack though. I’d pay for that.\n\nStory. I don’t want to feel this again, man. The story is amazing! It has everything you would expect. First, you know nothing. As you defeat the bosses, you know a thing. At the end of the game, you know everything. Even though there’s one character that you never ever see in-game, but in the end, you don’t want to lose that character. I got all the endings and I want to shed my tears. The game is just too beautiful and … I don’t want to spoil anything so play this game. Seriously!\nThat concludes my feelings for this game. I rate it 9/11 420 666 satan blaze it. Play this game.

Spoilers aren't good, especially for a story driven game like this.\n\nNow for the review....\n\nA simple (A)RPG anime game.\n\nGame's made in RPG Maker, and there's a real work for the story and the gameplay. Note that this game does NOT support Steam Cloud, Achievements and Trading Cards. Be careful with your save games.\n\nAs commonly found in RPG, there's a skill system where you allocate points to make the character stronger as you beating the game and level up. You can also craft the equipments with materials found from dead monsters/chests. The battle doesn't take away you from main screen, but instead you'll be fighting enemies in the same screen without transition. Consider this as Devil May Cry in 2D sprites.\n\nThere's literally zero effort in progressing, though, as the game even allows you to utilize easy mode during 'hard' boss battles. As it stands, the main appeal of the game is the story and I agree, the story is that good despite of it being a simple theme - the girl who's looking for sister.\n\nThere are multiple endings, not difficult to find as the game even hints you how to get them. Make sure you save often on a different save slots.\n\nAnd I'm surprised this comes with free price tag. So, if you have the slightest interest in Japanese anime-based game, this game's worth trying for.\n\nLooking forward to playing the sequel - developer said it is coming.\n\nPS: The OSTs etc are located in: D:\games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Eternal Senia\Audio (depending on where you install the game). The audio is quite well composed.\n\n8/10 solid game.","June 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","3"

Intuitive, easy-to-learn, and fast-paced battle system, custom-designed within RPG Maker by the developer.  Extra easy and hard difficulties are available to allow players to experience the story easily and to challenge players, as well as some optional sidequests.  Great selection of music -- drawn from royalty-free sources, I think, but that doesn't make it any less good of a selection, and the music is quite memorable.  Beautiful character art and well-designed environments.\n\nAnd best of all, a well-written emotionally intense story.\n\nHighly recommended.  There are a few typos, but they don't detract from the quality of the storytelling.  And the game is free anyway.  But it's so good that I'd be willing to pay for it.  It even includes developer commentary that is accessible after finishing the game.\n\nA beautiful game all around.\n\n(Disclosure: I got this game for free on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/recommended/351640/","HuuIsHuu","huu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/","177 products in account","Seeing as my interest in RPGs has gone up recently, thanks to the Hyperdimension Neptunia games, as soon as I saw a free ARPG game with an anime artstyle, I was ready to tackle anything this game was willing to throw at me.\n\nAnd alas, I don't think I was very disappointed.\n\nNow, as always, my reviews are spoiler-free when it comes to reviewing single player games, so don't worry about having the story spoiled. I'm just gonna give my general thoughts.\n\nThe Story (no spoilers!)Personally, I think the story could've been paced better.\nIn my opinion, it moves way too fast with things, introduces new characters and gets rid of them along the line with no idea as to where they've gone.\nBut as for the story itself? Well, it really is nothing new, but it works surprisingly well. The story is, without a doubt, sad and can invoke a bit of emotion into you.\n\nThe CharactersIn terms of characters, well...I can't really comment. Character development does exist in this game, yes, but as for the characters themselves, I don't know, we only have a handful of characters in this game, most of them being rather similar to one another. The characters weren't exactly too interesting to begin with, but again - the development throughout the story is nice, so it gets some points there.\n\nThe GameplayEternal Senia has really simple gameplay. WASD to move and a bunch of hotkeys for the specific menus and skills. How do you attack? You basically charge into the enemy and Senia will automatically attack, whilist receiving damage herself. First time users might get confused at the controls at first, but about 15 minutes in, you should get the hang of it. As for Senia's movement, it's decent, but a little bit slippery. Granted, there were a few instances where I accidentally walked into a different room without my intention to, but those moments were few and far inbetween. Throughout the game (and by that, I mean a grand total of 3 times), you will encounter "special NPCs", who will basically give you a certain task to kill a set no. of enemies or collect all the chests, etc., and once you do, they give you an item. The items they give, however, are mostly useless and you can play without them, so kinda makes me wonder what was the point of bringing them in anyway. The crafting system in this game is really simplistic and really easy to use, so just about anyone can have a basic understanding of how it works. Upon defeating enemies, Senia not only gains exp. for leveling up, but also gets SP, where it can be used to upgrade your special attacks, which are implemented very nicely.\nSo, overall, Eternal Senia's gameplay is good. Controls are a little bit confusing at first and slippery, but it really won't take you long to get used to it all.\n\nThe PresentationLet me get this out of the way - I LOVE the artstyle of Eternal Senia. From the 16-bit inspired graphics to all the character drawings, everything looks really nice in this game, including all the enemies and what not, but I feel that there's a little bit too much Christianity in this game. As for the music, it's good. The soundtrack, while nothing noteworthy, fits the game's atmosphere rather well and the songs themselves are a really joy to listen to, but I really wouldn't listen to it outside the game.\nNow, as for optimisation...well, it could use work. This game has really bad full screen support, so I ended up just playing the game in windowed mode, and the game seems to freeze my entire computer for about 30 seconds upon booting up. That really needs to be fixed. And another thing - Steam Overlay does not work with this game for me for some reason. But other than that, the game runs and closes just fine.\n\nFinal VerdictEternal Senia, as a free-to-play single player ARPG is a really good game. A nicely written, but badly paced story, decent gameplay, great visuals and a not bad soundtrack, I feel like this game should be worth at least $1. I would not have minded if this was a game you had to pay like $1 to play, but it's free, so that makes it even better.\n\nThe story mode itself shouldn't take you more than 3-5 hours to beat, so if you're looking for a decent f2p single player game, try Eternal Senia out, though be wary of the compatibility issues.\n\nEternal Senia gets a score of:6.6/10.0\nFor a free game, it's good. Though the badly paced story, uninteresting characters and some compatibility issues draw this game back from receiving a higher score.","July 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise.\n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes.\n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find.\nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty.\n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up.

So Senia resolves to fight her way through the tower to get her sister back"\nPack your water wings, your eyes are going for a swim\n\nWith simple controls, an endearing storyline, glorious music, and the best boomerang fairy in existence, Eternal Senia is a great play for all four hours.\n\nCombat is simple, walk into an enemy to attack them, and they attack simultaneously. Eventually Senia learns some skills, which can be used with a simple button press. But just because it's simple, doesn't mean it's boring. A variety of enemies from evil plants to fallen angels are ready to take Senia on with lasers, lightning, and some really sharp leaves. Boss combat gets even more interesting, and while a few principles stay the same for each of them, they are far from being identical.\n\nThe music Is wonderfully crafted to evoke just the right emotions, everything from the tranquillity of a rainy summer night, to the dark feeling of a demonic cave. It loops very well, keeping the ears entertained. The rest of the sound effects beautifully represent the actions taking place as well. None of the effects draw you out of the experience, as RPG maker games often do.\n\nThe art is well designed, flowing between the game field pixel art, dialogue portraits, and the occasional full art piece flawlessly.\n\nThe story is beautiful, and while some may be unsatisfied with the endings, I feel they were done tremendously well. Yes, I did say  endings. Three of them, to be exact. Don't worry about your actions suddenly having unintended consequences, you'll be warned when it's coming, and are provided with plenty of times to back up your save. Which also means that you don't have to replay the entire game to see all of them.\n\nA few notes for those who wish to be prepared for the negatives:\n\nThis is made in RPG Maker, but it is done very well. However, the limitations of the system can show themselves occasionally.\nBe wary of using your "dash" skill to go through doorways, cutscenes can break easily.\nIf you want to change the control setup, press f1, though you'll need to do some fiddling to get it right.\nIf using a controller, I suggest clearing out the default controller controls and mapping your own using JoyToKey or something similar.\nIf this reminds you of Ragnarok Online, that's completely intentional. No stolen artwork here.\nFOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY RECONSIDER DOING THE FINAL BOSS ON HARD MODE the "onward!" selection is normal difficulty when preparing for a boss.\nWell, that's all I've got, may Eternity be forever in your favour!","November 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","21","23","7","0"

People must know about this!\n\nI don't know if the Ragnarok references in this game were intentional or mere coincidence (which I doubt) but the moment I saw High Priest Magaleta, I knew I'm gonna love this. It was basically the reason why I got addicted.\n\nThe game starts off really slow. It comes off as a generic RPG made with VX Ace. The story doesn't begin until the player has gone through the basic controls. Honestly, I was bored to death in the beginning but it didn't take long until the game picked up. There's more to the game than just playing it and I'd like to mention a few. First and foremost would be the nicely written story. It has a lot of emotions in it and it was constructed well to go with the game's mapping design, before you know it, you'd be sucked into the fantasy setting of the game, which is something that modern RPGs lack. The art style is worth complimenting as well as it is amazing. From the menu CG, to the character sprites, to the game objects. The characters have their distinct personalities that amplifies the fun. There's the ever-so-stubborn protagonist, Senia; the composed and caring "big sister" figure, Magaleta (best girl, by the way); the not-so-annoying fairy guide unlike other RPGs; and a few more.\n\nI might've spoiled myself of the ending by reading other reviews but I tried not to read too much. From what I've seen, it looks like I'm going to love the game even more when I actually finish it!\n\nOverall, the game is really fun and entertaining. On one hand, I'm really grateful that this game is free so that I can actually play it (because I'm poor), but on the other hand, I feel that the game is too good to be free. The developers definitely deserve to get profit off of making such a great game. I give it 10 gold stars.","July 5, 2015","true","16.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Although simple in presentation, this game exemplifies how the ARPG genre should be through innovative changes to classic mechanics and a strong focus on story and ambiance.\n\nThe graphical style and user input are sure to inspire feelings of nostalgia for gamers over 30. A throw back to a time when fundamental game play mattered more than death counters or clicks per second, Eternal Senia is a fresh new experience that anyone looking for a little bit of relaxing fun at any age should be able to pick up and enjoy.\n\nThis game has:\nimmersive atmospheric effects and high quality background music\nreplayability due to sections of randomly generated content and multiple endings\nside quests for collectables and optional boss monstersGame developer and publisher Holy Priest has delivered a gift in the form of Eternal Senia, completely free of charge, back to the game-playing community that embraced him many years ago within Ragnarok Online. I have no doubt that others who take the time to experience this labor of love will be similarly motivated by his inspirational work.\n\nIn the end, the game is shorter than I would like. I also would have preferred more graphics options including native support for 16:9 displays and the ability to play in a windowed fullscreen mode, however these are minor technical points compared to the positive aspects of the game. For what is essentially a hobbyist project, Eternal Senia is an unqualified success worth taking note of.\n\n9/10","June 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As a free ARPG made through the RPG Maker, I really did not have high expectations and downloaded it mainly due to the “Overwhelmingly Positive” response by the community.\nAs such the game sat months in my Steam Library before today I finally thought “Man, would I love to play through a quick Adventure.” – and man did I get that.\n\nTo start off, you’re playing as Senia. A slightly 2-Dimensional character, who at first glance doesn’t care about anything other than saving her “sister” Magaleta” who went into the “Tower of Eternity” for reasons unknown at the start of the game. The first ten minutes you’re fighting through a couple of trashmobs and get introduced to the games mechanics. Most notably the combat mechanics, which I’ll talk about in a bit.\n\nEssentially the game is divided in three separate parts outside of the tutorial. Each of them is basically one big dungeon with 2-3 Cutscene’s, which is also the only time in which you’ll find any dialogue, exposition or character development, as there are barely any characters besides Senia and Magaleta, but every one follows the same structure.\nWhat I mean by that is, that you have your dungeon, with your fair share of enemies, which after the first dungeon do not pose any threat whatsoever, if you’re somewhat decently equipped, but each dungeon has an “Arcane” version as well, in which you simply go through around 10 rooms, grinding again for crafting material. Which you’ll do, since the Upgrades are quite important, especially if you’re attempting the Hard-Modes of each of the three bosses.\n\nEach of the 3 dungeons introduces a minor gimmick, which however isn’t really enough to set them apart and thus the gameplay can become quite stale if you’re not used to “grindy” games like other games from the ARPG-Genre.\nAlso at the end of each dungeon you’ll find 3 NPC’s who award you with special and sometimes important items for essentially 100% completing each segment. It’s a neat little bonus which you’ll most likely be going for anyway if you’re even interested in maxing out your Equipment before shooting for the next dungeon.\n\nThe game does have a really simplistic crafting system, which you’ll have to use, since there aren’t any drops from the enemies you defeat. Additionally you only have 1 Set of Armor and Weapons for each dungeon. As such you’ll be playing as a Swordsman and only as a Swordsman, which can get quite boring, adding to the stale combat system and the grind for equipment.\n\nThe combat system being quite simple: Through the game you unlock 4 special attacks which use Mana-Points and any other attack is done by simple bumping into enemies – quite like the first YS game. Having completed the game 100% (every challenge) and every Boss on Hard Mode, I did only actively use the first 2 Special Attacks and the 3. as an activator for some of the puzzles and even the second one only for Groups of enemies. As such only a single skill was somewhat important for any of the boss fights.\n\nSpeaking of which, the boss-fights are quite challenging, though basically share many attack patterns with one another, which can more or less be blamed on the game being made with RPG-Maker. Nonetheless all were fun to play through and each one had just enough innovation over the last one to keep the fight somewhat new and exciting.\nThe last thing I do want to talk about, since it somewhat surprised me – is the conclusion of the game. Like I mentioned earlier: the characters are quite 2-Dimensional, not only do we exclusively hear about Senia only caring about Magaleta, but also only learn about a tiny part of her backstory. On the other hand, Magaleta’s only exposition is during the finale of the game. The story very much falls apart by not explaining the concept of the “Eternity” Senia is plagued with throughout the game and we also do not learn about any of the few other characters we do encounter.\nSo that begs the question, if the story, lacking so much detail is good enough to justify a playthrough, especially if any given person isn’t that much used to ARPG’s?\n\nI’d argue yes. For a number of reasons: The most important being, that the story heavily relies on the conclusion, which is filled to the brim with emotional and somewhat manipulative dialogue and great exposition about the true feelings of both Magaleta and Senia. Each of the endings is smartly designed, the first one basically asking the player the question: “Did you pay attention to the dialogue, we DID present to you?” – which for me was a great feeling to then see this detail playing a role in the finale.\nI’ll obviously not spoil any of the endings, but just say that it reminded me a bit of the Key-Visual Novels, especially planetarian in terms of writing style.\n\nIn conclusion, I’m not sure if I’d recommend Eternal Senia solely for the ending and I do have to say “for the ending”, since I can’t recommend the story in its entirety. What I can do whoever is recommend Eternal Senia for the great conclusion, the ability to make the player bond with characters he/she barely gets to know over the course of just a couple of hours, I can recommend it for the surprisingly good Soundtrack, throughout the entire game and lastly for making the albeit negative grind a very rewarding experience, once you finally finish any of the dungeons and finally get to face one of the bosses.\n\n\nTL;DR\n+ Fluent difficulty (Easy Mode / Hard Mode)\n+ Rewards Completionism\n+ Great ending (The entire last dungeon)\n+ Good Soundtrack\n+ Solid length\n+ Great art\n+ It’s free\n\n\n+/- Very grind-heavy\n\n- Not enough character development\n- Senia’s exposition can get a bit repetitive\n- Lackluster in detail (Eternity / Sidecharacters)\n- Overworld “Boss” Monster completely lacking AI - why not make the Gems they drop a reward from the Arcane Dungeons?\n\n\nKeep in mind that my critique of the story is quite subjective, as one could argue, that the story doesn’t need to flesh out those details to get its point across – and I’d agree with that, although presenting me with those elements and then just “forgetting” about them (e.g. the game completely forgets about Senia’ sidekick during post-finale) did seem a bit silly to me. However none of it is a reason not to give Eternal Senia try.","March 22","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So if you like games like those, play this.\n\nIt's a pretty emotional game and it leaves you wanting more. I hope the creator makes more games like this one, because wow this is really good. 10/10","August 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Its simple to control (you walk up to enemies and touch them to attack them, and the enemy counters), QWER do special skills which you learn bit by bit and thats pretty much it.\n\nWith 3 to 4 hrs of playtime and 3 endings there is some good mileage from this game, and since its F2P, even better.\nthe music for the Dungeons is atmospheric and high Quality, I feel like I know the music from some scenes somewhere, but cant really point my finger on it\n\nas much as I liked the game, there is a few things that nag me a bit\n\nfirst of all - typos and Grammar. I know the guy who made this is chinese and english isnt his native language, but somethimes it just flings you out ofthe experience\nsecondly - two of the secrets in the second area are just counterntuitive. One uses the ability of a monster against a certain object, which is done once and only once, and the second one interacts with an object that has come up various times in the game already, but never gave any response.\nAs third - Due to the way the game operates, Battles are mostly luch based. Unlike in for example Ys you cant outkite the enemies, sneak a hit here and there and never take a hit yourself. But when you get good equip on the current floor, you're normally pretty well off.\n\nAnd something about balancing - the minute you can breeze through the Sanctum on every floor, you are set for Life, since (especially after the 1st floor) you can exchange one Elite Crystal for 5 of each material and 2 Elite Crystals are guaranteed to drop each run (Mid Boss and End boss) farming for materials is pretty much done there.\nAlso why the things in the 2nd ending happened is a bit beyond me, but whatever, I guess.\n\nAll in all, try the game out. Its good.\n\nPS:Is it just me or does Senias design really borrow a lot from Ragnarok Onlines Swordman(F)?","June 25, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardevoir/recommended/351640/","guardevoir","Gardevoir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardevoir/","193 products in account","Eternal Senia is an a RPG Maker game. Before I continue this review, I best get that out of the way, so that those of you who detest the engine and it's games can move on.\n\nNow, having said that it is an RPG Maker game. I must admit, I myself was highly sceptical that this would be any good. But, the screenshots and art style drew me in and so did that ever so kind price tag of: FREE! So, onto the review.\n\nNarrative\nFirst item on the list, the narrative. Eternal Senia is a romantic tale in as many ways as it is a drama. It's a tale of the length and extent one human will go to, to save the person whom they love. It's a tale about the psychological pressure's one will experience metaphorically whilst fighting for the place in the rightful eyes of those whom they hold dear. In essence what I'm trying to say is that, the tale, whilst short and fairly simplistic. Is a good one. It kept me hooked for the duration of the game and it made me intrigued enough to continue pushing on through to find out what happens in the end. Yet the end, is a fascinating feels trip, and (depending on which ending you get) may not satisfy what you wanted all along and make you question the outcome. Something in my personal opinion, any good RPG should be aiming for. To get the player to ponder and question the outcome is a good tale indeed.\n\nCombat\nNow, from the storyline to that of the most important aspect, the combat. The combat for this game is a fairly standard affair for those of you who have played non turn-based RPG Maker games and is in fact much easier than most standard games as this was the developers intention. The battles/boss battles can all be fought and won with strategy and tactics rather than sheer force, for those of you who are less interested in grinding. Having said that, the frequency of save points, the arcane realm (an in-game arena of sorts) and the huge amount of loot drops which can be crafted make the game's grinding seamless and in many cases you will not feel it a chore to level up. I myself managed to make to the level cap by the end of the game without realising as the various collectible "side-quests" you get in each dungeon quickly increase your exp without noticing. So, for completionists, you're in luck as you're partly rewarded with this game. This all goes hand-in-hand with the developers intentions of creating a simple to play story based RPG. It should aslo be noted, that the game also makes use of key-binded "skills" gifted to the player throughout the game. These skills are used for a variety of combat situations and occasional puzzles. These skills can also be upgraded using SP (Skill Points) which are awarded to the player after killing enemies in-game. Also, throughout the game, some enemies will drop pages or even books as a loot. These pages and books can be used to award permanent boosts the player's overall skills. You will also be awarded more of these if you complete the additional "side-quests". That is all that can be said for the combat of the game. Now we move onto:\n\nLength & Replayability\nLength/Replayability. This game as you might have guessed is indeed a short one. Given that it is a free game I'm sure you could not have expected it to be particularly long. The game by itself without gathering the collectibles or killing monster kings should take you no more than 3 hours. If you're a perfectionist collecting every item and completing the "side-quests" should yield a time of 4-5 hours. If you were to present yourself a challenge and attempt the game's bosses on hard mode, you'd find yourself looking at a modest 5-6 hour timespan. As for replayability, the game has 3 ending outcomes. These do not require the game to be replayed and all you need to do is make one save before the final boss (you will be given ample warning of this in-game) and then change your accessories before the fight each time. These accessory combinations will provide the various outcomes for the game. So, there is not much in the way of replayability.\n\nNow for those who skim read, here's a pro/cons list and a TL;DR:\n\n---Pro's---\n- Interesting Storyline.\n- Simplistic, yet fluid combat system.\n- Easier combat system for casual players/RPG newcomers.\n- Acheivable and short collectible "side-quests"\n- Simplistic yet effective character customisation.\n- Upgradeble skills.\n- 3 Endings.\n\n---Con's---\n- Story is slightly cliche in places.\n- Short gameplay time.\n- Combat can become slightly repetitive.\n- Occasional RPG Maker puzzles.\n\nTL;DR: The game is good. it's free, short, and is perfect for a small yet engaging feel train with some solid, albeit repetitive combat mechanics. I would highly recommend it as it is in my personal opinion one of the best RPG Maker games on Steam at this time. I mean, you really have nothing to lose. The game is FREE!","February 21","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deisophia/recommended/351640/","deisophia","Deisophia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deisophia/","324 products in account","At first glance, this is an game incredibly easy to overlook. The art style on the store screens is nearly identical to a thousand other JRPG games out there, even the sprites in game aren't anything special to look at, not having particularly innovative designs, but it is cute, familiar and comforting to play what is familiar.\nYet this game is anything BUT familiar, because as advertised it doesn't have combat, rather you walk into monsters to "battle" them, which belies any strategy or challenge, this is reinforced through the first 10-15min of play time as you walk through a series of linear corridors to fight a boss at the end. It doesn't end at that point through, and the game only really begins to reveal it's simple yet effective mechanics, as you journey along your path. Skills, page and book upgrades, a standard level system, and a crafting system, all give your character that little bit of extra damage, health or armour in order to achieve. It in fact reveals that it is quite the opposite of the initial presumption, and has a wodnerful level of depth to it, and is only overseen by an apparently simple menu system.\nAdmittedly the area progression is rather simple (all areas have followed a set path so far, with very few puzzles in place to challenge you in opening the exit to the next area, but there is a lot of potential for interesting set pieces and challenges as the game goes on, especially as regards the "Arcane World" which becomes accessible after the first 30-40min.)\nBoss battles are where the game shines though, as these are varied and interesting, and will require varied strategies to beat, which are fun to figure out, utilising the skills and movement patterns at your disposal.\n\nThe story is unfortunately cliche, but will tug on your heartstrings in the exact same way that many other games have done before, although it's not original it does it's job well, and effectively.\nThe biggest flaw is the English localisation, incorrect grammar, and spellings occur frequently, and some odd phrases and idioms do occur, but it is luckily not too distracting, as the dialogue isn't particularly lengthy, with characters only having quick interactions back and forth.\nWhere this game does shine though, and perhaps the most astounding part of it, is in fact the soundtrack, from the opening refrain, the piano melded with a few electronic rhythms, and the occasional up tempo beats, is fantastic. Again exactly the type of composition you'd expect to hear from this sort of game, but of excellent quality and standard.\n\nEternal Senia is a shining example of what high production values, dedication on the part of the developer/s and talent can achieve in a free game.","August 16, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has really amazing story, that is making cry few times. The music always fits in situation and it sounds really beautiful. After playing first stage, there are thoughts like 'what's wrong with those fights ?'. Keep playing anyway ! The game changes pretty quickly and fights become really oryginal. What really surprised me, was actually boss fights. I really like them, the bosses aren't moving at all, but they are spawning minions and throwing spells at you so if you want to beat them in hard mode, you must keep trying and changing different strategies.\n\nWhat are you gonna like :\n- Story\n- Music\n- Arts\n- Fight system\n- Characters\n- Boss fights\n- Unique spell casting by monsters\n- Skill system\n- 'Feeling trains' - the cry is real\n\nNow what's gonna irritate you :\n- Facial expression of Fairy is always the same, it's something that really hurts the eyes.\n- Crafting system is not complicated, but it's getting booring after gathering same materials but with different names.\n- To craft better item, you have to remove it from your active equipment, upgrade it, then equip it again. That's getting annoying !\n\nFor once more : Even through some irritating stuff, this game is amazing and is worth a try !","June 23, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

So I am looking forward to anything that will come out from this developer.

It's definitely more for those who enjoy an interesting premise over AAA polish, because its shallow combat system isn't up to snuff with mainstream gaming.  Recommended only for those who enjoy the story premise, alone.\n\nThe game is basically a long corridor filled with cutscenes (including a ton of flashbacks that fill you in on the context of why you're doing all this,) about a young heroine (Senia) and her quest to save her adoptive family member (Magaleta, which was probably supposed to be "Margret".)\n\nThe gameplay is relatively weak.  This game uses an "innovative move-to-attack" system, which basically means that if you run into an enemy, you deal damage to it, and it deals damage to you.  If an enemy runs into you, you deal damage to it, and it deals damage to you.  Facing and timing don't matter, so it kind of renders moot most tactical considerations, and just renders everything a matter of ramming everything until your HP gets low, then running away until your HP regens.  There are no healing or mana potions in this game, which does make things a little more tricky, and so you rely upon the automatic regen to survive, and it doesn't work if you aren't fighting, so generally, there are two modes: go ahead and let enemies ram you, or evade until you get enough HP back to go back to the ramming.  It's just too simplistic a system for me to really enjoy, but I guess you can't expect too much from a freeware amateur game.\n\nThe story, meanwhile, has some positive points.  The game focuses upon Senia's relationship with her adoptive "big sis" Magaleta, and if you're into strong-willed female main characters, that's pretty much what this whole game is built around delivering.  It also features some well-drawn art, although most faces are just variations on what you can see in the previews.\n\nThat said, the story has some negative marks, as well: ... Senia... truly deserves the title... "Captain Ellipses"...! Seriously, nearly every line of dialogue she posseses has AT LEAST one ellipses in it, she frequently has lines that consist entirely of "..." followed by "...?" then "...!" and even the narration bursts to overflowing with excessive punctuation.  Practically the only speaking companion Senia gets, as well, is simply named "Little Fairy".  Seriously, you couldn't be bothered to give her a name? She probably has the second most lines of spoken dialogue in the game, and she's the character just referred to by generic title.  (They even gave a name to the Fairy Queen, and then they just keep calling her "Fairy Queen"...)\n\nIn general, it's a free amateur actionRPG RPG Maker game, and certainly better than most in its category, worth playing if you enjoy indie titles for the sheer flavor, but it's not going to be anyone's Secret of Mana.","August 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's not a heckuva lot of technique to it at first, but as you progress you add a handful of special attacks (a dash slash, a projectile, etc.) to your arsenal, which will come in handy against foes which put up a better fight when approached head-on - since your life and special attack points gradually regenerate the game never gets too difficult (hardly surprising, considering that's one of the creators' stated goals), but for the handful of hours it lasts things stay engaging enough to keep things moving. If you want to find everything you'll likely end up taking a second trip through, as I did, and do so with a closer eye on your surroundings to sniff out persnickety hidden stuff that seems stupidly obvious once you've noticed it.\n\nVisually, Eternal Senia makes pretty good use of both stock assets and original artwork - the three sections (four, if you count the intro) of the tower you have to climb, and the baddies dwelling within, are distinct if somewhat predictable, and the music, while not particularly hum-worthy in my opinion, does its job admirably otherwise. The story tying the whole thing together is pretty boilerplate (your adoptive sis went to the tower and hasn't come back, time to head in and find her yourself), but the small handful of characters present are generally low-key and likable, not to mention that each of the three endings, while perhaps a bit melodramatic, will still likely evoke at least a little bit of "right in the feels" from many players.\n\nAs far as weaknesses go, the translation is a bit rough (albeit never enough to obfuscate things to any major extent), leveling up your gear and skills to their peak requires some grinding (though the game is still very much beatable without doing so), the only major threats to your well-being come when you're surrounded and trapped by enemies and their area-of-effect magic spells, meaning most of your deaths (especially if you attempt to bolster the challenge by turning boss fights up to "hard") will be the result of frustrating "pinball bounces" between attacks, and while you can fast-travel around each individual area you're not allowed to return to cleared zones to complete your checklist.\n\nOther than that, I can't really fault the game for being what it is - a simple, breezy, and overall pleasant (not to mention, once again, free) little action-RPG. It isn't likely to light anyone's world on fire, but it isn't trying to, and shouldn't feel any need to. If you're ever in the mood to wander around for a bit, smack some unfriendly sprites upside the head and get strong enough for the next batch in the process, there's no reason not to spend a little time with this unassuming, but warmly genuine, production.","August 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As the description of the game says it is not complicated, making a really simple combat mechanic where you only move towards the enemy. It does not sound like something pleasant but it is. The control is fluid. However the success of this game is on the artistic part, the story and the soundtrack exactly. The soundtrack is repetitive; however, it does not annoy as the pieces are beautifu, and the story is not your classic "Hero saves the day" story. Senia and Magaleta are portrayed as real humans, with mistakes on their acts, fears, hope and sorrow.

You have NOTHING to lose playing this game as the developer has kindly made it free for everyone on steam! Fighting mechanics are very simple and easy. While sometimes I would mix up keys, the only issue I had was the fact that the final attack you learn can get jammed when you bounce back and if you lose a boss fight it can make it very annoying and obnoxious to try and save yourself if you're caught in fire.\nThe story is A LITTLE lacking, not too much. The game play was about 3 hours for me without some craft grinding but it wasn't a bad story. It didn't really have a strong impact and it's kind of straight forward without much immerson. You go to save your sister and fight through all the crap in the world to try and save her with a few flashbacks thrown in. I didn't feel very drawn into the story, I liked the fighting and art. If anything I would say that that is something that could turn people off, but I didn't dislike it either. If there was anything to improve on in follow up games for the developer, that would be the spot to improve on. Also the fairy character was useless except for the attack...that was kind of boring as I forgot about her until I saw her again in the bonus room. If there are going to be characters, have them serve a purpose. But otherwise, beautiful graphics, you can tell the work of one person was put into this for night and day and well worth it. I will be looking forward to a sequel with hopefully the improvements I listed as I feel like that would make this game a snatch up. This game deserves more love and I feel with better story it could be on the level of Aveyond (the original) or Ib!","May 5","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As you can see it's an ARPG, so you are basically only playing one character with some skills equipped. A good thing is that you can grind ingredients and craft your own equipment in the game.\n\nDifficulty:\nTo be honest killing the small mob is really easy it's like u get 0 damage from the mini monsters, only the boss fights are challenging and only on Hard Mode anyway.\n\nCharacters:\nReally well done, I like the art design and also the personalities of all characters. (might be that I known them from Ragnarok Online, which was my favourite MMO 7 years along)\n\nMusic:\nNot many different tracks, however some of them are tearjerkers and very emotional, which totally fits perfectly at specific scenes.\n\nIt's not the best game I've played, but a real good one.\nI'd definitely redcommend it.\n","June 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Seriously, the story is just awesome, though it is very sad.\n\nThe game features an original battle system which I found very interesting, though it can be annoying at some times, but you'll get used to it. Soundtrack? Beautiful, it is really beautiful and fits well the game and it's powerful dialogues.\n\nPros:\n+ REALLY beautiful and touching story;\n+ Original and funny gameplay, though it can be annoying sometimes;\n+ Beautiful soundtrack which fits well the game and it's sad atmosphere;\n+ Has three endings;\n+ Battle system is simple, really simple, which means anyone can play and enjoy the game;\n+ Interesting characters and dialogues;\n+ Really simple but useful crafting system;\n+ Nice artwork.\n\nCons:\n- Battle system can turn out from something funny to something really annoying;\n- Has three endings, but none of them is actually a happy ending;\n- English translation has some grammatical errors here and there, but who cares? You can still understand it;\n- Each stage has some elite enemies, which are empowered versions of the normal monsters encountered throughout the area. The problem is: they don't attack you (unless you attack them, then they'll attack you back), they don't move and they don't retaliate to skills. This means you can keep spamming skills on them as long as you have mana without any harm. This is sad because killing them should be a challenge, when it actually comes to a matter of whether you have or not the patience to keep spamming whatever you want to spam at them until they die;\n- Relatively short game.\n\nAnd that's it. This game is deep, beautiful and worth playing, though with it's flaws. Nothing is perfect, you know. And well, uh... IT'S FREE! There's no reason not to play it, really. Even if you don't like the game, at least give it a try. You won't regret, I swear.","June 20, 2015","true","7.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Reasons:\n\nStory: The story is quite solid. A remarkable journey where the sister ventures into danger to find the only family she has left, her sister and will risk anything no matter how small the chances are, to be with her and to back to the Church together. Throughout the Journey Senia is more and more emotional yet never gives up. Determination at  it's finest. 10/10\n\nGameplay: Simplistic and yet fun. Maybe not the best combat system but it's still one fun game to play. The Game developer didn't try to win us over with the gameplay regardless. We're in it for the story. Even thuogh so the traps, monsters and obstacles to push are fun and joyable in it's own right.    9/10\n\nGrahpics/Visuals:  I can tell they worked hard on it. The characters look absolutely stunning. They display the correct emotions at the correct time. The visuals also impact how we,the player feel about thie story and we feel more emerged into the story, Feeling Senia's pain.  9/10\n\nMusic(OST): I"ll be honest here and say this game's OSTs are some of the best OST's I've ever heard. Especially the menu music. QUite addicting, it's like a mix of rap and hiphop. Anyway the game developers did a good job designing the music. It fits well into the game and they put it in the right times for a better emotional attachment to both the character and the story. 10/10\n\nOverall Rating for Eternal Senia: 9.5/10. It's without a doubt my top RPG at the moment and I hope they'll make a sequel. This game must be explored by other gamers out there who's not looking for anything super fancy, but a nice little RPG that can take your heart away.","July 17, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Boss battles make gameplay more interesting.\n\nThe story is deeply touching, but there's not really much to it. It mostly focuses on Senia finding her sister, flashbacks, some friendly fairy, and killing monsters. There is almost no background information to add to the characters, we simply know that Senia likes her sister very very much and vice versa. You learn a bit from flashbacks though.\n\nThe drawings are pretty and cute.\n\nTo sum up, this game has a specific charm, even without being amazing, you enjoy it. I couldn't really play much games in one sitting before I got bored of them, but I really enjoyed my 5h journey with Senia.\n\nMaybe because it's made with love, passion and honesty.\n\nSomething games nowadays ... and we, lack.\n\n\nGet it, it's free.","July 17, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.\nAll credit to Mr Pie. Youll find him on my friends list somewhere\n\noh yeah ive totally just played this game for 5 minutes but it did the anime dash cutty thingy where they dash and then the enemy dies behind them and Senia will never be Roranoa Zoro but i wont ruin her dreams.\nand my mum just gave me a toasted bacon and egg sandwhich. oh yeah. im gonna enjoy this. have fun with the pie and remember dont forget to scorn the guy who came up with the condom tutorial\n\noh wait\n\nthats me\n\nbye","December 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Oh it looks like some lame RPG Maker game pfff, all those positive reviews are fans of the dev or something"\n\nNo, they were correct.\n\nEternal Senia takes a very simple action battle system and complements it with satisfying design and wonderful narrative.  The cute design of the characters contrasts the pure emotion of the story as you play, providing a truly unique experience that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but wraps them around its hand and pulls hard by the end of the game.\n\nA note on the endings: there are 3, be sure to complete the Holy Chamber and equip the item you get from it while fighting the final boss.  That will allow you access to endings 2 and 3.\n\n---\n\n"Do you recommend this game?"

Hanako and Lilly, Flashbacks and Feels.\n\ni didn't know what to expect, to be honest i thought that it would be yet another free game that you'll play to pass time or some form of grinder to play for a while to actually be able to do any damage.\nboy was i wrong.\n\nit is a rather stable balance between easily won and "oh for the love of god!", sometimes you'd feel able to win easily, sometimes you'd just feel like you're in for some trouble, and a tush handing session.\n\nthe sprites are so clean and cute, the images are amazing, though some of the effect sprites like the lasers and such do sometimes glitch and you'd see the borders of the sprite, but it's generally fogrettable.\n\nthe combat reminds me of YS: ark of napishtim, easy to play and easy to follow, i love it.\nthe difficulty remains generally the same, level up, get better gear, get higher damage, beat enemies from 2-hits to a one hit finish, the enemies are ranging from a cannonfodder to a son of a protestant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the tactics go from one to one, to one over many, easy enough to do.\n\nthe map ranges from a wide and open fields to alleys tighter than a nun's butt, and each sector gives you a range of enemies to kill, either you completely bash them till they die one by one, or use your specials to hit with higher power or chain kills.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD, STORY REVIEW:\n\nokay, it seems like a Cliche type of game at first, but it fits this game like a glove, the idea behind it is heartwarming and heartbreaking, your character is extremely determined and very resilient, the objective is great, but an old and overused cliche, though it is used correctly, but it still makes it feel a bit overused by the abundance of games that used the "i will save Onee/Onii-chan even if it kills me".\n\nthe Onee-chan is beautiful, sweet, kind, she'd do anything to help you, even if it kills her, what a surprise there~!\nthough she is doing a noble thing, she has the skills, but she's not in the emotional status to partake in such journey, a place that will take your mind takes a great will, going there without preparing for external forces taking your mind over is suicide.\n\nso, the game is free, the gameplay is spot on, the creator is not forcing you paying anything or doing so crazy crap to actually win the game, he tried his best to make a good game, and he did what's better, he created a great game.\n\nalso... Senia is Hanako, Magaleta is Lilly, Malphiq is Rin, the succubus is Shizune, the fairy is Misha~!","November 18, 2015","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's better than most RPG Maker games I've played and the combat system and secrets are actually pretty nicely done.\n\nMy only two complaints are:\n\n1. PLEASE fix the translation. I know it wasn't initially made for English audiences, but please translate properly. I know there's no price for this game so I could even help the developers if needed. (If someone sends me the full English script, I can improve the English translation. I wouldn't be able to actually translate from another language.)\n\n2. I wish the Crafting system was able to show what you already have equipped and you were able to upgrade the equipment you're already using. I feel like it wastes a lot of time going to your menu a few times to unequip, upgrade and re-equip the armour etc.\n\nOtherwise, this is a brilliant game and I would pay for this if it was cheap.","December 7, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not being able to die is kind of a good thing, but it kills the point of having to fight the monsters and such.

If you want to engage into the combat system (the mechanics of the first spell for example is really nice) you actually can choose the difficulty for the bosses to be hardcore so its more challenging. I personally only died once before the final boss (no spoilers 4 u), at the medusa to be specific, because that was the first time I needed to dodge a lot of skills or else its game-over.\nThere are multipple endings which really nice and each ending has a touching feeling to it (excluding the first ending because its just crappy in my opinion......)                            LIKE IF U CRI EVERI TIM, SPODER MUN APPRUVS!!!!!!!! XDDDD\nAnd last but not least..... the music...... Its so fantastic and touching and makes the playing experience so much better and fun, it also has a really big impact on cutscenes by the way.... Sometimes i feel like the game just waits until you go to the next dialogue to unleash the part of the music which is emotional as f***. GAME WHY U DO DIS!\n\nJokes aside, I would recommend this to anyone who likes ARPG and an intresting plot because damn... this game has some intresting plot twists! There also should be a second season or something because I finished this game (with all the endings, WITHOUT looking on the internet) after about four and a half hours.\n\nSorry for my bad spelling if you find any... still learning english. :)","June 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By far this game deserves most peoples respect and I give alot of respect to the developers of this game. The one small issue I had that really made it feel less professional was when upgrading gear a set of gear had the wrong requirements. It asked for the elite fairy stone but it was for a different set of armor. This however didn't take anything away from the joy of the game.

I especially like the use of the piano music. Story is engaging. You enter a tower to look for your sister, beating up monsters along the way... and I actually can't tell you much more without giving spoilers. There are 3 endings, all of which are easy to get.\n\nBeating the game is not difficult, finding all the stuff in it can be.\n\nNow the bad. The game is only about 5-6 hours long, but it is free so that is not really an issue, although you're probably going to want more. It is fairly obvious at points that English is the not creator's first language, a few lines here and there that don't read properly, very obvious spelling errors, and if you interact with a certain item in the Sanctum your character's name will show up in Chinese characters instead of English.\n\nIt is an excellent way to kill 5-6 hours, and if you like an engaging story this is definitely one to pick up.

It's one of those rare treasures that come along in life that you need to experience at some stage because it's a work of art in itself.\n\nYou play as Senia, the titular character, on her quest to find her older sister who allegedly entered the Tower of Eternity, which is said to have the power to grant ones greatest wish. As Senia, you explore the various floors of the Tower, all the while upgrading your skills and weapons with the items you receive for defeating monsters and completing quests.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing story and lore\n+Beautiful music\n+Cute graphics and character portraits\n+Interesting characters\n+Fun combat and upgrading system\n+Unusual endings\n\nCons:\n-Short story\n-Made me waste all my money on tissues because of feels\n-Requires a LOT of grinding\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes rpgs, heartbreaking stories or pretty music :)\n9/10","July 15, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reasons:\n\nStory: The story is quite solid. A remarkable journey where the sister ventures into danger to find the only family she has left, her sister and will risk anything no matter how small the chances are, to be with her and to back to the Church together. Throughout the Journey Senia is more and more emotional yet never gives up. Determination at  it's finest. 10/10\n\nGameplay: Simplistic and yet fun. Maybe not the best combat system but it's still one fun game to play. The Game developer didn't try to win us over with the gameplay regardless. We're in it for the story. Even thuogh so the traps, monsters and obstacles to push are fun and joyable in it's own right.    9/10\n\nGrahpics/Visuals:  I can tell they worked hard on it. The characters look absolutely stunning. They display the correct emotions at the correct time. The visuals also impact how we,the player feel about thie story and we feel more emerged into the story, Feeling Senia's pain.  9/10\n\nMusic(OST): I"ll be honest here and say this game's OSTs are some of the best OST's I've ever heard. Especially the menu music. QUite addicting, it's like a mix of rap and hiphop. Anyway the game developers did a good job designing the music. It fits well into the game and they put it in the right times for a better emotional attachment to both the character and the story. 10/10\n\nOverall Rating for Eternal Senia: 9.5/10. It's without a doubt my top RPG at the moment and I hope they'll make a sequel. This game must be explored by other gamers out there who's not looking for anything super fancy, but a nice little RPG that can take your heart away.","July 17, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spreijer/recommended/351640/","spreijer","Spreijer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spreijer/","175 products in account","It's a relaxing, cute and simple rpg game that is worth your time.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, and gets dull near the end, where you have best equipment so monsters are no threat to you. Boss battles make gameplay more interesting.\n\nThe story is deeply touching, but there's not really much to it. It mostly focuses on Senia finding her sister, flashbacks, some friendly fairy, and killing monsters. There is almost no background information to add to the characters, we simply know that Senia likes her sister very very much and vice versa. You learn a bit from flashbacks though.\n\nThe drawings are pretty and cute.\n\nTo sum up, this game has a specific charm, even without being amazing, you enjoy it. I couldn't really play much games in one sitting before I got bored of them, but I really enjoyed my 5h journey with Senia.\n\nMaybe because it's made with love, passion and honesty.\n\nSomething games nowadays ... and we, lack.\n\n\nGet it, it's free.","July 17, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For an indie game, this one is worth trying out. It won't take you too long to beat it, and it's pretty enjoyable on its way through. It can provide suprisingly diffcult boss fights when need be. The best comparison of this game for me would be The Witch's House, Mad Father, and Ib.  Even though these are horror games, they have the same rpg elemets, great soundtracks, and my personal favorite multiple endings that aren't afraid to go a bit deeper. Overall I loved this game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

"Oh it looks like some lame RPG Maker game pfff, all those positive reviews are fans of the dev or something"\n\nNo, they were correct.\n\nEternal Senia takes a very simple action battle system and complements it with satisfying design and wonderful narrative.  The cute design of the characters contrasts the pure emotion of the story as you play, providing a truly unique experience that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but wraps them around its hand and pulls hard by the end of the game.\n\nA note on the endings: there are 3, be sure to complete the Holy Chamber and equip the item you get from it while fighting the final boss.  That will allow you access to endings 2 and 3.\n\n---\n\n"Do you recommend this game?"

The game is well developed and is excellent overall, I don't write reviews all the time, but this game definitely deserves my recommendation.\n\nTo simply put, although it is created through RPG-Maker which is a program I use, the game had it's own unique atmosphere, yes the graphics still look the same, but the character design, gameplay, combat, and story itself sets it apart from other RPG-Maker games (at least). The music is great, the gameplay is easy to master and fun to use, the combat is unique and different for a RPG-Maker game, the story is touching and excellent, the character design is Anime related and was awesome, and the overall concept of the game was incredible.\n\nThe one and only issue with the game is grammar, that is it. However it has an acceptable reason behind it, originally the game was written in Chinese(I think....) and was translated to English. So, of course there will be grammar mistakes, but the game is still well developed regardless of this issue.\n\nThe story is neat and fairly interesting, I don't want to spoil anything, so I recommend to download the fairly small(space-wise) game and play it yourself. I enjoyed the story very much, there are 3 endings to the game, two I found are fairly easy to get which is Ending #2 and Ending #3, I won't reveal anything about them, but it all depends upon which choice you make at the end of the game. I'm not sure how to get Ending #1 unfortunately.\n\nOverall the game is excellent, it definitely receives 5+/5 stars from me. Here are a list of what tags I ended up giving it:\nRPG, Touching, GDS, Story-Teller, ARPG, JRPG, and CDG.\nHere's an explanation to these tags:\nRPG - Role Playing Game, self explanitory.\nTouching - Contains a story that was touching or moving in a way that makes you sad or happy in a way. You may reference that it gives you the "feels".\nGDS - Great Developed Story, as the name suggests, the story was greatly developed and receives it's own "tag".\nStory-Teller - Focuses on story development, or where the story was a key factor throughout the game, or the story was presented very nicely.\nARPG - Anime Role Playing Game, self explanitory.\nJRPG - Japanese Role Playing Game, self explanitory.\nCDG - Character Development Game, either you have a lot of character background developed throughout the game or the character was weak before, but becomes stronger as the game progresses. Mainly it develops the character and makes that character stronger as well as adding background information for the character, for at least the main protagonist.","August 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is good.\nMaybe some wrong grammar or language but this game has been translated from chinese, so give it a break.\n\nSeriously, if this isn't for you, uninstall it and be done with.

A free game you say? A free game with a good amount of content in it? A GOOD free game? Sign me up!\n\nFirst of all, the story. It's good. Not great, but good. Definetly had me engaged, desperate to see the final outcome. It took me a while to get all three endings but the good news is you don't have to play through the entire game again just to see a different ending. Characters are an important part of any good story and Eternal Senia has some ok characters. You get a decent idea of Senia and Magaleta's personalitys and their backstories which really helped add extra emotional impact to the endings (There are three endings and all of them are real tear jerkers). That being said, they didn't feel quiet as fleshed out as they could have been.\nGameplay in Eternal Senia is really good. Combat is quiet a bit different from the usual RPG affair with no turn based combat or anything like that. Instead you simply run into enemies to attack them and use Q, W, E and R to use special attacks. It's a simple system that works very well with the game. The graphics are also nice and I really liked the artstyle. The music was also really great. Not much else to really say there. Um. Yeah. So it's pretty great. And free. Not flawless though, it's a tad repetitive right at the end and the final boss fight was a bit unfair, it's still a good game.\n\n+Reasonable characters\n+Decent story\n+Very nice visuals\n+Great music\n+Simple yet good gameplay\n\n-Characters could have been a little more fleshed out\n-A tiny bit repetitive towards the end\n-Could have done with at least one happy ending\n\n70/100 - "Just a lil' bit 2 sad"\n\n\nSequel please?

(like me) As well as a lack of sci-fi flashy art that modern games do, which makes it preferrably to be look from an Indie Game perspective. However, this game does have settling mechanics though, where you can naturally emerge yourself into a fantasy world. The story can be more elaborated still... That's the brief summary.\n\nAs this is the first ARPG game I play other than Zenonia, the skills are relatively balanced. Cool thing about the skillsets is that the developer manage to pulled it off, mostly By The Developer Himself, for the game to be balanced. The game isn't long and this saves the time needed to reduce the potential flaws occuring within the gameplay and the story, although, creating a game mostly by working by himself also takes a huge amount of time. As everything seemed fair and 6.5/10 to me, the only thing that enjoyed about this game is that it's immersive.\n\nTBH, I don't like bad/sad endings, nor do I like replaying a game. But there is a sequel for the game. Hooray! For a gamer like me who just love to immersive himself, the only thing that keep me finishing the game is the results.\n\nI play the game, I went through and collected all the seemingly hidden treasure, wanted to further the plot, and I was immersed into completing the game, until the story ends. As there is no neutral button, I can only select Yes and No with ratio of 60%:40% towards whether I should recommend this game or not.\n\n\nTL:DR the game isn't for gaming freaks who place expectations on a game, yet it's still fun cause it's immersive, where you can complete the game casually.\n\n\nStory - 6.8/10. Beginning of the story is typical, but the lore is interesting. I'm curious to know the plot, this keeps me going. However, if the lore is deeper, the game could get closer on becoming a masterpiece.\n\nPlot development - 4.2/10. Room for improvement, the plot goes too fast. I want more of the progression of the story. :p\n\nGameplay - 7.4/10. Really nice and alternative setting in an RPG game where no potions were added. Even as the combat system is repetitive, don't change it, as this is the core of the system's originality. Could do with more stages though.\n\nArt - 7.3/10. Serious yet Kawaii, fitting the theme of JRPGs.\n\nAtmosphere - 8.3/10. Atmosphere = Immersiveness. The music, the story, the graphics, the gameplay, the controls... Everything just fits within the idea of the game.\n\n\nIs it recommended? Only if you're onto Indie Games.","September 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game does suffer some technical issues with a lack of easily accessible options where even the resolution is a magnify option that resets everytime you turn the game off. I'm able to look past this to play a game which is a pretty nice little adventure. The challenge isn't as great as it could be since many enemies can't attack unless you attack them, but others will use things like area of effect spells and the majority of bosses throw out more elaborate attack patterns. Exploration offers some optional objectives and a few extras that require a little more thought than progressing forward. With a cost of zero to play it's worth a try.\n\nYou can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com]","September 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I honestly would pay to play, there are many games that there are paid, and they do not come close to it in quality. The story is very good. Or rather, the way it is developed. The story might be a bit cliché, the sister going to save the other, but the way it is developed is what changes everything.\nI loved the music and the effects of the game. I really enjoyed the graphics too. The design of the phases evolves so much! Do not be fooled by the simple design of the first, the forest.\nFor those who are complaining about the gameplay, the author makes it clear that he wanted something simple so that anyone, even if they are bad at video games, could play. I quite liked, just for simplicity. And the battles that needed to be complex, the boss battles, are really hard. I'm sure none of these people who criticized battles faced the last boss on Hard mode.\nReally, normal battles are simple, and the mini boss, standing by scenario, do not use magic or anything, which is kind of illogical, because they are the giant version of monsters that use skills, but they just stand still and reflect damage. You just need spamming spells and wait for your HP and MP to fill until you kill then.\nBut apart from that I have no complaints, the game even rewards you for exploring and kill monsters (it has three NPCs that give you awards for discovering chests, kill certain monsters and getting upgrades in your equipment). You even has a mode called Arcane Realm that is made to level up and drop craft items.","September 6, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story (so far) is compelling and the simple combat system works well, and despite being simple, it is not boring. The music of the game is enjoyable and fits well. I also like the crafting system as it adds some good ol' grinding to the game which fits very nicely given the slightly retro feel of the game.\n\nSo far, this game is very well made, par a few translation errors, and is most certainly worth a go.\n\n(Will extend review after compleetion of game.)","June 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know it wasn't initially made for English audiences, but please translate properly. I know there's no price for this game so I could even help the developers if needed. (If someone sends me the full English script, I can improve the English translation. I wouldn't be able to actually translate from another language.)\n\n2. I wish the Crafting system was able to show what you already have equipped and you were able to upgrade the equipment you're already using.

Hanako and Lilly, Flashbacks and Feels.\n\ni didn't know what to expect, to be honest i thought that it would be yet another free game that you'll play to pass time or some form of grinder to play for a while to actually be able to do any damage.\nboy was i wrong.\n\nit is a rather stable balance between easily won and "oh for the love of god!", sometimes you'd feel able to win easily, sometimes you'd just feel like you're in for some trouble, and a tush handing session.\n\nthe sprites are so clean and cute, the images are amazing, though some of the effect sprites like the lasers and such do sometimes glitch and you'd see the borders of the sprite, but it's generally fogrettable.\n\nthe combat reminds me of YS: ark of napishtim, easy to play and easy to follow, i love it.\nthe difficulty remains generally the same, level up, get better gear, get higher damage, beat enemies from 2-hits to a one hit finish, the enemies are ranging from a cannonfodder to a son of a protestant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the tactics go from one to one, to one over many, easy enough to do.\n\nthe map ranges from a wide and open fields to alleys tighter than a nun's butt, and each sector gives you a range of enemies to kill, either you completely bash them till they die one by one, or use your specials to hit with higher power or chain kills.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD, STORY REVIEW:\n\nokay, it seems like a Cliche type of game at first, but it fits this game like a glove, the idea behind it is heartwarming and heartbreaking, your character is extremely determined and very resilient, the objective is great, but an old and overused cliche, though it is used correctly, but it still makes it feel a bit overused by the abundance of games that used the "i will save Onee/Onii-chan even if it kills me".\n\nthe Onee-chan is beautiful, sweet, kind, she'd do anything to help you, even if it kills her, what a surprise there~!\nthough she is doing a noble thing, she has the skills, but she's not in the emotional status to partake in such journey, a place that will take your mind takes a great will, going there without preparing for external forces taking your mind over is suicide.\n\nso, the game is free, the gameplay is spot on, the creator is not forcing you paying anything or doing so crazy crap to actually win the game, he tried his best to make a good game, and he did what's better, he created a great game.\n\nalso... Senia is Hanako, Magaleta is Lilly, Malphiq is Rin, the succubus is Shizune, the fairy is Misha~!","November 18, 2015","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackSuperDerp/recommended/351640/","BlackSuperDerp","Phantom Renegade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackSuperDerp/","177 products in account","At first sight, the game kinda looked like garbage. I mean, the UI wasn't very attractive, the screenshots didn't spark any interest and the 'special' battle system just seemed boring as hell. But I was confused by the fact that this game was rated "overwhelmingly positive". So I gave it a try.\n\nThe game ended up being pretty good.\n\nThe story is ok. It seems a lot of people went on a feel trip although I didn't, bearing in mind that I'm not easily moved by a story.\nThe developer wanted to keep it simple and succeeded: it wasn't too boring after all; I enjoyed my time eventhough things were very linear and upgrading and leveling didn't offer too much. It has interesting puzzles and a few secrets. There is some grinding although I didn't really mind, because it wasn't too much. But some might think differently about this.\n\nIf you can bite through the bad grammar and don't hate RPG Maker games, this game can be very well worth your time, especially since it's free! It's a decent and simple RPG.\nOh, I almost forgot the mention that I LOVE the OST, it's amazing.\n\nThis game offered quite a lot for a free, small game.","February 26","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THE GAME IS FREE. JUST GET IT!\n\n...?\n\nYou're not sure?\n\n...\n\nYou want to read a review anyway?\n\nFine. Let's do this!\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Simple, fun gameplay.\n\nThe core gameplay is simple and easy to pick up. Still it feels rewarding and the various skills and their interactions give the game a unique feel.\n\n+ An above average story.\n\nIt's a simple story and you've probably seen it before. Still it's handled well and the endings really help it stand out. All the ending felt unique and despite there being a "good" and "bad" ending, all the endings felt like they had their own unique merits.\n\n+ Solid difficulty\n\nEven with maxed out gear the hard mode boss fights were still a solid challenge. Although maxing out your gear will make fighting the normal enemies a joke. Additionally difficulty has no impact on the endings so feel free to grind to the max stats or just set the bosses on easy as you please.\n\n+ Solid Visuals\n\nThe pictures above give you a pretty good representation of what the game looks like. Its not a graphical marvel but it's nice to look at. Little things like being able to change the weather in one level and the professionally drawn character art are nice touches as well.\n\n+ A ton of love\n\nEven though it is their first game, the creator really loved the time he spent on this game and its characters and it shows as you play. Each new skill or boss fight feels unique, and even though we dont get to spend much time with the characters they are all easily likable.\n\n+ Free\n\nThe game is of a high enough quality that the guy easily could have asked for a few bucks and the game been easily worth it. A game that asks for nothing but your time and is easily worth it.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Could use a proof reader\n\nThe game has some spelling and grammar errors that really stuck out to me. I think they are mostly just due to having only one guy make this and English not being his first language. Honestly, the only reason this was even a problem was that I was enjoying the story enough to care about the exact words a character was saying. Still it does draw from the impact of the story a good bit which is a problem since the story's value ways solely on its emotional impact.\n\n- First game the guy made\n\nThis shows from time to time with little glitches and two chests that were a little finicky to get. Still overall the game runs great and although i've heard of others experiencing an occasional error I had none myself.\n\n- It doesn't reinvent the wheel\n\nI can sing this game praises for as long as I want (and I wouldn't mind doing just that) but it doesn't change the fact that if you look at it objectively as a game, without looking at price or developer experience, its a short above average top-down ARPG. I think thats great and believe its a great game that deserves attention but if you need innovation and complexity in your games than this probably isnt for you.\n\n\n+- Short (about 4~6 hours)\n\nWhat it says on the tin. Take it how you will.\n\n\nOverall a great little gem of a game that I think most people could have a good time with.\n\nNote: if you're having trouble or just want to not miss out on anything RobertDeLaMorte's "Guide to everything ever" is a very well written guide for this game that has everything you should need. You can find it on steam or as one of the top results on google.","January 25","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean, the UI wasn't very attractive, the screenshots didn't spark any interest and the 'special' battle system just seemed boring as hell. But I was confused by the fact that this game was rated "overwhelmingly positive". So I gave it a try.\n\nThe game ended up being pretty good.\n\nThe story is ok. It seems a lot of people went on a feel trip although I didn't, bearing in mind that I'm not easily moved by a story.\nThe developer wanted to keep it simple and succeeded: it wasn't too boring after all; I enjoyed my time eventhough things were very linear and upgrading and leveling didn't offer too much. It has interesting puzzles and a few secrets. There is some grinding although I didn't really mind, because it wasn't too much. But some might think differently about this.\n\nIf you can bite through the bad grammar and don't hate RPG Maker games, this game can be very well worth your time, especially since it's free! It's a decent and simple RPG.\nOh, I almost forgot the mention that I LOVE the OST, it's amazing.\n\nThis game offered quite a lot for a free, small game.","February 26","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game took me about 4 or 5 hours to beat to 100% completion, though I did take a sneak peak at some guides near the end to figure out the rest of the treasure hiding places.\n\nStoryEternal Senia delivers a story about a younger sister searching for her older sister in a mysterious power.  Over the course of the game, the player is taken to several varying landscapes as the background and the characters unfolds through flashbacks.\n\nGameplayThe game is a turn based strategy style where you control your single character and "bump" into enemies to exchange blows with them.  There are occasions where some strong enemy skills are telegraphed and you have time to avoid them.\n\nThere's several pieces of puzzle variety that progress in difficulty, but none get very complex.\n\nThere are several large bosses that vary in fighting styles, each with its own types of challenges to overcome.\n\nThere are NPCs at the end of each level that help track how much of a completionist you are so you can do the OCD hunting!\n\nLikes\nIT'S FREE!\nPolished controls and gameplay.\nThere are some well structured goals and completions.\nMultiple endings.\nLikable characters.\nWell structured goals.\nPuzzle, level, and enemy variety.\nDifficulty level options on bosses.\nVariety in boss fight mechanics.\nCute visuals.\nCompletionist tracking and motivational reward system.\nEquipment upgrades through a simple item grind crafting system.\nDislikes\nNo steam achievements.\nVery little variety in the way of main story NPCs.\nThe balance on the hardest difficulty does not seem to be ironed out (but that may be by design).\nSummaryEternal Senia is not the most robust RPG experience, but what it delivers is polished and fun.

It's different from the usual RPG Maker games and is also short. However, that is part of the charm. It puts you more in the action during battles and makes for different levels of play. If you are having a hard time during a boss battle and can't get passed it, just put it on easy mode. Most of the battles are decently challenging on the normal difficulty, but there is a big difficulty curve for the end boss fight.\n\nThe story is amazing.

I started playing this game just because I saw a free game with extrmely good ratings. Lets just say I got a lot more than I bargined for. The pixel stle gives off an old vibe but there's high quality pictures for when it counts.\n\nGameplay:\nActually this game is super easy. It has a simple skill and attack system that anyone can use.\nFarming in this game is also super easy. The variety of drops that are availible don't change. At all. It pretty much just changes the color and the name of the item.\n\nNow lets talk about the soundtrack in this game. One word. Phenomenal. It fits super well with all the bosses and the regular levels. I wouldn't download it to listen to for leisure but I definitley love playing the game with it.\n\nWhat's nice is that theres three endings. I take that back. Not nice. Hold on, I need to cry in that corner over there remembering the stuff this game put me through. But yeah, it is a nice simple game that I believe, if it had better graphics and had a little bit more diverse crafting menu would definitley be a paid game.\n\nLast warning. Your boarding a feels train without knowing it. Get the game.\n","June 4","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/351640/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","This game is FREE.\nAnd it's better than many games I've payed sizeable amounts of money for.\n\nYou heard right.  This is a totally free game, so unless you hate video games you probably should give it a quick download and at least check it out.\n\nNow that that's out of the way.. yes, indeed, it's an RPGmaker game-- but don't let that turn you away.  Sure, it's got RPGmaker assets for most the backgrounds/terrain and some of the enemies, but;\n\n- It's got fully custom character art for the main characters, with many different states as well as gorgeous full-screen art for many cutscenes;\n- It's got REALLY nice custom music with only, like, 2 of the 20 or so songs in the game being anything approaching repetitive or grating, and several tracks being downright excellent;\n- It's got a simple but beautiful and bittersweet story, especially once you get to the end;\n- And best of all, it's got a hand-crafted action-RPG battle system reminiscent of the original Ys games and other oldschool RPGs instead of your regular random-battles-turn-based RPGmaker faire.\n\nMy only real complaint would be its length; as a free game made almost entirely by one guy, I wasn't expecting too much, but this lovely game is simply over far too quickly.  Even if you're the type like me that's going to go way out of your way to do absolutely every single optional thing possible and grind every item, you're still looking at a single afternoon's work all told.  The good news is the guy's apparently already hard at work on a sequel.\n\nSo yes, get this game, download it, play it, fill out the post-game survey, let the creator know he's a rad dude, and have a great time.  Sure, the gameplay's quite simple overall, it's not very long, and there are some generic graphical assets you MIGHT notice in between the gorgeous manga-style character art, but I can think of little excuse for anyone not to give this game a play.","July 21, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got all 3 endings in a single sitting (from the moment I started playing) since I got invested in the story and characters. The gameplay is simplistic enough to get into quickly, with just enough spice thrown into the boss fights that you'll lose if you're reckless, but otherwise it's easy to get into and enjoy.\n\nThe biggest gripe I do have is of course, the script. It clearly wasn't originally written in english, and the translation wasn't exactly great. It's still easy enough to know what's going on, but it was just that little bit too much that really stopped me from getting as into it as I could have. I feel like perhaps some characterization may have been lost in translation, as well.\n\nStill. It's free. And because it's free, I wholeheartedly recommend it. I admit I wouldn't if it was a full price title, but I've paid for worse, so take that as you will.","June 6","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very appealing with a beautiful story about sister-relationships.  While I was playing this game, I was only having enjoyment.  For example, a game is done right if a person is having fun trying to get the best equipment.  In case I haven't stated it enough, I highly recommend people to give this game a try as it only brought me joy.  The story is beautiful, the gameplay is easy to play as well as fun, the visuals are nice to look at, and the audio is great too.  The main downsides I would mention is if the story interesting to you (this game is story-heavy) or if you find it too easy/hard (there are harder/easier difficulties to play with though).  Either way, I think a person considering this game should still give it a shot.\n\nP.S. I understand this is a brief review, but I feel like it gives off my general attitude towards the game.","July 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's so addicting that even farming for crafting materials is fun and enjoyable.\n\nIts crafting system is great as well. It's just a bit repetitive, because it is the same set of weapons/armors every dungeon. Only, of course, with different names, statuses, etc. I think it would be nice if it had a recipe drop system, in which you needed to find the recipes for the gear you want to craft. But don't get me wrong, it's great the way it is!\n\nThe story is immersive and deeply emotional. I don't like comparisons but, it is as emotional as the story in To the Moon.\n\nIn conclusion, Eternal Senia is a great game that you should be playing right now! It's easily one of the best RPG Maker games out there.\n\nIf you, Holy Priest, think that your game made me want to play Ragnarok Online again after years, well, you're right! But I'm not going back to that, just thinking about killing one million Loli Ruris to level up makes me sad...","June 22, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The CGs in the game are absolutely beautiful, and the gameplay is very simple, but still fun. The game's strong point would be the story, and as the other reviewers mentioned, the story is quite good.\n\nIf there is a sequel coming, I really hope to see more of the story, like more on Senia's backstory, since we know enough of Magaleta.

Just love it.\n- The OST in this game is also amazing, highly recomened listening to it even if you don't decide to play.\n- The Story/Plot is very interesting, and sad. It will always leave you wanting to know what happends next.\n- There are multiple endings.\nCons:\n- Noticible grammar problems, only a few, though.\n- The only options availible are Sound, and fullscreen on/off. No option to stop me from crying.\n- The Occasional bug or two, no biggy.\n- OST Kept on switching when I wanted to listen to it. :c\n- Developer didn't add me on steam.\n\nOverall, I think anyone, and everyone should at least give this game a try.

And is worth anyones time. (It's free! Just do it!).\nNow, time for some Pros and Cons\nPros:\n- It's free. It's an amazing, free, game. No DLC, either.\n- Very easy combat system, welcoming to anyone.\n- The Skills, Craft, and Equipment system are very well done, and keeps you checking on your charactor.\n- Encourages you to explore, and find hidden things.\n- Amazing Artwork! Just love it.\n- The OST in this game is also amazing, highly recomened listening to it even if you don't decide to play.\n- The Story/Plot is very interesting, and sad. It will always leave you wanting to know what happends next.\n- There are multiple endings.\nCons:\n- Noticible grammar problems, only a few, though.\n- The only options availible are Sound, and fullscreen on/off. No option to stop me from crying.\n- The Occasional bug or two, no biggy.\n- OST Kept on switching when I wanted to listen to it. :c\n- Developer didn't add me on steam.\n\nOverall, I think anyone, and everyone should at least give this game a try. Also, you can see how passionate the developer is about the game, and despite all the hard work he put into it, he made it free!\n\n10/10, would have paid to play this game.","September 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Admittedly it's small and loops a lot, but the game is free, so I can't complain.\n+Gameplay is simple but sucks you in. Nothing too complicated here, this is a relaxation game. (Except for the final boss, which is unexpectedly difficult.) Just touch enemies to auto-attack. There's also a set of special skills that consume a magic meter.\n+Touching story\n+Character art is scant but what's there is excellent. It looks much better than most doujinsoft on Steam. Almost professional level.\n+I got eight hours of gameplay out of it\n\nCons:\n-Final boss is MUCH harder than the rest of the bosses; it feels slightly unbalanced with the rest of the game.\n\nThis game was better than a lot of games you have to pay for.

The number of artworks and where they are display is also well calculated it doesn't flood you at all but they are there when they are needed.\n\nThe characters, there is no superficial and useless character, the author just introduce the perfect number of characters to have all of them developed enough. Despite the feelings of the main characters a bit naive and childish sometimes they share very strong feelings well described by the text.\n\nThe sounds are excellent, I really enjoyed each of them, they suit pefectly the mood and the universe, only the first one is a bit too rocky for the place in which we listen to it.\n\nThe gameplay, this the best advantage of this game but also it worst drawback, the gameplay being easy it's really fun to play the game but when you are doing all the sidequests and starting to think about the game it gets really really easy to beat all the mobs. Mini boss is just spell spam. Bosses remain rather challenging. Despite the spells being usefull and funs, there is some really balance issue with them some are too strong some are nearly useless. Last thing the game isn't for controller buttons by default are really poorly or not configured.\n\nI higly recommed to give a try to Eternal Senia, but you should take the game how is it that is to say a fun game, no try hards, no theory crafting if you are able to do so you'll find a very fun and enjoyable game.","June 22, 2015","true","7.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It's free, anyways.\n\nThe game is an action RPG that only uses the keyboard. The description didn't lie when it stated that the controls are simple. Arrow keys to move around, QWER to use the four skills. Oh, and attacking doesn't involve any button- all you have to do is walk into enemies to attack. There's also a lot of puzzles in the game. They're simple to do and they're all different, so they're all fun to do.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, the game was a bit on the easy side. After upgrading items, normal mobs quickly become one-hit-kills, so for an experienced gamer, killing normal mobs becomes somewhat tedious. There's an option to increase the difficulty of boss fights, so boss fights were still fun and intense. There's also an option to decrease the difficulty in the event that you find yourself stuck on a boss.\n\nNext, the story and characters. The game explores the main characters quite well and gradually reveals their pasts throughout the story. It gets really emotional at some points in the story, as well. Oh, and there are three endings, by the way, each one very touching. There are quite a few grammar mistakes in the dialogue, but if you can ignore them, then it shouldn't take too much of the story.\n\nThe music and sound fit really fit the atmosphere of the game. For the brighter, happier places, there's upbeat music. For the creepy places, there's creepy music. And for the more emotionally dark spots, sad music. The sound effects are pretty typical, but they fit well into the game.\n\nLastly, the graphics. The game uses a pixelart style. For the most part, it looks good, but in a few places, there are mismatching tiles. It isn't too bad, though. The cutscenes are nicely animated and the CGs look really beautiful. I would love to download the CGs as wallpapers!\n\nDespite its flaws, the game is very good, especially since it's free. If it actually cost money, I would buy it without hesitation. Definitely try this game out!","June 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexmcs1/recommended/351640/","alexmcs1","Alex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexmcs1/","227 products in account","Quick analysis:\n\nStory: 2/10\nSenia goes into the Tower of Eternity to save her sister Magaleta. That's literally it.\nNo memorable villains/side characters.\n\nGameplay: 4/10\nBattle is a barebones YS Origins styled combat with some skills.\nSaid skills are a Front Line teleport hit (up to 8 tiles), 3x2 Front AoE, 9 tile front piercing ranged attack, All Around Point Blank AoE - the only one with a cooldown and massive damage.\nSkills use MP (20, 20, 10, 40, not listed in game) and you can use SP (gained from killing enemies ogether with EXP) to improve them.\n\nLeveling system is as basic as it gets. Level Up = More stats.\n\nThe crafting system is really simple and does not vary between the whole 4 dungeons.\nFor each armor piece and your weapon, you can craft 4 tiers of gear per dungeon.\nYou collect the base materials from the dungeon enemies, which enables the first 2 tiers.\nAn extra material from the midboss in each dungeon for the tier 3 gear, and the last material from the "King" version of common enemies, for the final piece of gear for the dungeon.\nEach tier needs the item from the last one.\n\nDungeon design is pretty linear with small puzzles and some skill usage here and there. There are only around 12 rooms in the whole game that are optional. At the end of each dungeon, there are some NPCs with rewards for # kill for each enemy type, getting all chests, and crafting all tier 4 gear.\n\nItems are there just for crafting or for a small stat boost, limited per dungeon. There is no currency.\n\nThere are multiple endings, but they aren't missable. You can get to all of them from the last save point.\n\nSave points are also pretty abundant, and most dub as warp points too.\n\nIt's worth noting that most enemies don't attack at all, or even do great damage on contact, making this game way too easy. Even bosses are hard pressed to be a challenge. Even in hard mode (you can choose whether the boss will be easy, regular or hard before each fight. Difficulty only modifies enemy stats).\n\nI didn't die even once, even fighting all bosses on hard mode, with no external aid/guides etc.\n\nMusic / Sound FX: 6/10\n\nPleasant but short music tracks. Some of them are really misplaced in some scenes though.\nThey are also very cool and you may find yourself humming them in your head :)\nSound effects are pretty good.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nGreat sprites, decent UI even if lacking some info, overall great assets in dungeons.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nOne of the best free RPG games i've ever played. It could be the pre-alpha version of a legendary ARPG. All it needs is improvement in the main lacking areas and a lot of polish / QA.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that it wouldn't get half that score if it was a commercial ($10+) game though.\n\nKudos to the author, who pretty much created this by himself, for this gem.","August 9, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Personally, I believe the third ending was fantastic (If you haven't witnessed this ending, do it now. Seriously, it was deeply emotional and was a great way to lead into a sequel if there ever is one). This game brought out emotions that are seemingly rare nowadays — a mixture of fear, hate, depression, happiness. Deep emotions that I haven't felt since I played Gears of War 3 for the first time.\n\nIf there was anything I would change, it would have to be the combat. Excluding the bosses, it was quite simplistic in design. Offering no sense of difficulty throughout the entirety of the game. If there is a sequel in the works, I would suggest refining what you have now and make it better, while still maintaining emphasis on story; that would be ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nI do have to admit, I really enjoyed the crafting system. While it lacked in complexity, it made up for me wanting to get the best gear I could before advancing to the next dungeon, simply to get that reward from the Legendary Sheep. Also, while on the subject, I loved the three NPCs located at the end of each dungeon. Yeah, the ones that had set milestones for the player to achieve, and in return for their time, granting the player items such as the components to reforge the Hydrangea Sword and Violet Crystal Armor, which broke during the first portion of the game.\n\nOverall, I thought the game was lovely. While lacking in gameplay and length, it did give me a good five hours of enjoyment. I'd recommend this game to anyone so long as you have the time. It's an enjoyable experience. Also, it's free, so why not play it? (Play the game. Do it now.)","June 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really had a good storyline to it and at the end was remarkable. I thoroughly enjoy it and actually when I first played it, I didn't get the grasp of it, but as I kept playing it, it got hold of my interest to continue and keep going foward to await what would happen. I would rate it a 4-5 star for a F2P and considering it doesn't take that long to complete, but the ending was the best in my opinion. Much feels :). Overall it was a very fun game to enjoy that it kind of reminded me of how an anime series would go.

Another little bonus that i liked was that once you completed the games endings, a bonus room was unlocked where you could read the developers thoughts while designing and creating the game.

Its originality comes in the touching and yet somewhat tragic dynamic between the titular deuteragonist - and main playable character - Senia and her older non-playable 'sister', Magaleta.  Whilst the cadence of the written English in the game is a little stilted and awkward due to translational grammatical errors, the potency of the dynamic between the two 'sisters' comes through very lucidly.  If I were to recommend this game, it would primarily be for that reason.\n\nThe combat system is a slight revamp of styles similar to Illusion of Gaia or Terranigma.  Enemy sprites are ran into and auto-attacked will, for the most part, counter-attack.  Four skills are learned throughout the game, and all of them have at least one area of optimal use (though the first two of these four skills in general have more global utility).  The bosses, whilst somewhat samey in the mechanics used (e.g. regular use of shield gems, shaded area spells, mob spawning, horizontal or vertical beams), do get harder as the fight progresses, and the last fight on Hard Mode is legitimately quite difficult.  There perhaps aren't as many special/unique enemies like the ghosts or the nuns as there could have been, and a flaw to the giant regular enemies is that they never try to initiate attacks so can always be beaten with patience alone.\n\nThere are three main zones to travel through and it's an elegant touch that some comic/trivial NPCs offer perks for fully completing these areas.  This primarily involves quota-killing NPCs for books that permanently boost the Evasion stat, finding all the treasure chests in an area, and crafting the best armour for that area.  Whilst the crafting will require some grinding, it never gets too tedious.  The Demon Frontier is the most interesting from an overall design perspective - the Wisdom area in the castle was probably my favourite individual section of the game - but the Sanctum is the most visually interesting area and has a couple of nice touches related to the game's plot.\n\nMy main critique of the level design would be that all levels are very, very linear, and with the Waypoint mechanic enabling teleportation between specific save points, it didn't really necessarily need to be so.  Often, a large appeal to ARPGs is that certain areas are unravelled and fully bloom over time, and only in the first area of the Sanctum and for completion is backtracking at all necessary.  The difficulty isn't quite tuned right, even though it is billed as an easy game, since if one keeps up on gear the second area and third area (up until the last boss) are actually both easier to clear through than the first.  Having said that, the option to take on bosses in hard mode was appreciated, and approach rather than level grinding always wins out on the bosses, which is good.\n\nThe music is fine and fitting to its surroundings, and whilst the visuals in general are a bit generic, it's understandable given the use of RPG Maker, although the few pieces of Senia/Magaleta artwork are nice.  The more minor characters are mostly a little cheesy, and whilst I'd prefer they had a little more texture, the Senia/Magaleta dynamic makes up for it.\n\nOh, and it's free.\n\ntl;dr - If you want a throwback to the SNES-style ARPGs with a poignant and touching story and simple, straightforward gameplay, this game is for you!","July 31, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Throughout the story, you've come to know the characters. You've gone on an adventure with them, only to be violently ripped back into reality. It's as if they, as well as the time you spent with them, never existed in the first place. It's really saying something when a 2-3 hour long game is immersive and memorable enough to do something like this.\n\n\n-Story 9/10-\n\nMy only complaint is how short/lacking in content it is. The entirety of it takes place in the Tower of Eternity where the protagonist, Senia, is looking for her sister who ventured into it. The Tower of Eternity is supposedly very dangerous after all. As far as the setting of it goes, there just isn't much. We don't even know anything about the outside world.\n\nOkay that aside, how about that sisterly love? Seriously, this is some tear-jerking ♥♥♥♥. The story between Senia and her sister Magaleta is probably what got me so hooked. It's tragic but beautiful at the same time.\n\n\n-Combat 9/10-\n\nFor a classic-style RPG, the combat is quite nice albeit repetitive and beyond easy. It's a nice change of pace from turn-based encounters in most other games. Unfortunately, there are only 4 skills in the game, two of which are actually useful. You'll mostly be using Q to do damage and R when it's up to nuke bosses. That's about it. There's not much diversity, but then again there isn't enough game to really justify going further in depth in this department.\n\n\n-Music 10/10-\n\nSome really beautiful stuff here. The only BGM that I felt didn't fit was right at the start of the game. Everything else was perfect. On top of that, all the sound files are sitting loose in the game folder. Free music too! :D\n\n-Art 9/10-\n\nFor an indie RPG of this caliber, the sprites are quite well made. The larger bosses had a lot of effort put into their art. The only con I can think of is how some of the bosses attacks kinda seem like the don't link up very well to the sprites. An example would be the giant lasers on s few of them.\n\n\n\nSeriously, just get it. Knock it out in a few hours. You've got nothing to lose!\n\n(Except for a few thousand tears)\n\nI'm still bawling my eyes out from ending 3.","August 3, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also his statement "A game need to be easy and relaxing" is sth i totally share with his thought.\nthe game is a Action Hack´n´Slash RPG yet its just so cool how he made the controls (not like the bad standard with just enter/space acceptments)\nsince it is indeed aviable for totally 0,00€ i should SUGGEST you to play it since i had terrible RPGs a lot and they did costs also. this one here is a pure Pearl of  RPG Mamker!\nOnly sad Part is how short this game is, due to the fact he made more Story/Gameplay etc than looking into a long hour´d game.\n\n\nHere is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:\n\nGameplay: 10/10 (easy to use, complex Battle System with skills)\n\nGraphics: 10/10 (fits perfectly each Realm/Area of the game)\n\nSupport: ?/10 (not needed since game is bugfree)\n\nPrice: 10/10 (he shouldnt have made it 4 free! this game deserves a Donation if you can do that!)\n\nStory: 10/10 (short, sad and very good story, 3 endings, my ending was very sad)\n\nSound: 10/10 (music is so great and fits also perfect)\n\nPerformance: 10/10 (some RPG lags with extended Scripts, this does not! Perfect stable!)\n\nFAZIT: 10/10 (MUST HAVE GAME: a perfect game for me a RPG can´t be better than this!

It may be a somewhat short game for people that are used to long RPG's, but this game turned out a lot better than i was expecting. The moment i launched the game, i was greeted with the beginning of a stellar soundtrack and it continued throughout other scenes of the game. The story is good and with multiple endings it's always interesting to see how things could've gone. The battle system is very simple and it allows anyone to pick this game up and play it. Another little bonus that i liked was that once you completed the games endings, a bonus room was unlocked where you could read the developers thoughts while designing and creating the game. If you're thinking about trying out this game, i highly recommend it, and it shouldn't take too long about (2+ Hrs) to complete if you're not going to get everything in the game.","July 30, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is amazing if you are into rpg styled leveling and grinding and the abilitys give you a bit of variety near the end of the game, along with a crafting system ,and a arcane area in certain levels for grinding loot.\nThe story is phenomenel it conveys emotion and can really give you the feels better than most triple A titles out there but be warned if you dont like somewhat sad storys you will probably not like this game. The music is another thing that really impressed me it felt like a piano being played in the background only sorta in a 8 bit form which goes along with the graphics which triggered a lot of nostalgia from when i was younger playing games like pokemon.\nThe translation from japanese to english isn't perfect and there was the very rare instance it would go back to japanese characters but that problem went away a little after the begining.\nIn my opinion this is one of the best games i have seen so far and it conveys the story so well it makes a lot of triple A games look terrible, i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes a story driven game or rpgs.","June 25, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not clear enough that dungeons can't be returned to to complete the tacked-on sidequests. The special items should be useful to complete the second ending, though, as the difficulty increases a lot.\n\nOverall, i'd pay no more than 1 euro for this, but it does bring back nice memories of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.","August 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I felt like the game very much encouraged exploration with the 3 NPC next to the boss room. Why not have achievements as well for doing it?\n\nXBOX controller... oh lord. There's no remap option.

A decently easy and straightforth game, Eternal Senia is definitly a game worth trying out.  The combat in the game is simple as an ARPG but you also get some special abilities to use for not just combat but for unlicking distant things as well.  The combat in the beginning is beyond easy (e.g. the first slime boss) but does get a little harder but never too hard so long as you aren't rushing to bosses.  As I went and tried to complete most everything before getting to the boss (all chests, all legendary, monster quota), playing on the hardest difficulty for a boss wasn't really even that hard once you figured out the attack pattern, which are pretty similar for every boss.  The story was pretty good and understandable and overall a good game.  This is the kind of game I probably would have bought had it gone on sale for a cheap price during the steam summer sale.\n\nRating: 8.6/10","June 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is fairly easy as it requires little more than moving around with the arrow keys, as running into enemies is your main means of attack. Due to this and the fact that there are items you will want to grind, "Senia" can get somwewhat repetitive, and repetitiveness is not something you want in a 7.5-8 hour game. However, the plot and art are pretty good, even if the plot could stand a little more flesh. In terms of sound, "Senia" has good music, but nothing to write home about, but some of the sound effects seem a bit out of place. Considering that most of the game was made by Holy Priest and that it is his/her first game, the game is good for what it is: a first step into the scene by the creator.\n\nScore : 7 / 10, a good time killer, lasting 7.5-8 hours for 100%. "Senia" is a nice game if you want to find something new and since it's free there's no reason to not at least check it out","June 22, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's what I like to call short and sweet like a piece of candy, it's amazing when you first try it, it doesn't overstay it's welcome and it left me wanting more just like it. It had some minor problems like the grammar, but with alittle polishing, that all can be fixed. I sincerely hope the creator makes more stories because to be honest this one made me cry alittle at two parts. (I won't state which parts to prevent spoilers and to be honest it might be because I'm just a big crybaby.) All in all, it was a very good game with a very good story with very likable characters.

A decently easy and straightforth game, Eternal Senia is definitly a game worth trying out.  The combat in the game is simple as an ARPG but you also get some special abilities to use for not just combat but for unlicking distant things as well.  The combat in the beginning is beyond easy (e.g. the first slime boss) but does get a little harder but never too hard so long as you aren't rushing to bosses.  As I went and tried to complete most everything before getting to the boss (all chests, all legendary, monster quota), playing on the hardest difficulty for a boss wasn't really even that hard once you figured out the attack pattern, which are pretty similar for every boss.  The story was pretty good and understandable and overall a good game.  This is the kind of game I probably would have bought had it gone on sale for a cheap price during the steam summer sale.\n\nRating: 8.6/10","June 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is fairly easy as it requires little more than moving around with the arrow keys, as running into enemies is your main means of attack. Due to this and the fact that there are items you will want to grind, "Senia" can get somwewhat repetitive, and repetitiveness is not something you want in a 7.5-8 hour game. However, the plot and art are pretty good, even if the plot could stand a little more flesh. In terms of sound, "Senia" has good music, but nothing to write home about, but some of the sound effects seem a bit out of place. Considering that most of the game was made by Holy Priest and that it is his/her first game, the game is good for what it is: a first step into the scene by the creator.\n\nScore : 7 / 10, a good time killer, lasting 7.5-8 hours for 100%. "Senia" is a nice game if you want to find something new and since it's free there's no reason to not at least check it out","June 22, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I sincerely hope the creator makes more stories because to be honest this one made me cry alittle at two parts.

As a gamer, I'd personally have to say, that "Eternal Senia" is DEFINITELY one of the better free to play games out there!\nThe idea of the plot is simple; you are playing as an adopted younger sister, named "Senia", of whom has to go try and rescue her older sister, from the "Tower of Eternity", and return her back home. But little does she know about the challenges that she is going to face....\nI am posting NO spoilers from here, but I did beat the game, already; while the gameplay was quite different, among indie games, it's also got beautiful artwork, neat soundtrack, and most of all, a nice, deep little storyline!

I didn't even care about the combat system, it is nice though, that I can agree. At first I didn't think it would work so well but it definitly works well. I beat the game then recorded gameplay since at the end it does say it's fine to spread your gameplay, sadly no one can see me nearly cry since I could only record gameplay only. Nearly crying means that if I were not so good at not really caring and ignoring pain, I would cry for weeks maybe months, perhaps years. You can really just finish the game in at least two hours I'd say, spent nearly half a day recording but yeah it's that short. Again this game is free and a really great game and it's really funny in my opinion to find Chinese writing I assume in the English version.\n\nNow this game is so well done that when I see it in my library I almost cry at the sight of it, also Senia is cute. Well in my opinion and that's all I really have to say about it for now.","November 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037427689/recommended/351640/","76561198037427689","Robot Death Party","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037427689/","386 products in account","It's a short game(5.4 hours for me, including the 10-ish minutes I spent in the bonus room) that has active combat (bumping into enemies to hit them), diverse bosses, and a neat little story(with 3 different endings) that borders on sisterly love without being over-the-top. Its english isn't the best but the developer clearly isn't skilled in speaking/writing English so fair enough and it's also free. Oh, did I mention that? A 5 hour game that is great at killing a few hours and it is *free*. Now, it's not so simple as "It's free so it's good". The specifics that you need to know are the usual ones. I'll list them in seperate paragraphs to make it at least a little organized.\n\nThe story is, well, it's pretty linear and straight forward but it definitely opens for being expanded. Since I don't want to spoil anything, all I'll say is it has a plot-device that is basically "magical essense that can possess and control others", which personally is something that bugs me because I hate mind-changing/controller/possession themes. Since this is the internet, I'll ignore the fact that it's R34 bait for seduction-porn because, yeah, that's a thing. It's not thoroughly explained in the game but it seems like it's only relevant to the tower you enter. Overall, not a bad story but not amazing. As I said, no spoilers, so you'll have to experience the story for yourself.\n\nThe combat gets repetitive sometimes, with skills to let you spice it up but the skills are really only useful against mini-bosses(optional bosses, to be technical) and bosses but only because you can kill normal enemies pretty easily with your basic attack. I've been told the combat is similar to Ys, in that you bump into enemies to fight them, so that's what you can relate it to. There's are four skills, each with their own uses(in combat and actually progressing through the game). Other than that, there's not much to discuss. It's pretty simple but somehow fun, until it gets repetitive.\n\nThe actual maps themselves are a bit plain. The "journey" is pretty linear but then again you are going up a tower so expecting diverse locations and intricately designed rooms is a bit odd, even if it is, assumedly, a magic tower. There are occasional side paths that lead to special mini-bosses(which tie into upgrading your equipment) and chests that give you helpful bonuses. There are also 3 grinding/arena type of areas that tie into upgrading your equipment as well. In fact, it seemed like these areas were designed entirely for getting more materials(I will explain that in the next paragraph) and that's it. Now, the maps are diverse in terms of your *location* but there aren't a lot of them. There's about 4 different locations you go throughout the game within 5 hours. You can't back-track when you go from one section to the next, so there's that.\n\nThis game has a crafting system, so there's your warning. It's a simple crafting system but it's still there. You craft by using materials you get from enemies (generic names e.g. fairy cloth, fairy crystal) but you can also upgrade your equipment by using the previously crafted equipment and crafting it together with what we'll call an "upgrade gem" and some more materials(which increases with each "tier"). There are only 4 tiers and 3 sets(one from each section of the tower) of equipment for 5 slots on your character, as per every RPGMaker game. Honestly, it's just a distraction to keep you doing something different once in a while. Your only issue will be when you need to upgrade your equipment for bosses but that might take about 10-ish minutes if you have no materials.\n\nThe music was actually pretty good for a free game. Nothing that stands out, other than one of the songs that had something that sounded like the dubstep-bumping/drumming sound. That was just odd in a game that has otherwise instrumental-esque music. Everything is good here, unless you don't like that type of music. It fits the game very well.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a pretty neat game for being free. It's not too short but it's not too long, the combat is pretty simple yet amusing, the music was very good, the crafting system wasn't a hindrance, the story was interesting for what it delivered but it was pretty linear. What would be my verdict? 7/10 simply because it was a pretty good game for a free game. There wasn't a lot of expectations as a free game, so you probably should heed my words and do not have high expectations. Just like any movie with as high expectations as Star Wars EP 7.","January 1","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I don't think I ever felt confused or frustrated.\n\nThe music, gameplay, and art were topnotch.\n\nIt didn't overstay its welcome.

Personally, I dislike this. It makes me feel as though what I'm doing is inevitable, like I have no bearing on what's happening. It was also a tad disorienting at first since the "touching enemies is bad" instinct was active. I suppose the display of damage dealt and the sword animation does make it better than, say, Hydlide, but it's still annoying. Also, perhaps it was just for me, but when it came to crystals or statues that needed to be broken to make a boss vulnerable, I'd have to press "Z", making the system inconsistent.\n-Speaking of bosses, the immobile sprites are really unfortunate. Even if they just changed their expression or stance as they were damaged, fighting them could have been much more interesting. The hitboxes are also small for them, as they can only be hit when you're standing directly in front of them. Most attacks done on them knock you back, which can be obnoxious on it's own, but this can also force you into an attack from behind.\n-The enemy sprites looked to be stock, or at least designed seperately from Senia's and Magaleta's, because they don't really fit in with the artstyle those two share (taller with colored lineart).\n-The translation in the English version is really off. There was one screen near the start where it wasn't even translated at all. I understand that English most likely was not the creator's first language, and the errors can be glanced over if you try, but it still comes off as a lack of effort.\nOverall, it's definitely not the worst thing I've played, but I just couldn't enjoy it that much. It's a nice little timewaster, but not something I reccomend or plan on playing again.\nTLDR; 5/10: Not my cup of tea, could've been worse.","May 8","false","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There is a live action combat mechanic and the rooms contain puzzles, but the controls are awkward: picking up unintended inputs and not clearly communicating to the player when input is being locked out.\n\nThe majority of the upgrades only provide differences in scale, and many become locked behind Points of No Return later. The story is a bit contrived, relying most on exposition and character monologue, rather than expressing any of that to the player through gameplay or character interaction.\n\nTo be fair, many of these weaknesses are actually weaknesses inherent to the RPG Maker engine, but knowing that doesn't make the game fun in its own right.","April 16","false","1.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

I'd hoped for more, and I can't fathom how this game has so many positive reviews. I guess being free helps a LOT.\n\nThe gameplay itself is meaningless, just filler to pad out a visual novel. A mix of simple combat and tedious, unwanted, grinding to get ingredients to craft better gear. Although, I did like the boss fights.\n\nReally the reason to play is the story right? But that is the least satisfying part of the game. The main characters are both very damaged, and have an unhealthy obsessive relationship with each other. It came across to me as plain creepy, not "love" as I think it was intended. I think this game lost a lot in translation, culturally and linguistically.\n\nThere are moments of fine storytelling, and the storytelling techniques the developer has employed like flashbacks and multiple points of view do enrich the game, but it's the story constructs themselves - the characters, the plot, the dialogue - that is poor, even cringe-worthy in places. The worst part being the endings. Endings #2 and #3 were so ludicrous and clumsily executed that I'm sorry to say, I laughed and shook my head.\n\nIt's free though right so why so negative? If you don't mind throwing away a couple of hours on a low quality free game, then go for it. If you like to play games that are worthy of your limited time, look elsewhere. Go and replay To The Moon or Actual Sunlight if you can afford their modest price. If you really are destitute, and free is all you can afford, go to your local library and borrow a book for free instead.\n","February 16","false","4.5"," 19 of 53 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","19","53","0","0"

Right up until the final boss.\n\nWhen you open your pitch for a game with "I believe that gaming should not be anything complicated or diffcult,\nbut a relaxing and pleasure experience", one thing you should maybe consider not doing is making the final boss the equivalent of the elevator fight scene in Winter Soldier, only with lasers. While the game DOES build up to that speed with increasingly elaborate bosses throughout the game in strong contrast to the essentially zero-effort main combat, the final boss is a sharp increase in that mostly by way of severely limiting your arena and only shrinking it further as the fight progresses, all while area of effect attacks go off incessantly. There's a market for Bullet Hell games, but it's generally not the "casual RPG" crowd.\n\nThe game's both free and relatively short - only three main areas discounting the 'tutorial,' all of which follow roughly the same formula - so there's not much else to discuss or complain about, but the final boss's sheer density killed whatever lukewarm goodwill I had built up over the adventure. Legend of Grimrock also had a bafflingly terrble final boss, but at least that game builds up an expectation of sadistic difficulty before turning into a twenty-car pileup of frustration. This is more like if an album full of soothing mood music suddenly launched into an ear-busting guitar solo on its final track apropos of nothing.\n\nFrom what I hear the endings were all kind of ♥♥♥♥ anyway, so I don't feel I'm missing much.","November 19, 2015","false","4.8"," 15 of 49 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","15","49","3","5"

Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews I was expecting a masterpiece.  The game mechanics are simple but at times can be fun.  The story is basic and not nearly as amazing as the positive reviews led me to believe.  The character designs are very beautiful and the music is good.\n\nThe main reason I give it a thumbs down is due to the lack of polish in the user interface.  You start the game and there is nothing telling you what keys to use to move or even how to accept or cancel.  It's very ackward for the first few minutes.  There is also a bug where two types of gems show up with the same name and you are left wondering why you can't build certain items eventhough the gem is in your inventory.  Some of the boss enemies sit there not doing anything. You hit them until your health goes down, then get some space, wait for health to regenerate, hit them some more, then repeat.\n\nIt's an average game given that is is free but I could have spent my time playing something better.","December 3, 2015","false","5.3"," 14 of 48 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","14","48","0","2"

You're a girl who has lost her sister. You need to go find her. You run into... some people along the way. None of them are very interesting or memorable, nor is the protagonist, for that matter. There is just nothing gripping about the story of this game.\n\nGiven the very simplistic, not very rewarding gameplay and the unrewarding story, there is just no reason to play this game.

I really hoped Senia would finally reunite with her sister. After I got the first ending, I was encouraged to reach the two other endings as well. It took 5.7 hours for me to get all the three endings.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to get into, which is great! Anyone regardless of skill can enjoy playing this ARPG. Similar to retro RPG:s, this game requires grinding in order to make Senia stronger to face tougher enemies. The boss battles can be challenging, but they're fun.\n\nEternal Senia also has a bonus room - a "behind the scenes" of sorts - where the developer shares his thoughts about the enemies, characters and so on with you. This room is unlockable after you finish a questionnaire which you get a link to after beating the game the third time.\n\nSo far, I've written good things about the game. Then why am I not satisfied? The translation from Chinese isn't perfect, but it's not the main reason I give it a thumbs-down.\n\nMy biggest problem is the story and its "pyrrhic victory" endings.

"Better than most free games on Steam" is not enough to make a game good.\n\nDelving into the actual game, the gameplay just BAD: Oversimplified and way too much like Hydlide for its own good. I realize that the game is supposed to be simple, but in no video game ever does having the player and a monster mash their faces together until someone falls over constitute good gameplay. Nothing except the last boss is actually a challenge, which was pretty disappointing for me.\n\nContinuing with the gameplay, there is a lot of grinding. If you want all of the equipment, you will need to do the same mini-dungeons many, many times. I abhor grinding, because it takes up time that could be spent on progressing through the game. In other words, the more grinding, the longer the game appears to be, but there's no substance there. It's called "padding," and there are much better ways to extend game time.\n\nEven with the grinding, the game is very short, especially for an RPG, taking me less than three hours (including grind time)  to beat. Eternal Senia is a (relatively) story-rich game revolving around Lost Sister Magaleta and Lonely Sister Senia's quest to find Magaleta. Not much depth there. However, I actually enjoyed the story, somewhat... until I beat the game and got the bad ending, which made everything I did up to that point feel like a complete waste of time, as in "You mean I went through this whole tower thing, and now my character gets possessed and is going to stay here forever? So why did I even come here?!"\n\nThere. That's one of the endings. Now you don't have to play through this game to find out. Also, I've heard that the other two endings are just as bad. The game gave me hints afterwards about how to get the other endings, but at that point, I was just so fed up with it that I closed the game without even bothering with the hints.\n\nI could name half a dozen JRPGs off the top of my head that do their job better Eternal Senia, so I have to wonder why this game got a 98% positive rating.

The game's short so I'll just make a few points:\n\nPoint number 1: Okay, lets get the good one out of the way. The characters in this game are quite nice. I like their design and their personalities (even if a coward using a two-handed sword as her weapon of choice strikes me as a little odd). I empathized with pretty much every line in the game; even if I didn't agree with all of them, I could at least see where they were coming from and that made it rather enjoyable. For a story-based game, that's usually enough to recommend it. however...\n\nPoint number 2: A bit spoiler-y but,  None of your choices mean ANYTHING until the last fight/choice. Senia is characterized as both loving and relying on her older sister, so I decided to make it so that I always had her sister's pendant equipped. There are two points where this COULD have mattered, but when I reloaded and tried the same cutscenes without the pendant, they played the clips as if I still had it around my neck. Oh, and at one point you get a move that destroys the pendant when you use it for the first time, so it seems like using this skill again without the little protective cross charm as a shield might lead to a bad end or something, right? But no, it means absolutely nothing. It just gives you an excuse to need to get it repaired if you want to see the second and third endings. The skill is kind of worthless anyway since it's the only skill with both a cooldown and a windup time, making your other skills more effective at their specific jobs.\n\nPoint number 3: The gameplay is insultingly easy. I don't even think that's an exaggeration. I was kind of insulted by the non-boss gameplay since it is impossible to die unless you are REALLY REALLY trying to. Even then, you need to be far enough in the game that trying to die isn't going to kill something, level you up, and refill your health (basically you need to find one of those completely stationary minibosses and go ape on them with no armor if you want to die).\n\nBoth point 2 and point 3 were overshadowed by the first one though since they may just amount to nitpicking and I really did like the characters. However...\n\npoint number 4: Why am I not recommending this game? To say it without spoilers: I HATE the way it ended.\nTo say it with minor spoilers:  I didn't like a single one of the game's three endings\nTo actally explain myself fully: SERIOUSLY!? You give me a game with enjoyable characters and heartwarming/heartwrenching plot and then you have the balls to 1) force me into a bad end the first time through before unlocking a second pathway which was inacessible the first time around that I have to reload a save to take and 2) give me two endings that are arguably WORSE than that forced bad end!? Full disclosure here about what the endings are: End 1, both girls lose the majority of their will, but spend eternity together under this strange power remaining with just enough of themselves to be shown holding hands even when faced with a lifetime of nothing else. End 2, both girls die; plain and simple. End 3, The older sister sacrifices herself for the younger sister AGAIN, and the younger sister decides that she's going to go on journey to find and save her AGAIN, giving me the impression that the two of them will spend eternity apart repeating the same mistakes whenever they have a chance to reunite. These two girls have an immense amount of love between them, so if the alternatives are going to be dying together or facing separate hardships forever wihout each other to rely on, then I would certainly say the choice of spending eternity together in a tower they can't leave is far preferable.\nPut bluntly. This game left a very bad taste in my mouth.","October 10, 2015","false","4.6"," 14 of 50 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","14","50","3","5"

It's kind of nice to have just a bit of grinding, and optional at that.\n• Retro pixely art. Cute? so I'm told.\n• A story - I'm not particularly keen on the actual story, but it is present and done pretty well.\n\nCons:\n• Difficulty is poorly designed. The game offers hard mode. If you leave that off, then difficulty is effectively disabled and you can walk through the story. If you turn it on, however, the difficulty curve is not a curve, it's a few disjoint straight lines. It goes directly from riciulously simple button mashing for most of the game, through two bosses that actually offer some difficulty, to the final boss. The final fight itself allows no mistakes, past the halfway mark.\n• Boss design in general feels more like you're just supposed to die a few times to get it. I prefer trying to stay on my toes, and don't think dying should be a functional part of the game. We're not dropping quarters in the thing, after all.\n• When an enemy attack is visually sort-of ambiguous, the game gives you a warning by drawing a red impact-zone box. Maybe those attacks could just be less ambiguous, but the warnings really do work. That is, when they are there. Some attacks don't havei t, and they are ... surprising in a bad way. If the game designers want us to expect a warning, then they should give it to us, and not take it away like we've been bad and need to be punished.\n• Outside of these warnings, there just aren't enough visual cues that I could find so where "stay on your toes and guess what's coming" works. The visuals are pretty, but the actual gameplay gets lost in them sometimes.\n• Teeny tiny little gameplay window, no fullscreen mode, and maximize is disabled. That's weird, because I wrote a script to force the window to resize, and the game scaled up just fine. That should be part of the game, rather than having to be hacked in, or rely on changing your screen resolution.","September 13, 2015","false","8.1"," 9 of 44 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","9","44","0","1"

Even though it's free, you shouldn't waste your time.  I completed the game when I had little else to do and was without internet. There is no combat system. You walk up to an enemy, you auto attack..and it's nothing but walking foward. This is highlighted by the very first boss battle. A dragon that sits in one places, shooting a fireball straight forward. You move to its side, or behind it, and just walk forward at it until it dies. The writing is cringeworthy, the story is basic, and dear lord, the music might be the worst thing about the game. Repetetive 30-40 second loops that absolutely do not fit the mood of the setting. The first moments of game play have you listening to cheery, upbeat music (which, by the way has some god-awful buzzing in the background) while you're questign to save your sister from the clutches of..monsters.

There is little to no variety. At best you can upgrade a set number of skills or craft a set amount of stuff. That is it. And the 'fighting' is just you walking into enemies. Not very riviting -_-. The fighting is most exciting during the boss battles, though no matter what all you do is run into them and occasionally push a button. That's it. The bosses [with the exception of the last one] don't move at all, and the damage zone is thin. Playing it on hard makes me more frustrated than anything else. The story is also kinda dull and I just don't care at all about these characters. I'm just not interested enough to try and find the other endings.\n\nBiggest complaint: This game NEEDS a map for the levels. I cannot tell you how easy it is to get turned around or miss something in this game. Especially at the end.\n\nFinal Verdict: This game has a heavy reliance on grinding and playing areas over and over. Now I'm a grinding kinda guy. I'll stick to an area to get stronger if I can. But I have no desire to do so here. This isn't a problem in games like the Dragon Quest franchise because the story is still interesting and you WANT to know what is going to happen to the characters. Plus most of those games provide variety depending on the game. This is just one example but my point stands. You don't care about the story, the gameplay is dull, the music doesn't change [though its lulaby tone fits fine], and while the art is pretty it isn't enough to pull this game through.","June 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 17 of 98 people (17%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","17","17","98","4","8"

I mean it's an RPG Maker game, but I can let that aspect of it slide.  The music ranges from okay to kind of bland.  The graphics...well...I already said it, but some things do feel they were done a bit lazily.  I'm not a grammar nazi presonally, but some of the dialog should be better looked at.  I understand the concept of a relaxing RPG to just pick up and play, but I'm just not sure about the whole "no attack button" thing.  Just me presonally.  The story I feel like does have some potenial, but a tad cliche in areas...at least from what I see so far.  Overall, I think this game could be nice, but some work is needed.  I would have liked a netrual option to give this game rather than do recommend and don't recommend, but since Steam doesn't do that, my opinion is only marked as negative only because I can't really recommend this game at the present moment.  Perhaps if some updates are made, I'll look into it again.  I must say at least you aren't charging for it, so that's a plus.  Yes, I know I didn't play for hardly any time, but at this point in time, the game has a hard time keeping my interest.","June 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 37 of 194 people (19%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","19","37","194","17","3"

The graphics are decent for being an RPG-maker platform and the story is "okay". I say this because the endings left something to be desired--to avoid spoilers. The battles were fairly easy until the very end when rage-mode kicks in and finding yourself dying every few minutes unless you're familiar with "bullet-hell" style games (to which this wouldn't be a problem).\n\nAt first glance, it looked like another lame anime RPG-clone that's been done to death (e.g. most flash MMORPG who use anime as ad and in reality looks nothing like it in actual gameplay) especially considering it's free which is what I was looking for so I decided to check it out anyway--nothing to lose except time. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was enjoying myself. I enjoyed the simplicity in movements and attacking. No real skill needed which was a nice change.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this for the more "casual" players or players wanting to take a break from the skill-required games.","March 13","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is compelling and great, also the main character is full of compation for others and challenges the tower to search for her sister. I give this game the note of 8/10, personal rating. I loved the mechanics for the fights and how you have to search for everything just to get the best equipement. The puzzles in this game are not hard and the hints on how to solve them are really helpfull. Overall this game is great to play if you want to relax or enjoy a story that will make you feel THE feels. No matter who you are I suggest you give this game a chance. To me the game has become a gem like no others, also it is nice to take a break from other FPS games and others triple A games.","March 12","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story of the game is just great, it's rather short but deep. It's kinda sad at the end but that's the main purpose of it I suppose. The combat system and boss fights are fairly unique, not commonly seen in RPG games. The music really fits the game, it creates a nice mood. The art is well drawn.The last but not least, the gameplay itself is not borring, it's rather gripping, making you to continute playing. Overall I think the game is extremely well made, and could be easily compared to games with a much much higher budged. I enjoyed every second of gameplay of this game.","March 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You lose no more than a few minutes of your time and a couple MB of space for giving this a try, so why not go for it?\n\nThis game is absolute quality. If the 98% positive rating (at time of writing) and big FREE button don't convince you to get this and at least try it, maybe I can give you that last little push.\n\nEternal Senia is incredibly simple and quick to pick up, but by no means is it boring or too easy. Combat revolves around walking into things or using Q, W, E, and R to dash, slam, and slice your enemies. On the first few mobs you fight, it's all about dealing some damage while taking some, restoring hp, and repeating. Once you fight your first boss though, and enter into the later levels, things start to get more complex with AoE hitboxes, projectiles, invincibility, stuns, etc. You'll find things to be incredibly difficult unless you go craft yourself the best armor and weapons around. Even then though, you can always bump it up to hard mode to really screw yourself over.\n\nAs for leveling, you get xp from killing things which of course levels you up, but it has less of a role in this game than it does in most other RPGs. In Eternal Senia, you get stronger by crafting better equipment and by leveling your abilities with skill points gained from killing things . Leveling alone will get you nowhere. Fear not though, as the crafting system is also incredibly simple and easy with the classic "upgrade" mechanic. Build your weapon, then gather materials to upgrade it 3 times. Same goes for the rest of your equipment.\n\n"Great, mechanics are cool, but who cares? I'm one of those people who only cares about atmosphere!"\nWell, Eternal Senia has got that covered too. The story is a real tear jerker if you can ignore the 10 or so translation errors, and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. There's also 3 different endings, each of which is incredibly well done. It's not like Mass Effect 3, where options A and B are for if you suck at the game and only option C is good.\n\nOverall, for being free, this game goes above and beyond any expectations. I'm actually glad the developer took that route, because if there were a price tag I would have never given it a second glance. Now, I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to donate and I'm hoping for a sequel :)","June 23, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
