"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/23700/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","290 products in account","Developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Strategy First, Puzzle Kingdoms is yet another terrific title from their wonderful puzzle series of games. If you're a fan of match three, puzzle, roleplaying or any combination of the three then you'll be pleasantly surprised by Puzzle Kingdoms. The game is very fun, can quickly become quite addictive and provide you with hours of intense gameplay. From what I've read on various forums, many people who enjoyed the first title, Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords, didn't really seem to like the sequel Puzzle Quest 2 quite as much because it wasn't as heavy on the roleplaying elements as the original game was. In that matter, this title seems to be much more like the heavily preferred Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords.\n\nThe story, told through hand drawn art and silent dialogue is mildly interesting with a welcomed dose of humor sprinkled in to boot. One thing I didn't like was that the artwork wasn't nearly as great as the superb art seen in the previous titles but it gets the job done as far as storytelling goes. During your travels throughout the land, you will recruit heroes, choose different types of troops with which to build your army and lay siege to various kingdoms before conquering and adding them to your very own empire.\n\nThe puzzle battles, which are the highlight of this game are fantastic and have a new twist. You have the typical match three or more gems up and down but now you can also match gems in an "L" formation as well which adds a new degree of strategy to the gameplay. By matching gems you build mana to power your heroes spells as well as attacks for your troops weaponry. In typical R.P.G. fashion, as your heroes level you can choose which abilities to upgrade and equip many different types of loot in the form of spells, weapons, armor and relics with which to upgrade your forces.\n\nThe music and sound effects in this game, as in the other Puzzle Quest titles, are top notch and fit the gameplay perfectly. I've been a fan of puzzle games since I first started with Puzzle Quest 2 and although Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords is my favorite thus far...I can say that Puzzle Kingdoms is quickly becoming a favorite as well. Highly recommended!","July 24, 2015","true","41.6"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","52","54","0","8"

I don't understand why people\ncan possibly give any negative feedback about this game. Yes! I do know it's old. Yes!\nI know graphics aren't the best, but back then nobody cared about graphics. I miss times\nwhen You could spend days on one game, and be sad that it ended. I only did 5.2 hours so far,\nand I think I'm not even close to the end. It is a bit hard to start the game, because it's so much\ndifferent than Puzzle Quest.\n\nIf You THINK it's Puzzle Quest game, then don't buy it.\nIF You are open for a different experience, then buy it, because it's worth it.\n\nLet me explain why this is not Puzzle Quest game. Mainly because Puzzle Quest was like Candy Crush game with RPG elements. This game has totally different mechanics, and in my opinion its harder than Puzzle Quest.\n\nI gave this game to my friend, and he rejected to play it, because he didn't like the way You need to pull or push the lines. For me these mechanics are exciting, and I really love the way this game works.\n\nI couldn't find any game that I could possibly compere it with, that's how different it is.\n\nSo, short version:\nDo buy it if You are ready for a new experience, and You will be happy to try something "NEW".\nI promise You that this game is interesting, and You will spend a lot of time in it.\n\nEnjoy! :)","July 2, 2015","true","11.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

Unfortunately, money isn't the biggest concern when it comes to a game's actual worth, the real valuable resource we truly pay when playing games is time.\n\nPuzzle Kingdoms is a Bejeweled-like puzzle game with some strategy RPG elements thrown in. Now if you're not farmiliar with those match the shapes kind of games that's been flooding the web for the past several years, you're not missing much. The activity consists of endlessly and effortlessly moving shapes around in one way or another to group them together, and when you do a nice little sound effect plays and the shapes disappear to make room for new ones, manipulating your brain with constant small benefits to drive you to keep playing.\nWhile doing a good job at cloaking itself from the fact, Puzzle Kingdoms is much like those games. The game provides you with "troops" you can buy and use which can attack and deal damage to enemy troops after you have matched the same shape enough times, and later on gives you more kinds of troops and different items which give you slight benefits. At first one may think the game has a neat twist to the formula, but soon enough one will discover that the game is just covering it's one boring mechanic- moving shapes around to group them- with much more distraction and brain manipulations than the other games of it's type, rather than adding any new interesting mechanics.\nThe game is insultingly easy, giving you a staggering amout of money to endlessly fill up your board with troops while the opposition never attacks you with anything bigger than what you already have. It forces you into painfully slow paced puzzles that makes you roll an invisible dice over and over again until you win, all for the sake of a story that is so obviously ment to manipulate you into giving any context to matching shapes it's laughable. The choices made in this game- the kind of troops you buy and the items you equip- have zero implication egainst an opponent that literally can't beat you as long as you deny him a specific shape to group together.\n\nThe game as a whole can pretty much last forever, and that is a pretty big part of the problem- it manipulates you to play it endlessly and effortlessly and in turn do nothing but waste your precious time. If a game does that it should at least have a strong point (Prime examples are Allan Blomquist and Kyle Gabler's "Little Inferno" or Edmund Mcmillen's "AVGM") or have some really solid mechanics to go with it so the player will have to [god forbid] think about the game.\nAs much the gaming industry wants to dany it, "time spent divided by money spent" is not a healthy way to measure a game's value, because that implies your time is a bad thing you want to throw as much of it away as possible. This game is just not worth your time even if it costed you zero dollars.\nPlease, do something and play something meaningful and fulfilling with that time, because your time is limited and it is worth much more than this.","September 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 45 of 79 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","45","79","0","3"

I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, but I installed it, played a bit, and here we are, 25 hours later. Yes, 25 hours for a single playthrough. Okay, yeah, I started over a few times early on, but once I got the hang of it I just kept going. The primary gameplay is match 3, with a slider rather than a swap mechanism. Each kingdom you conquer opens up a tavern and a ruin where you can find new relics, spells and items, and recruit new troops. To do this, you use some of the gold you've gotten in your warmongering, and then play a minigame. Higher level items and troops have a higher gold cost and a tougher minigame to play.\n\nYou can customize your newly acquired kingdoms with your chosen hero(s), troops, and relics, and use them in battles against kingdoms that you haven't conquered yet. You can outfit your hero with the items and spells you've gotten. All of these items have a color value and a points value, and each kingdom has either discounts or increased costs for using these items. (Ie, a kingdom might have lower point cost for blue and red items and troops, and higher point cost for red and yellow items and troops. Your hero's total cost is affected by his color and the combination of items and spells he or she has assigned.)\n\nIt's relaxing, but it can also be challenging, especially if you have trouble with the recruitment minigames.","April 18, 2014","true","25.8"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

In order to kick some ♥♥♥, you'll need to build an army. To do it, you'll engage on mighty battle against various villains, taking turns on a bewejeled-like game made to simulate battle... And works like a charm! I know how it sounds, I have to experience it to believe it.\n\nEngaging gameplay, good art and a delicious twist to two well-known game mechanics make this one an instant thumbs up.

I played the Warlords Battlecry trilogy and Puzzle Quest I and II, and I absolutely love the fantasy world in all these games.\n\nNow, concerning this game, compared to Puzzle Quest it is different in some aspects, but it's not that hard to learn and adjust to the gameplay style. The story is interesting, but eventually I got bored by the huge amount of puzzles I had to do in order to make progress. I mean, sure they are fun to play, but in the long run it feels like an endless set of puzzles. Also, I feel that the challenge is not very balanced; sometimes it's too easy and sometimes you'll lose no matter what, due to the way the board works. But anyway, it might just be me.\n\nIn few words, if you are a fan of Puzzle Quest games or you just like puzzle games with RPG elements, this one is worth trying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/recommended/23700/","nBnBB","[nBn] Beebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBnBB/","175 products in account","NOTE: I paid 90p for this game during a 90% sale a few years back, and my review is based on a price around that region. £10.99 is too steep, but 75% off or above is reasonable.\n\nPuzzle Kingdoms takes a familiar match-three base and adds a little spin on it to make it feel fresh. Basic gameplay involves pushing tiles onto a grid of blocks, making the rest of the row or coloumn move along by one tile and hopefully making a line of 3. The spin comes from the player-built armies you take into each match.\n\nFrom swordsmen up to dragons, you can take up to four units into a battle with you, and your opponent does the same. Each unit is “fuelled” by a different colour of tile on the game grid. Clearing a line of three adds one point of fuel to your unit, and combos add more. Once your unit is fully powered up you can unleash their attack on your opponent or wait for other units to be ready to attack which grants additional damage.\n\nThe added layer of strategy in building an efficient army changes Puzzle Kingdoms from a well made match-three into something much more interesting. You may have a powerful Green unit, but stacking your army full of only those not only means the other colours go to waste when you match them, but also you need to clear a lot of Green tiles to get any combo bonuses. You also need to pay attention to what colours your opponent is going for so you can try to get those lines yourself and prevent them attacking.\n\nThe story is kinda dull. There's a pretty interesting twist in the tail, but little reason to really care about it- so you should grab this for the Puzzle more than the Kingdoms. It's well worth sinking some time into if you can get it cheap.","November 12, 2014","true","23.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

While this sounds like it could be an interesting idea. By the time you have done your 2nd battle and realize that every single one will be the exact same just with a few numbers changing it quickly loses all appeal.\n\nThere is also an overworld that serves as a hub between battle zones and allows you to choose to grind even more by fighting previous battles again if the game is not enough of a grind for you. You can play still more rounds of the game with slightly modified goals like match x number of each symbol type or clear all symbols within x turns to get different poorly drawn items and solders which behave the same as the ones you start with except for a few numbers being different.\n\nIt is clear that just as little thought and care as was put into gameplay was also put in to the rest of it. The writing shows a lack of proofreading. Including messages like “If their (000,240,60,255}Colors match” showing up in the TUTORIAL and a story with both the content and writing quality of a 13 year old’s school project. The music is as bland as it comes as it comes as are the sound effects which is made worse by constantly hearing the same things over and over. What few effects there are during battles are simple and as barebones as can be while still existing.\n\nOne look at the $15 list price as of writing this combined with what is a small and simple game from a decade ago plus adding nothing of value on its own this game is not worth the purchase.\n","December 11, 2013","false","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Most of the interesting strategy is choosing which units and items to use, making the actual puzzle as easy as possible. The gameplay is decently fun, but the plot is horrendous.

Match mother farking, h♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, throw-‘em-in-a-river-and-watch-them-die, 3 games.  I’ve played them.  You’ve played them.  Hell, your 93 year old grandma has played them, and she’s been dead for a decade.  Which one was it?  Bejeweled, Candy Crush, one of the other 14 million clones out there?  Did cool things happen when you matched more than 3 colors?  Did lights and sparks and fancy graphics explode across the screen like blood from a gunshot wound?  Did you feel proud of yourself, like you actually accomplished something, when you got the highs core?  Did you spend real money on boosts, or power-ups, or weirdly specific cryptocurrencies?  Did you actually enjoy any of it?  Really?\n\nThere’s not much you can do with a match 3 game, other than take it out back, slit its throat, and chuck it in a ditch.  You can dress them up differently, give them a nice coat of shiny graphical paint, and send them out to the market place hoping to become the next trillion dollar iPhone app, but in reality they’re all the same farking thing.  You match 3 things, some shlitz happens, and then you match 3 more things. That’s what the game is, and ain’t shlitz going to change it.  That is, until you play Puzzle Kingdoms.  Then you’ll be all like, “Match 3 games aren’t so bad after all—maybe I just have anger issue and need to work them out with a therapist.”\n\nOr something like that.\n\nYes, Puzzle Kingdoms is, at its heart, a match 3 game.  You match 3 like shapes, some shlitz happens, and then you match 3 more shapes.  The difference is this: Puzzle Kingdoms presents a CPU controlled adversary that tries its hardest to cripple your dlick.  First, you build an army of knights, peasants, archers, etc., and march them through various kingdoms, conquering and killing on your way via the match 3 game.  You gain experience and gold when you win, and death and humiliation when you lose.  You can use the experience to level up, gain new abilities, and raise your offensive and defensive capabilities; you can use the humiliation to admit that you can actually enjoy a match 3 game; and you can use the gold to buy new recruits for your army, which you’ll need after realizing how hard and unforgiving the game can be.  Your recruits will be dropping like flies unless you think tactically, and match those 3 shapes like a mother farking boss!  BOSS!\n\nIn fact, the game is so hard (for me, anyway) that I couldn’t conquer the second kingdom.  Of course, I generally suck at these types of games.  A typical match goes as follows:  I match 3 shapes, the computer matches 3 shapes, I match another 3 shapes, and then the computer chains together a massive combo that wipes out half my army and leaves me running away with my limp thingy in my hand.  I just can’t see that many moves into the future, and the AI can, which is farking bullshlitz.  Fark that crunt.  Occasionally I get lucky and use a spell or special move and manage to take out multiple enemies, but most times I’m matching shapes that give me health or magic points.  It can get frustrating.\n\nLet’s see, what else?  The graphics are mediocre, but serviceable.  Some of the character art is downright ugly, and the over-world maps lack detail and scale.  The music and sound effects suit the action and generally enhance the gameplay.  There are some nice sword clashes and arrow zings as you battle your way through each kingdom.  All the other shlitz: it’s fine.\n\nSo there’s that.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I enjoyed Puzzle Kingdoms more than I hated it.  I don’t know if that’s a recommendation or not, and I don’t care, so go screw.  Even though it’s a match 3 game, which basically drops it to a zero-star game, the packaging around it is unique enough to bring it back up to a four star game (pro tip: all games are four star games).  Go ahead and try it, buy it, fark it, suck it, or stick it up your sass, you’ve got my ringing and useless endorsement.\n","June 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The story isn't anything stellar, and feels very slow-paced, but the combination of match-3 and RPG makes for an interesting twist on the typical puzzler genre. If you've ever played a Heroes title, it borrows the hero + troops trope of that, but instead of a map for the creatures to battle on, you have a matching system. Match a corresponding color to earn either mana for spells, instant attack damage, or build up an attack with your troops.  The battles in these games become insanely easy 90% of the time, and the only frustrating parts are when you have to clear the board of all matching pieces in the Altar 'minigames' in order to progress the lackluster story. Perhaps if there were achievements or trading cards added to it, I might have enjoyed the experience a little more.\nIf you want to try something different for a match-3 style of game, pick this up when it's on sale for under $5.

Overall I enjoyed this game, but I burnt myself out by the time I completed it.  I attacked every tower, citadel, and crypt there was in each area, then I used that income to collect every single unit, item, and spell I could find. By the time I got to the end of the game, the puzzles had become monotonous.  Another aspect of the game that I do not like is the team set up. Once I had a decent team in place I did not have to change it for the rest of the game. I did a few minor item swaps and I stopped taking any spells during the latter part of the game since there is no need for them. The battles are easily won. Maybe on a harder playing level that would change, but I have no desire to play through again to find out. I would still recommend this game for a one time play through if you can get it at a low price.","December 4, 2014","true","47.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/recommended/23700/","Kilbyashi","Kilbyashi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/","232 products in account","I sunk many an hour into the original Puzzle Quest, lured in with its simple match-3 mechanics and addictive leveling system. But after trying to get in to Puzzle Kingdoms twice, I've given up. Both times, I didn't get far enough to see some of the features it has to offer. The problem is that the actual puzzle gameplay is inferior to what other games in this genre bring to the table.\n\nThe issues I have with the gameplay are as follows:\n\n- Whereas standard match-3 gameplay requires only a few seconds to scan the board and look for the best move, Puzzle Kingdoms, with its numerous possibilities based on the icons that can slide in and out of gameplay, requires more care. This slows down the game, increasing the amount of time one has to take between moves. Some may like this, but I miss the faster gameplay experience.\n\n- “Dueling” match-3 games can sometimes be unfair based on what drops into play. Even though one knows the first icon that comes into a row or column in Puzzle Kingdoms, the need to only connect three or more (not three-in-a-row) tends to make things especially random. Simple matches often turn into devastating combos that are impossible to predict.\n\n- This game is made for touch-screen controls. If you have one, great. If not, prepare for an awkward “click and drag” fest or the counter-intuitive “click the slide you want to slide the icon in on, not the side you want the icons to move out.” Controller support is non-existent, so don't expect an easy-to-use system like used in puzzle games similar to this one, such as Yoshi's Cookie on the consoles of yore.\n\nThis isn't a complete review of what the game has to offer, but it demonstrates how that the secret sauce for puzzle games like Puzzle Quest isn't in the metagame and story (which are what elevates them beyond Bejeweled), but the core puzzle mechanics. And in this case, Puzzle Kingdoms did not fit the bill for me and I have to move on to other gameplay experiences that are more to my liking.","September 3, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Moving things that will allow you to match things on the next move is the wrong thing to do because the enemy will take you intended move and you miss out. Making any moves at all, requires you to plan ahead to the enemies move that will be available after you move. The enemy will never fail to see any possible moves. This makes playing this game much harder than a game should be, dragging things out simply because you spend most of your time ensuring that the enemy does not have anything to match when it is their turn.\n\nI would suggest finding something more constructive to do!","October 11, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plot, gameplay depth and strategy are interlaced with the simple and familiar elements of many popular "match 3" puzzle games.\n\nVenture into dungeons to build your army, increase their available support abilities in combat, and use the spoils to upgrade your castle and construct new types of support troops to fit your ideal strategy. Then take that battle to the story quests and face boss monsters.\n\nSimple enough to learn the basics quickly, but with enough depth to satisfy avid RPG enthusiasts.\n\nPuzzle Kingdoms does have a few random crashing issues not found in its Puzzle Quest kin, but they are rare enough to be forgivable.","August 11, 2012","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Winning a battle gives you gold and experience. gold can be used to replace dead units, or to unlock new units, spells, or artifacts.\n\nCombat consists of two players taking turns on the match 3 puzzle. The AI is very good at matching 3, but is usually severely handicapped by having poor army compositions. Units have a color and a power counter which gets filled when tiles of that color are matched. Matching colors that no unit can use gives mana, which is used to pay for spells.\n\nAt the core of this game is something that could have been pretty good (if rather repetitive), but it fails at being interesting due to an unfair campaign where it is hard to lose, extremely grindy variations of the main match 3 mechanic for getting upgrades and progressing after every kingdom, and a bloody minded focus on the puzzle part rather than the warfare part.","January 1","false","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted it does not have the charm of the original Puzzle Quest, and the story is not as good, but I don't play games like this for the story anyway.

The music is surprisingly good for this type of game; one of the rare cases where I didn't shut it off after ten minutes. I wil probably play this again at some point, maybe using a different hero next time.","May 23","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
