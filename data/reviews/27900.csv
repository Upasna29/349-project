"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/recommended/27900/","lucassm","Darius Vulkius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/","818 products in account","Twin Sector is a strange game. Not because it's bad, but because it's pretty underrated and pretty poorly done AT THE SAME TIME.\nI will try to explain it.\n\nThe Story: I think that was actually a good point in this game. While i thought it was somewhat pretty generic, it had some hidden potential. But i really think the story is more conceptual than a thrilling exciting story. It follows the same pattern of Portal 1 (which i will be using as a main comparison for this game). But...Worse.\nThe voice acting is bad. I mean, BAD. Look, i can't ask good voices on a indie game but, at least, couldn't they put a little of EMOTION? I mean, the voices looks like robotic. And not robotic like GLaDOS or something. The characters just doesn't have any trace of personality or anything that make us feel attached to them. Not even the main antagonist or the general that tries to help us. And guess what? We have been following the machine instructions when we shouldn't. We should fight the machine and escape from its rage. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. Story was a good point because i see they tried to do something here with things like only putting talented people to sleep for years and about what future the humanity will face, but i just couldn't be bothered remembering the characters nor the story. At all.\n\nGraphics: For an indie game, they are actually pretty well done. But since the texture variation is not present, you will see more white or grey rooms than anything (again, exactly like Portal). And i swear that i could see more focus on doing models like Turrets and "the balls of death" (as i call them) than anything else. And i have to admit that it's a bit strange when you look and see something is more textured than another. If feels a bit strange, but i can forgive that.\n\nMusic: Non-existent. Aside from the game's menu music, there's no music. They tried to follow Portal and put you in a linear path with an narrator, with no song. But as i said, since the characters have no personality whatsoever, it just feels empty. And even Portal 1 had music often. This game just doesn't have AT ALL.\n\nGameplay: Now, here's the big deal. The concept of Twin Sector is pretty simple: You have gloves that pull and throw. Pretty simple. You also have limited energy, so you have to make a fair use of your gloves to get through puzzles. In puzzles, you will have lasers, explosives, fire, turrets and etc. And that's where things gets pretty bad. This game is like "I Wanna Be The Guy" in 3D. You die from fall damage. You die if the "death ball" keeps touching you. You die from explosions if you are not too far away. And mostly important, YOU DIE FROM FALL DAMAGE. That was the worst thing they could've done to this game. Sometimes the falls are not THAT big and you die anyways. And that wouldn't be bad if the checkpoints weren't a mess. They're just too far away from one another. And there just like 3 or 4 checkpoints per stage. And that wouldn't be a problem if the design of the stages WEREN'T A HUGE PILE OF CLUSTER♥♥♥♥. Seriously. Dying in this game is WAY TOO EASY and FRUSTRATING. I can think why games like Binding Of Isaac or Super Meat Boy are frustrating too, but at least they are fun frustrating. This game is PAINFULLY FRUSTRATING.\n\nANGRY. Angry is the definition of this. Your character is slow and it's easy to ♥♥♥♥ up. Puzzles are bad because the physics in this game is bad. 90% of times you will die because of bad physics. And the other 10% you will die from the enemies that had to be, like, the worst enemies ever. They kill you with 3 hits and only die with 3 hits too. Easy, right? WRONG! Hitting them with objects is painful. They have a "recovery time" and they recovery way too fast. And also, if you don't grab them in time to hit them a second time (which makes 6 total hits to kill them), you WILL get hit by them. They are just boring to fight and are a pain in the ♥♥♥ most of the time. Mostly because there are times when they are ENDLESS. YES! They keep spawning again and again...\nNow, i think they wanted to give you a challenge. But then i ask: in Portal, did the turrets needed to be endless to make sure you die to them at least one time if you ♥♥♥♥ up? Couldn't them make the enemies like "if you ♥♥♥♥ up and don't play the game in the right way, you lose"? Because, the enemies are just something YOU CAN'T WIN. It's frustrating and keeps you away from getting past a mission, and so, from progressing the game. I never finished Twin Sector because it's way too hard from the half of the game on. I just can't win. Really. I gave up. I finished Super Meat Boy 100% but can't do the same with this game. I just can't win it...\n\nBut, remember: i said it's underrated and very unpolished. Why? Well. I liked how this game was supposed to work. The puzzles, enemies, and even the story. All of them could've worked better if they spent a bit more of time polishing it. It COULD'VE been a good game. But it just isn't.\n\nNow: I like challenges. And for me, Twin Sector is a good challenge. It's like playing Spelunky from SNES all over again. And for me, it feels great. I like raging. I like failing. It means that i'm not perfect. But i'm almost sure that almost no one is like me. Believe that.\n\nSo, my final warning is: if you want to challenge yourself, buy this game.\nIf you want to find a good puzzle with a medium challenge and a great community and stuff to do, buy Portal 2.","January 31, 2014","false","1.9"," 123 of 150 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","123","150","4","2"

It is highly reminiscent of Penumbra and Portal in how it plays, with it's highly intricate puzzle design and excellent horror setting. You will spend many hours working to solve the puzzles, just so you can reach the end of the thrilling storyline. At this low price you would be doing yourself a disservice not buying this game.

The puzzles it offers are ludicrously easy to solve as an intellectual challenge, yet mindboggingly hard to pull off as far as physics are concerned. That is the fault of the way the game handles the physics, the slowness of the main character, the unresponsiveness of the game to input, and the fact that you have to be very precise in how long you press a mouse button without there being good feedback on that.\n\nTwin Sector is a death simulator. You die. A LOT. You die several times on each JUMP. You die several times when confronted by each of the numerous turrets and tracers. You die every time you encounter another laser field. You die even when you jump off a platform that is three meters above the floor. That would still not be too bad if the game had a good autosave system and quick loads, but it loads terribly slowly and its autosaves are rare. You have a quicksave (not a regular save, unfortunately), but you should be very careful in using it because it is surprisingly easy to maneuver yourself into a position from which the game is unsolvable.\n\nThe voice acting is godawful, the animations are stiff, and the environments look like they were taken from a standard Unity library. The background story is not a bad idea to base a game on, but the background of the heroine is deploringly annoying ("Oh, Ashley, you are such a big hero, we all admire you so much." Bluergh). Those elements are all acceptable if the gameplay is good. Unfortunately, it is not. Twin Sector is a frustrating mess.\n\nI cannot recommend Twin Sector. It is too bad, because a lot of effort of several reasonably talented people was invested in creating this game. However, none of these people seemed to have any insight in what makes a game fun. I played half of the game before giving up. I do not like to repeat over, and over, and OVER again section after section because I die constantly. If you have no problems with that and are not interested in puzzle solving anyway, you might like it, but there definitely are better things to play.","January 9","false","2.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

To be honest, I'd rather do work because I'd at least get paid for that.

The special powers you have are so integral to the game, but because they were performed so badly, I feel this alone kills the game. I can forgive bad voice acting, bad animations, shoddy sounds, but if the controls suck, even the most common parts of the gameplay suffer. Why should I have to wait for the glove to charge up when I took just as long to power it up in the first place? I gave this game an hour to get used to the controls, but I can't. I really can't play anymore. I play games for entertainment. A little bit of frustration is ok, but not an entire hour of fighting with the controls.

You have two gloves, one pulls objects to you, the other repels them. This sounds simple, and it pretty much is, but learning how to properly use the gloves takes some time. The difficulty of the puzzles increases over the course of the game, and by the end you'll be doing tricks that weren't readily apparent, but it never feels impossible.\nThe pro's are the neat push-pull mechanic, the often well-designed puzzles, and the fact that some puzzles can be solved in different ways. The con's are that you'll die in seemingly arbitrary ways, the clunky combat, and a forgettable story (Think Glados without any of the charm).\nHad this developer had a large enough budget and enough staff, this game could have given Portal a run for its money. Unfortunately, this game doesn't reach its full potential, and I'm really sad that it didn't. It's fun, it's definitely an interesting idea for a game, but it just falls a bit short.\nI recommend this game on the basis that you don't go into it expecting something as great as Portal and that you're willing to accept dying often. If you're willing to be patient, this will be a fun way to spend a weekend, just keep your expectations in check.","February 24, 2014","true","24.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Released in 2009, by german developer Dns, and I believe published by Head Up Games. This game has/had an interesting premise;The earth has fallen to apocalypse, and is not safe yet. You play the character of Ashley Simms, who had been awakend by an AI Overseer, named oscar. Apparently, you are the only human being who has been awakend, as all the other humans have been frozen? hmmmmm, intersting plot, I may add.

You wear energy gloves in the game, which can save your life by jumping from high places. In the first part of the game, I had to carefully jump onto some pipes, and then jump down using my energy glove at full max, so I would not die, and have to restart the game. There's many puzzles in this game, which is not a bad thing, and you will have to learn to get through them, at times with Oscars Help. The puzzles are ok, but those also can get tedious.

The collision is bad, the gameplay mechanics are worse, and the puzzles are boring, they're either super easy, or stupidly difficult. Controlling this game is like walking through tar and sitting in the sun, you are very slow, crouching sucks, and you die from falling 4 ft. And by the way, checkpoints are VERY rare, which means if you mess up barely, it's back to 6 minutes ago potentially.\n\nThe only thing that partially redeemed this game are it's graphics. Clearly the developers thought to spend mroe time on the graphics than the gameplay. The voice acting in this is also terrible, and can take you out of it instantly. I do not reccomend this game at all. It's a disgrace to the puzzle genre.","January 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

While the concept is kinda neat, the gravitaional gloves and all, that is the only real neat thing about it. The animation is stiff and disjointed which is the only real thing one must worry about in animation because if you have that down, then you could get away with anything otherwise. It tries to be realistic which holds it back terribly. The puzzles were fairly decent, but you may end up doing them over again a few times because many rely on luck rather than skill.\nCourse, there's the story. People frozen for years? Okay. One woken up to fix things? I can get behind that. Totally lame plot twist? Wait a minute... Hilariously bad plot twist at the end leaving room for a sequel? Quit it. It's all only worse due to the incredibly bad voice acting of the main character.\n\nBasically, if you have extra cash and you've made sure you've already played every other game on steam, go ahead and pick this up.

Maybe not on purpose, but, there are many things that could and should have been better.\n\nGraphics: The hundreds of gray, metal corridors aside, the game doesn't look terrible. The character models on the other hand are all robot-stiff and the cinematics look like they were made over 20 years ago.\n\nGameplay: You will be fighting the horrid physics more than the puzzles in every corridor, most of which can be cheated/skipped/worked around due to the previously mentioned HORRID physics system. The controls are frustrating and can't be changed.\n\nAudio: Audio? What audio? Oh, that! Yeah, there's a hugely loud dull hum consistently throughout the whole game. The voice acting is bad. Specifically because it sounds like the three people are just reading a page and using absolutely zero emotion/effort. I think there's a song or two in the menus, that's about the only redeeming quality.\n\n+ Some of the puzzles are interesting\n+ What little (back)story there is, is mildly interesting if completely unoriginal\n\n- Everything from the puzzles, the story, gameplay and just about everything else is executed so poorly that it muddies what could have been a neat indie Portal-clone.\n\nTL;DR: I bought this out of curiosity (the gloves reminded me of a much better game, Q.U.B.E.) and because it was a dollar but I wouldn't recommend you pay any more than that. Even so cheap I find it hard to recommend the game.

You awake to the voice of a security programm that starts to guide you to save the other survivors from a catastrophe that is about to occur.\nA glove allows you to pull yourself towards the environment ,or to throw objects, or push yourself away from environments.\n\nWhile all of this sounds cool in theory, the relatively interesting story was ruined for me by the horrid voice-acting. The graphics are functional but not really interesting or varied and have a fairly low resolution, the field of view is extremely narrow.\n\nIt'd be fun to mess around with the glove, but as soon as you fall from a tad too high, you simply die and the game restarts you at the last checkpoint. This can mean that you have to replay the same section of the game over and over because there is such limited space for mistakes. It'd be cool if the interesting idea of pushing and pulling yourself around the environments was supported by gameplay that'd allow you to do this in quick sucession and to fall from high places. Of course this would mean the level design would've to be very different to still provide a challenge and be interesting to navigate.\n\nAll in all, I can see the potential of a game like this - the adaptation is too fundemantally flawed to be any fun for me though.","September 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It seems that every post-Portal physics-based strategy game is the same: there is a few cool physics elements which make the game look interesting, however the game(s) always fall far below the standard that Portal/Portal 2 have given us. To some up If you think this game would appeal to you by all means try it however you are probably better off buying Portal or Portal 2; if you have already tried these there are a few Community-made Portal mods that might appeal to you such as "Thinking with Time Machine" and "Aperture Tag: The Paint Gun testing initiative", the latter of which I haven't yet played (but it looks pretty good).\n\nI would not recommend buying this game, not even if it's on sale.","December 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is amplified by the footstep sounds the devs chose - big fat stompy boots. Walking backwards is like half the speed of walking forward. Again, this character is supposed to be a trained athlete.\n- The cutscenes are terribly long-winded and drawn out. Especially during the tutorial, the computer keeps taking control away from you to tell you what is actually completely obvious in sight. Even afterwards, the computer keeps talking to you as if you were a child with special needs.\n- The physics are dodgy - objects sometimes bounce around as if they weighed nothing and were made from rubber at the same time.\n- Falling threat, the immediate experience how dangerous your current fall is, is nonexistent. There is not enough feedback (cam shake, wind noise) to give proper impression on your fall, so you die, die and die.\n- All sounds and voice-overs are completely void of reverb. At no point in the game does the sound of voices and noises match the room they happen in. Even a large metal corridor will make the same impression as a sound-proofed cell.\n- The glove mechanics is pointlessly slowed. There is absolutely no reason for the "recharge time" other than to draw this game into a tedious crawl.\n- Loading times. With the low quality of graphical assets, resetting to the checkpoint should take the blink of an eye, especially from an SSD, but instead one waits for what seems like the regrowing of an eye ... absolutely abyssmal.\n\nAll of the flaws above could have been fixed with proper game testing which would have made a cool game even with the low-budget mocap or intro cutscene or texture quality.\n\nSorry, but this game sucks salty monkey balls, and you don't even get to marvel at Ashley's butt.","June 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, if one were to purchase the game here are some things to know.\nThe game isnt as bad as many people have made it out to be. The story is interesting and the voice acting is indeed terrible, but the gameplay is fun. The levels all take place in a specific area not unlike Portal and the player uses left and rightclick to pull and push objects with gravity generating gloves. Also, the player can crouch and jump as well as pick up an object without applying force to it which could be better than having to pull or push. Walking instead of running can be utilized against turrets and allow the player to control their sound. One IMPORTANT thing to note is the player can QUICKSAVE or QUICKLOAD which is very useful if you die and do not want to start from the last checkpoint.\n\nUsing a combination of the enviroment and mechanics from many enemies including: motion sensitive turrets, homing bombs, floating orbs of doom, lasers, and much more the player can overcome obstacles and progress the story. Small tactics like using barrels to block lasers or throwing an object to hit a button become key to passing obstacles or solving puzzles. Some puzzles even have multiple solutions. The difficulty can be anywhere from easy to ridiculous depending on progress into the game. Overall I was impressed and enjoyed getting turrets to fire at each other and strafing with canisters to shield myself from lasers. The final boss was a challenge as well.\n\nWhy has this game had so many bad reviews? First off, I dont believe the game was meant to run in fullscreen mode. The screen flickered madly and I had to edit a specific file to return it to windowed again. Secondly, the voice acting is terrible! I could somewhat understand the emotionless voice of Oscar (I kind of liked it actually) but Ashley's voice did not fit at all. I couldn't give an example but once heard you do not want to hear it again. It is too cutesy and princess-like. Unfortunately, I had to listen to it all game. The cutscenes were a good length, short and sweet. They were not very interesting though. Also, I would like to mention the enviroment. Half the game the player is navigating through a dump, literally. Personally I do not mind a game that has metal interior walls the whole time but I can see it being annoying for other players. Another thing to point out- the game is ambient with little soundtrack. This allowed me to hear what was going on beyond walls, such as approaching enemies, but it may be annoying to hear silence in the background for some players.\n\nIn the end, I would not recommend this game to another. It was fun and challenging. It had a story that made me keep playing and wanting to know what happened next. Also, the game has good graphics and I enjoyed the physics.\n\nIf you are looking for some challenging puzzles based around fun mechanics then this game is for you. Just endure the voices and short-length. Also don't expect an explosive ending and DO NOT put the game in FULLSCREEN.","July 1, 2014","false","9.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The overall game mechanic really isn't interesting enough to keep my interest long term.  You spend about 10% of your time figuring out how to solve an area, and then 90% of your time battling the physics engine to get everything in place.  On top of that they put enemies in the game.  These are giant balls that follow you around and bump you.  So while you are battling the physics engine, you are simultaneously playing bumping cars with floating balls.  Also, there's falling damage, and if for some reason your timing is off on one of your gloves, you very likely will die.  Be prepared for lots of quick saves and quick loads.  The quick loads aren't exactly "quick" either.  With a non SSD expect to spend a lot of time looking at a portrait of the female protragonist while you wait to do some more trial and error.","July 19, 2015","false","9.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Once that's done, you realize there really isn't that much here to begin with.\nThe key problem is the game's interface.  Controls are slow, imprecise, and laggy as all hell.  Given how often the game is designed to require good timing, fast reactions, and careful item placement, this is a huge strike against it.  I'm not sure if this is just poor design or horrible quality control - when I first started the game up I wasn't even able to move due to being spawned inside the floor, and even though they've fixed this the entire screen is constantly shaking (except, occasionally, when I jump and it snaps into stability) and there's a persistent damage indicator on the screen flickering on and off with varying levels of intensity.\nUnfortunately even if this were patched, it would not be enough to make Twin Sector a good or even passable game.  Frankly if you were to fix the controls, get the screen to stop shaking like my character is having a constant seizure, and speed up the response, you'd be left with a series of puzzles that are disturbingly easy.  All of the difficulty in the design comes from the fact that you're fighting against the controls, and this frankly is not acceptable these days.\nAs for the visuals and atmosphere, I was left sadly unimpressed.  Environments are blocky and I'm pretty sure frequently using textures ripped straight from Half Life 2, with nonsensical machinery designs that seem to mock the very idea of immersion.  It's obvious that Portal's influence is showing here in the level design, but sadly the devs didn't seem to realize that a key reason that the whimsical insanity in Portal worked was because it was in an environment intended to be a puzzle, and nothing else.  Once you left the testing chambers, the world was almost disquietingly normal.\nUnfortunately there is no such conceit in Twin Sector.  This is the real world - a real world where apparently engineers felt you should design a life support generator with a computer console you can only get to if you walk up three flights of stairs, turn off 2 superflous lasers on a catwalk that seems to serve no purpose whatsoever, and then jump 20 feet straight into an open topped cage over the generator's core.  The best part was that once this was done the floor dropped out of said cage so as to let you back out into the room - making that sole console completely inaccessible.  Just a little bit of creative set design here could have fixed this.  Sprinkle in a few broken consoles, dress up the lasers a bit more to make them look like they're actually part of the reactor rather than just arbitrary obstacles, and you actually start forming a cohesive, functional world for this story to be told in.  The makers of Twin Sector obviously either didn't know how, or simply didn't care to put in the effort.","October 30, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

According to O.S.C.A.R., you are the only person who was able to be woken and therefore the only individual capable of saving mankind. Within the next ten hours you will need to repair the broken main generator of the subterranean bunker system in order to reestablish the station's functionality.

So you're probably thinking "Oh yay it's like portal!" well it's not. It tries it's hardest to be portal but it is not. For it to be portal it needs to stop having nasal smegma sex with a diarrhea bubbly ♥♥♥♥♥ with ṣhit coming out the ḍick hole. Honestly the voice acting is ṣhit, the cut scenes are diarrhea, and the only good part of this game is that it was on sale when i bought it for 99 cents which is still a piece of ṣhit deal! I think to expirience a game this ṣhitty, it's such a bad expirience that I need to get paid for this. So please, Headup Games, change the price to negative $500. And I also think that's STILL a bad price. So in closing I would simply like to say, with the $4.99 go pay a male stripper to jiẓẓ mucus into your smegma compartmant, it's a much better deal than buying this piece of diarrheah!\n\nAnd that, is why you don't want to buy this game.","July 5, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

The graphics are a clean shell shaded look and they are kept consistant throughout.\nThe physics; which this is mainly based around, are very good. Do not expect to be fighting things in this though. It is very much like Portal and the only turrets you will find are not meant to be fought. I found out a wierd buggy way.\nThe controls are alright though I believe the menu could do with some changes. (Careful of loud music when you first start the game...)\nI don't think that I have any gripes with this game to be honest. Being a puzzle game I find it hard to pick back up.
