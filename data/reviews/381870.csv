If you are running anything bigger than 1600 X ____ prepare to strain your eyes trying to read the text.\n\nSummary:\nIf you use JoyToKey as the developer noted, you will be very happy with this little puzzle platformer. I just hope someday they add controller support.\n\n\nEDIT: The Developer removed the "Partial Controller Support" that was originally listed in the Steam Store page.

Control is via keyboard; assigning keys for two players is painless. You only need 4 directions, a "use" button, and keys for your two item slots: you can pick up items from crates and then use them anywhere in the level. If the levels in single-player seem somewhat lopsided, as if they were missing terrain, they probably are: the co-op levels are similar, but often contain extra paths that only the smaller koala can take, and extra devices that require both koalas to cooperate. It looks as if the game was designed with co-op in mind, and the levels then "dumbed down" for single player.\n\nThe game does not support controllers, but works well with Joy2key[www.joytokey.net] if you want to use them anyway.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun in local co-op, and ok in single-player.

It is pretty easy to figure out where to go like in first few seconds of each round started. And the difficulty simply dosnt ramps up. The ugrades between levels would be much better with actual choise of parts to build (or decorate) rather then full autoplacement. Also there are few bugs which making it annoying to play. Like, if you trap an opponent but then get killed - that opponent (inside trap) will get killed as well. Or sometimes my enemies getting out of traps for no reason (there is no other enemies on same floor).\n\nThis is braindead game which requires nothing at all to play. It does not have any unique possibilities, art or music - its just a common flash game.","July 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","3","16","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/recommended/381870/","GadgetGamer","GadgetGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/","669 products in account","A simple and easy puzzle platformer, which relies on picking up items that allow you to perform actions. The limitation is that you can only hold two of these items at a time, so you have to plan ahead to see which item you can afford to lose when you want to pick up another one. One item is a bouncy pig that you can jump on to get to a higher point. Dynamite blows up rocks (and rocks only). Water douses hot rocks so you can walk on them. And a donkey kicks you across horizontal gaps.\n\nThe difficulty doesn't change as you progress through the game. That's OK though, as it means you can play a few levels at a time when you have 10 minutes to spare without having to jump straight into a hard section.\n\nIt would suit young players, as you don't kill enemies; just avoid or trap them. (Actually, you can use a switch to close doors that effectively kill enemies if they are in the doorway, but that isn't really in keeping with the spirit of the game). At no point did I get stuck not knowing how to progress. The graphics are cutesy too and should be attractive to young people.\n\nI just did a quick test of coop mode. This would be a ideal game to play with a young person and an older child or adult, as the second character is an adorable little baby koala. You can see this at the bottom left on the screenshot below. The levels seem to be different in coop mode, and it does appear to be possible to play them in as a single player if you switch between characters yourself - thus doubling the value of the game! (I have only tested the early levels in coop mode)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660294047","April 6","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visuals are minimal but functional, the sound department is OK, and the controls are tight - always important in a platformer. I actually find the controller "support" funny, but it plays well on the keys as well.\nThe gameplay itself is fun - you move around obstacles with your Koala while using helping items (high jump, long jump, explosives, etc.), of which you can carry two at a time. You collect treasure to unlock cosmetic additions, or just make it to the end of the level to progress. There are 20 locations with 3-4 levels each.\nThe game is lightly challenging, but nothing to difficult. And, it's swift. No unnecessary timewasting when dying, when going back to the menu, when going between levels, etc. When you spend time with the game, you spend it playing. I could name (quite) a few developers who should follow this example.\n\nWith the above virtues, it's easy to recommend Koala Kids as light casual entertainment as long as the pricing is right - it's good value at the current 3 EUR.\n","April 24","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
