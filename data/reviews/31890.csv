I also learnt a bit about the Mayans.\n\nThere aren't many locations, but enough to keep up the interest. I'll give another one of these titles a go in a couple of months as if they are similar to this one, they provise decent entertainment for a few evenings.","January 13, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I've played a lot of Nancy Drew games. This is not one of my favorites. I actually don't care for it that much. The fact that the game doesn't even start off a mystery is a little, well, droll. Essentially, you start off wih tasks to do (which I found rather boring) and after doing some you get thrown into a case. I could just be picky, but I'm almost done with the game and I just don't care for it.","January 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You're helping out at a musuem at first, which means a lot of boring tasks you have to do before the case even starts. And even once things pick up you STILL have to finish all your meaningless tasks to progress through the game. Solving the mystery in this game always feels like a second thought since Nancy is stuck having to do everything else. And even when you DO solve it the story isn't very memoriable.\n\nWasn't bad, had it's fun moments but not the best ND title.","June 23, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It starts off with "not so much detective puzzles" but rather "work puzzles", but that's alright. It didn't take me long to get pen +paper out. As soon as the proper crime happened, though, it got gradually more interesting.\n\nWhat was bugging me the most, from a practical point of view, were the long documents on Nancy's laptop because of the lack of scrollbar handles and hinderingly slow scrolling arrows. That and the fact that your savegames say nothing useful at all, not even a timestamp. Just "Something is saved here" â€“ literally!\n\n6.0 / 10.0","May 29","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
