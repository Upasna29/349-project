After playing so many "meh" adventures, and i'm an adventuregame lover, my favorites the last years is the  "Book of unwritten tales" games. They do the pop culture thing soo right, and the humour is great, which others do alot in an excessive forced way, like Sam & Max, even though i like those one too. Graphics are great, voicing are great. This one, after just 20 mins after playing,  i knew it was a GREAT adventure game.

It tells you more about Critter and how he met Nate. It's a bit under half the length of the first game.\n\nOn the positive side..\n- Critter was my least favorite character in the previous game, and the prequel did redeem him in my eyes somewhat.\n- No more terribly compressed cutscenes, everything is crisp.\n- Animations may have been better, but I'm not 100% sure about it.\n\nBut,\n- Puzzles made much less sense this time and I'd not recommend the game to a casual adventure game player who's trying to avoid peeking in a walkthrough a few times.\n- Absence of Wilbur, the most charming Book of Unwritten Tales character.\n- In some places (Arch-Mage's tower) the item swapping mechanics really made the game tedious, as you had to go across 5 or 6 screens to swap an item between the characters, and then go all that way back. And this could happen few times in a row.\n\nIf you'd like to get into this series, I'd probably recommend starting with the first game because it was a lot better overall, even though this one is a direct prequel story-wise.\n\n\nSloth Academy rating: 4 silver sloths.","October 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Much of the artwork flows like an oil painting plus the animations give it an extra level of depth and personality. It is obvious the writers and voice actors had a lot of fun in their roles. The game puts several Star Wars parodies in the storyline as well as a few references to Portal.

I absolutely loved The Book of Unwritten Tales, but the Critter parts? Not so funny. I never really enjoyed controlling this non speaking character, always having to guess what I might be saying, after a couple of minutes I always got bored or irritated. But this spin-off (and prequel), The Criiter Chronicles? Don't ask me why, but it totally works.\n\nThe story is simple but entertaining, in this game we finally understand WHAT is Critter. Part of an alien race crashed on the planet, we have to help him and his mates get a crucial part of their ship back from the... evil, for lack of a better term, Munkus. We will also meet again some of the characters from Unwritten Tales, like Ma'zaz, discover how Critter became friend with Nate and visit many locations of the previous game. Dialogues are funny and full of pop culture references, puzzles aren't extremely hard, but a couple of moments may be really challenging if you don't pay attention to your surroundings. Plus, a Portal (as in the Valve franchise) based puzzle? Yes, please!\n\nThe Critter Chronicles is a solid game. Not extraordinary, but surely interesting and rewarding to play. Even if there are a lot of references to the previous game, it is completely possible to play one without having played the other, the two adventures are totally indipendent. Nice game.","September 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Puzzles are more difficult and felt more far-fetched, and I had to use a walkthrough several times, whereas remember having to use one maybe once for the original.

Generally I could always figure out what needed to be done once I found the right items, without resorting to much trial and error.  Critter Chronicles, however, strays a bit too far into the territory of some of the more egregious 90s adventure game leaps of logic where the solution is stumbled upon only by exhausting all possible options.  More than likely at some point will need to resort to the process of trying to use every item on every other item and hotspot - which is made even more frustrating by having to rather slowly transfer items between two characters, one at a time.\n\nForgetting the puzzles, the game still retains much of the charm of BoUT.  It's still well acted (though Critter's "dialog" did start to grate on me as the game went on) and nice to look at, but the cast and overall scope of the game is much reduced compared to BoUT.  It comes out feeling a bit thin as a result.\n\nTo a certain extent it seems perhaps a bit unfair to hold it up to the standards of the excellent original BoUT, but that's naturally what one would compare it against, since Critter Chronicles is presumably meant for fans of BoUT.  The bottom line is unfortunately that all but the most fanatical of BoUT fans could safely skip Critter Chronicles without feeling like they missed out.  I don't regret playing the game, but knowing what I do now, I wouldn't regret having skipped it either.","July 30, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, that is not the case with "TBoUT: the Critter Chronicles" which feels like a failed experiment, prior TBoUT2, for testing various game concepts.\n\nThe two difficulty options "normal" and "hard" causes far too complicated puzzles on the harder setting. Other puzzles gets harder by having all spoken clues removed. The normal setting is playable but sometimes a puzzle just "ends" without any visible progress feedback since the "hard part" has been cut.\n\nThe gibberish speak from Critter itself overstays its welcome fairly rapidly and I quickly tried to maximize the playtime using captain Nate. The other two playable characters from TBoUT1/2 Wilbur Weatherwane and Ivo, are unfortunately not present.\n\nEssentially the Critter Chronicles feels much more unpolished and rushed in comparison to TBoUT1 and 2.","December 27, 2015","false","22.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Critter Chronicles is fun, and reminds me of classic point click games I played as a kid.  The problem with the game, and a reason I wouldn't recommend the game, is to those who have little patience for unfixed bugs.   This game will crash at the Yeti cave, and there is no way around it.  So basically you can only play half way.\n\nThe original "Book of unwritten tails (BoUT): part 1" had a bug where I had to load someone elses game in order to continue playing, which defeats the purpose, but the bright side is... I could actually finish BoUT: 1.  No matter how nice BoUT: critter chronicles is, the fact that I can't continue playing it after the yeti cave kind of destroys the credibility of a game.\n\nUpdate:  I posted the original review Nov 19, 2014.  It is currently May 17, 2016. No one has contacted me or commented on this review to inform "me/other forums" as of why this yeti crash continues to occur.  It could be because I have an updated Windows (10), but they have no interest in their buyers or helping anyone out with these issues in the games. So, this also gets me to be very skeptical on considering "Book of Unwritten Tales 2."  Which by the way, also has complaints about many bugs when you look up their reviews/forums. This is the only reason why I did not purchase it immediately.   Just Sad.","November 19, 2014","false","2.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

You can still turn on the Show Points so you won't have pixel hunting even in HARD mode.\nBut the riddles are difficult enough in front of the first part of the series.\nIf you play the game in normal mode you 'll have more hints by the characters and you 'll miss a couple of riddles. Generally the game does NOT change much. So play it at hard anyway!\n\nThe graphics are about the same with the difference of the settings. You don't have complicated settings like AA Anisotropic or Antialiasing. You choose between smoothness and Picture quality and that's it.  Well in the first part the antialising thing mattered . I had it in 8X. Here the differences are small to nothing. Try "Low" in smoothness and "Medium" in picture quality. The last one sets the textures sent to the graphic card. If set to the best it will sent uncompressed textures directly to the graphics card so even the best cards may NOT handle some scenes and you ll have glitches. You have more vivid colors but the difference is that and ONLY that. So set it to medium and enjoy the game with more earth colors. The graphics are 3D Indie so the colors are vivid enough anyway.\n\nI wasn't amazed by the story BUT is better than the fisrt part and you have the critter to break the ice and makes you laugh.

It doesn’t exactly reach the same level of excellence as BoUT did, but it’s still a fun little adventure game.\n\nLong version:Critter Chronicles was created to fix the greatest error in the first Book of Unwritten Tales: not enough Critter. It also serves as a prequel, telling the tale of how Critter and Nate met and eventually wound up as the two hapless travelling companions you found in the clutches of an ork bounty huntress.\n\nAs a game it functions more or less as an expansion pack: it’s about half as short, features only three main locations, and two controllable characters. Luckily the humour remained, albeit in much smaller doses.\nThe shortness is compensated by increased difficulty, including a larger dependence on character switching. The helpful hotspots remained, but even that is not enough to brute-force your way through everything.\n\nThe levels are less detailed– mostly because most of the game takes place on a desolate iceland– and there are very huge chunks where the designers just used high-resolution 2D images instead of elaborate 3D models. Since the engine is the same, the clipping issues remained too, but maybe they are a bit more frequent than they should be.\n\nThese mistakes don’t turn Critter Chronicles into a bad game, far from it, but they make it recommended mostly for those who are familiar with the original Book of Unwritten Tales.","December 31, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I get that the Nate character is this ne'er do well who turns into a hero despite himself, but it was just tedious.","June 28, 2014","false","10.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I have to agree with other reviewers here and say that while this game has some gorgeous visuals, having 3 chapters out of 5 taking place in the same 4-5 screens hurts  the game significantly. Especially when the puzzles in those chapters are the least intuitive in the game.\n\nFor example the chapter in which you get to play Critter for the first time - I wasn't really sure what I was trying to achieve so I spent a lot of time running from screen to screen interacting with everything I could. The solutions aren't as farfetched here as I felt they were in Deponia though. Maybe I'm just generally dense.\n\nAs for the story, I still enjoyed it very much even though it is fairly classic. I was especially delighted by some of the references and I laughed at every altercation Nate and Zazi had.\n\nWould I recommend this game? If you are a fan of BoUT and this game happens to be on sale, I'd say you should buy it. It is playable without a walkthrough. Otherwise, just play the original BoUT. You won't really miss anything.\n\n","October 4, 2015","false","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even home produced TV content still pumps out fake snow during the Christmas specials despite us all knowing that it’ll only ♥♥♥♥ it down with rain.\n\nSo I was quite pleased that my assignment over the festive break was to review the snow heavy The Book Of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles. It’s a happy go lucky entry into the point and click adventure genre that’s full of warmth and good humour, if lacking in certain other departments.\n\nA prequel to the first game, The Book Of Unwritten Tales, you start the game as Nate, on the run with a questionably acquired airship before you are attacked by a bounty hunter seeking to return the ship back to its owner, along with yourself for punishment.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth across the same few screen locations and some relatively easy puzzle solving to rid yourself of your pursuer. The plan immediately backfires and you end up crashing into the cold tundra of the Northlands. It’s here that you meet the star of the show, Critter, and the rest of his tribe. As with the previous game, you can switch between both characters in order to solve the puzzles that will help you both escape from the frozen wastes.\n\nthe book of unwritten tales the critter chronicles image\n\nSolving puzzles in Critter Chronicles was relatively easy, and that’s coming from someone who usually struggles with such things. I assumed briefly that maybe I was no longer stupid but sadly that is not the case at all. The ease of the game is mainly down to one the fundamental issue I have with it. The heavy and repetitive use of backgrounds and locations. Even by two thirds of the game through I think I could count the number of backdrops on one hand. There is a significant amount of location re-use that does mean you’ll never get too lost trying to solve puzzles, there are only so many permutations you can attempt before you stumble across the right one. The net result is that the game that feels more like a smallish DLC episode rather than a title priced at £17.99, so I’m not convinced about the entry retail price here. It’s questionable.\n\nSo what does it get right? Firstly atmosphere, the game world is beautifully drawn and realised, even though the human characters don’t shine quite as much as the their creature counterparts. The game has a warm hearted comedic tone that gave me a few good chuckles throughout. Whilst the first chapter was rather dry and plodding in nature, the introduction of the Muppet inspired alien Critter and his species really liven up the second and third acts. Playing the game as Critter made for some very amusing moments, particularly as eats and pulls out of his stomach all of the items you acquire, and his imitation of certain objects when you click on them. The game also features an ultra adorable baby critter and an ingenious use for penguins that could solve the world’s energy demands if harnessed on a large enough scale.\n\nthe book of unwritten tales the critter chronicles image\n\nThe voice acting features some lively performances that could have easily been lifted from a Saturday morning cartoon. However it can sometimes sound as though the developers have rounded up a local amateur dramatics society, with some of the acting sounding very forced, particularly with the lead Nate. The score that accompanies the game is also quite enjoyable to listen to and fits in perfectly with the light hearted fantasy world that has been developed.\n\nOverall The Critter Chronicles was an enjoyable slice of point and click adventure. It has a warm heart and some lovingly realised characters. Ultimately though, much like the frozen desolate wastelands, the game feels too isolated from the world itself. A sparse cast of characters and repetitive use of locations makes the game feel very narrow in focus.\n\nWhilst the puzzles are quite simplistic, that could be considered a bonus for those of you that enjoy the telling of a story more than the taxing of the brain. I wouldn’t hesitate to snap up this game and its predecessor, The Book Of Unwritten Tales, if you see them going for a good price on Steam.\n\n6.5/10\n","May 11, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a shorter story lasting around 8 to 10 hours depends on your play style, and tells the prequel story of how Nate and Critter first met each other, and their adventures that takes place before the original game.\n\nOnce again it is another light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to lots of fantasy and RPG stereotypes and old adventure games. In fact one of the puzzle solution near the end of the game would not make much sense to someone who had not played a certain Lucasarts adventure game before. For those who have played it however, it certainly a funny and nostalgic treat.\n\nWhile this game is shorter then its predecessor, the puzzles felt alot more devious and require you to think out of the box (at least for the hard mode version). More then once I had to consult a walkthrough as puzzle solutions can be a little cryptic.\n\nThe annoyances that plague its predecessor continue with this game such as not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical "mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable" type of situations. This game doesn't end in a cliffhanger, but it would have been nice if it was tied directly to the first game.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nDefinitely pick this up if you enjoyed the first game in the series. For newcomers, I recommend playing the first game to better understand and appreciate some of the story elements in this game even though it is a prequel. Be forewarned, the hard mode of this game is alot more challenging then the original game.","June 29, 2013","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a shorter story lasting around 8 to 10 hours depends on your play style, and tells the prequel story of how Nate and Critter first met each other, and their adventures that takes place before the original game.\n\nOnce again it is another light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to lots of fantasy and RPG stereotypes and old adventure games. In fact one of the puzzle solution near the end of the game would not make much sense to someone who had not played a certain Lucasarts adventure game before. For those who have played it however, it certainly a funny and nostalgic treat.\n\nWhile this game is shorter then its predecessor, the puzzles felt alot more devious and require you to think out of the box (at least for the hard mode version). More then once I had to consult a walkthrough as puzzle solutions can be a little cryptic.\n\nThe annoyances that plague its predecessor continue with this game such as not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical "mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable" type of situations. This game doesn't end in a cliffhanger, but it would have been nice if it was tied directly to the first game.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nDefinitely pick this up if you enjoyed the first game in the series. For newcomers, I recommend playing the first game to better understand and appreciate some of the story elements in this game even though it is a prequel. Be forewarned, the hard mode of this game is alot more challenging then the original game.","June 29, 2013","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzles are inventory based, with a few minigames thrown in. None of the puzzles are too hard, although I did get stuck once on a minigame and had to consult a walkthrough. About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way.

It is a shorter experience (8h vs 13h for me) and not with as many characters. Which is certainly a weakpoint in my opinion. Since they cost about the same I would certainly recommend the original game over this one.\n\nThe story and voice acting are pretty good... though the parody stuff and the "do you see what I am referencing? Do you? Look closer! Are you sure you see it!?!" type of pop culture referencing from the original game still keeps a lot of the characters from being as amusing as they could have been. And unfortunately Nate's and the Critter's backstories do not really flesh them out as characters very well.\n\nThe puzzles do suffer quite severly from the same simplified inventory system that Unwritten Tales, but I think to an even higher degree. Since it is so easy to combine the right objects together and find where they are to be placed (only the right ones will give the option to combine except in a few, very rare, circumstances when you get a witty remark instead), they seem to have tried to compensate by having really ridiculous and stupid solutions to problems. This often means you are combinging things and placing things without logic or reason, but only because you have an item and a place.\n\nObviously this is a problem in a lot of point and clicks, but the Critter Chronicles really take it to the next level. Since it is so easy (even on Hard) this is not so much frustrating though as... unsatisfactory. It gets a bit better when you are able to control the critter as well since this does force you to think a little bit more about what you want to use where... but the barrier is still quite low and it becomes a case of moving all items between characters to find who will do the thing you want them to do.\n\nIn the end I will recommend this game (if you've already played the original and liked it), but I would suggest playing it for the characters more than the gameplay. You will not find a challenging puzzle experience here if you're a veteran puzzle player, but maybe a laugh here and there.","January 30, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game tells us about Critter and his(?) people and how he and Nate meet.\n\n+ Very good voice acting and nice music\n+ Atmospheric hotspots\n+ Ok story and pop culture references\n+ Difficulty setting\n- Annoying human main character\n- Some bugs\n- A few unskippable cutscenes\n\nOverall I'd say this game is slightly better than the first game even though Nate is still quite annoying. Many good features from the first game are found in this game as well. Again the voice acting is very good, the music fitting and the story being told only lacks because the game doesn't take itself too serious while making as many references to pop culture as is possible without being annoying - hinted at are Star Wars, Star Trek, Batman, Borat, The Simpsons and more.\n\nAs said before, Nate is annoying which is irritating because we spent quite a lot of time with him. Although he'll show nice traits from time to time, especially when it's about something important, Nate acts like a self-centered, narcissistic buffoon when interacting with other people. As The Mary put it: "There is something about you that makes me wish I could move my arms."\n\nI encountered  a number of small bugs which didn't obstruct the flow of the game.\nWhen Critter closes the hatch after Ma'Zaz is trapped the hatch clips behind the door of the closet.\nThe closet is missing its right door later in the game.\nIn case you have the horse shoe on a string in your inventory when making the Baby-Critter-sandwich the horse shoe will vanish from your inventory.\n\nThe game features two difficulty settings, normal and hard. Where normal plays quite like the first game with spacebar showing hotspots and the current mission. On hard mode hotspot display is deactivated by default and the solutions to puzzles often take a few more steps than they would on normal. I'd suggest playing on hard first.\nThe game has again the atmospheric hotspots that add to setting up the scenery but vanish once explored leaving only the important hotspots - very helpful.\nSince the game has steam achievements some of which are bound to the difficulty setting the game basically requires two play-throughs. For that reason I would have liked to be able to skip the cutscenes between chapters.\n\nEven more than the first game The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles is easily recommendable. It's no Sam&Max or Monkey Island but still a good and solid game. I had fun with both books.","February 15, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/221830/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","This is the prequel to the original game and it tells the story of one of the 3 main characters from that game, with his sidekick getting a much expanded role in this installment.\n\nAnd that is also one of the biggest drawbacks of the game, in the original game you had at certain points in the game the option to control 3 distinct and interesting characters. Here you can control 2, however one of them does not speak in a human language, so there are no helpful hints from him when you are inspecting items. This means that controlling him is annoying and a frustrating experience when you are limited to only that character for solving certain puzzles\n\nIt is interesting to see the genesis of a few characters, especially since in the original it was left as a big question unaswered. And the story itself is quite nice, however I will say that the puzzle design is noticably weaker this time around. And the game seems to be not up to the same quality as its predecessor, as there are quite a few issues with clipping, and a serious game crashing bug connected with a puzzle that can only be avoided by making sure the game is constantly busy during that puzzle.\n\nThe game does retain its charm though, and it makes for an OK entry in the franchise.\n\n5½  / 10","August 3, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was interesting, but it really suffered from bad puzzle design. It's really inconsistent in the way it handled the puzzles, and there's way too much guesswork involved in the solutions.\n\nHere's an example of a bad puzzle (of which there are many), I'll be vague and won't spoil the exact solution: There's a part in the game where you'll have to disguise yourself. There are no clues as to who you are supposed to be disguised as, and the solution is a homage to an older adventure game from a different developer, which is almost impossible to guess. The only way to solve this puzzle is to try all item combinations and pray that it works.","May 17","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also found myself turning to walkthroughs more often for this one. As critter doesn't speak english, he doesn't give very good prompts.\n\nIt is worth buying on sale to finish out the story if you've played the first two. If you haven't played the first two, you should start at the beginning. The first game is the best, and sets a necissary foundation for the other two.\n\n8/10","June 5","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
