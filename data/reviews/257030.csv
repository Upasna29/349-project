Alongside the sweet graphics, this game offers an intriguing plot (all two acts of it), and the missions showcase a great balance between "destroy this" and "protect that". The voice-acting and subtitles are a little suspect, but the space-opera vibe is appreciated.\n\nMost importantly, the game is a lot of fun. The controls are fluid, and allow the player to easily soar in-between scores of enemy mechs. I love the amount of freedom available to the player. Enemy targets can be approached from any direction, and the chaos can take place anywhere, even at insanely high altitudes. The ability to boost from the ocean to the end of Earth's atmosphere in less than two seconds is just awesome. I also appreciate the little things, like how Survival Mode's scoring changes, depending on which mech is used. The slow-motion button is also really cool. Sometimes I use it just to admire some kills. Altogether, Project Nimbus is fast, frenetic, and very entertaining, and it'll undoubtedly impress gamers when it's finally completed.\n\nBut I believe that the game can be even better.\n\nFirst off, I'm not too concerned about the amount of content in this game. The final version is going to include 27 missions, a "sand-box" mode, and Survival. While you can't expect a Path of Exile amount of hours from Project Nimbus, you're certain to get your money's worth. However, If I could make a suggestion right now, it would be for additional maps in Survival mode. These maps could offer different sets of enemies, and perhaps even unique lay-outs. Perhaps the developer is already kicking around this idea, and they're just setting it aside until the campaign is finished. In any case, I expect this game to deliver in terms of content.\n\nSecondly, it's worth pointing out that there are some technical issues present in the game. I had to restart a mission early on, because an enemy had somehow become trapped inside a building. The option to toggle v-sync is currently unavailable, which results in some bad screen-tearing. A number of the effects - such as bullets and booster-trails - look unfinished. The frame-rate can also take some knocks in a few missions. The camera can also be problematic depending on the current situation, but I'd hard-pressed to come up with a 3D game that hasn't suffered from camera troubles. These issues can be resolved, so I'm not too worried. Even now, the quality of the game still shines through these problematic aspects.\n\nNow this is where it gets complicated. I have a few suggestions of my own that I'm going to share. While I believe that implementing them could make Project Nimbus an even better game, the possibility exists that it could have the opposite effect. Honestly, I probably shouldn't say anything, because I adhere to one of the strictest rules of game-design:\n\nDo not give the player exactly what they want.\n\nThis is a rule that can go hand-in-hand with the saying: "It's not for everyone". If a game tries to do everything for any and all gamers, the final result is liable to be very bland and unremarkable. For the most part, the development team should stick to their vision, and try not to accommodate the whims of the gaming populace. All that said, here are my suggestions for improving Project Nimbus.\n\n- The sword needs tweaking. Usually melee weapons in mecha games are immensely satisfying. Here, it just doesn't quite hit the mark. Most of the time it feels like swings don't actually connect, and my mech will just move past the target, and they may or may not be destroyed. It's hard to appreciate a good melee kill. To counter this, I'm thinking that the mech should swing the sword downwards, or perhaps at an upward angle. Better yet, there could be two melee attacks, with the trade-off being that the more powerful one can stop the mech just in front of their target, which could leave them open to attack. One thing I've noticed is that the sword seems to work better when not locked on to a target.\n\n- Larger explosions. While I'm no rocket surgeon, I know when the "Heck Yeah!" sensors in my brain are being tripped. Destroying an enemy and being treated to a worthy explosion never really gets old. Granted, if the explosions are too large they can become disorienting, so it's best to shoot for a subtle but still noticeable effect. Also, while it can be difficult to notice (due to distance and scale), I'd like to see enemies shatter to pieces when they explode(especially when hit by a powerful gun). On occasion, I'll see a transporter or other ship break apart, but the effect looks rather cheap. Maybe the inside of the mechs (at least the parts that are exposed to the player) should have a basic "circuitry" texture. Players notice it enough to say "Wow! That's cool!" but not to the point where they'll think "Wait. Does that make sense?"\n\n- Better damage indicators. Whenever your mech takes damage in this game, the screen turns red. I think it would be less distracting (and possibly more immersive) if damage caused the UI to scramble for a second, or even just blink red. The damage to the UI should match the severity of the weapon. A few bullets from a machine-gun should feel very different compared to getting hit with a missile spread or a blast from an ion cannon. The UI effects shouldn't be permanent though; just a visual effect to get the point across.\n\n- Changes to the weapon system. Currently, the Mirai and its variants are a little overpowered. This is mostly due to the presence of smart missiles and funnels (AI drones). I propose that there should be a customizable load-out before each mission. This would give players the opportunity to select different guns. Furthermore, these load-outs would limit which weapons could be taken along. There's really no reason to have both missiles and funnels, as they offer the player the option to stay far away from most engagements and let the automatic weaponry do all the work. I suggest that players should be forced to make a choice, but also have a selection of weapons that allow them greater flexibility to develop their play-style.\n\nAgain, these are all just suggestions. Even if the developer of this game were to ignore them all*, I would still consider Project Nimbus a game worth looking into. Its development still has a long way to go, so I'll be sure to keep you all updated as it progresses.\n\n*Although I really think they should look into the whole "screen turning red" business.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 21","true","3.8"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","55","57","2","2"

I think at this point, I'm just repeating what everyone else has said... But there's a reason for that!\nVerdict - 7.5/10Scroll to the bottom for an Overall\n\n\n\nCombat - 8/10:\nYou have two choices to pick from, lock-on targeting and shooting freely. I'll say this now, you will end up using just the lock-on mode (Right Click) all of the time which comes with a small close-range camera of the enemy and their health bar. At first I was a bit 'iffy' about this but after about 20 minutes I didn't mind it at all. The first couple of levels are pretty basic, you get a Machine-gun and Rockets, there's not really that much to do other than get used to the movement of the game. As soon as you reach the 3rd level though you get access to a whole new collection of weapons ranging from the Machine-gun and Rockets to OP Drones (Funnels) that shoot down enemy projectiles and attack the enemies when you lock-on - and when accompanied with the small lock-on camera you get you can see the little drones swarm your enemy just for that added effect. I won't spoil any of the other weapons for you but I can say that they are all fun to use and become even better when you see your enemy get vaporised to dust on the small lock-on camera! Overall, the combat is really fun and satisfying, if you don't mind the lock-on (Which I might add doesn't make it easy) combat system then you'll probably enjoy this.\n\n\nLevel Design - 6/10:\nI would like to give the level design a higher score but really it's just being attacked by enemies in waves. The first act is pretty basic, some of the levels are great where you have objectives but others are just very 'meh' where you just get attacked by wave after wave until you complete the level. As the levels progress they do improve; to the point where it's obvious that the Developers have become a little more ambitious and have decided to try out new things. They intend to make 4 acts, each with about 6 levels in each and currently they are on Act 2 Level 2. So there's plenty of room for improvement.\n\n\nGraphics - 8/10:\nThe graphics are debatable. Up-close they aren't that good, but the thing is you'll never actually go up close and as a result the graphics actually look pretty damn great. Saying that; they aren't spectacular either, but I think this is mostly because most to all of the levels are just open air where you've got nothing but sky above you and nothing but water below you. Just for the sake of mentioning it you can press F1 to remove the HUD. Here's a screenshot I took of the game so decide for yourself really but remember, the HUD covers quite a bit of the screen at times and having no reference of size can really boggle your brain when it comes to judging distances. The graphics on the world on the other hand are pretty standard in all honesty, but like I said, most levels are nothing but sky and sea.\n\n\nStory - 5/10:\nThe story is average, the characters are pretty bland - but the voice acting is alright - and there is barely any actual information on the lore other than the short ~20 second cut-scenes at the beginning of each level and the dialogue that's passed between the characters. It doesn't really do anything wrong or particularly bad in any way, it just doesn't really do anything at all. Basically, don't buy this game if you're looking for a good story, because you definitely won't find it here.\n\n\nAudio - 8/10:\nLike I said, the voice acting is surprisingly decent, the writing could do with a little work to build the characters up a little better, and the sub-titles are riddled with grammatical errors - for example apostrophes  '  appear as □ (As well as grammatical errors littered across the game in general - "Option" instead of "Options"). As for the actual game sound, it's decent, nothing that really makes you go "Wow!" but nothing that makes you think "Damn this is annoying *mute*". The music is great though, it's the typical Heavy Metal background music, similar to Killing Floor 1. It blends in with the game really well and the music hits at just the right moments, likewise there are some errors with the music as well, for example on some levels the music is unaffected by the options and really overpowers all other sound, I imagine these will be fixed sooner or later as this is an Early Access game after all. The audio is an overall 'Great' simply because of the music and how well it fits in with the game.\n\n\nOverall - 7.5/10\nOverall, I really enjoyed playing this game. It's nice to see Developers trying out some of the old game-play styles again and it's good to see a game similar to Zone of the Enders being developed after the third one never came out. It is in Early Access however so remember to take everything with a pinch of salt as it may or may not represent the final product.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 83 of 106 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","83","106","6","12"

That's exactly how it is in this game. Just like in Armored Core, you get a lock-on feature, and just like in AC, it's annoying, but useful.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fast paced\n-Reminds me of Armored Core\n-Guns, Rockets, LOTS of explosions\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Only two Acts at this time\n-Lock-on feature zooms in too much\n-ZERO customization\n-No way to upgrade/buy new weapons\n\n\nHonestly, it really does remind me of Armored Core, but unlike it, I'm stuck with one mech for a couple of chapters, then I get shoved into a more nimble mech with six or seven different weapons, and it's just a headache trying to figure out how to utilize them to the fullest. I would like to suggest a sort of tutorial where you could try each and every one. Granted, a few are self explanatory, but the others require more detail.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo, I finally got off my ♥♥♥ long enough to hop back onto Project Nimbus, only to find it to be a chaotic mess. Good gods, the second act starts off with the Chinese, then gravitates a little towards the Americans, then forces you into the Russian's side of things, and finally brings you back to the first girl from Act 1. There's little room for character development because of this, which annoyed me to no end.\n\nWith Armored Core you have, at the very least, the ability to pick which path you'd like to follow. Whereas PN simply drops you into the hot seat of whatever point of view they wish for you to be a part of. It just feels too damn rushed, in my own opinion.\n\nI'm glad the developers put in a way to change out mechs, but there's STILL zero customisations when it's all said and done. By the way, that's only towards the middle of the second act, and nowhere else in the game.\n\nI don't know, folks. If there was a "Meh" rating, I'd give it instead of saying yes or no in recommending the game. I'll keep it at a "Yes" for now, though, but my personal rating for the game dropped to 6/10 for lack of character development.","December 17, 2014","true","4.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

Controls-wise need some getting use to since you can't customize it(at least not in-game), and while WASD is used to move around as per normal, you use E & C to fly up/down, which makes the otherwise completely free aerial movement feel a bit uncomfortable. The action feels really fast, but combat may feel quite draggy considering the difficulty in landing hits(missiles & funnels ftw!) and it lacks a satisfying hit confirmation. The lock-on system can be a bit annoying at times since it automatically locks on to the next target and focuses your camera on it rather than un-lock on kill. To the credit of the developers though, they recognized these issues and I applaud them for adding Bullet Time, the option to vary the intensity of the camera focus during lock-on and being able to toggle off lock on rather than make it fully automatic.\n\nI would recommend buying to support the developers in polishing this gem, especially if you're a big fan of mecha and games similar to Ace Combat.\n\nEDIT (17 Nov 20214): The developers have recently patched the game to include a hit indicator.","November 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

While the full campaign is not released yet, it seems like a SLIGHTLY more involved version of the Armored Core 4A plot with poor people living on a polluted surface world with rich folk safe in the skies.\n\nAlthough the game is currently in early access, it is still capable of offering an enjoyable romp though clearly, some issues need to be worked out in order to consider this game "top notch" in comparison to the other games it is channeling.\n\nFlight comabt: because of the high speed nature of the game and the fairly small scale of models, it is virtually impossible to play without locking onto your targets constantly. This lock on quickly establishes a sense of disorientation as you become a wasp flying in spheres around your target. A quick examination of Armored Core 4 Answer (yes I name this one alot since it is, for me, the pinnacle of high speed mech combat) could probably offer the devs a deeper set of ideas for how to handle high speed combat by adding real weight to the machine you are flying in and a more noticeable effect upon quick boosting.\nAs a quick addition, there is no system in place to keep you from colliding with the world around you as you dogfight, given the way you fly in spheres while being locked on and boosting to avoid dying this means you may crash into the ground or buildings very easily while trying to target things.\n\nWeapon Systems: There is nothing in place besides the enemy health bar which is fairly small on 1920x1080 to know if you actually landed hits or not, with missiles especially, the game boils down to firing off all your weapons over and over as fast as possible while dodging around until stuff blows up. It is fun but could be improved greatly.\nAlso, the railguns, while useful, come across as very inaccurate unless you catch an enemy with a luck shot or it is one of the less intelligent drone level AIs you are fighting.\nThe sword especially feels almost useless in its current form as even attempting to attack a capital ship that stands virtually motionless was a tedious proposition. The range on the blade is almost 0 and the idea of slowing down enough to effectively line up the attack or even know you hit with it is almost lethal every time.\n\nOverall, the core idea of the game is good, the story elements are EXTREMLY light though not quite as light as Armored Core 4A. The Gameplay mechanics are, at their root, very fun but still quite rough around the edges. This is definitely a game to watch and be appreciated since there is not enough high speed mech combat in the world anymore.\n\nTo the Devs: I really really hope you read this, and do a serious examination of Armored Core 4 Answer because that game is a more serious version of what you are trying to make here in regards to high speed mech combat and physics. (Yes 4A begins more oriented towards ground combat but it is entirely possible to have a high speed, virtually endless flight design for your Mech within just a few missions using the right parts). Zone of the Enders 2 would also be one to consider drawing from.\n\nI am not saying that you should copy either game exactly, but rather that you should look at these earlier games within your genre and work to build off of their ideas rather than starting over from the ground up.\n\nThe most important aspects of the game that are currently missing is a reworking of frame weight and boosting mechanics to impart a real sense of piloting a big machine within airspace and getting pushed in a direction by high powered jets. Also, an upscaling of the models within the world so it does not feel like you are a HUD shooting at circles and Xs on your screen could help improve the overall experience imparted. On a personal note, please consider some type of tracking for the sword so that you are not simply using a point blank melee attack that would be viable on maybe 1 out of 100 targets in the game.","November 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

To everyone else + Devs, enjoy.  I'll try to make it as humorous as possible.\n\nP.S. (After Review): Despite the crap I'm about to give this game, make no mistake, this is a GREAT game.  I'm just listing off all the bad points.  I still highly recommend it despite the flaws.\n\n---\n\nThis game has many successes yet many faults.  Despite that, it's still a worthwhile game to get.  Don't worry developers, the faults are mostly just plot issues.  MOSTLY.  Like how I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on half the game (please excuse my use of profanity, but I just wanted to make that clear).\n\nBut we'll get to that later.  So, what is Project Nimbus?  Well, I'll tell you what it is: It's a game.  A mech game.  A very fast paced Mech game, faster than Armored Core, faster than Blazblue, faster than all those Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi games.  Suffice to say, this is a VERY fast paced game.  Players of the Armored Core franchise will feel right at home as there is bullets, missiles and mechs EVERYWHERE trying to kill you, but you have bros!  Don't worry about them, they die just as quickly as the rest.\n\nSarcasm aside, this shares many traits from the Armored Core games, mainly in mobility and certain weaponry.  The spacebar (default) will be your best friend.  It does everything from make you boost in all 3 dimensions (unless you're using the mouse and keyboard, then it's like...18 different directions).  You have a boost bar on the left hand side.  The game doesn't do a good job at explaining the UI so you'll have to learn from trial and error.  Speaking of UI, you better like the color green because THAT'S GOING TO BE THE UI...FOR THE ENTIRE GAME, well, entire as in...as far as this early access goes.\n\nNow, gameplay...right gameplay...\n\nIt's very repetitive.  Technically speaking, it's very, very repetitive.  It's mainly, go here, destroy that, go there, destroy that, try not to get shot down, oh you got shot down?  Well checkpoints SUCK.  You'll have to do that entire portion all over again until you see your screen cut to black and your health is back at 100%, then you'll know you have a checkpoint, but I digress.  The game, in all honesty, is repetitive.  Although I do NOT know how you can fix that, I'll let it slide because the gameplay is FUN.  I mean balls deep fun.  I'm just talking about the campaign gameplay though.  The campaign is fun.  The world is enticing despite the DESTINY LEVELS OF LORE THEY GIVE YOU.  WHAT?  WHO?  WHERE?  I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS!  The campaign has that Armored Core feel to it, and you can tell from the gameplay that they took a lot of inspiration from Armored Core.  That also means they decided to take pointers from the same game and make the story nearly undecipherable.  Nearly.  Most of the time, they throw you into a new character every 3-4 missions.  On occasion they'll let you stick with these main characters, AKA: The ones with the cool mechs.\n\nThroughout the game, you'll have two, maybe three main weapons, but the first two are most consistant: The Minigun (10mm I think it was called) and the lock on missile launcher.  Better get good at those two because they're the ones you're going to be using the MOST.  Why?  Because they have the fastest reload time.  You see, the time the game gives you the best mechs: Psycho Gundam and White Glint...I mean this Purple one and Mirai (Future in Japanese), LOOK THEY DON'T TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE PURPLE ONE OKAY (except in Survival, but I'm too lazy to memorize it)!  So, White Glint and Psycho Gundam have SIX WEAPONS.  The minigun, missile launcher, sniper, smart missile, funnel/Psycho Drones and Sword.\n\nNow, throughout the entire game, you'll be playing as either a Russian or a PMC...or was it an American Air Force team...?  I don't know, I think they're PMC.  Anyways, you'll be playing as a PMC or a Russian and you fly around either defending a place by shooting down Gundams and Fighter Jets or you'll be attacking a group of enemies by shooting down Gundams and Fighter Jets.  Beware though, there are these "Ace Pilots" that have better mechs and more accurate weapons!  They rival your mech in speed and durability and are VERY hard to hit.  Throughout the game, you will only get two (arguably 3 if you count the Sonic 06 speed attachment, you'll see after boss #2) which is basically this really annoying Mech and a team of 4 mechs (Black Knights) that will KICK YOUR ♥♥♥.  Despite Boss 2 being a pain, it is quite fun to play through.  I ended up spamming Sword to follow a few mechs and when I was close enough, I gunned them down with my minigun.\n\nIt's at times like this when the game shows it's true colors.  It's too far in between however since most missions will have you play through just stock enemies/cannon fodder.  Basically, you're given the same set of enemies over and over again and I can't blame them for not knowing how to add more variety when you have a game like this.  However, they seem to just throw a controled amount of enemies at you, so little (on normal) that it seems like a joke since you can one hit with your Sniper Rifle.  Combined with the fact that you have allies, quite a lot of them too, it makes the game feel like a joke most of the time.  The AI also seems to get stuck in building cities.  They're too busy dodging that they don't know how to fly up to get out of their pit of doom.\n\nNow, onto my major concerns: the STORY.\n\nBelieve it or not, THERE IS A STORY!  What is it?  I don't know, something to do with terrorists and a huge misunderstanding.  The game does somewhat of a good job at this, letting you play through crutial plot points that unfold the story, usually as a grunt pilot and that somehow has the capability to own ace pilots.  Other than that, all that background information is not explained at all.  There are only 3 things I know about the world: War Broke Out, Flood Happened on 80% of Earth, We're Now in flying cities.  We don't know ANYTHING else.  Main plot?  Terrorists and Misunderstanding!  That's it.  No character development.  You feel NOTHING for these characters.  I don't know what ANY of them look like, except for 2 (because we get anime portraits yay!).  Most characters are forgetable stock characters.  I'm not sure we even have a protaganist.  I hope we do and I hope it's a self insert.\n\nThere are also no cutscenes.  So once you've completed your mission, you're thrown straight into another mission with a short intermission explaining a little background information (A LITTLE) and what you're supposed to do.  That's it.  We have no idea when there's a timeskip (though we definitely notice it) and we have no idea what's going on.\n\nOf course, there are ways to fix this.  The most expensive way would be to add cutscenes into the game.  Maybe a little character development to cute little Mirai.  The most time consuming way would be to turn this into a pseudo Visual Novel.  In all honesty though, I may prefer the latter if we have a skip-text option.  Continuing on the topic of story though, since the game is EVERYWHERE in it's story telling, we have no clear picture of a protagonist.  So far, we have Mirai (the human), Psycho Gundam's Pilot and a mech pilot with a Char Aznable inspired mech...also a guy you play as in mission 2 but he's like never mentioned again, though you KNOW you're playing as him when you're in the White Glint...I mean MIRAI (Mech).\n\nThe lack of consticency is really annoying.  I can live with a new pilot every Arc, but every 2 missions?  No, no thank you.\n\nNow I do have more complaints, but I'm running out of characters to use.  Therefore, I'll end it here on a positive note:\n\nThe game is GREAT.  Everything about it (gameplay wise) is extremely fun to play as.  However, the story and plot left me...wanting more...context I mean.","November 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","70","35","50","18","2"

I like the ariel mech combat as it is intense and exciting, and it keeps that excitement throughout the entirety of each mission. One thing about the campaign, however, is that some of the weapons make one of the mechs the player pilots feel too overpowered (I played it on "Gamer Recommended") and it seems like some of the other battleframes, as they're called in the game, could use a variety of weapons besides MGs and missiles. I would have liked the ability to remap my own controls, but will hold out hope that it will be done in the future.\n\nIn survival and campaign mode, I think that some more optimization and some more stability are in order. One of the times that I played in survival mode, my battleframe was unable to return to the fray because I couldn't tell where it was pointed, which leads me to believe that some of the textures were meant to be boundaries, like the sky texture. In campaign, every time I clicked the mouse in the menu, the game would unpause for a split second, then would remember that it's supposed to be paused. Multiple and repeated clicks garnered the same result. Another thing is that being able to customize battleframes would be a huge plus for this game especially in survival mode or something that can be saved for ACT II, when you make it. Besides the gripes, I can see myself having quite a bit of fun with this game for a while!\n\n\nUPATE\nWhen the optimization came, it completely changed the game! Now things play like they were "supposed" to and the experience (while I dicked around in survival with everything besides Mirai) almost makes it feel like a new game.  I may have to play through the campaign again.","November 8, 2014","true","7.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterDiddles/recommended/257030/","MisterDiddles","TR-8R","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterDiddles/","162 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI really like this game. It reminds me a lot of Armored Core: For Answer and a couple Gundam games like A.C.E. This is an early access game so this review will change depending on the updates given and such.\n\nYou move incredibly fast and are completely free to move where ever you choose making combat very fast paced and hectic. Lock-on makes these skirmishes easier but the problem for me is that it makes it way too easy to kill opponents. Like, I know the Guardians during that prison escape mission are just amateurs in mechs but the moment you lock on, they pose little to no challenge to kill. Even on harder difficulties, anything on the same level as those mechs or even a tiny bit higher are just easy to destroy. This also means the first like 30 waves in Survival are way too easy. Fun mechs to fight against were the terminators and strikers. Tough and fast opponents, durable and have a better chance to actually hit you. The aces (the red ones, I hope they are called that) are very fun to fight against, they are even tougher and it's difficult to take them down especially when there is at least 3. They come in fast and will dodge most of your attacks. They keep you on your toes and make it hard for you especially when they get some fodder to back them up. I don't know if this is actually a thing but I feel like funnels in this game don't come back to you. They just stay in the field in till they get destroyed. Especially when you get another chance to shoot out more funnels, there can be a ♥♥♥♥ing LOT on the field. I personally think it should be that the funnels return to you rather than just swarming the field with them, however they do get destroyed rather quickly against tougher mechs so It really evens out unless there are only weak mechs which there are barely in later missions.\n\nMaps and the mechs look rather pretty and the maps differ from ruined cities, floating colonies, just an open sky etc. The mechs are pretty cool. I don't personally like the sword because it doesn't make you lunge forward so I end up awkwardly clicking my middle mouse to try and hit something with it because I find the animation for it to be rather lacking. Only thing I could possibly say about the maps are that I hate the ones that take place inside colonies. You move so fast and since the camera can just clip through a building sometimes, it gets rather frusturating.\n\nRegardless of the map and mechs sometimes, mission are quite enjoyable. It might get repeitive here and there but I have no problems with that. The only problem I actually have with the missions are that it lacks any narrative. Sure there is a debriefing in the beginning but I didn't know what was going on. Russians appeared out of nowhere and a bunch of dialogue happened but I had no idea who was who or what they were trying to do. So I assumed it was a mix-up then the protagonist said something (note, this was like the 5th mission) and I was completely surprised he said something because I didn't hear him talk in till now. However, he could have said something but the story felt so boring with really dull characters that I just probably didn't care. I don't even know why half these battles even start or even why Russia is fighting the US! Don't know why Bangkok got attacked by the US. What the missions need is when the moment the mission starts, give me a timestamp, tell me who I am, whose side I am on and during the debrief, tell me why this is happening because the mission before the Yukon one, I was suddenly Andei who never showed up in till then.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game maybe a 6 or 7. The game itself gets carried by it's gameplay because of how fun it is. It really lacks in the story element because it lacks charm and a good narrative. However, it is still being developed and I will keep an eye on it since I really like these mech games. Hopefully it will constantly improve and get better. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I really do if you've ever played and really enjoyed an Armored Core game and maybe even a gundam game. If you haven't played either, I'd say stay away from this game in till it gets further developed or it goes on sale. (Highly doubt that). On a personal note, I'd love to make a custom mech, bonus points if that is ever considered.","November 11, 2015","true","4.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Now put it all on a computer and you've got Project Nimbus.\n\nIt's impossible to lie that this game is early access, like... Released a day ago as of this review. Bugs happen, the campaign progression is a mess, and you'll probably run into the standard hilarious glitch or two. That being said, the gameplay itself is solid. The mech variety is interesting, because they all actually feel different and aren't just skins for you to shoot weapons out of. The standard grunt suits are slow and have a varied weapon variety, while high-performance frames are agile and deadly with their specialized loadouts. The S47 in particular is a favorite of mine.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have about this game is the voice-acting. I hate to say it, but I honestly think GameCrafter could have done without letting their backers voice their own ace pilots on the Kickstarter. It's very hard to follow along with the story for the game, and I'm practically through the first Act already. The camera can be a bit clunky with the speeds your mech goes at, and while I know multiplayer isn't on the menu, the game could really have benefited from letting players blast each other apart in small deathmatches.\n\nThat being said, it looks nice, plays well for early access, and I hope to see a number of optimizations in the future to make Nimbus even better.\n","November 6, 2014","true","7.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Now, I know this is still in Early Access, and probably/maybe/hopefully/I pray these flaws will be fixed soon enough as the game develops, but until they're eliminated entirely, they're still something to keep in mind and be wary of.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nProject Nimbus is something I've wanted for a very, very long time: an Armored Core for the PC. Now, it's not a real Armored Core, obviously, but this game plays like one of my favorite missions in Armored Core: For Answer that it's really hard to care. Another thing about this game that I really like is that, unlike with so many games that involve a lot of arial combat, in this your movement is almost perfectly unrestricted. Inertia does make a mess of things at times, and with how fast your mech moves it becomes rather unwise to stay close to buildings, but on the whole these are small issues once you get into things. Another thing I really liked was the bullet time button. I don't actually know what the game calls it (again, 40 minutes), but with a button you can temporarily slow down time to take note of your surroundings, change weapons quickly and smoothly, set off emergency escapes, or make effective use of the missiles despite the .00353 femtanosecond window for lock-on. The last thing I liked, one that I always rank least important but still quite deserving of mention here, is that this game is simply gorgeous! Yes, the modling on the mech isn't always perfect (like the tacked-on look of the wings), but the textures and visuals on the game field and such are beautiful, and it makes the absolute chaos that is a close range firefight come alive in a way I haven't seen in ages, if ever.\n\nTHE BAD:\nAs mentioned, this game is still in Early Access, so hopefully these things will be remedied soon enough, but there are quite a few issues with it that cause quite a bit of strain. First, foremost, and King of the Mountain on things that cause problems is that the game has enough optimization issues to fill a novelette. At least, I'm assuming that they're optimization issues, because otherwise this thing just naturally chugs twice the data of an unmodded Skyrim and runs worse than Skyrim with a full 346 mods on it. I'm packing a mid-range Alienware from 2014, and while this thing -can- run it at graphics settings above Medium it becomes unplayable due to framerate issues. Even at Medium it seems to have constant issues with the framerate and the drop in quality is quite steep as you move down the ladder, to the point that I just get distracted by all the beauty I'm -not- seeing. Another thing that irks me about this game is that ever-dificult problem child of 3D games, the camera. For most things the camera is actually quite good, able to allow you to manuver in 3D with very few issues at all, but the moment you wind up in an enclosed space then you have some rather major problems, problems only made worse if, for some reason, you happen to be using the blade (like in the first part of the second mission, by requirement). Another flaw, one that I find in an anoyingly large amount of games, is that the controller support isn't getting as much attention as it needs. That's not to say that the controller support itself has too many issues, the only big one I noticed being that switching weapons was a task and a half, but the game makes the not-terrible decision to introduce a significant portion of new controls mid-battle, and none of them are shown as controller buttons, making me figure out exactly what button is supposed to correspond to the blade (R3, by the way) and what button is this new weapon mapped to. Lastly, the menu has this annoying thing where, with a controller at least, your cursor just drifts about slowly rather than actually moving between options. It's not as big a complaint as the others, but I still feel it needs mention. These are the biggest flaws I can think of for now, but I know there's more.\n\nVERDICT:\nI like this game. It's slick, fun, and (when I decide looks beat gameplay) very, very pretty.The developers have obviously put a lot of work into this, and it shows quite well. There are flaws and bugs, yes, but time (and money) will (hopefully) smoothe things out, and even with the issues present it's still a very nice game. One worth far more of your money than, say, Lichdom Battlemage (not bitter).","July 19, 2015","true","0.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mokkas/recommended/257030/","Mokkas","Velka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mokkas/","97 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nProject Nimbus is an alright game.\n\nSet in a world where even the world doesn't like itself, humans live in floating cities due to the large amount of flooding and oceanic spreading that has covered much of Mother Earth.\n\n...\n\nExcept that's ♥♥♥♥ing boring so let's bring out some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechs.\n\nPilots utilize large robots called Battleframes to fly around the barren oceans of Earth and usually battle for various tactical reasons that I'm sure make more sense in the actual world. Project Nimbus delivers as a mech shooter, with a wide variety of mechs and missile spamming to make any player seem like they're the protagonist of the next edgy gundam series.\n\nCurrently there's a campaign and survival mode. Campaign takes you through the eyes of various people, from an american mercenary piloting a japanese prototype (complete with waifu material voice acting by Amber Lee Connors) to a Russian ace pilot and his quirky female friend. Both have some interesting elements, such as ships or ace customs coming out, both good and bad.\n\nSurvival mode gives you a neverending supply of enemies to shoot down. Pick any mech you'd like and fly through an open area, where it's just you, your missiles, and those AI enemies. Survive as long as you can, basic stuff.\n\nCombat is fairly satisfying. The wide variety of weapons, from automatic shotguns to funnels, can be utilized depending on which mech you have and everything sounds and looks great. Feedback on hits are obvious, with enemy parts wiggling, burning, and falling apart, and the entire game feels like it was designed by people who know what they're doing. Combat itself comes down to dodging and outdamaging your opponent. You attack via lock-on system, which essentially aims for you, making it forgettable and, admitedly, boring. But dodging is fairly fun, with boosting and quick sidedashes giving you a feeling of badassery.\n\nThe game's graphics aren't exactly beautiful, but the bloom spam and fairly nice looking models do hide the game's "2005 PS2 graphics". Performance is about what you'd expect. With an old graphics card like mine (Nividia 260x) I still got a full 60 FPS on all but the missile-spammiest missions, which are very rare.\n\nSo overall, is this game good?\n\nWho the ♥♥♥♥ cares it's a mech game that isn't complete ♥♥♥♥, it might as well be a godsend for us mech fans.\n\nBut really, it ain't too bad. It's Early-Access game, but it's an Early-Access game with some spirit. The developers are tough and responsive, and know what they're doing. I'd trust them with at least 30 dollars.\n\nSo yeah, it's a good game. Buy it if you want a good timewaster and you're into stylish mechs and a nice bundle of combat, throw 14 dollars and 99 cents towards this. It'll be worth it, especially with the future updates and what they promise.

That is also why I selected Not Recommended. Devs probably don't look at the positive reviews since it doesn't help them.\n\nMinor Issues\n-Subtitle text doesn't match what is spoken and there are some encoding issues (apostrophes appear as rectangles)\n-Rumble support for controller would be nice\n-Needs more explosions/effects. Combat and enemy destruction has all the visual impact of being hit in the face with a cotton ball.\n\nMajor Issues\n\n1)Level design\n-Slaying many objects in a tiny enclosed space while the camera clips through walls, obscuring your view completely, is nightmarish. It doesn't make sense to put a giant, rocket-powered robot in a small enclosure, especially when the camera  is zoomed so far out.\n-In a vacuum, you could be going a million miles per hour or standing still and there wouldn't be a perceivable difference. So why make a game that potentially offers an incredible sense of speed only to have a sparsely populated environment with few objects relative to which speed can be perceived. Most of the action happens outside the floating cities (inside of which the sensation of speed is tremendous), and even if it didn't, the cities are so cramped, it discourages entry for fear of constantly colliding with something. I understand that the scale of the robots needs to appear massive, but in whatever year this is, with overpopulation fueling all human progress, wouldn't buildings be proportionally larger? This is probably why most robot anime is set in space. Asteroid fields and massive yet sparse space colonies make for perfect environments to convey speed, yet not be so cluttered as to constrain movement. Perhaps individual, massive floating buildings rather than a city on a floating platform?\n\n2) Controller Support\n-My xbox controller worked fine, although it did take 30 minutes of random button presses to figure out how to do everything in the tutorial. As a temporary measure, I would at least expand support for the xbox controller which is what most people use. Display the corresponding controls during the tutorial. Also, during the second mission, there was no way to switch to weapon 5 as weapons are mapped to the various direction on the d-pad, not including diagonal. Perhaps scrolling up and down with the d-pad instead of using the directions to select different weapons is a more effective design (if somewhat slower than just pressing a number on a keyboard). People will simply have to accept the limitations of a controller if they choose to use it. It's better than not being able to select a weapon at all.\n\nWill update as more content is released.","December 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","31","51","3","3"

The music, the voice acting, the atmosphere, it all reminded me of the golden days of the PS2 era. And holy crapbaskets, I was not wrong.\n\nThe good\n\nThe Music: It's absolutely perfect for the atmosphere of the game, both in missions and briefings. Seems heavily inspired by Ace Combat (You'll find me saying this often, and it's always a good thing).\n\nThe Voice Acting: Just the right balance between great and campy, with pretty good writing to boot. Again, seems heavily inspired by Ace Combat.\n\nThe Gameplay: This is what Strike Suit Zero wished it'd control like. Using M&K, I had absolutely no problems making my Battle Frame do exactly what I wanted it to, even through the absolutely frantic battles this game has to offer. You'll always leave a mission feeling like an Ace Pilot, a trail of destruction in your wake.\n\nThe Middling\n\nThe Story: While I absolutely love the style they chose, sometimes it's too rushed to get a good idea, and battles tend to be so intense that keeping up with the dialogue is a big challenge.\n\nThe HUD: It's serviceable, but sometimes it's hard to discern information at a glance as it gets lost in the visual chaos, something that is very important with such a fast-paced game.\n\nThe Bad\n\nMission Length: While they do get longer as the story progresses, most missions go by too fast and simply leave you wanting for more. Some more moments of calm and story development between the frantic bouts of action would be welcome.\n\nThe Bloom  On High settings, some missions (especially indoors) had so much bloom it was hard to see where you were going or aiming at. While that can be disabled with some fiddling, it's something the devs would do well to tone down at least a bit.\n\nOverall, a great game and VERY recommended, especially if you are a fan of Ace Combat, Armored Core, Strike Suit Zero, or badass flight action games in general.\n\n","March 12","true","2.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","1"

Project Nimbus, The game where rather than being stuck to the ground in a giant robot, you are soaring through the sky in a giant robot, not having to worry even a little bit about gravity restricting you! A game where you have complete control over your movement. The mechanical designs are charming and unique, and the equipments of each Battleframe are fun to use. The Campaign has decent voice acting, a good plot, and unique locations, and Survival is fantastic for those who want to test their skills with all the different Battleframes!\nMy only issue is with display settings, and how you can't change each one individually. I want to play the game at high, just without the crazy bloom effects and huge particle overload.

Firstly, I love the designs of the mechs; most of them could have been from Gundam and fit right in. Secondly, the story is solid (reminds me of gundam 00) so far. Third, the controls are feel of the game is great (you accelerate a bit too quickly in my opinion)  Lastly the game looks amazing.\n\nAlthough I like where this is going; however there's still a lot I'd like to see change. First off I think the over all combat from the player's perspective is way to simplistic: just lock on and circle strafe. The way I would fix this is by:\n\n\nKeeping lock on but only making it used for keeping the camera on them and for locking on with missiles\n\nMaking Manuel aiming easier\n\nMake the mechs accelerate slower and have give them more momentum\n\nSecond thing I would like to see is some customization with the mechs for example new colours or a different load outs. Thirdly the AI could definately be a bit more agressive especially on the harder difficulties.

Note, these are my thoughts after the first hour of playing the game, and I will add more as I play more.\n\nThe overall gameplay was amazing and if you've always wanted an amazing mech combat game with multi weapons at your disposal per fight/scenario, this is YOUR game.  The controls were somewhat easy to pick up within the first 10 minutes of gameplay, and the tutorial is extremely useful.  The first few campaign missions are also great because they enforce what you learn in the tutorial, step by step, as well as establish a great story.\n\nHowever, as for some possible downsides, I personally felt a that up to beating the first enemy mech boss, the game was somewhat 'easy'.  Of course, that's just me.  There are no customizations or multiplayer yet, everything is single player.  For survival mode, you have a number of Mechs to choose from (each are based on your/enemy boss's Mechs) and you don't even need to do the campaign to have access to them.  However, I don't think you have the choice to choose for the campaign.\n\nThe feel to the game was great and the graphics were fine.  Note that there were occasional frame drops from 50 to like 5 when many enemies spawned (15+), but that's understandable right?  Being only this far in development and having such quality, I still think this game is a MUST BUY if you've been wanting something like this since you were a kid.  The game is also ~1gb, so downloading this is pretty quick.\n\nEdit:\nNote - I do feel like the combat is somewhat easy, spammy, and repetitive now, but my opinion barely changes from the fact that it is a pretty good game nonetheless\n\nEdit 2 (as of December 3, 2015):\nThis game has been consistently updated since it's initial release and it looks even more amazing now than before. I haven't played it yet except for ~2 months back but it was definitely a lot harder than the spam-everything-and-win gameplay style because I tried that and died pretty often lol (or maybe I'm just not that great of a spammer anymore).  I can see that if you put just like.... 30 minutes to try and learn to get around an obstacle in the game, you'll easily pass it, showing that it's not impossible.  The game is also a lot more fun, but since it's harder it can be a bit more frustrating though that's not a problem at all since that just means you have a challenge to beat :)\n\nStill a recommend and must-buy","November 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It feels like I am playing an episode of Gundam Unicorn or Macross Zero. It is must-have for any mecha anime fans. Especially since Steam doesn't have Armored Core and Bandai refuses to release Extreme Versus in the US this game is very welcome in the marketplace.\n\nFast-paced areial combat is largely unexplored in Steam's catalogue and as of now the Early Access for the title shows much promise. Story is a rather ho-hum reworking of themes from Gundam UC but given how accurate the combat is to the series, it is forgivable. Eventually once you start launching Funnels and flying through Itano Circuses you'll know this is a great experience.\n\ntldr: Insta-buy for fans of mecha anime.","November 14, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've seen multiple reviews saying that it's an amazing combination of Ace Combat and Armored Core and I agree with that completely, and all the allusions to various mecha anime and such also totally get me on board with it in general.\n\nThe controls are extremely responsive and well thought out, none of it seems difficult to use and it maps well to both keyboard and controller so there's no loss for anyone in terms of having to settle for one control over another. The graphics are really good and it runs really well, it doesn't seem to get bogged down or lose it's edge even in the middle of intense combat, so you can stay into it quite easily. The real shining point to me, though, is that there's actually quite a variety of mechs. Most games like this tend to skimp on the playable mechs, usually because it's hard to program this much stuff as an indie game I'm aware, but this game offers quite a selection. Also, as a Muv Luv fan, I like the fact that the mechs follow a similar basing on modern day aircraft as well.\n\nReally I have no honest complaints about the game, I like it quite a bit. I would like an online multiplayer and more mechs, sure, but I wouldn't list the either of those under a complaint. Besides, this is early access, so there's always time to add such things in. On that topic, also, this game is really, really good for an early access game, for the most part it's very well polished and set up and doesn't play like half a game.","October 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

You take control of one of many different mechs and dog fight in a variety of different scenarios. The game features easy to handle mech flight with some fast pace air combat. The visuals are quite sleek and clean, with some of the best sky and atmosphere effects I've seen in any game! The clouds are ridiculously realistic, and so is the atmosphere effect.\n\nThough the overall game as of this review is good with some very high caliber game play and presentation, it is early in it's early access phase, and the game really does feel incomplete at the moment. There's a lack of options in the options menu, the survival mode feels very incomplete and tacked on, and the campaign, though enjoyable, only features the first act.\n\nThough the game does feel a little light on it's content currently, I highly recommend to at least keep an eye on Project Nimbus if you don't decide on the purchase. If you do end up buying the game, know that it is incomplete, but what is there, is very enjoyable. I see amazing things for this game in the future.\n\nPros:\n- Great and realistic sky aesthetics\n- Fast, and demanding game play\n- Easy to learn\n- Has a lot of potential\n\nCons:\n- Feels incomplete currently\n- Some features such as survival mode seems tacked on","November 9, 2014","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Project Nimbus is the high speed mech game that you should keep an eye on. My favorite mode in it so far has to be "Survival" which, just like many other games, survive wave after wave of enemies. The further you get in survival mode, the better the AI gets, the stronger mechs they have, and the more you really test your limits with your response time and weapon management.\n\nMy only complaints are that the lock on system for the normal machine gun is a bit cheap on early waves and lesser enemies in general (this goes for the Campaign mode as well). Sometimes you move a little too fast and that can be a problem if you're around buildings; your speed can be more a of problem when it comes to escaping missiles being locked onto you while trying to maneuver around tall buildings. The camera seems a bit hectic as well. While you are more focused on the enemy at hand, the way the camera moves with you can cause a person to get a little disoriented (at times it gave me a headache).\n\nNever has a game made me want to be a mech pilot as much as this title does.

If you want an action mech game this The closest thing I can find to Armored Core on PC. Been keeping an eye on it since it came out on Early Access. Development speed isn't blinding but it's consistent which is more than I can say for most EA games on steam.\n\nThe gameplay is good. Controls are tight and there's some variety in different machines to pilot depending on the mission you're in. Generally the game does not feel feature-incomplete. Every level that was in the game when I played felt 90% done, they mostly seem to be focused on making new levels not to finish the campaign.\n\nCurrently there's enough content for a couple of hours if you smash through it, or a few more if you take your time and explore all of what this game has to offer. There have been about 2 missions added since I last played so there's more content than when I played.\n\nOverall at the price point the game is not complete at all, and not ready for commercial sale. Everything here is good there's just not enough here. Buy this game if you love Mech games; want to see how this one goes and support the development. So far I haven't felt betrayed by the developers like I do almost every time I buy Early Access games. Once the game is finished and released as a complete game I will probably be at the top of the list of people telling you to buy it or go soak your head.","September 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Project Nimbus is exactly that kind of game which will give you this feeling. Very fast and dynamic battles against any kind of enemy. From drones over planes until you meet your very first enemy mecha/battle frame.\n\nThe controls are very easy and as soon as you get the right touch for it, you will find it even more fun.\n\nBut a little warning: At some points it is better to have very fast reactions, rather than the countermeasure and some missions will bring you to the edge of dispair. But that's what makes this game even more fun: The Challenge to master your frame.\n\nThere is just one thing I do miss. Multiplayer Games. For example: A Tournament ladder like Arena Combat with different kinds of Battlegrounds. There are so many ways of possibilitys for maps..\n-Citys, suited for close quarter melee combat and very fast chases\n-Mountains, for a hide and seek Dogfight like Air-to-Air Combat\n-Flat Terrain, for an open terrain Dogfight like Air-to-Air Combat\n-Underground/Cave Maps, for dark lighted highspeed Dogfight chases\n\nWith this.. this game would have everything needed.

What you see in the screen shots is what you get.  You take control of a mech and shoot down the enemies.\n\n\nStandard WASD controls for movement and mouse controls for angular poitioning of view seem to work well, space for boost so you can move faster. Movement is good enough as long as obstacles are not in the way(ie buildings or indoors), fortunitly there are very few indoor sections becasue movement controlls are not pollished enough for that as of the time of this writting, and it doesn't seem like the designers intend this to be like Armored Core, but rather closer to Zone of the Enders so as long as they keep the cramped areas to a minimum things will be fine.\n\nCombat is very simple. You look onto an enemy, empty everything you have into him until he dies, rinse and repeat, dodge via boost and drop flares to shake off missles launched by other enemies. Switch from one weapon to another when it needs to reload.The weapons are adequate for most enemies, machine guns for close range, missle for fire and forget, and rail gun for longer range sniping will be your bread and butter.  Most mission have a mech with funnels and a secondary missle, although they don't feel like they do anything(Maybe they do but if the player can't feel it this is a problem).  A few things make the weapons feel lacking. The sound design is one main issue here, the weapons are supposed to be large and attached to a massive mech. The sounds created when they fire should feel very very heavy.  I don't get that vibe from them.  Another problem which has been partialy addressed by a flashing "hit" button is that due to the high speed of everything involved and the sheer distance enemies are from you it is very difficult to tell if an enemy is hit by your attacks, which again could be fixed by proper sound design. I should both hear and feel the metal twisting and breaking when my railgun shot impacts an enemy, and the destruction of an enemy even more so.  I almost forgot there is an energy sword, but it is almost impossible to hit enemies with it. Everytime I take a swing I end up missing the enemy entirely( it is possible I am hitting the enemy and not realizing it, see my previous comments about sound design)\n\nThe enemies themselves are another story.  Low level enemies can be brought down by the methods in the previous paragraph, and can feel somewhat satisfying to take down, again see the previous paragraph on the importance of sound design in a game.  The problem comes when very powerful and mobile enemies swarm you which feel like a chore to take down.  They can pretty much dodge almost everyhting you throw at them and it feels like they moving so fast and playing by a different set of rules than me. My machine gun feels useless, railgun ocasionaly connects, spamming missles seem to be the only good option but I feel like the game is taking away my options when I fight these enemies instead of allowing me to get creative with the tools given to me as the player. I can't help but wonder if a few tweaks to the AI, or improved aiming for your mech would solve this problem for the faster enemies so they don't feel invincible.  Becasue of this I can't recomend playing this on anything but the lowest difficulty setting. Enemy airships can be interesting and a nice boss fight, but they need to have a different move set and AI than mechs, right now I can see enemy frigates moving in ways that feel unnatural for a ship(ie moving verticaly upward or tilting themselve ar odd anlge that would be very uncomfortable for the crew of said ship), but would be quite natural for a mech.  End of act boss design seems promising, the large white mech you see in the trailer called the Patriot shows some potential and is very fun and satisfying to take down.  He starts out easy, as his health is depleated he starts throwing out more damaging attacks requiring you to keep up or die, and other than commiting the cardinal sins of infinity respawing enemies, and a time limit I give that fight an A+.\n\nLevel design is a bit of a double edged sword. Some levels have no structure to give you a sense of distance, and even the ones with a large structure(space elevator, floating city, etc) to give you some sense of bearings feel like there is a lot of unused empty space. Too much cluter would slow me down.  The ultimate result is an inability to judge relative speed and distance to enemies/objects. Due to the large distance, and high speed you can't see the enemies which is a real shame since the designers went to a bit of trouble detailing the mechs and designing them. They should let us see them on screen with detail more than 10% of the time. They try to rectify this by a subwindow that opens showing a zoomed in semi tranparent view of the locked on enemy, but the animations and movement of the zoomed in enemy seem choppy, like it is running at 15 fps or soemthing.  I suspect this has to do with optimaztion and level of detail so the game doens't spend resources rendering something that wont be visible to the player.  The developers may have painted themselves into a corner and this might be the only good option left at this point for us to see and appreciate the enemy mechs during play, but more work needed here. The other alterantive would require redesigning gameplay and levels from the square one and slow things down which seems unfeasable at this point.  Most levels are simply a variation on kill everything in sight which doesn't seem too bad since this looks like it will be a short and fast game once done which isn't necesarly a bad thing( see most games made by Platinum games).\n\nThe plot of the game is another issue. I can't help but feel the developers were very passionate about it and trying to make their own Gundam-esq story, but unfortunitly they can't seem to tell it within the framework of the game they have setup. Since this game is fast paced they need to carefuly edit the dialog and make sure everything said over the radio during a mission either fleshes out that charcter more and/or adds the world/lore building, no room for waste here.    No character physicaly appears during game so we can't tell who anyone is. If they can find space in the screen during the game perhaps a small window could show up with the character portrait when they talk on the radio.  Funny story, I didn't relieze until the Act 1 boss (Patriot) that my mech had a pilot and a copilot since that is the only point the 2 characters seemed to have a conversation. The plot involves a dystopian future where a massive war scoarched the earths surface to most humans took the sky, but terrorist organization operating on the remains of the surface threaten to upend a fragile peace bewteen the 3 superpower nations( US, Russia, and China? It's not entirely clear). Good news is you don't need a deep plot for a game like this to be good, it just needs to give me an excuse to blow mechs up.\n\nI have probably ranted enough at this point, but the ultimate question of whether I enjoyed the game( well ~40% of the game is out now. This is early access after all).  The answer to this is YES, mostly. My rants earlier account for relativly small part of my gametime.  I may have seemed critical of a lot of the game, but I did not write the previous paragraphs out of spite, but becasue I believe the game has the potential to be better.  There really arn't many giant robot games out there, in contrast to FPS which are a dime a dozen. The developers clearly like mechs/giant robots, though I suspect this is there first time making a video game and I think there is only 10 people or so on the development team so I can let some stuff slide. So in conclusion, Project Nimbus is a roughcut gem, and if you like Mechs you owe it to yourself to give it a shot since there are not many of this kind of gem around.","August 7, 2015","true","8.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Although I am a bit rusty at games as fast paced as this, I am really enjoying myself and finding it easy to get along with the controls. Flying at the speeds of a jet with the freedom of movement in all angles has really been well done, the ability to boost was a brilliant idea too as I feel like a total badass as I fly towards incoming missles and boost past their blind spot.\n\nSo far i have noticed no real issues other than maps being...a little empty? for example the first map was an epic fight in the city but the city didn't seem to have as much detail as I would expect and the scaling seems a tiny bit odd, it's early release though so it's nothing major really. Also I am not sure if it was just because I was on the fourth mission but I felt like most of the music was relatively the same (just a personal thing, nothing bad).\n\nSomething I would like to see is the ability to customise a mech from body parts, to colour and even which weaponry to use, also maybe a cooperative survival/story mode. I am definitely sticking around for later updates to this epic game and I give it a solid 9/10.

If you like the mech genre in any of it's manifestations, you'll love this! As it is still "Early Access" its not very long and there is a lack of customization. However, with all the things still to come (and what it has now), I think this game is a great investment and I have been looking for a mech game like this for a while and I'm really glad i found this.\n\nI find the controls, once you learn them, really easy and straight forward to use. There are only a few campaign missions but there are a fair amount of mechs (or battle frames) to choose from in survival mode, and the really nice thing bout that is that all the mechs do handle differently with different weapons so there is a lot to experiment with until the next update.\n\nThe story right now is ok. Gundam influence is notable (i.e. funnels, elements of story), but I love Gundam and most other mech series. Missiles get annoying and there are some other equipment you come across that you don't have access to yet, but i assume it is coming.\n\nOverall, If you like this genre, haven't been too pleased with other recent mech games, I was very pleasantly surprised with this and I think for this is well worth the reasonable price and is just a really overall fun time.","January 2, 2015","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you can tell from my profile picture, I adore Armored Core. My friend has told me this game is a lot like Armored Core, and in a sense. Yeah he's right.\n\nKeep in mind: This is an Early Access game so what I say isn't going to be accurate when the game is updated.\n\nStory: This is unfortunately, one of its issues. The story is alright in the beginning, but the dialogue is very poor, I mean my god, I have no connection to any of the characters and they are practically cardboard cutouts of the same character's you'd see in every other game out there.\n\nThe snarky ace pilot? That's you.\nThe gruff and serious General? Yup, he's in here.\nThe female mission briefer and co-ordinator? Yup, she's in here.\n\nBut then again, this is just ACT 1 of what seems to be 4 acts. So we'll see if it gets better in time.\n\nGraphics: The graphics for the game are solid. They fit the game and overall are pleasing to the eyes.\n\nGameplay: Okay...this is the big part. The game...needs development in this. And it's quite obvious that it needs some more work in the gameplay side of things, as it feels like so much can be improved. From the U.I. to the way you move, it feels basic. But I think that's a positive as well, as of right now, they have a solid foundation of the combat (which is more than most early access games can claim). You can easily understand what to do and how to play it.\n\nIt has a lock-on system where it allows you to focus on specific enemies, which is mighty helpful.\n\nIt also has one of the most stylystic bullet time modes, where you can just simply activate it at a click of a button and fire at an enemy while you're sprinting ahead of them, it feels very satisfying.\n\nContent: There's not a lot to the game as of yet, but it is early access so I guess it gets a pass.\n\nSo do I reccomend this game? Yeah, but not for everyone. If you really want to see more from the devs, I reccomend you support the game and purchase it. It is a fun little time waster as of right now and I think you can have a lot of enjoyment from it.","December 30, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though the story mode is still incomplete, the survival mode is really where you want to go to test your mech pilot abilities. I found that I could not play survival with the main stories battleframe and it pretty much locked the game up. But, I had access to the control console (which was nice) and exited the game. So I hope that this is fixed soon, as well it would be cool if there was a hover option to stop your battleframe mid flight.

And let's not forget the blade one gets on the Mirai.\nThis is the complete change from Western style mech games, such as Mech Warrior Online, which feature lumbering beasts with heavy firepower. This is not Mech Warrior Online, this game is more in the vein of Armored Core 4/ For Answer, with high speed, fast paced combat.\nIt is for this reason that I absolutely love this game, as so few of its type end up on PC.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, such as the difficulty spikes out of nowhere, the absurdly short missions, etc. But they can all be fixed should the Dev dedicate time into it.\n\nWith that being said, this game should get around 7 or 8/10, the short missions do dampen the fun of the whole thing, and some individual customization like Armored Core would also be very nice.","January 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I kinda wish you could choose different mechs/characters for every story mission (You are able to do this in a few of the act 2 missions) to give some more replayability, and there are a few other things I am hoping to see, but it is already a fun thing I would say is worth the $15 and when they add more content it will be a great deal.","February 10","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first look it seems like an armored core game due to the mech design, but upon starting the game up it feels nothing like one. The combat is very flight focused, and fast paced, remniscent of Zone of the Enders in that aspect, though with much more focus on ranged combat rather than ZoE's melee focus. The funnels would probably remind most people of Gundam, and indeed they do work pretty much the same (It's even inferred that they work on the same concept as how newtypes use them), and the missile barrages (As well as fast paced aerial combat) certainly feel like they're straight out of Macross (ESPECIALLY the smart missiles which even have the light blue trails).\n\nThe game itself, besides just being completely satisfying to enthusiasts of mecha anime and games that play like them (such as myself) also has great gameplay, and this is coming from someone who has played a  lot  of mech games, from the old Mechwarrior games on SNES, to Mech Assault, Armored Core, several Gundam games, Zone of the Enders, and several unlocalized games such as Another Century's Episode (Every game except for 1, which I haven't been able to get my hands on) and Macross Triangle Frontier (Planning to play the rest of the series).\n\nThe story though can be a bit convoluted, and difficult to understand. Suffering from switching main characters without much warning or indication especially. For instance, initially I didn't realize that the protagonist from the first mission wasn't the same as the male pilot of Mirai (Who I do not know the name of) until you ended up playing as them again in a later mission. The lore isn't gone into as much as I personally feel it should, and I can't say I have much of an understanding of the game world at all. In general though recurring characters (Such as Mirai, the male pilot of the mech by the same name, and Luciana) tend to be well written and engaging, and missions involving them tend to be the same. Their plot lines also tend to be the most coherent out of them.\n\nAs it is I'd say it's worth buying. It has a decent amount of campaign missions, as well as a survival mode in which you can play as, I believe, any of the mechs playable throughout the whole game and from my experience it updates regularly enough. From what I hear it used to have optimization problems, but I don't have any issue on a relatively low spec PC so as far as I can tell those are a thing of the past.","November 8, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics and details look very detailed for the team it is, and the designs are very well thought out. The game is very fast paced, in the sense where you would be dodging enemy gunfire and missiles nonstop, as if it was some sort of 3-dimensional bullet hell game.Since this game is in early-access alpha, I can't really blame them for having too many bugs and glitches in the game, but some of the flaws would be camera collision, where you would be able to see inside models, GUI bugs like the flare reload bar going off the bar boundaries, and the most important feature that this game is lacking: rebindable keys. I would most definitely recommend this game for mech-combat fans, but when the game is more developed and the little bugs are ironed out.","November 9, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You get the default Mech for the mission. There's no customizing your mech for specific missions and customizing your mech to your playstyle here.\n\nThe second thing is that it took me 2-3 hours to complete the current storyline to the end (act1+2) but from the menu it looks like there will be another half to the game.\n\nInstead of Armored Core where you actually have ammo, everything is infinite here and you just keep spraying until everything dies. It's closer to a 3D bullet hell.\n\nAnother thing that struck me is that you're playing more than one story at the same time. You might be a US colonel in one mission and change to a Russian lieutenant in the next mission and of course with this comes a change of your mech every time.\n\nSince it's still in beta I would not recommend purchasing this, not yet anyway.\n\nSome of the voice actors don't seem to fit for me. Also some of the lines themselves feel really out of place for a supposed military campaign.\n\nBugs: a couple of the voice actors don't match the lines / subtitles written\nIf you complete certain objectives at the same time you can activate multiple sets of dialogue at the same time from the same characters which is confusing.\nOn the prison mission I managed to phase out of the wall early on in the mission and was able to skip right to the end of the M1 section of the mission without really doing anything...\nMost of the AIs also can't track you if you're just moving horizontally very quickly.\nThe Air force 1 ship is very odd to watch in terms of the movements and the random direction changes.\n\n\nOVERALL: Please note that this is an early access review and I will revisit this as updates come out.\nPersonally for a mech game I really would have liked to see mech customization (not necessarily on the level of Armored Core) but otherwise the movement and gameplay is entertaining.\nThe difficulty ramps up fast to the point where it ends up feeling closer to a bullet hell while you're zipping through the map. Just about every enemy can be killed by just locking on, spinning around them while hitting your booster regularly and cycling through your weapons unloading everything.","May 3","false","2.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Even if From never ports the series over, this game has already perfectly captured the high octane mech combat that made me start watching Gundam once I sold my consoles. So far, the story and gameplay are both very reminiscent of Armored Core For Answer; all high speed shooting against a backdrop of a desolated planetside and floating cities.\n\nWhile this game is in Early Access, as evidenced by some performance issues and a lack of options, there is a foundation laid for a very fun revival of the mecha genre on PC. Even if it is a little rough around the edges, and pretty animu to boot.\n\nIf you've got a mecha itch that needs to be scratched, I strongly recommend checking this game out.

So imagine my delight to find that it's spiritual sucessor seems to have been created. I actually only found out about Project Nimbus thanks to the Steam page, but for an Early Access game, it's certainly impressive. In fact, there's more content here than in some full games. The Campeign is relatively engaging, with interesting briefs and some fun missions. Personally, I prefer the Survival mode- simply because there's just so many different playable mech to choose from. The design of the 'frames' are excellent- think Gundam UC crossed with ACFA. Gameplay is ridiculously fast, and incredibly intense. If I have one criticism of the game then it's relating to this- sometimes, especially when low to the ground, it is a little TOO fast, and can be quite confusing trying to track where each individual missile is coming from. But in the air, combat is fast, fluid and relatively easy to pull off. There's a ton of different weapons too, which helps things from becoming stale. Rest assured- if you're a fan of fast paced action, or have the slightest interest in mecha, this is a game for you.

The mec genre is seems very difficult to pull off successfully, due to its niche required playstyle. Overall that game has some interesting concepts, but lacks in what makes mec games entertaining, and that's the combat. In Project Nimbus, all that is required of the player is to right click to lock on and the hold left click to shoot, all while moving in one direction, occasionally hitting space bar to speed up. The combat is very boring and lacks depth. I've heard reference to Gundam and even Armored Core. This game doesn't come close to either franchise, other than you are a mec, which even then, it doesn't give you that emersion. Really you're just a WASD lock on and shoot'em flying gun.\n\nSo combat blows, but the game does have some interesting elements to it. Beside practically ripping off AC:4answer's atmosphere (in terms of floating nations, ground level for terrorists and the poor) the game has some decent levels. They feel rather larger, but then again, you are just flying in circles locked on all game, so really there is no time to fully enjoy the environment.\n\nAnother aspect that was lacking was customization, and according to their FAQ there will be no update for that. This is a huge disappointment. AC, as a franchise, did so well in the genre because it offered customization. Nothing was better than fine tuning weight/speed/lift/drift/power ect. to synchronize and ultimately make you the player on top in the battlefield. Since PN does not offer or plan on offering customization, this title was an instant return as the provided battle suits are god awful and plain out boring.\n\nVoice acting was mediocre, and sadly was what I enjoyed most. Typical cookie cutter characters mashed with some pretty good voice acting for an EA title. So props on that.\n\nStory was meh. The team could really take advantage of the parallel story arcs going on. Rather than investing the player's time fighting for the main power, perhaps the player could have a choice in which side he fights for.\n\nThere is talk of multiplayer, but in reality this game would not function well with it, given its current lock on and shoot gameplay.\n\nPrice, only 15 USD. It's not going to break you, but for $15, your money is best spent elsewhere. My price for this, at least in its current state, is 4.99 USD.\n\nOverall this game is a 3/10.\n\nCombat: 1/10\nEnvironment (level design): 6/10\nStory Arc: 5/10\nVoice Acting and Character: 7/10\nPrice: 1/10\n","October 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I did get that, to an extent, but the game has a few too many technical issues. It lags even on the lowest graphic setting, the camera is really jittery and I can't see anything properly half the time, and the game has crashed a few times within the short period that I played it. I couldn't even access certain settings (like low graphical setting) without the game freaking out and showing me a bunch of puked up graphics on my screen. It was uncanny. Other issues include clipping, weapons being kind of buggy (the psycho drones in particular are awkward in terms of how you activate them, and half the time i'm not even sure if they activate or survive), and the worst would be severe frame rate drops if you're too close to an explosion.\n\nI know it's still in early access, but I waited for almost 2 years for this to become stable. It's kinda like Starbound, where I doubt it'll be stable any time soon. Maybe it's just my personal experience,  but I wouldn't recommend it. It hurts me inside, because I'd love to see more giant robot games on steam, and I can't completely condemn Project Nimbus. It has some unique ideas and I see a concept of gameplay that could really shine through, but at the time, it's just not worth 15 dollars. I'll definitely consider looking at this game again once they finish the single player, which going by this rate should be around 2018 (if the dev releases 7 missons per year without delays).

The weapon systems of your mech are well thought out. All have their merit, and while some are more powerful than others, there is no one weapon type that works for every situation. You'll need to make ample use of every weapon type, even (or especially) your close range machine gun. This is also a pretty darn fast game, so if you're expecting Mech Warrior style slowmotion or even Hawken style gameplay, this is not at all the kind of game this Project Nimbus is. But don't let that scare you off. If you lose your bearings, it'll only be for a moment. Especially since every Weapon has a lock on function that helps you keep on facing the enemy. However, just because you're locked on, doesn't mean you're going to hit your target. Missiles can be evaded by moving away far enough, or via flares or via the funnel weapon (little interceptors that fly around you and that can also be used to attack, very powerful). Everything else needs to be evaded manually and works fine most of the time.\nYou'll most likely breeze through the first 4 or 5 missions or so, learning about the weapons, reveling in your massive fire power and perhaps asking yourself where the challenge is. Especially since you get to pilot a really nice mech and you're fighting against all kinds of simpleton mechs or stationary weaponry that really isn't all that big of a threat. But as you near the end of Act 1, you'll have your work cut out for you. You'll be forced to pilot different, lesser mechs as well as fight pretty darn dangerous special boss mechs with potent entourages that will shoot you down in mere moments, if you don't know what you're doing or just aren't careful enough.\nI'm no expert on the game yet, but keeping your distance is often a very good idea in this game ;)\nAll in all, it's a fast paced, arcadey Gundam Mech Shooter. It's easy to get a handle on, and you'll be having fun from the moment you start. I got this via Steam Christmas Auction and wasn't expecting too much, but it really surprised me and got me hooked.\nOnly real downside is that there's only Act 1 to play so far. That'll give you around 2-3 hours game time, depending on how good you are (I have 2 missions left). And there's a survival mode that's pretty fun, that'll keep you occupied for 2-3 runs. As it stands now, it's a good game to spend 15 - 30 minutes on (especially after you've finished Act 1) before doing something else. However, if you're looking for something meatier, I'd wait until they finished the game.\nI'd definately recommend it for anyone looking for a fun arcade shooter. Because in essence, that's what this is.","December 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

First off, I'd probably ask, how bad are you craving a game like this? If you expect Armored Core's near perfection for that money, then you might want to hold off for a second. However, if you're craving high speed mecha combat then there's a good chance this is your perfect game. If you're familiar with Zone of the Enders, Armored Core, Macross, and a few of the Gundam games then for the most part, you should feel right at home. If not, then I'd suggest looking them up so you know what I'm talking about.\n\nThis game is literally a marriage of the previously mentioned games/anime. It has the Macross ridiculousness (in weapons), Armored Core mech style (without the customization), Zone of the Enders high speed pace, and Gundam's insane over-powered feel. I played the game on an Xbox 360 controller and the controls aren't difficult to learn, but a bit of a challenge to master.\n\nIf you're coming for the story, you might be better off waiting, as it seems like only Act 1 is available, unless you like that sort of thing. Having just finished it, and Act 2 not activated yet for me as of 11/7, I must admit that the cutscenes are very well made, and the voice acting is VERY good considering that it's an indie game. The story is almost like an Armored Core game where you're only semi-immersed, you only hear voices and you lack that personal feel that Gundam, Zone of the Enders, and Macross tend to have, granted the 3 are role playing games and/or are based off anime. As someone already said, there's a survival mode that is very much like the Strike Suit games, and for me, I can only do survival for so long.\n\nGraphics are decent, very impressive for a small scale indie game, yet not something I'd be geeking out about (I think the voice acting is something I'd be praising before the graphics). I played on Very High on my gaming laptop, and only experienced a few lags, but that was fine. I'd say it would look like a Gundam Vs. environment, with Armored Core 4Answer mechs. If anything, the mechs are pretty small compared to the scale of the environment (I might just be a mid-close combat person and I'm just complaining that the quick boost shoots me passed the AI).\n\nOverall, I support this game. I might seem a bit over critical, or comparing it to everything else, but it's just what I'm thinking, it's that vibe I get from playing it.","November 7, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comicconreviews/recommended/257030/","comicconreviews","JUST","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comicconreviews/","143 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdUK-UDYCFo\n\nThe story in project nimbus plays out like a budget version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare with motion video graphic intensive cutscenes taking place between missions and gruff commanders acting all edgy. There really isn’t much more to it than that. None of the characters are memorable because you never really get to see them. The plot is predictable is no more than a basic setup for destroying various spaceships or whatever the case may be. It’s not terrible but it certainly isn’t a strongpoint.\n\nWhere do I start? The frame-rate is horrendous it will give you over 60 frames per second at one moment and go all the way down to well below 30fps in another. The backgrounds can be fairly detailed especially things like skylines and the sea, or they can be utterly disgusting and plain in another part of the very same level. The particle effects can be decent or they can be over 10 years out of date. You see my point? This game is half finished at best but I’ll save the real kicker till later in this review.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is one of it’s strong points. Some tracks are generic and overly dramatic .while others are well crafted techno infused tracks that fit the themes quite of the game well. What isn’t so good is the voice acting. With the exception of maybe one of the female voice actors it’s really very poor quality. Think of the kind of cliche’ nonsense voice acting you get in a typical call of duty game only worse. Additionally two lines of dialogue will sometimes clip over each other. Also you’ll sometimes encounter random lag in the audio on certain levels.\n\nOkay I’ve mentioned the frame-rate issues and don’t get me wrong I I know this isn’t a new problem in pc gaming. I can recall tweaking poorly optimised games for a better frame-rate nearly 15 years ago.  but no matter what setup you have performance here is sometimes unplayable. But here is the real kicker, the game is so flat out broken it will crash to desktop at a certain point in the campaign. Not only that but it will also crash randomly on top of that. So even if you really wanted to beat this game you probably will literally find it impossible to do so.\n\nBut let’s say all of that get’s fixed because so many people buy this game that it becomes a smash hit and the developers can afford to put in the hundreds maybe even thousands of hours needed to make it work properly. Would it all be worth it?\n\nWell..no. You see in the game you control a mech called a battle frame that has a variety of attacks including chain-guns, a railgun, and various missiles. You also have defensive abilities like flares and decoys. There is even a melee weapon but the less said about how that handles the better. Sadly the missiles  in the game are way too overpowered. You can just spam the hell out of them constantly and win 90% of the time. You see the game has a lock on system and most of your weapons apart from the chain guns have cool downs. So what you end up doing is locking onto your targets spamming a tonne of missiles, whilst using flares and decoys to avoid getting totally owned by your enemies missiles, keep a good distance. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYou’ve now won that’s it. That’s the majority of this game. Now this game is in early access and some of the issues I’ve mentioned have gotten partial fixes since I started writing the review. But many of them remain, and even if all of them got ironed completely. The gameplay is just very disappointing and frankly not worth the hassle.","December 20, 2014","false","1.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

But the bullets are homeing missiles. I find in retrospect, that the game has potential to be good. But the graphical trade off of intense missile barrages will be a downside to most lower end computers. I applogize if it's not a review that will sell any sugar coated words for the game. But it's not entirely optimized, for it to perform well. Control wise, it's pretty much close to armored core aiming mechanics mixed with more simplified point and shoot arcade style fireing like Macross on the psp.  To be honest. The experience doesn't compare well enough that I would give this game any colorful stars to boast about.\n\nGraphics: Artistically not that great, It's more GPU intensive. Even though it may look playable for the most part, it's not for lower end computers in its current optimization. But it's still pretty nice to look at. Though map design is mostly airborn, I'd like to see more things like the city in the sky which tosses my score around a little bit. This is only early access so can't wait to see more.  7/10\n\nGameplay: Unique to what it wants to deliver, but falls short to practical use for what it offers for now... But the Bullet time makes it worth the while. Although Melee could use some reworking. But once you get the feel for it, the controlls and combat make the bread and butter of this game. Don't think Armored Core, think Japanese mecha anime like Macross, minus variable transforming fighters. 7/10\n\nStory: The story itself is actually very well driven that it'll be told durring combat, and through cinematic scenes it's a pretty exceptional. 8/10\n\nPros- A much faster pace arcade style armored core, with lighter controls. It's promissing for what it's priced. It's also quite intuitive with options of what you can do durring combat... Use flares? Or just shoot down the missiles yourself in bullet time.\n\nCons= I'm not a fan of the games current engine. It maybe great for high quality graphics, but I believe that it's just not there. Smart missiles may cause some drop in fps, which makes me a bit upset since it's highly missile heavy,  Maybe a bit too much? Hmm, other then that there's not much else.\n\nWorth the money? Yes. This game is definitely worth checking out, if you've been looking to try something new and thrilling on the PC. The gameplay will leed you wanting more... To improve your skills and advance through the story. On the plus note, it'll look amazing if your rig is pretty good.","January 6, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is beautiful, especially in the Act 1 Mission: Rise, Mirai!!\n\nPros:\n- Fast paced\n- Easy to learn\n- Lots of explosions and bullets\n- Excellent Music\n\nCons:\n- Horrible, HORRIBLE framerate lags on mac, even on very low graphic settings (macs suck)\n- In tight, enclosed battle areas, the camera clips into walls and ceilings, making it a bit frustrating\n- No good cutscenes, all of them are rather simple and without much detail\n- Characters are dull, no emotional attachment to them whatsoever. Then again, there is only one act so far\n- Zero customization, although that may change in future updates\n- WHERE'S THE GIRL IN THE FIRST TRAILER???\n\nKeep in mind that despite all the cons, this game is still rather early in its development. I expect many changes to be made not only to the gameplay, but also to the story and maybe even the cutscenes, graphics, characters, etc.\n\nCurrently a 8/10, although technically little higher because I suffer from framerate lags that are absurdly annoying. It would be 20/10 if the girl from the trailer was added, no framerate lags, and improved cutscenes (srsly, who doesn't like it when girls are placed into these games?)","January 7, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly,  when I look at the water in survival mode (and probably the other modes) at a certain angle, it flickers rapidly. Secondly, the major FPS dip (like from 60 all the way to 20) you get with firing off smart missile and other weapons at the same time. Lastly, the "jet" streams from the back of your mech, it could just be that it is unfinished at this point of time but the animation seems extremly clunky.

The levels design needs work.  They are boring and simple, and need an artistic touch.  The voice acting needs a lot of work, and needs some a good amount of proofing.  One of the main cities is pronounced counter to how its spelled, its pronouced differently depending on who is saying it. (Mithril is spoken both as Mitt-rill and Mith-rill. Pick one.  The latter one.)  The voices during the 'briefing' would be better off if altered with the radio voice.  The sound effects/music in the game needs work, and often doesn't seem to fit what is is happening on the screen.

The levels design needs work.  They are boring and simple, and need an artistic touch.  The voice acting needs a lot of work, and needs some a good amount of proofing.  One of the main cities is pronounced counter to how its spelled, its pronouced differently depending on who is saying it. (Mithril is spoken both as Mitt-rill and Mith-rill. Pick one.  The latter one.)  The voices during the 'briefing' would be better off if altered with the radio voice.  The sound effects/music in the game needs work, and often doesn't seem to fit what is is happening on the screen.  Much like the scenery, it feels... empty.\n\nOverall, as an unfinished game, it holds a lot of potential.  The game plays great, and I'm looking forward to the finished product.","October 22, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly,  when I look at the water in survival mode (and probably the other modes) at a certain angle, it flickers rapidly. Secondly, the major FPS dip (like from 60 all the way to 20) you get with firing off smart missile and other weapons at the same time. Lastly, the "jet" streams from the back of your mech, it could just be that it is unfinished at this point of time but the animation seems extremly clunky.

I'm a big fan of mech games of all types, and this definitely fills up that Gundam/Zone of Enders/Armored Core 4A feel that has been lacking in Steam.  It's chock full of references to the games it honors.\n\nThe game looks pretty damn beautiul and the controls are pretty good once you get used to them.  The campaign and survival modes are pretty fun, as the campaign shows off some pretty cool minimalistic intros and a bit of story for the world you fight in and the survival mode allows you to use different mechs that you fight as or against a growing multitude of enemies.  The enemies range from cannon fodder to extremely hard depending on the mook and difficulty setting, which is good variety.\n\nWith any game comes problems though, as it's not optimised very well considering the fact that the reqs aren't bad.  Needs more work as a lot of the assets and other things need some toning down on the intensiveness on the cpu and graphics.  I'd suggest supporting this project if you want to help the devs find all the bugs and bring a fun mech game to steam.","August 10, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love mech games in general, you should buy this game. However, it has flaws despite being an amazingly enjoyable game.\n\nWhilst it lacks heavy custimization options in the menu, the dev is very open in helping people edit .ini files to appease their game tastes in the steam discussions. A dev communicating a lot with the player is a huge positive for me as well.\n\nIndoor levels seem really finicky with how much the HUD can take up space, I hope we can change stuff like that in the future.\n\nThis game is REALLY hard on harder difficulties and later levels. Don't be afraid if you need to tone down the difficulty, but when you do beat it on a high level it feels great. I just hope for more checkpoints in the future.\n\nWhile it has many flaws, for what the game has to offer and it's price, I see this as something you should get if you're a mech fan or want a game with awesome gameplay. Hopefully when this comes out of early access it is a must buy.","February 15","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, this game has a charm to it that I haven't seen since the old PS2 Ace Combat / Armored Core days, the gameplay is fun, albeit a bit dizzying, there's less skill involved than say Armored Core, but it brings out the chaotic fun of destroying massive quantities of enemies like in Ace Combat. Also, the music is great, it's been a while that I've enjoyed the music during "briefing" cutscenes, very Ace Combat 4-5 / Zero nostalgic, great job on that end!\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't pay more than ~10$ on it in its current state, but as it gets more polished, I am excited to see how this game pans out, especially if it can get to a higher quality of completion!","May 1","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hah!...sigh... its actually pretty hard as you have to manage who else is gunning you plus by that time; you probably already have at least 3 high performance mecha(s)/Gundam(s) on your tail firing at you and launching everything they have at you machine guns, railguns, missiles, etc thus getting low armour and being shot down. Mind you that this is only normal mode(Casual Gamer) and the action is already putting you on your feet.\n\nThis game resembles actual proper mech combat for non-atmosphere and probably atmosphere, also the User Interface is well thought out for this kind of fast paced mech combat. Mech controls and moves like how u want it to fly and the mechs are well designed and thought out with realistic combat in mind.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is the freaking missile spam by the massive ammount of A.I. in the combat zone. The reason that this is bad is because you will have at least 30-50 homing missiles chasing you on a regular basis. This is so as sometimes you are the only person doing that particular mission and its like 1 v 20 mechs multiplied by the missiles that they can fire = you cant even attack them without having to worry about the missile barage thats gonna exterminate you if 10 of them hit.\n\nWith that being said, this is a very fun and challenging Mecha simulator and although it being above averagely difficult; this is one of the best Mecha Simulator I've played although it is in its Early Access develoment. Easy to play, Hard to Master.\n\n10/10 would recommend to any hardcore or non-hardcore Mecha/Gundam fans out there who want realistic and fast-paced Mecha combat.\n\n\nP.S. (Gundam Reference) You can finally pilot your own Mobile Suit with custom Psycoframe thats launches Beam Funnels like Char Aznable/Amuro Ray/Kira Yamato/Athrua Zala/Shin Asuka/Hero Yuy and be a Newtype/Coordinator/Seed Holder or whatever you want cuz this game gives you the freedom to choose how you pilot the Mech during combat !!!","April 30","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try to figure out a way to do this to make the review more accurate.\n\nIt's a tough recomendation in the state it is in.  While technically playable, my computer well exceeds the recomended specs but regularly drops below 15 fps even on the lowest settings and menus don't exceed 30 fps ever.  That's not to mention the constant crashing, In the few hours I played this, it crashed five times in game and several more in menus.  I tried playing with the settings to remedy this, but it really didn't fix the issue.  Controls were slippery as well, with inputs feeling off and unresponsive at times.\n\nBeyond the technical issues presentation is presently a mixed bag.  The graphics and story aren't presented well and feel very rough and unfinished, which they are.  I don't see the story ever becoming fantastic, but if they improve the cutscenes and presentation, they could have a fairly interesting, if cliche, mech storyline in the vein of Gundam (with some suprising parallels to Zeorymer).  Some of the Graphics are great, others are not, it comes with early access, but the game certainly looks passable and will probably continue to.  Music is fitting and feels very much like a mech show with lots of trumpets and strings.  The voice acting and sound effects could both use some work as the voice acting lacks emotion at times and the sound effects feel a little dull and lifeless given the scope of the battles.\n\nWhere the game really seems to shine is the gameplay though. It is super solid, playing like a mix of Armored Core and Zone of the Enders (more the later than the former.).  While a little -okay, a lot- unbalanced presently (the drones are kind of a win button) there is really the foundations of something really great here.\n\nFor the future, I would like to see the story expanded so we have a clear view of our protagonist (or is it protagonists, it doesn't really make that clear) and what is actually going on beyond that or just make it clear who we are playing as.  I would also like to see some cutscenes put in, even if they are only a mech hitting another mech.  I would also like to see the balace issues fixed, with weapons other than the drones being useful and the sword feeling like it actually does damage.  It would also be cool to vary up the gameplay beyond "shoot every thing on the screen by locking on and sending out drones" especially in what I assume are the boss fights as they really don't feel any different from every other part of the game.  Oh yeah, and the technical issues improved.\n\nSo for now, I would give a recomendation to those who enjoyed Armored Core (specifically 4 and For Answer) and ZoE as well as those who really like Gundam or similar shows.  If nothing seems to improve in a couple of months, I would probably hesitate even further to recomend this, it really needs work in the technical department.","April 15","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

Sound acting is not bad as well althought nothing to worth noting about though\n\nVisuals:\nMy rig can only take up to high so I can't comment for very high options. While the terrain details are not the best, especially for urban maps, it is more than made up for in the combat scenes when your own unit starts spamming missiles and funnels and bullets.\n\nOverall verdict, it's a great game considering that it's still in early access, can't wait to see how this game will develop considering that there is still a lot of room for development in many aspects such as the story, the chara development and also, the possibility of multiplayer and mech customisation","June 5","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
