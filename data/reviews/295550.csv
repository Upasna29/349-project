The quests consist of gather that, kill this, talk to this guy, give this guy this, etc etc and they have you running around huge amounts of land which is very time consuming.\n-Forced PVP in some areas, I got killed without knowing twice by some random player while doing a quest.\n-Obviously a Pay to win game, even the cosmetics give you +5% hp or +5% stamina, and those are just items ON TOP of your actual equipment. I have also not received a regular mount 20 levels into the game, so paying is your only option to get a mount as far as I can see.\n-Again, very generic mmo, this game would have been good 8 years ago.\nconclusion: this game isn't worth your time, there's way better mmorpgs out there.","August 1, 2014","false","6.2"," 1,285 of 1,481 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","285","1","2","43"

By f2p they meant you can download the game for free and log-in to it and that's it. Once in the game you immediately see how badly they want you to pay to play the game,\n1. Your inventory space, you'll be throwing stuff every now and then just to accomodate the things you need the most.\n2. Deep in a dungeon/far from the city and want to go back? go buy teleport from the item shop else suicide your character.\n3. Quest is too far, can I have at least a low quality mount sold from an NPC to travel faster? No, go buy from item shop else be a warrior (they somehow have some for sale).\n4. I saved hundreds of thousands just to buy a mount from a greedy paying player, I'm bad ♥♥♥ now right? Hell no, that's just some low quality mount unless you feed it(go buy from the greedy player again or the item shop).\n5. You seem to have lots of things that needs to be bought from the item shop, we can do daily quests to earn small amount of item shop currency right? Hell no! get lost you filthy Earth scum! lol\n\nThese are just a few of the things that I personally dislike about the game but to be fair I'll add something good about it.\n1. It's just another MMO, you know the game you play just for nothing. You just want to try it and not expect anything great about it.\n2. You'll probably be turned-off in just a few hours of gameplay therefore it won't be able to waste your time a bit more unless you try to make the game likable but in the end fail(like me).","August 10, 2014","false","48.0"," 457 of 561 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","457","561","11","11"

More backspack in your tiny backpack? Pay up. Per item type (equipment, loot, potions, quest items). Would you like to revive instantly? Pay up. Fast travel for no gold? Pay up. Pet collars? Pay up. In fact, you're constantly nagged with functionality that requires you to either get a premium membership or pay a one time fee in premium currency. Constantly.\n\nIf you don't have a premium membership, you receive a lot less gold, experience and loot. Your resurrecting sickness lasts seven times longer, and much much more.\n\nThe game itself is alright. There are tons of different spells, and different classes really do feel like different classes. Some quests are unique and interesting, but most are fetch, deliver or kill quests. The PVP wasn't well thought through, and can be tedious at times. Most areas look similar, and enemies are not very unique in the way they act.\n\nThe chat is horrendous and unintuitive. This leads to very little chatter over the airways and a sort of isolated feeling, as if you're not really in an mmorpg.\n\nOverall, the relentless pushing to get you to pay up spoils most of the fun, especially since your basic account is so limited it's hard not to feel pressured into spending money. I can't recommend it.","June 6, 2015","false","73.2"," 117 of 134 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","117","134","0","4"

When you first get into the game the first thing they do is try to get your money... and when i say try to.. they TRY TO.. all these screens pop up to buy premium and then shows you the item shop next, this is before you have even got started on the game. So.. of course i took a look though the store, and this is all Pay 2 Win, meaning..There is no balance for Paid vs. Free players. I understand the whole idea of these Free 2 Play games, but this game is clearly just out for your money. Its not like other games that have great balance like LOL, Dota, CSGO, Neverwinter.. ect ect.. Don't get me wrong some people like Pay 2 Win, but what sets this apart from others is their dire need to lure you in before you even get started in the game and this to me just screams desperation.\n\nYour next question probably is going to ask is this a turnbased game, my answer to that is yes and no.. its semi turnbased due to the controls, its def not hack and slash as most would generally expect.\n\nThe eye view on this game is also terrible.. really terribe, i would suggest not getting this game till its 100% free and not pay for anything till you have tried it out for yourself. Some people like point and clicks, some people like terrible views, some people like Pay 2 Win, but since this is my review i dont.\n\nAt this time i do not recommend this game. I will continue to watch for updates and see if they make any changes to controls then ill give it a shot again, for now..

I gotta say, The people I've met here in RQ were kind, and sharing. Community Is Great(I'd rate it 7.5/10) There are trolls and ragers, But not that many. Now, the gameplay is pretty strange since this was my first click to move MMO that I've Played. You get used to it though, I see why they would drop the normal WASD key configuration to click 2 move since there are many spells in each classes(LOTS,There are also many Slots to add in your interface,Side slots and 3 rows on the bottom). Also this game forces you to pay for blessings, which is a time duration item that gives a certain amount of bonus exp+gold intake for an amount of time.\n\nNow about the bad things to point out. To reset skills 1-20(Yes, there is a limit of levels where you only can reset from a certain item) 1-20 is where it only takes about 200 gold(which is really REALLY easy to get). Now 21-49, you need a flower. This Flower costs about 99 reales(reales are REAL LIFE CASH-Worth about $2-$3). The flower can be easily bought for about 800k+ and is pretty expensive for people that are levels 21-49. Now 50-60 is where it gets really damn serious. To reset you need to spend $$$(199 reales) or 2-3 Mil gold in game just to reset. This is ridiculous In my opinion. Also note that there are 2 certain categories to reset, Talent Points and Characteristic Points(STR-INTEL-VIT-LUCK-DEX) Which makes you have to spend x2 the money just to reset everything. This Plus the Blessings people usually buy.\n\nNow the PvP system. The PvP system they have for RQ was only probably meant for 1v1s, Only because there are so many single target spells for many of the classes,subclasses etc. PvP In royal quest always connected to eachother. Meaning that One class counters another and another.\n\nFinally, the conclusion of what I think about this game is that if you are beginning to play MMOs, This is a really REALLY great example of what to play as your first MMo. But if you are an experienced MMo player and a hardcore MMo player like me, There are so many MMos that beats this one(No offense Royal Quest).\n\n\nRattings-\n\nOverall Gameplay-7.5/10\n\nCombat-6/10\n\nEz Navigation-8/10\n\nCommunity-9/10\n\nGraphics-6/10\n\nStoryLine-2/10\n\nThis is all In my Opinion, Please Do NOT get offended If I said anything wrong about RQ.","January 19, 2015","false","920.9"," 210 of 279 people (75%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","75","210","279","20","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/recommended/295550/","TheFattestCoporateCat","CoporateFatCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/","700 products in account","For all those calling this P2W you need to quit reviewing F2P games, you have no clue how F2P works. Every MMO F2P game has microtransactions. Someone has to pay for server upkeep and development, in short no F2P MMO will ever be truly free.\n\nThe upper hand Royal Quest has over it's competitors is that over 95% of what can be bought with cash can also be sold in the in game market for gold. Collecting gold in game is also very easy for players who do not want to pay any cash into the game. Even the cash shop currency can be sold. So it gives no advantage to any players that prefer to buy cash shop items.\n\nThis is actually a great game and THE MOST BALANCED F2P with cash shop items I have ever played and I have played them all, literally. I am sick of the all the ♥♥♥♥ poor reviews of games by players who don't have enough knowledge into said game to give it an factual review.\n\nSo let's clear up some of these misconceptions already put out there for this particular game:\n\n1. Bag space. Your bag upon starting is split into 5 sections with 14 spaces each, that is 70 slots total. I've played plenty of "F2P" MMORPG's with less.\n\n2. There is no forced PVP Zones. You can choose to follow your open world quests and grind or you can join the sandbox PVP zone for boosted EXP points.\n\n3. EVERYTHING except the market currency can be bought at different NPC's, INCLUDING CASH SHOP ITEMS AND MOUNTS FOR IN GAME CURRENCY! One of the best mounts in the game cannot even be bought, it has to be unlocked with quest items. You don't have to buy these items just from players. Cash shop currency can be bought through the auction house . And they have included a maximum/minimum cap on how much a player can charge for cash shop currency. This is to fight gold farming companies. IN WHICH CASE NO OTHER "F2P" game has ever initiated a limiting system like this and has actually done very well for this game. You won't ever go into town seeing shouts of "Golds 200k=9.00 US @ royalquestgolds.com" or some garbage along those lines.\n\n4. You don't have to pay anything to get in as some other review has mentioned.\n\n5. Another reviewer had mentioned getting constantly killed by another player with OP cash shop gear. You cannot buy gear in the cash shop for this game. You cannot buy the ingredients in the cash shop to craft gear. This RPG much like every other RPG is heavily character build based. I haven't purchased **** since I first started playing and was already dropping characters 10 levels higher in the PVP zone in the most basic gear I could pick up. Also in which case PVP zones are limited by levels also so no getting into battles at level 13 with level 47 characters. PVP Zones are level designated & only allow a 10 level difference.\n\n6. Now with the newest update all classes are about balanced in PVP. The crusader for a time there was a tad bit horrible but the new update has fixed that.\n\n7. No kill stealing, no powerleveling. Everyone who hits an enemy will gain their proper share of exp from it. Even if you are not partied with that/those other person/people. However who ever does the most total damage will get the loot. All characters in a party with the exception of PVP zones, since parties can get split up in the zone, must hit the targets to get exp from it. No letting another character stand aside gaining EXP while a higher level character decimates the battlefield. Each person must attack to get their exp share. Again another way to combat gold farms & their services. In the PVP zones however, you will get exp from ally kills no matter where you are and the total end exp when you leave the zone is what you truly get, it is not split up dismally between the party when you leave. What you see is what you  get.\n\n8. All mobs that can aggro will be aggro'd. A system in Royal Quest needed in most MMORPG's to eliminate people's needs for vacuum hacking. If you run past 20 aggro set monsters in Royal Quest you will pull 20 aggro set monsters. At that point it's fight or flight. Which can make for some interesting save-your-***-moments. Had another character try &  run past me pulling roughly 10 monsters, he ended up dying right next to me and in an instant they were set on me.\n\n9. There is no such thing as junk in Royal Quest. Everything you pick up can and will be used for crafting something or commission(repeatable) quests which give Exp/gold/items sometimes all 3 and a few of them give a cash shop item. Even not so great gear can be broken down for crafting materials. Which makes making money in the game so easy. There is always somebody looking for what you have. And as I had mentioned earler more than 95% of cash shop items are sellable in the market. There really is no upper hand for cash users, unless you think that NO bonus stat costume is giving the player at the controls an ego boost...(At this time there are only 4 total pieces of costumes/pets/decorations that give bonus stats, which are horrible compared to the stats you can get from crafting normally).\n\n10. Fair level up system for those of us who work. Your character gains 2x exp points when you are offline resting. The exp amount is dependant on your character level. Fetch, kill and collect quests are pretty fair in ratio at each level. So for collect quests which take the most time you can grind for a little bit, collect the money then buy the necessary collection items in the market/auction house.\n\nIt is your standard point & click, press skill button, type of game. Lightweight on processor and graphic usage. For those that prefer WASD movement like myself...as someone else had mentioned, the point and click system absolutely sucks. Because of this, I would compare this game to a cross between point & click ease of Diablo, skill system of Dekaron, and speed of Dragon Nest (When you get into higher levels of course). Some AoE's have a targeting system similiar to that of Wildstar. Camera movement is very Diablo-esque, which can also be annoying sometimes. This game could also use a better guide on how to obtain certain types of currency in game for specific NPC's, and NO, none of this special currency cannot be bought in the cash shop.\n\nHOWEVER, ONE WARNING: This game has been in open beta for over 2 years now(Yeah, I know that is rather ridcilulous.). So be prepared for major changes that could be postive or negative.","September 27, 2014","true","973.5"," 147 of 201 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","147","201","9","18"

Until you hit level 20 or so, and then you're forced to go into pvp zones to gather quest items. These zones are designed for trolls. Don't get me wrong, there are some people who understand that you're only there to get what you need for a quest or two and then leave. Or just to farm some xp for your next level. But thats about 1% of the people in said zones. The zones usually encompass 9-10 levels meaning you could be level 20 trying to grind and there is a level 28 trying to do the same. Except when you come across someone who is 8 levels ahead and is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they just continuously kill you. Long story short, the game is designed for trolls beyond level 20.

You can also use Grass Chewing Gum which gives you 20% Runspeed for 15 minutes, you can get it from a daily quest or dropped from monsters (its rare to get a drop), you can also buy it from the Market fairly cheap.\n\nA Mount and a Pet can be bought from an NPC (Head of the Merchant Guild) to the south of city square in Varlone City.\n\nReales can be bought from Market for 10-14k gold per Reale, 10x Mount Feed is 29 Reales and last for 1 hour each (290-406k for 10 hours of extra buffs, which you totally dont need if you are just PVMing although it would be useful), Silver Collar 2000 Charge is the same 29 Reales. You can get 100x Mount Feed for 269 Reales and Gold Collar 9000 Charge for 99 Reales. This is on the EU Maragorne Server.\n\nBAGS AND WAREHOUSE\n\nYou have 14 slots for each type of item they are split into Equipment, Expendables, Loot and Crafting Items. You can store excess/rare items in your Warehouse which has 27 slots available accessible at any Maiden. The 2 Bags that get full fairly quickly are Expendables and Loot but once you learn what you should keep and what should be sold to NPC or put on the Market you won't have too many bag problems.\n\nEQUIPMENT, ITEM IMPROVEMENT AND SEALING\n\nALL Equipment in the game can either be bought from NPCs, Crafted, Dropped from Monsters, Found in Dungeons (Marked by a Cross Shaped Grave Stone with Blue particle effects, these are mostly personal so you will not be able to sell them on the Market) or bought from Players via the Market.\n\nItem improvement is done through Alchemists you will know the NPC is an Alchemist because they will have an Alchemical Cauldron next to them which is used to craft recipes. Philosopher Stone Chips are used to upgrade C Class Equipments only, Philosopher Stone Shards are used to upgrade B and A Class Equipments. Ashkalot Cubes can be used to upgrade any item while reducing its cost and protecting it from breaking (there is a daily to get these cubes), Cash Shop items can help in your upgrading but if you start using those before level 40 you are just wasting your money.\n\nSealing is EXPENSIVE, this allows your equipment to gain extra stats quality of seal is as follows from worst to best Green/Blue/Purple/Orange. Emeralds are used to seal C Class Equipments, Sapphires for B Class Equipments and Morions for A Class Equipments. Crystal Vessels can be obtained through a daily quest, this item can be used to grant you Blood Crystal which can be used to place a new seal on an already sealed item (The current seal will be DELETED and a NEW seal put on). Emerald, Sapphire, Morion and Crystal Vessels can be purchased from Master of Enchantment outside of Academy of Magic Varlone City bottom right of map. Cash Shop items only help to alter the seals already on the equipment or to allow the lowest quality of Blue to be added.\n\nDAILIES AND X2 EXPERIENCE\n\nThere will be many dailies but the two worth mentioning are Caustic Acid (This nets you 3 Ashkolot Cubes for 50 Caustic Acid) and Green Slime (This nets you 2 Crystal Vessels for 50 Green Slimes), you can take these quests soon after you hit level 20 from the Message Board in Varlone City centre to the bottom right. You can also get a free Emerald along with 2 Potions from Protecting the Vegetable Garden from Pests taken from Connor Barr in Elgore. You can bring up available quests by hitting the M or Q key and clicking the Available Quests tab top right (You will need to bring up the map and click this tab and quest to see where to go for it each time you lose your way).\n\nYou will gain resting bonus experience if you are not on your character for more than 8 hours to a max of 20 hours this works on all quests and monsters you gain experience from will be doubled till it is depleted.\n\nBELLA THE RARITY BUYER AND SELLA THE COLLECTOR\n\nCards are rare drops from monsters which can be given to Bella for Insignia's of Distinction or sold on the Market. Various items can be bought from Sella for Insignia's of Distinction including PREMIUM TIME as well as a few things that can be bought in Cash Shop which includes Decorations that give +5% Health. They are both located in centre court of Varlone City to the northwest. You can also gain Insignia's of Distinction by PVPing in PVM/PVP areas Rewards are given monthly and you must be in the top 20 PVPers.\n\nCRAFTING\n\nMost loots are used for crafting, C Class Equipments are 100%, B Class 80% and A Class 60%. Flax is important in crafting you find this randomly by digging up plants. Ores are also found scattered around areas and as you progress through the game you will find the higher quality ores, digging ores also gets you Anthricite. Elum is obtained through Equipment that you put in the Splitter, the higher level the Equipment the more Elum you will get, Red Elum comes from Weapons, Blue Elum comes from Clothing (Armor, Headgear etc), Green Elum comes from Accessories (Rings, Amulets etc). So keep those Equipment drops! if you plan on crafting (Crafting gets you personal gear with slots, the same as Dungeons). WARNING keep all Gem drops if you do plan on crafting as they drop rarely and are used in recipes at high levels. Some Crafting Recipes can be bought from NPCs inside of PVM/PVP areas, they require you gather Elenium nodes which will give you Alchemical Runes with which to buy the Recipes. Recipes also drop from monsters. You can find all the machines necessary for crafting/splitting at the east side of Varlone City, SPECIAL NOTE the Elenium Converter requires Alchemical Runes to change 1 material to another.\n\nPVP FIGHTING ARENA\n\nPushing A on your keyboard brings up a Menu with Battleground, Arena and Store (in the Center, Blue button), You can join Arena 5 times a day to earn Blood Tokens which in turn can be used to buy from the Arena Store to improve your prowess vs other players, there is also a Mount and Pet as well as various potions.\n\nTo conclude the game is beautiful the music is great and I enjoy playing it for free.\n\nI hope you found this Review(Guide) informative and insightful.\n\nGo here for more!\nAll about RQ and MORE![eu.royalquest.com]\n\nHAPPY RQing!","September 6, 2014","true","530.9"," 124 of 170 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","124","170","6","11"

I was a warrior, and i wanted to be a Dark Knight. There were 2 options to become one. 1. i could kill a room full of mobs and then kill the "Horrid Beast" or i could go grind for a few hours, collecting 65 peices of grass. I picked the faster, and obvious, Horrid Beast line. So i clean out the room rather easily and then get ready for the beast. well the beast killed me and i respawned. so i started strategizing and saw that potions heal instantly and i can be in combat, so i get the 100% health potion and i bought a very expensive Energy restoration potion from the market and try again.. and again... and again.. because no matter how many times you try, you cannot kill this monster. I had the best gear i could get, i spent hours grinding levels and weapons and i even bought the Welcome Pack.\n\nNot to mention the countless payment walls i noticed. Bag space is limited to about 15 slots, you can extend your bag if you pay with "Reals" which are the premium currency. theres a premium shop full of gear and stuff you could buy, not to mention the other 2 "Dlc" items that add gear and stuff to your account. If you want anything in this game, you have to buy it.\n\n*EDIT*\nSo ive been getting comments (Like Kez1304, stating that since i had 2 options of getting an objective done that its not "pay to win". first off, thats completely and utterly false. its a paywall, a very classic example of a paywall. And on top of that, he said that i didnt spend a dime on the game, so let me clarify.), which i have deleted because steam does not allow comment replies, and most people are spineless and dont allow comments on their profile. I had bought 2/3 DLC packs, which gave me a very powerful edge on the gameplay. Potions, armor, weapons, items, mounts.. all in one pack. On top of that, most items in game cost gold, which is really hard to grind........ unless you buy it with the premium currency.","October 25, 2015","false","25.4"," 87 of 115 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","87","115","7","2"

Here are the reasons simply said from someone who has played the game for 2K hours and was stupid anough to think the game was going to get better:\n1. The game Screams pay to play. Only people who enjoy it are the ones who pay and it's because the pretty much rule the server and decide if you will ever get gear as good as theirs.\n2. Very slow grinding - common for many MMOs but when you're not a premium user and you have to waste 6 hours for 2% by doing the same daily quests over and over and over untill they end and congrats + 2% xp gained.\n3. Lack of Quests. I swear in a couple of hours of play you're going to finish all your quests for your level and you will be forced to play in a PVP map where any parties of players or possibly a player with 9 levels above you will kill you, take your items, you have a chance to spawn right next to them and will give you weakness witch you need to wait out.\n4. The Community and Forums are ♥♥♥♥. If you don't agree that the game is a masterpiece and it needs no player feedback, suggestions, balance or some improvement then you're just a "♥♥♥♥ing idiot with no place on this planet who should uninstal the game because you can't tell what's high class and perfection and you should go die"\n5. The Steam version is EU+US version. Don't play it. I know it sounds stupid but find the Russian version. They hold events so common, players are nice to each other, the gap between paying and non-paying players is shorter, prices at market don't charge you absurd and unpayable prices, your feedback is rewarded and there are English speaking players.\n\nIf you want to try this game out go ahead, you have been warned. As soon as you reach level 27 your fun is going to End. Have a nice day and maybe look for a better MMO","November 19, 2015","false","452.6"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","41","47","6","6"

You can buy premium currency with gold. Second off, most of the people who are bad mouthing the game either have very low hours played (under 5) or got their ♥♥♥♥ rocked in PVP (Which is entirely optional)\n\nIt feels alot like Ragnarok Online but with better graphics and animations. There are also far more skills than Ragnarok.\nThe leveling is slow, but the game isn't all about leveling.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalavine/recommended/295550/","dalavine","Dalavine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalavine/","456 products in account","First, complete ripoff of the classic MMO, Ragnarok Online. It misses what Ragnarok had however by.... messing up completely.\n\nFurthermore!, everything about the game screams, "GET OUT NOW UNLESS YOU PAY US!!!". Within killing a few different types of monsters and grabbing up the loot, my bag space become completely full. No, wait.... there are seperate bag slots [equip/use/loot/ect], my LOOT bag became full almost instantly. It was then that I took a look at the bags, just a few measly slots. If you are going to try and become a crafter, you NEED to pay for extra room.... or just do a lot more work than you should have to.\n\nI died. Yes, it happens. I died and got the option to revive in spot instead of having to walk for five minutes to get back to where I was. Thing is, in order to revive on spot, you NEED to pay for that. I didn't take a close look at how much the in game currency costs but I think it's like 25c in order to revive on spot. That's $1 for 4 on spot revivals... YIPPEE!!!\n\nI said it before, I'll say it again, this game STOLE everything about Ragnarok Online, changed some of the gameplay, changed the grid layout to more of an 8 direction instead of 4 like RO, changed the art and called it fresh.\nTHIS. IS. NOT. FRESH! This is copywrite infringement at it's worst.\n\nJesus... I thought Hunters Blade was a travesty against Monster Hunter, this is worse because it has the potential to actually succeed, to actually make a truly obscene amount of money. And it IS obscene because it IS theft. They are trying to profit off of one of the most amazing MMO's that has ever existed and they are saying it's like nothing else??\nThey said, point blank, "Guild Wars". Catchy name, huh? I wonder why... hmm... because it's one of the top MMO's of our day? I get it, yes, they mean War of Emporium. They couldn't very well say THAT could they?\n\nThey are getting away with copywrite infringement because, while the game is an obvious clone of RO, nothing is exactly the same. Fly Wing [randomly teleport] isn't called Fly Wing, Elder Tree are called Stock [who came up with that lame name?] and don't drop branches that summon random monsters [that I have seen...] and just... everything is slightly different.\n\nIt still just.... it isn't right. They are going to make a killing off their truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ [against players] P2W system and it isn't even their game.\n\nAnd, honestly, it isn't even very good. I had people constantly come up to me while I was fighting, wait till my monster had like 10% health, attack it once for the kill and steal it.... the exp, the items.... everything.\nI think that's how the comabt system worked in RO [or... am I wrong... it's been years] but these days, people have no internet morals. Give people a way to kill monsters, get items and exp without having to fight, without having to lose health and mana/energy/ect.... they will do it.\n\nI remember in RO how the bots would always take stuff... they were the only one's... well, them and noobs but noobs learned fast that it's better to be chill and not steal. Oh, that brings me to another point!; I played for a few hours, there were some people just running around killing everything, stealing kills... same people... for hours. The game ALREADY has bots!!! I mean they are f***ing cockroaching the game already!!! Bots. Killed. RO. Based on the amount of bots in the game... I don't really know for sure if the game WILL survive..... I just know that it has no right to survive. It is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripoff of one of the greatest MMO's of the past.... well... of the internet ever actually!\n\nMy top list of MMO's [some of the games do not apply past certain points, only at their high points but it is the high points that count to me] are, in no particular order.\n\nWoW\nRagnarok Online\nStar Wars Galaxies [pre CU but LOVED Jump to Lightspeed!!]\nThe Secret World\nMabinogi & Vindictus [putting them both together because same game universe]\nEVE Online\nMonster Hunter Frontier [even though I only played a few hours, I know I would love it most of all~]\nDungeons and Dragons Online [before the crappy P2W version...]\nThe -nevergonnahappen- Pokemon MMO that is crossplatform between PC, WiiU and 3DS!!! The dream of an open world Pokemon MMO fuels my hopes and dreams for a better age of MMO's!\n\nI'm probably forgetting some.... hmm... but one thing that I'm not forgetting is ANY MMO that is thick with Pay to Win!! DISGUSTING!! Just add cosmetic stuff, people go crazy for that and the more that people play a game, fall in love with it, the more likely they are to BUY COSMETIC STUFF!!!! JESUS!!! It isn't that hard to understand is it?\n♥♥♥♥, just make some of the cosmetic stuff only available for a short time, people will rush to give money for that!!\nEr... that.... that right there is just in general. Cosmetic only for F2P MMO's.... this one, this MMO, it NEEDS to either die or the developers need to admit that they stole most of the game from Gravity [the people that made [[?]] Ragnarok Online].\n\n","August 10, 2014","false","1.9"," 92 of 146 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","92","146","4","1"

If somoene buys an item with real money, they can sell it for in game gold, and people frequently do.  This is one of the best systems of any free to play ive ever seen.  If you dont feel like spending 5$ to get a "real money" item, just wait til someone else buys it and sells it.  You can just get enough in game gold to buy it off them when you want!\n\nI could continue, going on and on about the game in paragraph form, but ill simply list the Pros and Cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Fantastic Music\n- Responsive/noncomplicated UI\n- Veried Environments and Enemies\n- Varied Missions and mission rewards\n- Tons of weapons, hats, shirts, pants, shoes, etc; all with unique stats\n- Gear Upgrading system. (Find a reall nice piece of gear? Upgrade it and make it better!)\n- Lack of Pay-to-Win Elements\n- Devs are active! They do announcements in game, as well as work on updates, and help players who are having issues.\n- Fantastic community. If youre a new player, 99% of the community will answer any question you have and try to help you along the way!\n\n----------------------------\n\nCONS:\n\n- Occasional bugs, but nothing major\n- Bag size is relatively small to start with (this can be expanded at any time)\n- Some Quests have you running across large portions of the map, and you move slowly at first (better gear can fix this "problem")\n- Game is still in Beta. (This will obviously change, leading up to the full release)\n\n----------------------------\n\nHonestly I only made this review because the current top rated reviews for the game are completely inaccurate.  Most of the people who reviewed the game and then said "PAY TO WIN DONT PLAY IT LOL" are completely wrong.  They invested just enough time to get to about level 15 (not even to the first major choice you make in the game, which branch of your class you want to advance into) and then declared the game unbalanced.\n\nNot only is this completely false (as i said above, someone can, and people constantly do, buy "real money" currency and sell it on the in game market for gold. You get gold, you buy the real money currency, and you dont have to ever spend a cent on the game) But it gives the game a bad name and bad light.\n\nI played for about 2 hours and then quit originally, but came back a month or two later and havnt quit playing since.  Once i got past the newbie level stuff, I really began to enjoy the game a lot more.\n\nI also think its important to mention this is my first MMO.  I literally only play Shooters besides this game, and I usually hate games like this.  It takes something special to make a hardcore CSGO fan enjoy a top down-esque ♥♥♥♥♥♥me.","January 27, 2015","true","501.7"," 82 of 130 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","82","130","8","9"

Later, i will probably edit this.\n\nFirst of all, if you are a King's Bounty fan,you will probably like this game... It is developed by Katauri,same developer.\n\nNow, step by step explanation:\n\n-it isn't open world,you have regions like Dragon Nest\n\nMovement:\n- identical like King's Bounty\Diablo, as in Click to move,( no WASD).\nDespite this, it's not a Hack'n'slash game.\n-it has also an auto-path movement,which can only be activated through opening the map.( i hate this autopath in general).\nStupid thing: in autopath movement,you are not safe, the mobs will attack you... :))\n\nCombat:\n-you have skill bars,like any other mmorpg, but it also have the auto-attack skill which can be disabled (quite tricky though).\n- i play as a rogue,which has energy as a resource skill spenders.\nUnlike any other mmo, the energy bar is refilling very slow,and makes you wanna use the auto-attack which makes you feel like you're watching a movie or smth, because there's nothing for you to do... (big downside here...)\nif you don't use the auto-attack,you will lose energy after 2-3 battles and need potions to refill... which you need to buy...\n\nLevelling up:\n-at each level you obtain 4 skill points that need to be distributed through 4 skills... all this time, i spent them equally between the skills ,because (and maybe here i wasn't paying attention) i cannot find a skill that suits best for my rogue...\n\nquesting:\n-basically,like any other free-to-play mmo is kill that,bring quest,receive items, etc... kinda grindy imo...\n\nitem enhancements:\n-you need some resources for that, which i couldn't find until this level... maybe you can buy them from merchants....\n\nProfessions:\n-until this level, i couldn't find out if this is really a feature...\nyou can gather all sorts of items,grassy things,ooze things, etc, but i couldn't find any use for them,so i sold them to merchants...\n\nbags:\n-you start with one bag,slots can be bought with royal reales,which can be obtain with real cash...,until now, i found no need to buy extra slots,but after each quest, i sold everything unneeded to merchants...\n-stupidest thing: you have different tabs in bag (equipment,consumables,etc), but NO ALL tab.! so everytime you need to do something or to search something in your bag, you'll have to switch between tabs... kinda annoying.\n\nGraphics:\n\nstyle identical to King's Bounty (same engine), i give it 9\10\n\nMusic:\n\nnice, but nothing compared to the music in King's Bounty,which is amazing...\nalthough I entered a dungeon of some sort,which had the same song as in KB :)\n\nPlayerbase:\nin this moment,i found only one player in the zone,but this is because 1C Publishing made a HUGE mistake on launch:\nthey announced it is an Open Beta with only 3 hours before launch,and turned out to be DLC purchase players only,for the first week!\n\nOverall:\n-it has potential..\n-don't spend your money to get early access, wait another week,until it's free.\n-i will spend some more time playing this game,and if you like KB,you need to try it.","August 1, 2014","false","6.6"," 63 of 99 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","63","99","0","1"

But here is a thing you can buy cash shop money "reales" with gold from other ppl in the market so you can obtain same stuff just not instantly\n\nSecond : Game is a bit grindy, with ques,t which helps a little but you will grind for items, for craft mats etc but in my opinion its good that you can't get good stuff instantly\n\nAnd third : Game has open pvp zones where you go to farm mats for recepies soem quests and other stuff and its free pk zone on all ofc its lvl based you can't get in to lvl 10-19 zone with lvl 20+ char\n\nSo overal i like this game, I played for 200h and still gona play it as its pvp is engaging , there is NONE p2w aspect only pay to be lazy aspect, and the game has a freaking castle wars :D owning a castle is always fun","August 8, 2014","true","242.9"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","46","71","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewmewGirl/recommended/295550/","MewmewGirl","MewmewGirl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewmewGirl/","259 products in account","I'm sort of confused by some of the negative reviews, as I'm finding this to be a pretty decent game that doesn't have many problems.\n\nFirst, it has a lot of lore and story to it.  It's not just quests like "Kill 10 rats because I stubbed my toe and need toe medicine" - the quests have more detail and story to them than that.  Each quest has been pretty detailed so far with lots of extra tidbits of story and lore you can get out of the NPCs if you select to ask them certain questions.\n\nYou also find a lot of NPCs that aren't part of the quest line but that actually have story bits to add if you talk to them.  I find this extra work and detail to help the game to be much more immersive.\n\nThe classes are all very different.  If you don't like the way one plays, you really should try the others as they all have their own different way to play and their own feel.  The powers are all different and specific for each class line and greatly change and affect the way you play.  This isn't like some games where the only difference in classes and skills are that they make a different graphic for them but they play the same way.  Here they all really play in specific unique ways.  Even when two classes have traps, one class they are auto traps and the other are traps you manually detonate.  There are a pretty good amount of skills too and they all have purpose and do different things rather than just being damage upgrades that look a little different.\n\nThe game plays out just fine and quickly.  Yes, your main attack if you click something is set on default to autoattack (like 99.9% of every MMORPG that exists, so why one would complain about that I don't know - especially since you can toggle it off to manual if you really want) but in most classes that attack is very fast and you're going to be worried about using all your skills all through combat.  You quickly end up using a lot of them.  The only class that plays a little slower to start out is the Warrior, but even they end up with a lot of skills in time too.  If you're into melee and want faster combat, play the Rogue.  The Warrior is meant to actually be a party tank and has a lot of taunts and things instead of the fast pace skills of the other classes.  That isn't to say they are lacking, they have quite a few and you'll see them as you level up more.\n\nThe game isn't well known here, so there aren't a lot of people in game right now.  Not only that, but they don't really understand why it's a free game they can't get in (the first week is just for people who buy one of the DLC packs, but they only say that if you go searching elsewhere to find that info and didn't post that here).\n\nI'm not that into PvP, but for people who are they have these nice castles your guild can take over that spawn chests of loot and have other neat little extras in them.\n\nI don't really get their whole "PvPvE" thing - that's just a fancy way to say PvP zones.  Most MMORPG games with PvP also have monsters in the same zones but they just call them PvP zones instead of trying to be fancy with the wording.  I really very much dislike PvP and want to avoid it, so I'll have to see how much it affects my gameplay as I level up.  I hope it's avoidable and not too too bad.  A description at their web site says there are quests in those areas which I never enjoy being forced to go to PvP zones to do quests, especially in game that has so much story and I really am enjoying reading all the quest text.  I'm not really there yet though to see how that's going to affect my play.  It could have a huge negative affect for me and even get me to quit if it's bad enough but I'll just have to wait to get there to see.\n\nThe camera angles really aren't that bad.  I think they limited it in order to make the game work better on lesser systems, I'm not sure.  It runs very smooth and pretty though and I don't really see why they can't allow you to pan it so you can see into the distance a little more but you do have some tilt control and it's really not too bad.\n\nThe one thing I dislike though and very much want to see change is for us to get the ability to use WASD movement in the game.  A lot of games like this launch with click to move movement only, and it's always the same.  I get sick of clicking so much, it's a pain in the butt after a while.  They really need to change the game to allow keyboard movement controls as well.  I know it doesn't work great for every situation, like if people set the camera to auto movement, but they could always disable it if you have auto camera on or find some other work around.  Too many people are going to want WASD movement controls, maybe they'll listen and put them in game in time though.\n\nSo I'm finding a pretty decent game here.  You may want to wait and not chance it, and give it another 4 or 5 days until it's opened for free to everybody, but I for one am very happy with the game as it is and am glad I bought a DLC pack so I could play now.  Even if PvP areas make me quit later (again I still don't know if they will or not, it depends if I can still level and quest around without having to deal with them for the most part) - I still will be happy that I got and played the game.  It's been interesting and fun and is a good example of how to put real story and more meaning into quests.  It also is doing something very right with the skill system all being so different.  Hopefully once it's opened for free a lot of people will find out just how much they like it too.\n\nThe video they have here really doesn't show much of the game, you can find videos elsewhere online of people playing the game if you really want to see how it plays though.  They don't take the time to read and go through all the extra text and things in those videos however, so if you're a person who really likes story and lore in your games you won't really see how cool it is until you're able to get in there yourself.","August 2, 2014","true","21.2"," 99 of 167 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","99","167","2","9"

All of the character designs are pretty much the same, everyone has the same weapons, the same clothes etc. The good thing is that plenty of people play it, so if you need help with a dungeon, there is a pretty big chance that someone else is looking for a party too. However, it also has its downfalls because it takes forever to farm the items you need for a quest because 10 people are in the same area doing the same thing. Its nearly impossible to find a guild because the forums are dead or unless someone invites you randomly.  Oh, its also click click click. Click to move, Click to attack, blah blah.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the fact that the inventory space is so small! Like 10 slots! And they want you to pay money to get more. If you are out farming for quest items and need to get stuff to make gold, your inventory fills up so fast. Sometimes you forget to sell stuff and have to go all the way back to the npc to sell stuff before you move on to the next area.\n\nAlso, it might be worth pointing out: A lot of people don't like pvp in this game despite there being pvp in certain maps. I was in an area where I had to collect quest items that was a pvp area and soooo many people were complaining about being PK'd. I don't think its that big of a deal because when you die, you spawn to a different random area on the map without having to respawn to a npc far away.","May 16, 2015","false","5.8"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","0"

I don't understand how people are voting it down because you have to click to move. Like, have you played Diablo/Torchlight? Get over it. Anyway, back to the game:\n\nIt's an MMO, so be prepared for a lot of fetch quests. Besides this, it does some pretty unique things.\n\nFirst of which would be the leveling system. It's typical in the sense that every level you get stat points and sometimes a talent point, but the stat system is really cool. basically, every 10 points put into a specific stat, you get an extra bonus to it, and your 'rank' in that stat increases. So if I put 10 points into stamina, which is the rangers base stat, I'll get +15 to my damage output, on top of the points I put into it. Very unique and I enjoy ranking up stats.\n\nThe talent point system is also fairly unique, as they're all passives. There are multiple paths to travel down, which each give your class a unique playstyle. I'm not sure if there's a way to reset these, but I'm sure there is.\n\nThis game is NOT pay to win. You can obtain the premium currency by using gold, the in-game currency. Actually, gold is pretty easy to obtain as well, and so are most of the items in the game. It could be a bit of a grind, but that's how most MMOs work anyway, so it's not a big deal.\n\nI really have been enjoying my time with this game. It's fun, it's a good time waster, and it feels like there's been a lot of love and time put into it, in order to make it good. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun MMO to play with.","August 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","31","55","0","0"

While in truth this game isn't bad, and that the game play is fairly solid, it's also true that there's nothing new here. It's the typical MMO fair.\n\nThe movement controls are click-to-move, so if you've played Tourchlight or Diablo, you know what to expect. The camera feels a bit wonky at time, shifting to a higher angle at odd times, but thankfully you can rotate it 360 if needed. However the mini map doesn't rotate with you, so that gets annoying.\n\nYou start with 2 toolbars for skills, but the top one is bound to Alt+# instead of the F-keys, which feels odd to me.\n\nThe health meter is too small, not attracting enough attention to it, and as it's placed in the upper left cornor, it's easy to overlook it in a fight because the action is always closer to the toolbars.\n\nThe initial graphics settings are OK, but even with everything cranked as high as it'll go there's very little change aside from adding shadows and foliage.\n\nI can't comment on whether there's P2W or not becasue, honestly, I haven't seen it. But as I ahven't explored a lot of this game it could be there and I just haven't seen it.\n\nHonestly, as this is a F2P game, it's up to you whether to try it or not.

I played a mage (eventually a warlock at lvl 20) and when I started to attack a mob I was delighted. I was flinging spells with a flick of my wrist while holding a spellbook in my other hand. It was great. The quests are pretty generic and the environment is nice to look at. For some reason only warriors and its subclasses can have mounts and they require food to run at full speed (otherwise it's reduced to 20%). The food also costs special currency that has to be bought with cash or the random player shop will be selling some mount feed for an outrageous price (I saw 10x mount feed for 100,000 earlier. To put that in perspective at lvl 24 I barely have more than 105,000 gold). Immediately after hitting level 20 the amount of experience it takes to gain a level is severely increased and I've run out of quests and had to grind my way to 24. It took me 2 days to get from 20-24 and that was with the free premium upgrade for 3 days that increases experience gain by 50% (I also had a few periods of rested experience).\n\nIt's still in beta and things are subject to change, but it's definitely an asian mmorpg so if grinding at a mind numbing pace is your thing, go play it. I'm going to move onto something else.","August 7, 2014","false","17.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

While it's a polished game and has a few quirks here and there it is just another MMO copycat. I don't even want to get started about the ridiculousness of their in game "Premium" and store functionalities. Royal Quest is completely set up to be a cash cow while having an extremely limited amount of uniqueness and originality. If you're a fan of Ragnarok Online and are looking for something similar you should definitely give the game a try though, they offer a 3 day trial of their "Premium" which give you bonuses including: +50% increase to EXP/gold drops, a teleport to Maiden spell (you attune to Maidens which you ressurect at when you die), and free teleport between Maidens which act as instant flight paths, but unless you're a Premium member you're paying about 1k gold per teleport at low levels, I'm not sure if it scales in higher level areas since I did not use my free time. The game is also quite the grind, it took me the entire time I have played to obtain a level of 22 which is only about a fourth of the cap which is 60. Surprisingly enough as well for a game that's already 2 years old it's seemingly polished look hides a nasty collection of bugs and spiking ping. While the game does look good, it just doesn't feel good and there's also many balancing issues that I feel need to be addressed. The unfortunate part of Royal Quest and games like it is that they just can't keep up with their secondary userbase, porting the game to the US is just another way to milk the cash cow. Take a good look at how active and busy the forums are in the US versus in Russia.\n\nhttp://us.royalquest.com/forum/\nhttp://sdn.royalquest.ru/forum/\n\nWho do you really think they're going to pay attention to? There may be 1000~ daily concurrent players but the game is FREE on Steam AND featured as well on the front page of the store! The game is busy now (if you can call 1k users busy) and will only begin to decline after it fades into the nether of the Steam store. I highly suggest trying this game if you feel like paying for features you deserve as a free player is something you like. I unfortunately do not like it in any way, shape, or form. If you don't believe me, try the game for yourself and go without the free 3 days of Premium for a day or two and then activate it and see the difference. If you are going to charge people for fundamental game functions you shouldn't call the game free.\n\n\n☆☆☆★★ Overall ☆☆☆★★ Gameplay ☆☆☆★★ Story ☆☆★★★ Graphics ☆☆☆☆★ Sounds ☆☆☆☆★ Oddity","August 21, 2014","false","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't even have to use the different skill buttons if you have auto-attack enabled. Worse, you can click a point on your map and your character automatically heads there. Easiest RPG I've ever encountered.\nPros: If you enjoy looking like you're a high school kid dressed up for cosplay, you might enjoy the character appearances. The simple format of the game makes it easy to pick up as well. So if you want a reasonably pretty game to play on the fly to kill time -- this might work.\nCons: This is a Final Fantasy wannabe. From the chocobo-doppleganger mounts to the kidlike character appearances. They nickel and dime everything of value, so F2P is only going to be worthwhile for the first 10 levels. Good luck finding your quest line at that point, too. It seems to drop you like a bad habit.

Ranged classes are pretty dominant in pve because they can kill things really well and they can pretty much take all the monsters they want. Ranged classes are alright for pvp. leveling to level 20 is really easy, once you hit 25 or so you will have to start power leveling, there is a specific place in this game to go to for power leveling which is totally dominated by clans, if you don't get into one then you should quit the game because leveling will pretty much seem impossible because the only thing you can do is daily quests and no one likes that ♥♥♥♥. The reason why clans are dominant is because when you get teleported to a different zone to farm monsters and get good exp but for some reason the developers thought it was a good idea to make it a pvp zone.

I understand that its a tutorial, but why bombard me with quest that require me to kill, and collect items of small, or great quantity? I just started the game, and already I'm having a "its going to be one of those games" moment.

Brought some successful elements from Ragnarok Online, which I enjoyed. Graphics Updated from RO, but.. Good flexibility for hot keys. Many premium items can be obtained in-game, but..\n\nCons: The list of cons is huge.\n\n1. Graphics are updated, but .. mediocre by today's photorealistic qualities.\n\n2. It is definitely a free to play, but PAY TO WIN, model. In comparing the relative speed at which pay users achieve end game characters and equipment, I would estimate that the pay players are at least 5 times faster to achieve their goals over the average free player. This is evident by players who have started around the same time as me (free player), but have already been miles ahead of me in a matter of days, and I'm not one of the average free players, myself. Likewise, many who play much less, are already left behind in the dust.\n\n3. Grinding end game levels will definitely put you on your knees, and that's even with a premium membership. Yea, lots of level grinding. I've heard of a L55 premium sniper complain about it. And when you see L22~26 players grinding on L50+ mobs..and the max level is L60..you know, something is wrong here. When you die, above L20, you are exposed to a 10 minute status ailment called weakness, that halves your attack and defence. The only way to get rid of it immediately is to pay the npcs gold, gold that escalates every level higher than L20 you are. So each time you respawn, you've got to do something else to wait out the weakness time..otherwise cough up (or go premium, which reduces that time to 1 min).\n\n4. Earning in-game currency is really horrendous. It's subtle, but with a closer look, you'll see that the loot that you bring in from the monsters, especially true for the higher levels, are not only few, but they hardly add up to buy a single health potion of equivalent level. The rest of the loot can be vended, but only with a time-restricted stall that you need to purchase for more coin..So what does this mean? It simply means, you'll have to farm loot with minimum potions/foods most of the time unless you can successfully fetch a good price for your vended goods. Other times, you'll have to rely solely on the gold earned through quests, and there aren't that many well paying quests after you've completed your main ones. On top of all that, if you've got weakness, you've got to wait it out before you can even start farming for loot.\n\n5. PvP everywhere, if you're a friendly, social player like myself, you'll hate the PvP, but that's fine of course, if it's confined to themselves and we PvEer are left to our own entertainment. Sadly, that is not entirely true. The guild system has a lot of perks, like discounted npc prices, better drop rates, better running speed, more defence, more attack and a social community. However, past rank 10, and the guild is prone to other guilds declaring war on it. Some high level players have decided to band together in a certain guild (unnamed, but it could be anyone) in an effort to extort protection tax from smaller guilds so that they will not be PKed outside of towns..it's kind of like how the triads extorts everyday citizens.\nI guess this is a reflection of the situations real Russians face..but still..\nTHIS IS A BIG DOWNER.\n\n6. A massive rip off from the once popular Ragnarok Online. Not that, that in itself is a bad thing, since they had done a lot of concepts right. And most games these days are copied from one another. Big Deal.\n\nI could say more, but I have to go.\nStay away like the PLAGUE!!","August 25, 2014","false","692.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I encountered a pay to win player soon off and noticed that despite the 3 lower levels they were than I and the same class of character, they did "SIGNIFICANTLY" more damage than I did. I mean where I was doing 20s and 30s as a full dexterity & strength fighter, they were doing low hundreds. That's the first thing I noticed that seemed off. Secondly, this game almost forces you to buy premium to ignore the ill effects of weakness once you reach level 10, the revival effect or pay gold to remove the effect.\n\nThe next problem I have with this game is the fact you basically walk to & fro from quest giver to location and back to quest giver, one....at....a....time. I figured that it would stop after a few levels, but a solid hour of playtime and it was still doing it. It gets old, FAST. Next problem is the somewhat limited arrangement of classes available, and evenmoreso with the choice of subclass. There is no imagination or love here and while this game boasts freedom; it yields very little to the aspect. In short, don't support this game if you're not into another very generic MMO rpg that better belongs with it's browser brothern. Thumbs down and I'm uninstalling.","August 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I've played MANY mmo's with a cash shop that pushes itself upon you often yet those games, cashshop aside, were still fun regardless. Mabinogi is a prime example of this, great gameplay, deep plot with now 15 or so different main stories to experience back to back all adding new mechanics and types of combat styles. Fairly big world to explore, interesting NPC's with friendship system allowing you to gain perks by gifting npc's and talking to them. Every Pet/Mount doubles as a playable character in of itself. There's just so much GOOD with Mabinogi that the cash shop is just a small bother by comparison of the fun you can have with the game with out the cash shop.\n\nThis game on the other hand, is just flat out NOT FUN. I was expecting a Diablo-esk style mmo with the topdown view faster point/click style combat and such but no, a single click auto attacks, the spells and skills take FOREVER to charge and cast, quests are boring and generic fetch quests like most mmo's seem to be doing these days, tho top it off the visuals aren't even good enough to validate it's existance. I'm not saying visuals are EVERYTHING but if the game itself isn't fun at least make it look decent enough that you'd want to stare at it for a while.

You get less than 20 slots per tab, which if you have some RPG gaming experience, would know is not even close to being enough for the later on grinding sprees that you'd need to go on, and if you need more space, guess how? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Speaking of money, the game is screaming "give me money" as you play, you need $ to buy in game currency to buy cosmetics, which DOES give you stats, and the stats are not exactly tiny (Example: 5% max hp for footprints). Now some of you might argue that you can buy the ingame cash, "Reales" with ingame currency, but when I last checked, 1 REALE is about 14k gold, which is considered A LOT in this game, so if you are planning on buying reales, you might need to spend quite a bit of time. Speaking of grinding, the game also has a "member" system (remember Runescape?), yes, the member advantages are not even close to being as much as Runescape, however, they get 50% increased exp/loot drop rate. All in all, if you are not planning on using money on this game, be prepared to spend money.","August 9, 2014","false","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The aesthetic shines the most in field areas with a bit of blending between one zone and the next.\n\nThe second thing I notice, is that the Camera is locked in this psuedo-isometric position, which allows full rotation, but limiting tilt. you can look almost straight down at your character if you wish, or at a slight angle, but you are incapable of looking parallel to the ground, let alone being able to see any trace of sky. (Probably to lessen the system-demand for rendering, and the need for a skybox)\n\nThe third thing I notice is the obvious Premium service. The game practically screams P2W. I honestly wouldn't mind if there were some benefits to paying players, but what ruined it was the constant self-advertising. The fact that you'd have a Premium / VIP tab right above the hotbar that remains there forever, alongside tabs that would remind you of unspent skill points or stat points. It's also a nuisance to see that little blue 'Premium' tab at the center of your screen as you try to pay attention to skill cool downs and potion counts.\n\nThe game spends quite a bit of effort reminding you that you 'could' be enjoying the game better if you paid for it.\n\nNext on the list is the combat, which is a bit dull. It's your standard auto-attack, use skills when ready, repeat on the next bad guy. What's interesting though, are the passive skills (Talents) that somewhat modify the properties of previously obtained Active skills, though quite a bit of advancement is required.\n\nAfter your first class advancement, you gain this Rift-style 3-option talent tree, in which you can specialize, or become a jack of all trades. Specializing yields you a powerful (or less-than-powerful) active skill at the end of one of the three trees for your class. But frankly, the three-tree system is nothing close to the way Rift handles it, and feels like a dumbed down 'my-first-RPG' experience.\n\nThe game itself lacks depth from the beginning, and the overall pacing is slow, the quests are un-engaging, and are your standard 'go kill me some wolves for their pelts' ordeal. Occasionally you will get some quests that mess with the props in the environment, or sends you on an errand run across NPCs, concluding in an encounter with an instance (or psuedo-instance)\n\nHere's another drawback that really bothered me. The fact that what I had assumed what were instanced dungeons, are actually open to other players. Caves, Underground Libraries, Sewers, were all loaded with players with the same quest, therefor your target monster or drop would also be hunted by several other people, making your 25 Slime kill quest last longer than it really should. My only experience with a true instance were the randomly spawning 'entrances' that whisked you away to an extremely linear and un-engaging mini-dungeon, or one of the Boss Dungeons that I fought with a party of four.\n\nThough with that drawback, there is also a certain benefit: The Community. The early-game community is pretty large, everywhere you go you are guarenteed a sighting of another player probably doing the same thing as you, hunting Monsters. Not just one, but many players, all hunting monsters, all having a bit of fun. That's nice. Having lots of players around is nice, which makes this experience slightly more enjoyable. Sort of like you and your friends going to a really really bad theme park, somehow with your friends you were able to squeeze some fun out of it, despite the actual place itself being an uninteresting experience.\n\nThere are also a few somewhat innovative features: Like castles that could be fought over for guild dominance (though I haven't experienced this feature myself) as well as competitive 'deathmatch dungeons' were you can grind for loot and exclusives materials only if you can survive the onslought of players doing the same thing. (essentially an open PVP dungeon that only allows you to keep your loot if you can escape). Even a raid boss would wonder into town to face the innumerable number of players turning in their quests, leading to a 15-20 player assault on the big ol' boss guy.\n\n---\n\nIn the end the game is colorful and full of life, but also in turn, is uninteresting, even annoying, when alone amongst crowds of other people, all competing for a limited supply of Monsters. The game has it's moments when partied up, and certain aspects are enjoyable, with a few speckles of innovation. But overall, the game feels like an RPG experience lacking in depth, but not lacking in it's P2W ego. It's a game worth trying out to see if it fits you, but also is a game worth completely ignoring if you're a hardcore MMO'er looking for deep an immersive RPG experience.\n\nNot Recommended, but try it anyway.","August 18, 2014","false","26.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

If you've played browser-based MMOs before then this will all be familiar.\nAs I didn't make the mistake of paying to play I don't really have any significant complaint. As an uninspired F2P no-brainer this will pass some time.","August 4, 2014","false","1.4"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

But by simply playing the game as well, you can have fun whilst levelling up with friends and tackling monsters together. This is rewarding in itself and is much more entertaining than paying to reach higher levels. Finding weapons on the ground and trading them with friends, rather than buying them for extortionate prices at a user-based shop, is a truly wonderful experience that teaches the player to be generous and tactful with their items, rather than spending real-world money and buying the highest level sword you can.\n\nObviously this game can be played a lot easier if you splash the cash and buy your way to level 50, but where’s the fun in that? Get on, get stuck in and battle your way to it. Then you can truly say you’ve accomplished something, without paying half your life’s savings.\n\nWhile the fanbase can be small and in-game prices are a little bias in their amounts, we must remember that this is simply an open-beta and things will be changed and fixed in the future. For that reason, I recommend this game to any budding young MMO player, or an experienced try-hard just looking for something fun to divulge your time to.","August 16, 2014","true","45.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Not worth it at all. The developers obviously don't understand Pay-To-Win. The Russian company behind King's Bounty isn't a good developer. There are people trying to defend this game with "You can use gold to get premium items". Sure, if you grind for 10,000 hours, perhaps. This game is just bad design.\n\nPROS\n1. Global Map Movement\nYou can use the Map feature to left click on the point you want to run to and your character will run to the location accordingly. No need to keep left clicking all the way.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay to Win\n3500 Reales for $100.\n\nHere's a list of core mechanics you can buy with cash\n\n1. Bag slots x 1 for 9R. (Inventory space, another core mechanic)\n2. Arena Tickets x 10 for 29R\n3. Maiden's Ticket x 20 for 29R (They are selling 20 town portal scrolls for $0.80, a bloody core mechanic)\n4. Ambrosia x 20 for 9R (Heals 100% Health, Energy and Mana over 5 seconds, Elixirs can be bought with cash too)\n5. Card of Chaos for 399R (Weapon Insert : Attacks with Chaos Element Weapons deal increased damage to all other elements. This is an item advantage)\n6.

I played till level 52. Didn't use premium/blessing until level 30.\n\nPros:\n-Sweet time waster with lots of fun for early levels.\n-Making decent gear for class C items (1-30 ish) is easy and fun. Most materials are obtainable from daily quests with easy to farm items.\n- Exploring the maps with mobs that can kill you in 1 to 2 hits is fun. Basically it is fun to be noob in this game.\n\nCons:\n- P2W.\n\nGold cost for gear improvements and seals increases at almost triple or more  from each class. Just look at the NPC price of Emeralds compared to Sapphires compared to Morions. Without mentioning the required cashshop items for item improvements as the success rate for higher class item is much lower if using non-cash cubes\n\nPremium/Blessing is a must to play at later levels even when 60. Gold/time costs of weakness debuff after death is very high, and players can die a lot especially when playing in areas with range mobs or during guild wars. Maiden tele costs adds up without Blessing. (7K here, 8K there and all your gold farmed is gone) Another thing is the tax on non-preimun account for players setting up markets is ridiculous (15% vs 5%). Either spend time spamming to sell instead of enjoying the game or suck it up losing 10% extra.\n\nTL/DR:\n\nReccomended for those who like grinding games with an objective to reach level cap and for causal/serious pvping in lower levels.  Not reccomended for those who wants level cap PvP because the costs is too prohibitive for most. (too grindy or too P2W)","September 18, 2014","true","101.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But by simply playing the game as well, you can have fun whilst levelling up with friends and tackling monsters together. This is rewarding in itself and is much more entertaining than paying to reach higher levels. Finding weapons on the ground and trading them with friends, rather than buying them for extortionate prices at a user-based shop, is a truly wonderful experience that teaches the player to be generous and tactful with their items, rather than spending real-world money and buying the highest level sword you can.\n\nObviously this game can be played a lot easier if you splash the cash and buy your way to level 50, but where’s the fun in that? Get on, get stuck in and battle your way to it. Then you can truly say you’ve accomplished something, without paying half your life’s savings.\n\nWhile the fanbase can be small and in-game prices are a little bias in their amounts, we must remember that this is simply an open-beta and things will be changed and fixed in the future. For that reason, I recommend this game to any budding young MMO player, or an experienced try-hard just looking for something fun to divulge your time to.","August 16, 2014","true","45.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

One important thing for me with MMO's is responsiveness of controls and fluid animation. This does both very will. I have played other MMO's (such as AION) that, while had beautiful scenery, felt like it had choppy responsiveness.\n\nYou really do not need to spend a dime of real money to compete in this game. If you know how to use your character class with some skill, you can win a lot of PvP matches (duals, PvP dungeons, etc). I play the assassin class, and when I get challenged to a dual, can beat characters who clearly have superior equipment but only know how to "left click".\n\nMy only complaint, which I hope they fix, is how useless it is to upgrade the Dexterity attribute. It is suppose to improve attack speed, but compared to just improving your strength attribute for more damage, it is totally useless. They need to make the dexterity either also upgrage your dodge, or just make the attack speed increase MUCH higher (something like +1% for each point, and +5% for every 10 points).\n\nI think this game is still in Beta so hopefully they fix this.","September 3, 2014","true","77.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

This MMO takes no risks and does nothing innovative at all. It is just like a bunch of other f2p MMO's out there (such as Eden Eternal). You pick from one of 4 generic classes, and then embark on a series of generic fetch/kill quests. The quest objectives eventually are so far away that you can just put your toon on auto-run and go make a sandwich before reaching them. They separate you by class, so forget questing with your friends unless you are all the same class. The stealth ability for the Rogue class made me cry...lasts a very short amount of time and makes you move extremely slow. I understand some movement speed decrease, but RQ takes it to the extreme. Overall: extremely disappointed. There are a ton of f2p MMO's that do everything this does but better.\nI honestly didn't even look at the cash shop, so I have no idea what is in it.

Pretty annoying. Don't think I'll continue playing with the low inventory slots paired with  unbalanced combat.\n\nFor better clarification: I played the melee class rogue that has no cc and tried to fight my own level minibosses: They would either 1 hit me or simply have too much health to kill them before dying from their damage even if using skills in the right order.

Yes, there are only about 14 bag slots, but there are 5 different bags for different types of items, so in essence, there are a lot more.\n\nQuests are the standard, but they require treking back and forth repeatedly, with random spawn points, which is extremely tiring and annoying.\n\nThe game is decent; in depth skill trees, unique play-style classes, decent graphics.

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

It's the apparently intentionally confusing pricing in the cash shop and the constant prompts to spend money that warrant the down vote.\n\nMost F2P games I have tried are at least roughly based on the dollar. $10 gets you 1,000 coins, or 900, or 1,100 or something close. Here it is 260 coins for $10. This makes it very confusing to figure out how much anything actually costs.\n\nFor example, crystal keys to open chests are 889 coins for a stack of 10 (used to open random high level chests). So how much is that actually? The answer is $33, or $3.30 to open one chest. You must multiply the item cost by 3.8 to get the dollar price (if buying in $10 increments.)\n\nAnother example is the item you need to gurantee a combine doesn't fail. They are also over $3. How many ultra-rare reagents you going to see poof before you start buying those?\n\nInventory slots are 36 cents...per slot and per category (armor and weapons go in one bag, potions in another, etc.) You start with 19 slots in each category, the 20th slot is a "buy" button. This makes it $7.20 to buy 20 bag slots that only hold potions (or only armor, etc.). This wouldn't be too bad if the slots could be used for anything.\n\nWhen you die you have 2 choices. Run back from town, or pay to res right there. Which would be tolerable, if every town allowed you to bind. I could find no way to bind in the 2nd town at level 11, died and had to run back from the first town. I died because of a level 59 skeleton that came out of nowhere and started one-shotting people.\n\nYou can buy a 40% speed mount for (I think) only about $1.60, but that was the only decent deal I could find.\n\nI only played to level 12, but from what I'm reading the grind is very bad at 40+ unless you go premium, which is another $12 a month. And going premium does almost nothing to change the intrusiviness of the cash shop.\n\nI'm not at all against spending money in these games. I do it all the time. But this whole thing would be more reasonable, and not as confusing if you got 1,000 coins for $10. Maybe their pricing is based on the Rubel or something and will be adjusted before release. As it is now, it's very expensive and intrusive.\n\nBottom line, the game is fun if you have deep pockets.\n","August 10, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeldamasterace/recommended/295550/","zeldamasterace","hollisjg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeldamasterace/","8 products in account","Three months ago I wrote a negative review for royal quest after rewriting my original positive review. I will now go on to expand that negative review.  My last review ended with me summarizing that Royal Quest is pay to win. Which it is, however, it gets worse. The admins, and mods in charge of the forums online are corrupt and protect people at the top of the food chain in game that have cheated their way there. To help people understand the game and the background of what i'm saying i'm going to give a very fast breakdown of all the different levels and parts of the games.\n\nlevels 1-20 = having fun, playing casually, (taking the bait)\nlevels 20-40 = more challenge, figuring out your class and game goals (getting hooked)\nlevels 40-50 = sinking more time & money into the game you didn't expect (you can't turn back now)\nlevels 50-59 = hoping that the max level 60 will change the game for you (being disillusioned)\nlevel 60 = looking to get in a top guild, throw all your time & money at the game (your fate)\n\nso all in all how Royal Quest works is this: it lies to you in the beginning, and then once you've invested too much time and money into it to leave, it forces you to join a top guild to succeed. which isn't inherently bad if it weren't for the background corruption of the game. and that corruption boils down to this: monster cards.\n\nthere is a special item in game that are called monster cards. essentially these cards are very hard to get and make your gear and character very strong. however, there are normal monster cards and then Elite/Boss monster cards which are the hardest monster cards to get but also the strongest. Now when you get to level 60 typically the last thing you do before finishing your character is finding all the normal and Elite/Boss monster cards you need.\n\nHowever it came to light that the leader of one of the strongest guilds in the game had fabricated the majority of his Boss cards some time in past. And to top it off when someone tried to call him out on it, their account was permanently banned. Since that time, people have avoided openly talking about that incident for fear of being permanently banned.\n\nbut it gets better. That corrupt guild leader then became a moderator. And as a moderator in any medium your responsibility is to be objective and help the players in the game you moderate. However this corrupt moderator went around and instigated arguments with players (because that's the type of guy he is) and then would chatban people who hurt his feelings.\n\nRecently I was one of those people that got temporarily banned for arguing with him after realizing how corrupt he was. The interesting thing is there are in game rules where you're not allowed to discredit those in authority. however, every single forum post or in game conversation that shows evidence of moderators abusing their power magically gets removed. so when they ask for evidence to our insinuations they know we dont have alot because they took away most of them.\n\nTo make you smile even more, after this recent happening of me and my friends arguing with the corrupt moderator, i messaged the admin about the whole incident and was promplty temporarily banned for discrediting the corrupt moderator. I then made a forum post about the whole situation and how the moderator was corrupt and broke the silence on all the wrongdoings of the mods and administration and was promptly banned from making forum posts.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\n\n-this game is dying because of corrupt moderators and admins abusing their powers to cover up illegal stuff they did in the past and only care about the top guilds that those corrupt people are a part of.\n\n-There is no way to prevent the people in authority from abusing their powers so they do it all the time and you get punished for even trying to stop them.\n\n-don't play this game if you want to have fun. don't play this game if you're bored. don't play this game at all. play WoW or guild wars 2, or Tera. literally any other MMORPG.\n\nThanks for reading, now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to try to get gold in league of legends this season.","September 10, 2015","false","073.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","2"

Most of the negative reviews are telling you things that are true about this game. Yes bag slots are low and you have to pay to get more, there are cash shop mounts, and there are items in the cash shop that give you SMALL bonuses especially campared to the cards in the game, which are found when killing mobs or a few unique kinds from the cash shop. (which aren't very useful endgame) What these people failed to mention is that this is a FREE game. Free games always have to make someway of making profit and profit = cash shop. But by far it is not P2W, you can buy your own premium currency fairly cheap with your own gold that you earned ingame. And the cash shop items aren't even that expensive if you do decide to pay.  For example, a crystal key, which opens a chest that can give you a majority of things only costs 99 Royal Reales, which is less than 5$. As someone who opened 2 of these chests I got a mount that would have cost me 20$ and a 7-day premium scroll. Also on the PvP dungeon side of things, yes you are killed, yes you are camped when you enter one. But what reviewers have failed to tell you is that it WARNS you before entering saying YOU CAN GET KILLED. This is a PvPvE game if you don't like PvP quit or go somewhere there isn't PvP. As of now there are things we still don't know about the game, but I  have had a lot of fun playing it and it does have some interesting content that I have not seen in many MMOs, such as war and the card system. War is when 1 guild declares war on another, no matter where you are (discluding towns) the enemy guild can kill you. This is very fun especially if you enjoy PvP. And cards are very rare drops that each mob has that can give you special bonuses, some are good and some are bad. You can equip these cards in equipment with card slots. So please, if you are thinking of playing this game, take advice from someone who has played way longer than many of the negative reviewers. Just give it a try yourself, who knows it might be your new favorite game.","August 29, 2014","true","123.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Key note: I saw Open Beta!  ( With that i keep beta at the front of my mind) The key to a successful review is honesty not sarcasm or insult.  I will provide information based on what i know and how i intereret the game.\n\nI am an enthusiast when it comes to games.  Normally i do 3 part reviews.  (First few hours, 50-100 hours,  End Game)\n\nFirst Impressions.\n\n-Cash Shop,\n\nThe first thoughts that came to mind is this going to be a pay to win?  I was completely blown away with that thought when obtaining premium items could be accomplished without spending a dime.\n\nPremium is more of an Aid to the game then a bonus.  It allows characters to progress more smoothly.   I noticed no real advantage to in game transactions or premium over standard methods of game play.  In a nutshell  Not a pay to win,  Its just a pay to get ahead framework.\n\n-Questing\n\nI have mixed feelings about questing.  Every MMO ive played follows the same routine.  Being a Noob sucks.  When you start your questing you will find yourself doing a lot of running.  Fortuneatly in the beginning its very cut and dry,  do this get my reward.\n\nLeveling is decent. ( Its a matter of opinion,)  I dont want to play a game where i can max Cap in less than a few hours of dedicated play.  The feeling of being rewarded for hard work and effort outways the purchase of my max level character.  Anyway so far in the beginning leveling is pretty steady.  Thumbs up to that.\n\n-Character\n\nI will agree with a majority of other reviewers.  The characters are super smooth when it comes to game play.  They handle well,  Development is unique,  Classes are Fun.  And especially with that Old School feel to it, the characters are great.\n\nAt this point its really to early to critique the characters.  I am not far enough to really grasp their potential.\n\n\nAdditional Notes.\n\nIf you like the classic feeling of this.  Example Titan Quest, Farewell to Dragons.  Then you will enjoy this game.\n\nSo now to press onward and ill update the review.","February 5, 2015","true","61.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are simple, yet colorful and full of life. The gameplay resembles diablo, torchlight, and spiral knights.

Its crazy addicting, tons of loot to gather, and the community seems to be nice if you have any questions about the game, or want to join in a party etc.. I definitely recommend this to anyone seeking something new to play! Oh and if you're wondering, its not pay to win. if you end up spending money of the game, its just for cosmetics, a new mount, better potions, and so on. You can also buy premium membership for double xp, more quests, and more added stuff to the game. but its completely free, and you never have to spend a dime!","March 28, 2015","true","27.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If pvp is your thing, maybe look for a MOBA game instead.\n\nPvE is pretty grindy. But, I had fun.\n\nHelpful Tip:\n\n1) Make sure to have your character accumulates "rest" - This can be acheive by not logging in the game for a period of time.\n\n---- The trick here is, to not used up all of the "rest exp", instead save them for future usage.  <-- This method is incredibly useful for higher level and will save your a lot of times for training.  (I leave my rest exp at 5000 exp)\n\n2) Play a sniper for PvE. (You can hit level 56 Bonerattler when you're only level 27)  Fastest leveling up. Check out the forum ---- "Jumong's Sniper Guide." <--- Very helpful guide for PvE sniper.\n\n\n","April 18, 2015","true","121.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It only has 8.. which is mediocre in the league of RO and especially ToS.\n\nAs far as the game AUTOMATICALLY shoving premium benefits in my face as soon as I start... and the extremely limited bag space along with some poor character customizations. I'd probably say this game is good for someone who doesn't want a Korean Styled MMORPG as their go to MMO or first MMO. It's good for what it is, not being too demanding on the PC for requirements.. yet it doesn't have it what takes for more exciting and up-n-coming F2P's that's going to be booming the market even more later this year.\n\nI would post this review as a neutral.. but..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/climbingmatt/recommended/295550/","climbingmatt","climbingmatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/climbingmatt/","15 products in account","This game is beta, so I found the intro and stuff really bad.  Probably they'll clean that up when not beta?  I don't know, but the first 10 levels seem pretty pointless.  After that the game starts to get more interesting.  So overall this game is pretty fun.  I prefer full 3d, the view on this takes getting used to.  You do tend to get player killed in some areas without knowing why and with no warning, even from people in your own guild... so that's kind of weird, just kind of walking along then out of the blue -- dead.  But does't seem to do much to you other then stick you back at a maiden.   But the free play on this is pretty fun so far, still not as compelling as other MMORPGs I've played, but it's got a lot of depth, so you keep discovering stuff.  It's a pretty light weight client too so you can easily play it on any machine.\n\nI _hate_ the dependence on mouse for everything.  I'm used to using keyboard for moving around at least somewhat, your mouse hand gets pretty tired in this game.  Not sure why they don't have keyboard support.\n\nI would give it thumbs down if  I actually paid for it.  But it's a free game.  It's stable, and more than somewhat entertaining.  What more can you ask for for free?    I've been playing for abput 80 hours now and it's already getting really boring though.\n\nI've seen absolutely no compelling reason to spend real money on this game.  If it required money I would never buy or play it.   It's a piece of garbage compared to any real MMORPG such as Everquest, WOW, or LOTRO.  And LOTRO is F2P and is much, much, much, better.  On LOTRO you end up wanting to spend money to add new zones... which actually makes sense -- pay money, get good content that you actually desire.  Versus pay money and get a disposable weapon enhancement... blah ... so you can PK someone in a game where PK has no meaning since the PVP combat system is kludged and unbalanced to death - or that's my interpretation of it anyway.\n\nPROS:\n1. you can play it on your laptop, so can play from anywhere, it's got low quality graphics so doesn't require much of a machine.  Seems to work fine on any machine.\n2. stable game, rarely crashes, rarely have network / connection issues\n3. it is a graphical MMORPG and F2P, so if you want to do some mudding there you go\n4. compared to other _free_ MMORPGS, this one is pretty good\n5. For someone like me who used to play text-based muds a lot, I'm still impressed with any mud with graphics!\n6.  Randomized tiered reward system, so kind of like an easter egg hunt type model.  Every once and a while you find really cool stuff from even the weakest creatures.\n\nCONS:\n1. If I actually spent money on this game, I'd have to be insane.  I regularly will be happy to spend money on games, money is not the issue.  But I absolutely refuse to play $10 real for an in game suit of armor.  Or a dollar for transport, or anything stupid like that.  When the designers are so out of touch of the value of a dollar, it just pisses me off and turns me off to spending any money on the game.  If you are stupid enough to put real money into this game, go find a non-free MMORPG and put your money there instead, you'll have more fun.  The value of this game is only in the fact that it is free.\n2. Low-end annoying graphics, not impressive, boring, and difficult to look at, it's some sort of fake weird angle 3D that really bothers my eyes and makes the side of my brain hurt for some reason.\n3. Requires mouse for just about everything.  This absolutely sucks, and never have played an MMORPG game with this much dependence on mouse.\n4. all the toons look like teenagers.  makes me never want to take screenshots... i take screenshots and they always suck.  That says something there.\n5. the story line absolutely sucks.  I've tried to read the quests and they make no sense... There is no art to the game basically... just a bunch of grunt work hunter gatherer quests.\n6. All the quests seem exactly the same.  There seems to be a pretty small set of canned quests types that everything is derived from at all levels.\n7.  No spirit.  This game has no spirit and no artistic elements.  There is a feeling like I've already been there and done that with every element of this game.   And nothing new or special about it -- probably the same thing.  So it's kind of the same old grinder mud type game in a new setting with new quests if you have some time to kill and can ignore the fact that your toon looks like a spoiled teenager.","February 6, 2015","true","122.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews are telling you things that are true about this game. Yes bag slots are low and you have to pay to get more, there are cash shop mounts, and there are items in the cash shop that give you SMALL bonuses especially campared to the cards in the game, which are found when killing mobs or a few unique kinds from the cash shop. (which aren't very useful endgame) What these people failed to mention is that this is a FREE game. Free games always have to make someway of making profit and profit = cash shop. But by far it is not P2W, you can buy your own premium currency fairly cheap with your own gold that you earned ingame. And the cash shop items aren't even that expensive if you do decide to pay.  For example, a crystal key, which opens a chest that can give you a majority of things only costs 99 Royal Reales, which is less than 5$. As someone who opened 2 of these chests I got a mount that would have cost me 20$ and a 7-day premium scroll. Also on the PvP dungeon side of things, yes you are killed, yes you are camped when you enter one. But what reviewers have failed to tell you is that it WARNS you before entering saying YOU CAN GET KILLED. This is a PvPvE game if you don't like PvP quit or go somewhere there isn't PvP. As of now there are things we still don't know about the game, but I  have had a lot of fun playing it and it does have some interesting content that I have not seen in many MMOs, such as war and the card system. War is when 1 guild declares war on another, no matter where you are (discluding towns) the enemy guild can kill you. This is very fun especially if you enjoy PvP. And cards are very rare drops that each mob has that can give you special bonuses, some are good and some are bad. You can equip these cards in equipment with card slots. So please, if you are thinking of playing this game, take advice from someone who has played way longer than many of the negative reviewers. Just give it a try yourself, who knows it might be your new favorite game.","August 29, 2014","true","123.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has many ups  and downs to it, just as any game of this genre. Before we start lets get rid of some obvious stereotypes that I know you're thinking of;\nThere ARE pay to win aspects to this game. it's an MMORPG, what do you expect?\nYou have to actually put effort into the game to level up past the level 20 hump, where players basically say its "too slow". Ask yourself a question, what MMO is NOT grindy? k. done.\nYes, there are PKing types, get over it, it happens, ignore them and take a break, go see the sun or something.\nk, so we got that out of the way now what to talk about? well what more than the gameplay?\nit starts out in a tutorial, which every game does, of course, but this tutorial is unique as it gives you freedom to stay once you're complete or not, which might not mean much, but at lvl1 grinding the tutorial mobs can get you to lvl5+ before you even leave the tutorial.\n\nNext, the graphics, yea they aren't the sekciest, but who cares? they aren't ugly either. I quite frankly love the character and mob designs. It's the textures on the ground and such that I'd like to see changed. There are glitches in some spots, and holes and such that aren't a game breaking aspect.\n\nOk, so you got to lvl 20, it slows down a ton, should I quit as a player?\nHECK NO the main aspect of MMORPG's are the grinding aspects, you play the game to get a higher level, which requires you to do quests, and kill stuff. It's really a simple concept.\n\nI really reccomend this game. I hope you enjoy it.

Better than Pokemon, better than TV - have to read between the lines, its never about the grind. - Droog.\n\nJust has a really bad name - all will agree with that.\n\nThose who play generally agree - very similar in format to ragnarok 2. MMORPG. First off, let me say that this is a well crafted game - those who enter the f2p/p2w argument generally and unfortunately dont stick around long enough to understand the dynamics of the game. Many come in with a high expectancy and first impression of pay to get ahead quick - you have to remember that in any game that would ♥♥♥♥ off anyone, no one wants that. So, no - this is not a P2W game - it's meant to be a balance between the two and the access to store items is monitored to ensure world availiability. Pay is for the impatient - ie. i want a gold treasure card so i can start making money, buy store items, IMPORTANT - NOT FOR BUYING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STORE ITEMS FOR GUILDMEMBERS, alot have tried to become a guild leader - feel this sudden mantle of responsibility and sudden need to line the storehouse with store bought items - just dont - it's bad form, people cry when it gets stolen, and most act like babies when they cant control everyone, and then leave game - money doesn't buy people. My own personal feelings - the cost of store items have been a high par requirement for this game - and while devs need to eat, most would be unwilling yet as an observation - as prices go down - the population becomes more spend thrifty on a regular basis - and i think the devs see, recognize and have been testing that with the event sales some of us have been expecting.\n\nMany likes on how supportive admin has been - i believe it has made a general impression on the community and many have seen that, and are very suprised where normally this is absent in other games.\n\nDislikes would say probably the "Open Beta" sign - hoping that comes down soon. In my eyes, games going to have problems, issues and updates. Alpha for program testing, Beta for input and changes, General Release - Steam. Bugs and maintenance going to happen - at the same time if it were at all possible to rename the game to something more strategy minded - would catch a lot of WOW LOL fanboys - to me this is a treasure I almost skipped over because of the name - very reminiscent of the old vanilla WOW days (before it was ruined) in some ways, I find able to recapture that here.\n","November 8, 2014","true","346.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

If you liked RO you are going to love this game.\nIn the other hand if you hate grinding, this isnt for you, questing is not a big part of the game, most quests give so little exp that you would rather grind instead. You can level up by questing easiely up to lvl 20-25 but after that you have to grind. If you played RO this might feel familiar and it shoul'nt be a problem at all. Grinding is not that hard and you get cool rewards for it. Also there are pvp zones with mobs in it where you can grind and the exp is at 120% just be careful with the other players.\n\nSo far this is not a pay to win for me. Theres a currency called Royale, which you buy with real money and with this you get a premium account that gives you boosts in exp and such. However you can buy royales with gold. At this moment it costs about 500k gold to get 3 days of premium account. In case you are wondering, 500k is not expansive at all, I had spend that when i was about level 25-30.\n\nFinally: If you are going to give it a try play after level 20, this is when the game starts to shine. Althought for some classes is very hard to go from 20 to 30. I played as a crusader and as a Sorcerer. Sorcerer is the easiest class to lvl. Just mob mob and mob using AoE. At my current level (35)  I can get a level per hour if I play good. In the other hand, the Crusader at lvl 26  i only can get a lvl every 2 hourrs of grind. This is because the lack of AoE skills, but everyone keeps telling me that at lvl 30 you get a skill (Grand Cross RO fans know) that allows you to kill a bunch of mobs at the same time and so they say is going to get easier even though the exp requierd is going to be a lot more. Right now for the Crusader I usually go in party to lvl faster.\nLastley I've been playing a roug for a couple of hours but I cant say much about that because I havent play enought to get to 20.\n\nPD community is great too. Bunch of Guilds, people is friendly and ussually like to play socially.","June 18, 2015","true","93.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Step 1 to enjoying it, like any MMO, is finding people to enjoy it with, Once you have that down it is gravy.\n\nThis is a PVP game but PVP is entirely optional. Don't want to PVP? Don't go into the elenium caves, don't queue for a BG or duel.\n\nA very few might say this  game is pay 2 win but in my experience it isn't. There are many things you can buy from the cash shop but free players can buy them too. The cash currency 'reales' is tradable and often bought and sold. The cash shop items are also commonly bought and sold. The most popular being 'blessing scrolls'. There re 3/7/14/30 day varieties and they are basically a 'subscriber' type buff for XP and a few other things. No weapons or armor are cash shop items. Of the items in the cash shop that gives bonuses, equivilent items not in the cash shop are superior. I could buy a +5% HP decoration or I could work for one that can't be bought for cash and has a card slot. It is like this for all items even mounts.\n\nThe game gets regular updates. In a recent update called "Patch of the Crusader" the class I play as was completely reworked. Before the patch there was a very specific objectively best path to work through. This was because many skills were so weak as to never be used and others being so powerful as to being crutches. This was reworked as to allow multiple ways for the class to be used without one being objectively best. In addition some classes got buffs/fixes/nerfs. As is the far easiest classes to level are the two mages and the sniper.\n\nSome people complain about the grind but I have found the grind to not be very bad compared to other MMOs I have played. On the range of "No grind" to "Extreame years long grind" I'd have to put it in the couple months catagory. If you take a mage you can get to level 40 in 3 days and 50 in a week now that enough time has elapsed for people to determine the optimal leveling areas.\n\n","September 30, 2014","true","225.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The panning view/area with the mouse is severely limited making it hard to navigate using  mouse clicks. You cannot see far enough ahead or zoom out enough to plan your movement, you have the overhead map but then have to keep resorting to it as you harvest and enter various dungeons. the entire game is designed to seperate you from your money, we already have enough free to play minimumly games like Everquest and Everquest II. Right now in Beta there are too many players to have any kind of fun due to fighting over resources and people stealing kills, I hope that changes with the final release. I played about 7 hours, and it was really not very exciting or fun, most of the time was spent fighting over resources. people in the game are not very friendly because of this strugggle for resources, but as I say this is a beta with one server for the world presently. I would reccomend this game for kids under 14,","August 9, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Mostly due to the fact that you have to pay for convenience.  People rage and ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about games that require you to buy stuff in game, yet not too long ago we were all involved in monthly subscriptions for games that we already bought just to be able to log in and keep playing.  I personally prefer not paying for a game, having it be completely free, and paying for stuff in game IF I CHOOSE TO.  As apposed to buying a game, paying for 4 months, being down like $100 and getting bored and moving on.  Guys this free model is awesome, and the free games are getting freaking amazing. Have you played Planetside2 or Firefall? Free freaking awesomeness.  This game is the second coming of Ragnarok Online and I'm loving it so far.

The first thing that really stood out to us was the super bland quests. Yes, there is a nice amount of lore and story behind each and every one if you bother to read the dialogue, but at the end of the day "kill ten wolves" doesn't get my blood boiling. This isn't a surprise in the modern-day MMO design club though so I can let it slide a little bit but you don't gain points for unoriginality.\n\nThere is a paid currency in the game, and which it you can get exclusive cosmetics, mounts and potions. Essesntially, this method of monetization lessens the Gold cost of all those things which you can obtain in-game without paying any real dosh up front. Does it streamine the experience? Who knows, we slugged through it without dropping any cash, but it does seem pretty fair for the non-paying user if you're willing to work a little harder for those shiny things.\n\nHearing that the questing is bog-standard and that there's a Cash Shop might immediately turn you off and I would wholeheartedly understand if it does, but the game does have some good things going for it that might make it worth a shot even then.\n\nThe freedom you have to customize your character's stats when you level is a throwback to older Korean-style MMOs like Ragnarok Online and it was a such a little detail that had a huge impact on how I approached the game. Combined with the Talent Trees (each class has 1 base tree, and then 2 branches of 3 each for a total of 7) you have a surprisingly robust system for really making your toon unique to you, and that hasn't really been a thing in MMOs for what feels like forever.\n\nThe PvP zones were a ton of fun, even if it was just the three of us dudes ganking groups of one or two, the risk vs, reward of staying in and collecting tons of crafting mats, gold, exp, and transmutation currency, or getting killed while doing so and losing some of your bounty, was really exciting and was a nice distraction from the questing. Multiple times we decided to head back into the zone because it was just a ton of fun to do. Sorry to all those players we knocked down!\n\nOverall, the initial experience of the game is going to turn off a lot of people because they see "Cash Shop" and immediately throw their mice out the window, but I think that Royal Quest has a lot to offer in the realm of F2P MMO and is at least worth a try if the idea of said Cash Shop doesn't immediately put a bad taste in your mouth.","August 10, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Entertaining with a friend or two. Some of the quests are silly to ask you to kill lots of things, but other than that it's a pretty basic MMORPG. The controls are interesting. It's worth a quick try and seeing if you like it.\n\nTo add to this review. A lot of the negative reviews have the same theme. "This game is Pay to win". I tend to find that this comes from a group of people who probably have ADHD and have never played an actual MMORPG in their life, or if they have it was WoW after it was nerfed to hell to accomedate casual players and allow them to earn the same rewards as the people who spent 100s of hours earning them in mere 1-2 hours. If you don't hand these people stuff on a silver platter, they won't be happy. It's simple as that. Their time in game reflects that. Most have 1-2 hours played. What can you accomplish or even find out in that time?\n\nBoo hoo. I can't have a mount at level 20. What about when you needed to wait till you were like level 40 to even see a mount in WoW? Flithy casual!\n\nBoo hoo! I have to pay money for more bag space. Stop hoarding then. You don't need to pick up ever jelly or wooden stump you see.\n\nAs someone pointed out in their reviews. You can get the "money" currency, in game, by using in game gold. Sure it's a bit pricey, but that's what MMORPGs are about. Grinding. Grinding. Grinding. If you don't want to grind, don't play MMORPGs. Otherwiese, buckle up kiddo, farm that gold, get that money, and buy that mount or bag space you so desperately are crying for. Don't expect things to be handed to you just cause it says "Free to play". Nothing in life is free.

Pretty simple, colors are great,\nmonster designs are kinda generic (but meh), however the character designs are pretty good.\nMusic is also fantastic. I can just grind my way listening to the bgm since its so relaxing or so\ntense when it needs to be.\n\nGameplay wise, its a good balance between questing and grinding. Quests scale depending on your\ncharacter level so you'll have no problem with it althroughout the first few hours of gameplay.\nBut since it's this kind of MMO, expect lots of grinding and questing.

Pay to Win is just a more stable way to play this game instead of having the trouble to go through so many problem to get some item. I am personally a dark knight in the game level 21.\nIf u r having problem with the dungeon, get a party or join a guild and ask people to join u and u can go off killing players or defend urself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yunocchidota/recommended/295550/","yunocchidota","Yung XL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yunocchidota/","58 products in account","So I had a chance to play this with a couple good friends of mine, and I'll try to summarize our thoughts on the game as we played here in this review.\n\nLet's start with the bad, because it's defintely not a perfect game, no question about it. The first thing that really stood out to us was the super bland quests. Yes, there is a nice amount of lore and story behind each and every one if you bother to read the dialogue, but at the end of the day "kill ten wolves" doesn't get my blood boiling. This isn't a surprise in the modern-day MMO design club though so I can let it slide a little bit but you don't gain points for unoriginality.\n\nThere is a paid currency in the game, and which it you can get exclusive cosmetics, mounts and potions. Essesntially, this method of monetization lessens the Gold cost of all those things which you can obtain in-game without paying any real dosh up front. Does it streamine the experience? Who knows, we slugged through it without dropping any cash, but it does seem pretty fair for the non-paying user if you're willing to work a little harder for those shiny things.\n\nHearing that the questing is bog-standard and that there's a Cash Shop might immediately turn you off and I would wholeheartedly understand if it does, but the game does have some good things going for it that might make it worth a shot even then.\n\nThe freedom you have to customize your character's stats when you level is a throwback to older Korean-style MMOs like Ragnarok Online and it was a such a little detail that had a huge impact on how I approached the game. Combined with the Talent Trees (each class has 1 base tree, and then 2 branches of 3 each for a total of 7) you have a surprisingly robust system for really making your toon unique to you, and that hasn't really been a thing in MMOs for what feels like forever.\n\nThe PvP zones were a ton of fun, even if it was just the three of us dudes ganking groups of one or two, the risk vs, reward of staying in and collecting tons of crafting mats, gold, exp, and transmutation currency, or getting killed while doing so and losing some of your bounty, was really exciting and was a nice distraction from the questing. Multiple times we decided to head back into the zone because it was just a ton of fun to do. Sorry to all those players we knocked down!\n\nOverall, the initial experience of the game is going to turn off a lot of people because they see "Cash Shop" and immediately throw their mice out the window, but I think that Royal Quest has a lot to offer in the realm of F2P MMO and is at least worth a try if the idea of said Cash Shop doesn't immediately put a bad taste in your mouth.","August 10, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It could be thx to the music, very progressive and diversified. Instead of a tempo-constant loop, there is a wide range of uplifting and thrilling effects to get from the tracks.\nIt also has to do with the animations which have been well polished. Look at those groovy barking trees and the way they react, aren't they amusing?! And those attacks give a nice arcade feel to it.\nI only did a few quests, which were not that different in content from other similar games, but looking at the world map and how the worlds vary at relatively short distances, I feel drawn towards discovering more.\nI say good job so far...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297211383","August 7, 2014","true","0.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Yes it's pay-to-win and is much like other games, but nowdays, there's just so many mmorpgs, it's hard to find anything unique anymore. Just each games has their own style and variations. And as far as pay-to-win goes, that's what you will get when you play a FREE TO PLAY game... The damn makers of this game have to make money SOME HOW to keep the games going...\n\nLet me get one thing straight about all the negative reviews.... All these things things the negative reviews are complaining about, is just pretty much what you will find in any typical free to play mmorpg.\n\nNow here's my personal opinions on the game so far:\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are beautiful for this type of game, way more beautiful than I expected.\nThe things that you can do to upgrade your gear is a nice feature.\nSo far from the low level maps, I've found these randomly spawned gravestone things that you can click and go into a mini-dungeon (I assume). I've found these quite fun to do because you can get some decent loot from these. I hope there's more in the game!\nThe characters and customization all look quite nice. The faces look just a little weird on some of the options, but other than that, I really like it. There's a decent amount of options for you're character's looks, more than even some mmorpgs I've played. I'm a sucker for character customization, so I really hope they add more features to this.\nI haven't gotten into crafting (if there is), but what I'm seeing looks like it should be interesting as well.\nThe classes, skills, and stat points when you leveling, all this I really like. There's a unique (to me anyhow) feature for spending your stat points each time you level.\nThe amount of options you are given in the settings (graphics, sound, chat settings etc...) is very nice as well. Games that give you a lot of settings and customization is always nice.\n\nCons-ish:\nI do hate the click to move, but from all the mmorpgs/games I've played, I'm use to it by now.\nBag space is annoying, but I just put things in storage I don't keep any time soon, and sell everytime I go into town. So I never really run into many problems with it.\nThere are pvp zones, I'm not quite sure how it all works, but I look forward to exploring this. From what I've heard though and from what it seems, it doesn't tell you when you are in a pvp zone. Hopefully this stuff will be changed up some.\nThere is a 10min death penalty. After you die, you're stats are decreased for 10mins, but this can be removed for 500g (which is REALLY easy to get) from the respawn points. So it's not a big deal.\n\nTLDR? The game has it's ups and downs. To best figure out if YOU like the game, I'd honestly suggest trying it out. Like I was saying earlier though, these negative reviews are kind of BS. Their complaints are stuff you will deal with in almost all free to play games.\n\nEvery game is going to have at least 1 thing you don't like, after playing games almost my whole like, and 12 years of it being mmorpgs, I've learned you just work around it and deal with it if you like the game enough. No game is perfect :P","August 8, 2014","true","228.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

The questing is a little basic as it tells you to go kill stuff and retrive stuff, but thats what MMORPGs are. However, many quests even early on require help from others, something MMOs need and most lack nowadays. Also, around LVL 15 you have to go in a an underground area for a quest and collect some items, wll that undergound area is an open PVP area, so while you are questing you can be killed by other players at any time. This is a nice challenge which most MMOs also lack nowadays. You either have to fend for yourself or group up and protect each other while doing the quest. You are free to distribute your stat points to your liking, can create many different playstyles with that and how you also choose your path for your class. I think the game deserves a try from anybody that enjoys MMORPGs.","August 7, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It seems like there is huge skill customization that comes within time.  It's not exactly a "twitchy" game, but the combat does take some thought, or else you are toast.  It reminds me a lot of UO in some ways.  With open world pvpve later on in the game, this seems like it could be a great time.  Overall, pretty solid, polished game that reminds you of the old days of mmo.\n\nWith a few more hours, it's still super fun.  I got into the PvP dungeon thing, and it's just a riot.

The camera angle from what I've played is fine I personally really like it and if you played any of the Diablo games and didn't mind it then you should be fine. The pay to win aspect is there but with a f2p game that is almost always the case but the thing about that is that only the PvP is pay to with, the PvE (Which is what I am here for) from the 4 hours I've played I haven't had any trouble making it through the PvE parts so if you aren't looking for PvP then you can ignore the pay to win because it doesn't concern you.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful music and textures, some of the best I've seen for a f2p game.\n-Fast paced combat, no turns.\n-Copious numbers of quests to do, you never have to just farm for no reason to do the next quest\n\nCons:\n-Only 4 playable classes with 2 sub classes each at level 20\n-No race selection (Only humans)\n-Lack of armour and weapons for each class.\n\nOver all its not a bad game considering it's free and with the graphics and combat it has it's definately worth your time to check it out.","August 5, 2014","true","21.4"," 15 of 41 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","15","41","0","3"

The core game is from...Russia, I think. The PVP is pretty great though with guilds in the PVP zones, it can be rather overwhelming to jump in without any backup. I think I spent the first 3 days more dead than alive in the PVP dungeons. Only 5 character slots per server so alt-itis will hurt some people. More servers are expected to open later.","August 9, 2014","true","155.8"," 5 of 27 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","5","27","0","0"

Cosmetics DO NOT give bonuses, cosmetics are suit items, suit items DO NOT give bonuses, there is other gear which do give bonuses from the cash shop which are face and head items, which replace your face and head gear, and right now the only gear you can buy for face and head with cash is +5 stam, or +3 hit or 5% max health, which is useless late game even level 40+...  cosmetics = suit items, suit items = no bonus = game is not pay to win.\n\nall the reviews on steam are thumbed down and the main point is pay to win, clearly all these people haven't played the game to understand how to get item seals and +10 gear. i have easily already made a legendary level 24 +8 dagger without spending any real money and it only cost me 30k in game, and i sold that dagger for 300k. So late game, maxed out level, best gear in the game is very possible  without spending any real money, don't tell me this game is pay to win. its like calling league of legends pay to win.\n\n120+hours on this game, i know what im talking about.

I like the fact that you can play for free. I have played for around 12 hours already, raising the level of my character (mage) to 21 pretty fast. Player base seems friendly in general. The story, while not amazing, is pretty simple to follow and interesting. The look of the game kinda reminds me of Tales of Symphonia, the parts when you were on the world map running around (which, to me, is a good thing).\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is the fact that while it's free to play, you always, ALWAYS have a "premium" button thingie on your screen, right above your action panel, if you don't have a premium account. It gets really annoying. Also, there are various chests randomly put on the maps, and you can only open them with keys that cost real money. Basically, you can play for free, but you won't have access to everything if you don't pay.\n\nIn other words, this game is enjoyable, but it's not perfect, especially for people who don't want to spend real money like me. I would still recommend it.","August 18, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
