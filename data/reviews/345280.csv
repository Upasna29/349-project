After getting the first page, you're basically screwed, because you'll have monsters constantly shoved in your face, which damage you instantly.\n\nAfter 3 minutes of being bombarded with Slenderman's inbred cousins every 5 seconds, you'll die, and have to restart the game. All the weapons do the exact same thing, but they're completely useless, since just looking away from the monsters is enough to make them disappear.\n\nI know this is only a $1.99 game, but it's seriously bad. It feels like the game was just thrown together in the Unity engine in about a week.\n\nThis game honestly shouldn't be on Steam","January 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 70 of 92 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","70","92","19","0"

The game feels like it most certainly didn't mean to be a parody; it feels like they finished the game and realized that it wad too generic to have any else marketable or mildly unique (which the game, at this point, sadly isn't). The game play is uninspired, the graphics are as bland as lukewarm water and the actual mechanics of the game are - again - very generic. This game might as well be a workshop pack for Slender, but Slender was at least atmospheric. The compass gets cut off by some aspect ratios in windowed mode, you cant sprint again after depleting your stamina until it is entirely full, and the map is a big pile of almost-identical textures.\n\n3.5/10, not only wouldn't recommend but would also actively recommend against it. i kind of want to apologise to the single person who made this game, but he/she should really have tried to make something that is either A) an actual parody, or B) not so (and again I'm sorry to keep using this word)damn generic.\n\nTL;DR, This game feels more like a thinly-veiled ripoff than a parody. It's uninspired and fun for about ten minutes, but they aren't the first ten minutes. The game is a bumblef*ck, I'm sorry.","May 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/recommended/345280/","BrickMcSlabHouse","Viktor Vasko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/","297 products in account","What a lackluster title. Lost in a forest is a game that boasts finally being able to fight back against the ghosts and ghouls you run from in other games. Taking up the setting commonly found in games like the slender the game certainly delivers upon it's promise. Very comedically. Your aresenal runs from soda cans to toilets. Every enemy is a one hit kill with any item so having such a wide range of items is for the gamers pleasure I suppose although most of time you'll be gunning soda cans and bricks as they are the most common items in the game. As far as the horror aspect goes it's pretty much non existent similar to the threat of anything you seemingly only lose health when you look at the enemies which are all poorly modeled tall characters with no descernable traits other than being tall. But as I said you only have to hit them once with anything and they die so it's really no big deal. The poor combat and gameplay aside what this game has you do is wander around the forest for seemingly no reason with signs pointing to different locales like a warehouse and other such things. The only building I found was a shed after finding that I found nothing for the duration of my time playing this game. So essentially the name of the game is wandering aimlessly through a poorly laid out forest blasting the monsters out of your way with random junk and that's it. The game certainly leaves a lot to be desired and quite frankly I could expect no more out of a low budget comedy title. The game really loses it's comedy charm about 3 minutes in leaving you with nothing more than monotonous boring chore gameplay. So unless you can pick this game up for somewhere along the lines of 25-30 cents like I did I wouldn't suggest picking it up at all. 4/10 pretty boring...

Most of the time I was just wandering around farming Slendy, the Grim Reaper, and Camel-headed Slendy while completely lost.  The game has a decent environment; I like the shape of the trees, the helpful glow of throwable items, and the variety of items.  But getting to the items (via mouse scroll) is almost impossible, making you overshoot the item you need.\n\nOnce you get going, you don't die (hint: aim the HUD at the heal kits in the vending machines to heal), at least not easily, and I quit out of frustration and being lost rather than fear or death.  Life and Stamina meters are a godsend - thank you!  The on-board compass and ingame 'maps' (map? it's literally just a field with 'you are here' on it :T ) are nice, but give us a little bit more.  I'd like to know that walking in one direction forever will eventually get me somewhere.\n\nDevs, please - put more than one sound on the footsteps.  That sickening grass/gravel crunch turns my stomach.  The ambient noises are really good, though - that howling/screaming one was just creepy!  An overall story would be GOLDEN.  You have a lot of room for great parody, here.  USE IT!\n\nI do not believe the church exists.  There are signs for it, but I've never seen it. :T\n\nCalm down that mouse sensitivity as well.  It's bad.  I waste more potatoes shooting trees than creeps.  But I love the ragdoll physics used (the truck tire is certainly worth using!), and dropping Slendy & friends is quite satisfying.\n\nGUYS - THIS GAME IS SCARIER THAN IT LETS ON.  I was walking after getting the second page and out of nowhere some gray body/face/screaming thing popped on screen in line with my HUD.  Made me jump a damn mile!  Jump scares are all right, but the scary noises and ambience is even better.\n\nGood cheap game, nice if you're too freaked by Slender.  Worth the $0.99 I put into it, but with some work it could be worth a lot more.  Definitely has potential.","May 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Nothing makes sense.  It's like a horrible put-together-in-2-seconds kind of bad game but it does deliver on it's promises of being a horror game.  Some parts are freaky.\n\nI wish there was some direction on WTF do you even do?  I got 1 of howevermany pages and then all of a sudden I'm just haunted and somehow dying.\n\nSuch a strange game, with a fair price, a welcome, but confusing addition to Steam.","January 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 23 of 68 people (34%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","34","23","68","11","3"

When I first played slender man with my sister we had a fairly good time. This game doesn't even come close to the standards set forth by the penumbra series or even by ,the less creative but still OK ,slender man game. My main complaint concering the graphics was the setting which was suppose to be this scary forest. Well it wasn't scary and what's more it barely passed as a forest. It revealed to me how unimaginative the developer(s) are as well as their knowledge or lack of what makes a successful horror/adventure game. Another complaint I have is the game's lack of originality in other words it has been done there is no need to create the same game over and over again. My advice is to be inspired by other games not copy them, you know take what has been done and  go to the next level ,think outside the box, do what hasn't been done yet.","October 23, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
