The instructions, if you can call them that, do not give you much insight as to what needs to be done. The voice used is really annoying and the after 30 minutes of play (if you could call it that) I quit and removed this from my computer. It was a complete waste of less than $3.00 and a bad idea in general.","December 30, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
