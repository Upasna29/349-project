I even highly recommend watching some gameplay before you decide to buy it. The gameplay is blocky and the early combat feels like an extremely downgraded Batman game, and everything else pretty simple and basic. HOWEVER I find the game extremely funny, and have mainly been playing it because of how much I enjoy the dialog and jokes, and while the platforming is pretty bland I love it because it reminds me the platformers I used to play back on the original playstation. Overall I'd say that I'm happy I bought this one.","April 22","true","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Love it. Overall pleasant. Game play wise is straight forward hack and slash. Simple puzzles. If you like beating up clowns that has given you nightmares go for it, pluck their red noses and nail them down.","April 25","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Quirky comic-book style, good action - similar combat system to Arkham Knight - though humour is a bit hit & miss and some issues identifying a controller.\n\nDid a video overview of the game with further information here - http://expansivedlc.com/masquerade-baubles-doom-exp-overview/","May 15","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
