Winning games to unlock boosters is the whole point of DotP, so buying the complete version basically means you've wasted not only the extra money over the basic version, but also the money for the basic version. All. Your. Money. Wasted.\n\nThe "pick a deck, but you're stuck with it" gimmick is bad design and the devs are bad for doing it. No preview of the decks, just a vague description that in my case was totally misleading. I chose Red->Black which was described as "focusing on stealing your opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for fun and profit". Yeah it was just a plain RB aggro deck with 2 Act of Treason and 2 vampires that could sacrifice creatures for a +1/+1 counter...in a 60-card deck. 4 cards does not a focus make.\nBut that bad design was merely irritating, not game-breaking. I could live with it.\n\nThe deck-building feature is good, it's about time that they added it. However, they didn't actually add it. They replaced all other features with it, for a net loss of game. Let's see what the trade off was for something that should have been a standard feature years ago:\n\nNo more Two-Headed Giant, either co-op vs AI or multiplayer.\nNo more Planechase multiplayer.\nNo Challenge puzzles.\nNo Sealed campaigns.\n\nIs all that worth it? Hell no.\n\nThis is a blatant money-grab by Wizards, who clearly fear losing players from MTGO if they add too much actual gameplay here, which is completely stupid as the two games serve two different fanbases.\n\nI have nothing but disgust for the design decisions of this game. Definitely do not recommend.","July 18, 2014","false","6.4"," 1,144 of 1,247 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","144","1","0","23"

This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nMagic the Gathering; Duels of the Planewalkers has become a yearly franchise, and with the recent success of Blizzard's Hearthstone, they've attempted to step up their game with Magic 2015 by allowing players the much-desired ability to finally create their own decks.\n\nAfter a brief tutorial, you're able to pick a starting deck and begin the campaign. From there, you're able to unlock booster packs as you defeat opponents, allowing further customization of your decks. If you don't feel like endlessly-grinding the single player, you're also able to purchase additional cards via micro-transactions and collecting every card will run you about $50. If you factor in the initial cost of the game, Magic 2015 will run you about the same price as a full-price triple AAA title.\n\nThere are nearly 300 unique cards to choose from or close to 1000 if you include duplicates, allowing for a multitude of options when it comes to crafting your deck. You're also able to adjust the amount of land in your deck for the first time, which is recommended as leaving it up to the game to do this automatically isn't ideal. Often assigning lands with no rhyme or reasoning behind it, such as giving you mountains in a blue deck. Infact the AI in general is greatly diminished in this installment as it will often tap the wrong lands by default if you're not careful enough to use the toggle key. Such as tapping all of your swamps for colorless mana instead of any other lands you may have available.\n\nThe campaign features a bit of a narrative where one of the Planeswalkers; Garruk Wildspeaker has gone rogue and has been hunting down other Planeswalkers.  It's your job to track him down and stop him. The campaign's story is nothing extraordinary and chances are you've purchased the game to play with friends.\n\nThe Multiplayer allows for you to use your crafted deck against your friends as well as other players online. Unfortunately, it's been stripped down from previous games of the series, featuring a lot less gametypes. Two-Headed Giant, Archenemy and Sealed Deck have all been removed, with the only option being a 1 on 1 duel or free for all. The user interface is also completely unintuitive as there's no lobby for multiplayer matches. Once a game is concluded, you're forced to exit to the main menu where you'll have to jump through a few separate menus in order to change your currently equipped deck or to host another game. Also a search function would be a welcomed addition for the deck builder, as it can sometimes be a little tedious searching for the cards you want.\n\nThis isn't the only area of the game that is lacking content as the single player challenge mode has been removed as well. There are also a lot of cards that are only available in the single player campaign and inaccessible when it comes to crafting your deck. One could say this is a result of balancing issues, but the game has definitely been designed from the ground up to cater towards micro-transactions. I wouldn't mind spending money for constant DLC card packs and additions if the game was self-contained like Hearthstone but the fact that it's simply a yearly release that will only be supported for a limited time, makes it feel somewhat pointless.\n\nMagic 2015 also has quite a few bugs and glitches. I found that I was unable to change my resolution to 1920 x 1080 without going in and manually editing the config file in wordpad. I've also experienced quite a few freezes in the multiplayer where the timer will disappear, forcing us to leave the game. Not only that, but it does randomly crash to the desktop as well.\n\nUltimately, Magic 2015 is one step forward and two steps back, it's enjoyable if you're a fan of Magic the Gathering. The deck creation tool is a much welcomed addition, however micro-transactions, an unintuitive interface, bugs, and a lack of features in general holds it back. While the initial game provides a great base to build on, chances are the DLC will be aimed at making as much money as possible from the consumer before repeating the same formula with Magic 2016.\n\nThis review is also available in video format:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI4sNlB2I4o\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Deck creation tool finally allows you to craft your own decks.\n+ More customization options, such as being able to adjust the amount of land in your deck.\n\nCons:\n\n- Challenge & Multiplayer modes removed when compared to previous entries.\n- Lots of bugs\n- Unintuitive Interface\n- Lackluster Campaign\n- Microtransactions\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","July 21, 2014","false","27.1"," 716 of 809 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","716","809","0","18"

You seriously need to step your game up and create a DTCG (Digital Trading Card Game) that actually competes with other DTCG's currently and upcoming out there. You have failed to create a singular platform (Magic Online is a piece of garbage) where all MGTO fans can gather and play each other for fun and competitivly. Look at Infinity Wars, HEX, hell even Hearthstone.... How dense can ya'll be?\n\nI have been wanting to play a singular online platform of MGTO on my desktop since I was in middleschool, I am now 26... I am still waiting for ya'll to get your act together and create an actually stable, graphicle, and appealing online game. You have failed to do so and have given us this. Sure it's good looking and stable. But there is still tons to be desired to even be as competent as the other DTCG who have far less funding yet FAR surpass you. This shouldn't HAPPEN! I have always loved and dedicated a lot of time on MGTO but for some odd reason even though you're the big one in the room you FAIL at giving what your fans and dedicated players want.\n\nIf you guys stopped with this whole "Release" a new title every year which are limited in their cards that fractures your player base and created a single downloadable client that we all can download and all be able to play with a cash shop and all then I'd be happy. I want to spend my money on your DTCG game but at your current state and your competition my money goes to them instead of you.\n\nDon't get me wrong I enjoyed playing this game but coming from playing other competing DTCG's you have left massive holes to be desired and to improve upon. Stop releasing new 'games' every year. Focus on the engine and release card collections like the rest of the herd. No microtransactions on a game that will be dead next year. I dont want to start my collection from scratch every year!\n\nHopefully you get it right the next time but my expectations will always be low.","December 30, 2014","false","5.2"," 541 of 605 people (89%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","89","541","605","27","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/recommended/255420/","zanameth","Zanameth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanameth/","341 products in account","A lot more bad points than good points on this one.\nEdit : BUT, you might wanna have a look at my (edited now that I got more hours behind me) closing words to know if this game is for you or not.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros :\n- Finally being able to build a somehow more "customized deck" !\n\n- The new battle UI is neat (is that even a good point anyway)\n\n- If you're really patient, you can get a lot of cards and shape your deck however you want, tho be prepared for some nuts grinding.\n\n\n\nCons :\n- Menus are goddam slow to navigate in. Looks fancy the first few minutes, but afterwards each menu transition will feel like an eternity. You also sometimes have to click several times on a button due to the slow responsiveness of the UI (probably cos it didn't finish its transition)\n\n- You start with only one deck (yes, only one). You cannot swap decks once you have chosen, and you have no idea what the contents of your pick will be (all you know is the colors inside your starter deck).\n\n- The starting deck is WEAK, and I mean it. Compared to the previous Magic DoTP, the deck feels weak, no fun cards in it that makes you grin, no solutions against many types of deck you might encounter. The result is, AI will ♥♥♥♥ you in Planeswalker diff unless you get not only a perfect starting hand but also very good draws. In fact, turn down the difficulty to "Mage" and do some games against a random AI deck, you're not even guaranteed to win, even as a veteran player. The problem would not be with your skills, but because of how weak the deck is. It does look like you can change your starting deck at the very start (tho it doesn't seem clearly visible), but afterwards you're stuck with it until you get enough cards to build a new deck, or to alter your starting one to something decent.\n\n- Grindfest party to build a proper deck. We are very close to a Pay2Win iteration with this 2015 edition. The game now has an online shop in which you can buy boosters (1.79€ for 10 cards) for real money, or an entire card collection for (4.99€). We all get where this is going. And given the facts that even Mage level AI will pown you depending on your starter deck (which doesn't make speed games for farm very efficient at start), you will either have to be very patient or break your piggy bank, the latter being obviously what the game wants you to do. For reference, Only two rares in your starting deck (one at first, and the second when you finish or skip tutorial).\n\n- The land system is broken. Example : Let's suppose you have two plains and two swamps in play, and in your hand you got two cards that each cost one swamp and one colorless mana to play. If you wanted to play both, you obviously would want to pay one plain and one swamp for each.\nWell guess what? No. Click the first card in your hand, and the system will often tap both swamps for its mana cost. What the [insert kind words and sing a Bieber song here] hell? You can still tap your lands manually with CTRL, but the system used to be smart enough to leave you with the right mana combinations, which ain't the case anymore. Let's hope this gets fixed.\n\n\n\nClosing words\n\nWell, we wanted a better way to customize our deck, so now we have it. While I believe there is a way to build the "deck of your dreams" (will never beat Shandalar anyway), the game obviously wants you to pay extra money to get what you want. I'm saying this because if this wasn't the case, they could've made starter decks more fun and powerful (like the starter decks in the previous series), and still make other good cards unlockable afterwards, which would've been fair trade. Instead, they made your deck as weak as it can be to either push your patience to the limit or make you break your piggybank. This is not a business tactic I am especially fond of, thus I cannot put a thumbs up for this game.\n\nEdit : To clear any misuderstanding, I'm not saying the game is bad per-se. The game itself is solid, and if you're willing to make repeated fights to farm your cards, you'll definitely have fun later on (I can tell without being there yet). I mean, how can it not be fun to make the deck the way you want ?\nHOWEVER, and unlike the previous Magic DotP games, you WILL NOT have fun right off the bat. You will first have to farm cards for hours before you have something you can really call a "Deck". In the end, if you know you are willing to spend a decent amount of time to get your cards, I believe you won't regret it and you'll definitely have fun. If not, well...\n\nHave a great day,\n\nZanameth, a very old Magic player\n\nMy favorite deck? A "Wildfire" variant from the Urza block! Veterans will know what I refer to.\n\n\nEdit 19th July : Clarified the mana tapping problem and the starting deck problem.","July 16, 2014","false","12.7"," 1,052 of 1,278 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","052","1","0","64"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/recommended/255420/","zreese","zreese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/","1207 products in account","Wizards of the Coast and Stainless Games have listened to hardcore fans and finally given them what they want: a sales funnel.\n\nI'm having a hard time grasping how Magic 2015 became such a mess. Previous games in the series have been wonderful, offering the components and mechanics of the Magic: The Gathering card game without the overly involved meta-game. Choose one of the pre-configured decks, play a quick game online, then step away from the computer and enjoy the other passions in your life. I contend that it is one of the most enjoyable ways to play Magic: The Gathering, if only because you don't have to interact with the sort of people who play Magic: The Gathering on a regular basis.\n\nA common criticism of Magic 2015's predecessors was "Why can't I build my own deck from scratch using all of the Magic cards ever made?" This is similar to walking into a coffee shop and asking for a porterhouse steak. No one will argue that it's what you'd most desire at that given moment, but the resources exist for you to have that experience without making the world collapse and conform to your immediate needs. There is a game called Magic: The Gathering Online that allows players to have the "complete" Magic: The Gathering experience, such as spending hundreds of dollars to build the same deck that everyone else is using because of a mechanical exploit. That is it's own thing. You can go out onto the internet and type "Magic: The Gathering Online" in a search engine, with or without quotes, and spend lots of money on digital trading cards. The Duels of the Planeswalkers series has offered a different experience, more akin to a fighting game. It was a well balanced game that afforded many different play styles and allowed players to have fun regardless of their skill level.\n\nMagic 2015 does away with pre-configured decks almost completely. You play a tutorial and then choose from a list of different decks. None of them are very good. You can not change your deck after choosing without deleting your save file and starting over. You must use that deck for the first section of the campaign. If you are patient you will eventually unlock the ability to build your own decks, but only after slogging through numerous battles with the starter deck.\n\nWhen you win a battle, you are rewarded with a booster. This booster contains a few cards that are almost certainly worthless to you. Maybe you are playing with a black zombie deck. Your booster might contain three green cards that are not zombies. And you'll say, "Wow, I wish I could get lucky and open a booster with some good zombie cards in it!" The solution to this is to purchase a premium booster. These premium boosters contains the Good Cards. They cost $1.99 each. You can buy as many as you want. The only way to get the Good Cards is by buying premium boosters. If you buy enough of them, you might get a Great Card that wins the game when you play it. If you don't buy enough of them, you will be at a disadvantage when playing online against the people who did buy enough of them. These people will play a Great Card and you will lose the game.\n\nIt is important to remember that you have paid at least $9.99 for this experience.\n\nDesign decisions like these have turned a reasonably solid series into something foul. You should not buy this game. You should not play this game. If you want a casual game of Magic: The Gathering, buy Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014. It is well balanced and fun to play. If you want to spend exorbitant amounts of money building whatever deck is dominating the Magic: The Gathering meta-game, play Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want a real challenge, open a coffee shop that sells porterhouse steaks. Let me know how it does.\n\nOne additional item that I absolutely must mention as part of my "See Something, Say Something" campaign against offensive user experiences: the menus in this game are presented in a slideshow fashion, where you can only see one menu option at a time and have to cycle through each screen. This results in the inability to view menu options that are currently disabled. So it's impossible to judge your progress in the campaign, which is unfortunate because most of the game's content is hidden away behind various milestones. FAQs online told me that deck building was unlocked after beating Avanyc, but due to the poor menu system I was unable to determine how many more events I needed to clear before I reached that point. The "unnumbered list" menu system used in the previous games, as well as almost every single piece of interactive media produced since the beginning of time, would have been a much better solution for content navigation.","July 21, 2014","false","4.6"," 593 of 715 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","593","715","2","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celisasu/recommended/255420/","celisasu","Celisasu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celisasu/","246 products in account","Honestly there needs to be a mixed button for reviews I think.  Magic 2015 is a shining example of a game that has a number of good qualities but is marred by some bad ones as well.  It's like they took all these great ideas and then put some flaw that ruined the awesomeness that could've been.  I'm going to look at both the core game and the Garruck expansion with this review.\n\nOn the positive side we finally get true deckbulding.  Every card you unlock can be accessed to build any deck you want.  This is something people have been clamoring for for awhile and it's great that they finally offered it to us.\n\nYou also face a wide variety of different decks in the single player campaign which while showing you the diversity of Magic also unfortunately shows you all sorts of cool stuff that you won't get to use in the game yourself.\n\nI've heard people complain about the black and white color scheme and honestly I don't have a problem with it myself.  I think this is a taste thing as it doesn't seem any better or worse than the previous color schemes used in Duels of the Planeswalkers.\n\nThis brings us to some of the noticable flaws in the game unfortunately.\n\nFirst is how they approached deck building.  You can have one of any mythic, two of any rare, three of any uncommon, and four of any common in your deck.  This goes back to the bad old days of hiding good cards behind rarity.  Note that there are good common and uncommon cards in this game and bad rare cards(I can't recall if there are bad mythics off the top of my head) but honestly they should've looked at each card and said "Is this broken?" and if their answer was yes, not included it and if the answer was no then allowed a full playset of four cards.  Some games can be decided by someone getting that rare or mythic card in their hand.\n\nSecond is some bad campaign choices.  This is especially bad in Garrucks expansion.  In that you have to use Garruck's premade deck and you'll be facing off against decks that are specifically designed to beat him.  It's not fun.  It's frustrating.  For example the second Garruck match gives you some new cards for your deck that you have to use...such as creatures that are capable of killing a non-black creature.....when you're facing an opponent who is using mono-black.  End result is that you have a seriously overpriced 3/3 flyer in your deck.  All the Garruck matches are like this and it's more a frustrating slog through the expansion as a result.  It could've been awesome.  His deck has stuff that you'll almost never get to play in the actual paper game such as Bayous(the original black/green dual land with no restrictions) but they successfully made even that not fun.\n\nThird is the paucity of game modes.  I've heard people complain about the lack of two headed giant which is fair, but they pretty much only have the most basic modes.  This is the first Magic which hasn't offered an alternate mode at all.  No Adversary, no Planechase, nothing.  Commander has been big lately, couldn't they have put stuff in for that at least?\n\nFourth is that some of the starter decks are almost traps.  They're really really bad and if you chose one it'll be much harder to go through the main campaign until you manage to unlock a few worthwhile cards.  And you don't even get to know what's in them until after you chose one.\n\nFifth is the lack of other players.  The flaws in the game have clearly lead to a limited player base as I've wandered on at what should be good hours and only seen a few people on.  The flaws and the fact that apparently they're already working on another game have clearly lead people to moving on.\n\nThe last thing is more a meta situation than anything else so I'd say less a flaw and more a flavor thing.  Obviously different eras of Magic had different metas.  The meta for 2015 is fairly aggressive.  It's going to favor aggro decks and not be so friendly towards slower decks so if you want to play a defensive blue/white control deck for example 2015 probably isn't going to be the Magic environment for you.\n\nOverall it's a fun but noticably flawed game.  I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you see it discounted(I'd say 50% off minimum) and enjoy card games you might have an enjoyable playthrough.  I got it discounted and I do think I got my money's worth but I probably would've been more annoyed if I'd paid full price.  So not recommended at full price, but go ahead and pick it up if you can get it cheap.","May 10, 2015","false","24.1"," 146 of 156 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","146","156","2","3"

If you want to play Magic at your computer without investing in MTGO, buy DOTP 2014 instead.\n\nQuite frankly WOTC isnt known for quality control of digital products, but this might actually be the worst designed product with their name on it that I've seen (and I played MTG Tactics and MTG Battlegrounds).  I finally decided to try this version out, despite all of the negative things I've heard about it.  Surprisingly though, its somehow worse than I expected.\n\nThe microtransactions arent the real problem here.  Certainly they are there, and that is slightly annoying given that the point of the DOTP franchise is to play MTG without that aspect of the card game.  However as a paper MTG player I'm certainly used to that.\n\nNo, the real problem here is that the game that you are paying for is garbage.  First of all, its one of the most abysmal PC ports I've seen in awhile.  Instead of a menu screen, you get a series of icons that you scroll through one at a time until you find the one you were trying to get to.  Even in game, the mouse controls are strangely less smooth and not as responsive as in 2014.  It feels like the function of every aspect of the game has been sacrificed to try to make things look "cool".\n\nAnd since I'm talking about the appearance of the game.  It looks horrible.  Why is everything on the screen black and grey?  Did someone at the studio decide that the colorful blues, golds, and reds of DOTP 2014 were too pleasant to look at?  The whole design of the in-game interface is not only far less convenient and poorly laid out, but also just plain irritating to look at.  Are me and my opponent playing MTG in some dystopian sci-fi future where joy is illegal?\n\nBut so far I've been talking about the interface, gameplay functionality, and apperance of the game; "what about the actual card game?", you excitedly ask.\n\nUnfortunately its just not worth it.  I continuously feel as though Im playing the sealed gameplay mode of DOTP 2014... except with less interesting cards.  And this is the 2015 campaign gameplay.  Sure being able to make my own deck with random cards is nice, but if I wanted to make a crappy deck with crappy cards I would play sealed mode.  Which I can already do in DOTP 2014.  And if I want to play multiplayer or the campaign, 2014 lets me play with some fun Magic cards from throughout MTG history instead of the boring trash you get to work with in 2015.\n\nIn conclusion, if at any given time I was unable to go out and play paper Magic with people in person, I would play DOTP 2014.  If I was unable to play DOTP 2014, I would play Hearthstone.  And if I was forced to play DOTP 2015... I would go read a book.\n\nLearn from my mistake, dont buy this version of DOTP.  Dont support their horrible decisions.  Hopefully WOTC will seriously rethink their poorly implemented digital business model.","December 29, 2014","false","23.7"," 179 of 204 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","179","204","12","0"

While the optional second deck is based on your existing portfolio of cards and therefore fails to alleviate the issue, the inability to redo that crucial choice in the beginning is a real kicker. Cue endless tiresome games during which you desperately try to improve the absurdly abysmal starter deck with zero synergy so you stand a fighting chance against a full-blown enemy.

The content is so tedious that I'm sure plenty of people are paying that $35 just to avoid experiencing it. In addition to that, even if you pay $35 or unlock all free content the strongest cards in the game can still only be obtained via the RNG of opening "premium" booster packs.\n\nIt feels like they are trying to shift these Duels of the Planeswalkers games in the direction of MtG Online, expecting people to pay large sums of money to open boosters, build decks and play competitively. Whilst the UI and gameplay is superior to MtG Online, MtG 2015 does not offer the trading, social and most importantly, competitive/tournament scene that the Online client does.\n\nSo it straddles in between and ultimately offers the best of nothing. Not the enjoyable co-op, single player or casual PvP game that MtG 2014 is, but not the competitive PvP client that MtG Online is.

WotC went completely Pay to Win.\n\nWhere as in Duals of the Planeswalkers 2014 sealed play was one of the best things in the game (Even if you had to pay in DotP 2014 to have 3 or more sealed decks ..of course.. ), they completely REMOVED sealed play from M2015 and I will tell you why.\nIt's because their other game, Magic Online, makes them a lot more money in offering sealed play events because people pay the full price for virtual card packs over and over again (By the by, yes, the full retail price is charged in Magic Online. The exact same 4 dollars per pack like you would have to pay for physical ones.). And because that alone is not making them enough money yet, they changed their business model to make this game appealing only for the crowd of new players who are new to Magic and want to learn how to play.\n\nEDIT: They removed Two Headed Giant too apparently\n\nDon't even try multiplayer in this game. A number of card sets are available for everyone who wants to pay to make the perfect decks. If you just buy this game you are stuck with a cheap deck of commons that you picked at the beginning of the game. A choice you can't even revert later on if you don't like your deck.\n\nBut wait, there is more:\nThis game's interface, for some reason, is SLOW.  It's not my hardware but even scrolling through the main options is slow.\nThe design is poor. You are pretty much forced to use your keyboard to scroll through it because it's so oddly placed on screen that if you try to use your mouse you will often accidentally click something, and your have to wait until it's loaded up (which takes like 3 seconds) before you can go back and load the interface back up (takes too annoyingly long as well). You might think; 'a few seconds? What is this guy whining about?' well, buy the game. You will see how annoying it becomes after you misclicked for the fifth time. The whole feel to this game is just as if it's an unfinished, unpolished game. Very badly optimized.\n\nMy rant is not over yet:\nThe promo you get for buying this game: Soul of Shandalar is terrible. Last year we got a decent rare but this card is just unplayable. Don't even get this game for the promo card if you were planning on that.\n\nEven if you are a new player whose characteristics include infinite patience; this game is not worth it for you even though you are the main selling audience. If you are determined on learning how to play Magic, just drive to your local store, pick up an intro deck (like 20 bucks) and play some real Magic with the people there. Im convinced it's a lot more fun to play together and Magic players are often very helpful and will teach you how. They don't have to improvise a way to help you through the constraints of a shabby business model. I am seriously contemplating quitting Magic the Gathering now. Don't get this game.\n\nPositive points:\nI bought the standard edition and didn't waste another 20 euro's on the full edition.","July 16, 2014","false","10.3"," 126 of 161 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","126","161","0","0"

Like in each PC instance, with the exception of Magic The Gathering Online, the rules are dumbed down and a pre-set of cards is given to make the game appeal to more casual gamers that don't want to invest hundreds of dollars and still play with nice decks against each others.\n\nThe basics of the game are explained in my review for Magic 2014, so please look there, including the comments section:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/213850\n\nWhat are the differences between Magic 2014 and Magic 2015 then?\nWell, first of all you can now freely build your deck from a given card pool for which you can unlock booster packs by winning games or paying real money. While it doesn't sound bad at first, two factors greatly diminish the value of this novelty to the DOTP series: First of all the card selection is horrible, several combo cards are added without their counterparts, making it difficult to build a good deck. Second, some cards are real-money exclusive, which requires around 16 Euro to unlock all so-called "premium" booster packs.\n\nThe multiplayer experience suffered greatly by the exclusion of the Two-Headed Giant mode where two players could play against two other players cooperative. Another removed mode is the puzzle mode where you could solve 10 puzzles, i.e. pre-given positions where you had to defeat the opponent. Instead a forced tutorial was added that goes over one full act, only afterwards are you allowed to get an own deck, and only after the next act to freely build your deck. This horrible design choice leads you to having to play through the first part of the game with the starter deck which you can't exchange for another starter deck. Those decks, of course, have misleading descriptions.\n\nAs for achievements, most are nicely done again, only the 100 multiplayer wins are a very bad achievement, since without the Two-Headed Giant mode there is no real incentive to play multiplayer with not fun decks against other people with not fun decks. The 1v1 battles for that achievement should be done with a friend, ensuring you also can get other achievements easily.\n\nAnother thing that really bugs me is that although the title is "Magic 2015" the signature cards of that addon are not included in this game - Waste Not would have been a real addition to the game, allowing for really cool effects. Instead you have cards you either know from the older games or that don't have much synergy. You want to create a deck of your style? No good mill, no good burn, no good anything - a green-white token deck or red-blue control deck without any real opportunity to draw cards is the highest of feelings you can get.\n\nOn the positive side, several new effects were implemented, such as multicolor lands (finally!) and Monstrosity. And as the title says, planeswalkers are... wait... still not implemented!\n\n\nRecommended: Play inofficial mods for Magic 2014 instead, and do your own deckbuilding with inofficial tools there. Many effects of Magic 2015 are already possible there, although quality varies. And yes, you CAN have planeswalkers with unofficial mods in Magic 2014!\nEven as a die-hard DOTP fan, I can't recommend Magic 2015!","August 17, 2014","false","34.6"," 76 of 90 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","76","90","0","2"

It used to be a cheap way of getting to play some MtG sure it had its limits with deck building, but it also had fairness in the sense that everybody had acces to the same cards, This new 2015 edition allows you one deck with no way of pre-viewing and then you have to buy booster packs to actually make it strong.... They really screwed the franchise for all of us casual player, the pros play the real online mgt anyway..\nTo clarify you do unlock cards, but you'll have to spend more cash than the initial purchase if you want to have acces to the same arsenal as your oppenents.\nOther than that the game is pretty much the same as the other games of the serires.\n\nEdit: Felt i had to add an edit. Yes, you unlock a lot of cards so you can build more decks, which is fine if you only goal is to play vs. a somewhat broken AI.\nUnable to make a proper AI like all previous MtG games they allow the AI to chat in the sense that it play solely reactive with what must be classified as miracle draws.

People have complained for years about many features, or lack thereof in this series. The developers finally listened to people cries for full deck building. While the deckbuilding is robust and the card collection is larger than ever, there is almost no content to back it up.\n\nDotP has been a great online trading card game because it had little competition in the past. Now that there is competition in the form of great games like Might & Magic Duel of Champions and Hearthstone, Magic 2015 is easily overshadowed. You would think that a game series would only add content to the franchise in yearly installments, but Magic 2015 has actually stripped multiplayer of it's best game modes. Two headed giant IS NOT in Magic 2015, and the developers fail to acknowledge that it was one of the best selling points of past games, and the only mode distinguising DoTP from the competition (Hearthstone players are dying for a 2HG game mode, but will likely not get it). The removal of the 2HG was a fatal mistake for Magic 2015, and can be credited to Nik Davidson (http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ac4v9/ama_with_nik_davidson_lead_designer_for_magic/citnrid).\n\nIn the past, cards were unlocked either through grinding (which wasn't all that bad!) or simply manipulating game files to unlock all cards. The developers have done nothing to moderate or squelch people from cheating in past iterations of DotP, and I can easily forsee people exploiting Magic 2015 to the fullest. I would say that Magic 2015 is pay to win since actually unlocking the games full content will cost more than the base price of the game in the form of microtransactions, but I won't because I don't think it will be long before people hack cards into their games and start using cookie cutter decks. Regardless, I do not see myself investing the time to craft decks in Magic 2015 because my only multiplayer options are to 1v1 duel, or free-for-all up to four players - opposed to the past 2HG, and the hilarious Planeschase mode from 2013.\n\nAside from the removal of the best game mode in DoTP, Magic 2015 has compounded the worst features of past iterations. The menu system has never been strong, and 2015's is the worst of the worst. Navigating the menu is cumbersome, and clicking buttons is extremely unresponsive. Thankfully, the in-game responsiveness is better, but the game is still brought down by slow animations and a boring playing field.\n\nI have been a fan of Duels of the Planeswalkers for years, and a cardboard Magic player for 20 years. Magic 2015 is a huge dissapointment and one of my first regret purchases on Steam. This can honestly be salvaged if the developers patch in 2-Headed Giant, but if past games are any indication, they will do nothing to support the game except release nickle-and-dime microtransactions rather than fix bugs. With over 500 hours played in the DotP series, I am sad to say that I likely will not be playing this game and instead move onto the now better online TCGs.","July 16, 2014","false","2.5"," 75 of 95 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","75","95","0","1"

Specifically I dislike the way decks and the aqquisition of new cards has been handled. After a brief tutorial you are thrown to a very large list of pre-assembled decks, all looking suitably cool with their flavour names and artwork, however expect to enjoy only one of these for a very large amount of play because that is all you may use with the standard edition. No information is given on any of the decks apart from their colours and it is not made clear that the decision you make here is final with no going back to sample the others. To me this feels like a gentle shove in the direction of the £4 a pop dlc packs offering all the cards instantly. After this at the end of each sucessful duel you will be given a booster pack relating to the plane you are currently on, a nice idea that gives you options for customisation that may not have been so prelavent in previous editions. This system is flawed however, I found on my playthrough the packs to be glitchy, and several times I was re-issued the same pack. The departure of Two Headed Giant, a mode me and freinds enjoyed significantly seems to seal the deal for me. I can't recommend this game particularly, I'd rather just go back to 2014 and play Echanter's Arsenal without having to throw Wizards any more money than I already have...","October 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 75 of 96 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","75","96","2","0"

I know i may not have played the game long enough to gain credibility but lets start at the basics. There is no Two-headed Giant which IMHO is one of the best gametypes they created for the game, the UI is a shambles and in no way needed changing from the previous games. At the games start you get to choose ONE deck out of the many terrible ones they have put together and trust me i know what im talking about when it comes to MtG.\nFrom the previous games you had the sence of feeling that everybody had access to the same cards and this has gone in the complete opposite direction in terms of that feeling and approach. It has become, like the metagame itself a pay to win game and i for one am very dissapointed in this ultimate proposal.\n\nIn Summary do not buy this game, if you are looking to re-invest your time back into MtG then i plead you to try Magic 2014 or just play the real game itself with friends where you do not need to spend ludicrous amounts of money in order to feel "Competitive"\n\nOn the other hand if you are simply looking for a new card game just try Hearthstone where you can actually have a sence of achievement without spending a lot of money on Packs.","July 16, 2014","false","0.8"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","0"

The whole menu usability is so frustrating it overshadows any other feature of the game.\n\nNo matter how good I play and with what cards, I will end up frustrated because the HR department skipped over the usability experience in the interviews.\nAll they managed to achieve is have nice single icons on the screen. Which might be nice if you're using a smartphone but you'd break it anyway after another "menu transition" which is not really an animation anyway, just a very prolonged fade.\n\nEven on a tablet there's place to choose more than one icon (sorry, I forgot left and right...) and have some sort of attempt to ease the navigation. For the mouse navigation they just attached a mouse to a tablet and checked wether you could see and move the cursor. You will go mad if you don't use the keyboard in the menus.\n\nOverall it takes me about 50 (not counting skipping the intros or the 20 clicks to get past the "Press Start" screen) clicks to start a game. The menus are so horrible I ended up quitting the game several times because I accidentally clicked past "do you really want to leave".

This is my first negative review of a steam product.  I love MTG and have been playing since the 90s with a couple of breaks in between.  So when I say this game is garbage I'm not just being a hater.  At the core when you are playing a match it is just like all the other games in the series.  It is the card gathering mechanics, menus, and lack of game modes that hurts this version of Duels.  Unlike previous games in the Planeswalker series you don't start the game with a selection of decks to move between and maybe discover new play styles.  You are locked into one deck that you have to pick off it's NAME, thats right name and color no card preview.  You are now stuck with that and must use it to beat matches and earn booster packs.  On the plus side you do have the ability to fully customize your decks which is awesome.  The down side to that is that the card selection is kinda meh.  Also being a game that is focused on dual colored cards it has barely any and the card focus is totally on sets that had plenty of them.  You can buy booster packs with micreotransactions or just unlock all the cards in a certain set.  Personally I don't like microtransactions of that nature but whatever, what really burns it is that the cards are lackluster on a whole.  I spent about 10 hours grinding out my black deck and once I had it finished I didn't want to play anymore.  Oh almost forgot no Two-Headed Giant (2v2 MP) or Archenemy(3v1 uber deck)!  Draft mode is chill but I dig team battles way more.

But this one makes it quite a bit\nmore difficult then the others I have played!\nNow to what I like and dislike about this.\n\nThe Decks!\nPositive: You can build your own decks: This has its enjoyable moments and it feels good to "Build" your own deck as-well as\nhaving freedom to do what you want and use or add what-ever colour you feel like! so long as you have the right cards of course. It was also good for them to do Tutorials before jumping you right into the decks and give you a chance to understand what the colours do!\n\nNegative: The starting deck experience I thought was fine at first. But you eventually realise that the starting deck you get is just garbage and can't really compete against half the decks reliably. It doesn't help that the cards you get almost feel like they are intentionally designed to not help your deck (I'll get to that later)\nNegative 2: Be careful what Starting colour you pick, because you cannot change once you accept it! You can build others yes, but good luck with that!\n______\n\nBoosters!\nPositive: I really like that they have done it much like MTG in real life (Bunch of commons, 3 uncommons and a rare or mythic rare!) the mystery of the boosters is always something I am a fan of. It is also nice that you get a booster everytime you finish a campaign mission (Not sure about Multiplayer; haven't touched it yet)\n\nNegative: As much as I like the mystery of the cards, I swear it is Designed to NOT pick cards for your starting deck! the amount of cards from boosters I have gotten that have been every colour BUT Blue white (Which is the starting deck I chose) Is a bit silly now! This\ndoes makes me guess they done it for the next Negative...\nNegative2: PAYWALL, GUYS! PAYWALL! This I was originally worried about because we already pay money for the bloody game, and it feels like you're forced to pay more, Which is just bad design! I did by two just to see a difference. Thankfully I just got draws I couldn't use, because that is exactly what I needed (Insert Sarcasm here!)\n\n_____\n\nVisuals\n\nPositive: The menus and the game over-all game looks nicer and more modernised! It is good to look at and easy to find most things.\nPositive: When actually playing the game, everything not only looks better and is easier to see but they made it more interactive. It was a cool Idea that the Environment actually shifts tone and the battlefield gets modified as-well as some other minor things which is just neat to look at!\n\nNegative: As much as I like the look of the menus... They couldn't make it more annoying to work with! In a nutshell, you can only look at one thing at a time (Single player, multiplayer, decks, shops ect..) and when things are locked off, it doesn't allow you to look at them AT ALL! It is especially annoying in the Deck area, where you can see these different decks, but cannot get a clue of WHAT THEY ARE!\nNegative 2: This isn't really a visual thing, but it kinda does fit in. TRANSITIONS! And boy do they like making you look at fading white fog with a white background... Slowly! If they didn't take so bloody long, they would actually be pretty cool and would fit well with the theming of 2015. But no, they had to be unusually slow and annoying to watch! You even have to stare at the start menu! "Yes, they must look at our glorious 'Enter game' button" A Genius developer said (Insert Sarcasm here)\n\n-----\n\nFinally, Gameplay\n(NOTE: I haven't done multiplayer yet, only single player, so I wont judge the game there)\n\nPositive: Because of the ability to properly make your own deck, the game has that extra level of enjoyment. It is that feeling when in real life, you made your first deck away from a starter deck and won against one of your friends (Which is a fun ♥♥♥ feeling!)\nPositive: I don't know if I am frequently lucky or not. but it feels like the drawing system is more designed so you actually get cards you can use so you can actually play the game! I do know from the previous DotP games that you can quite oftenly just draw abysmally and you'd be better off leave or restart half the games you play.\n\nNegative (This is campaign exclusive) : I have grown to really hate the campaign in this one! It isn't like the others where they add some stupid mechanic that you have to get a good draw to beat it.. That still exists, but from the ones I've seen, they are at-least acceptable and only slightly annoying. What is annoying that relates to that is the AI drawing the same cards, or always having the same cards. This would be fine if the deck you were given and the boosters weren't so bad that you likely can't do a thing about what they do. I'm almost content to not play the singleplayer at all because of it!\n\n-----\n\nCONCLUSION!\n\nI can say for a time you will get enjoyment out of this game much like the others. How long that lasts, will likely depend on how full your wallet is... or your Patience to tolerate some of the issues this game has.\nIt does sadden me a little, because I was looking forward to the boosters, the deck building and just a freash change from the usual DotP Formula. It is just a classic case of "Taking one step forward, but two steps back" Which is really unfortunate.\n\nThank you for reading my Rambling!

There is no 2 headed giant. A major drawback for some. I miss it, but I can live without it.\n2. Terrible starting decks. It's a deleberate game push towards teaching deck tweeking. And it does lend to the true beginners experiance of not having any cards.\n3. The automatic funtions as always have to be turned of. I can declaire my own attackers thank you, and I'll choose when I'm done with a stage. I know they use this for beginners, but it's truely as always anoying and useless. Even beginners need to learn how to manage games stages.\n4. The card pool of unlockable cards is one of the biggest of all the electronic versions. Still not enough cards for my taste. But a nice big unlockable pool. And don't pay to unlock the cards, just play for them. Easy enough to get everything but the battle packs.\n5. Foils again?! Why? Worthless online; you can't trade them for upmarket value like in real face to face and as always they make it VERY difficult to see which card is which on screen.\n6. Multiplayer is a bit sparce currently. It may pick up, I suspect though with people still playing 2012 on here, 2013 on here, and 2014 on here; just massively hampers the number of players. And to top that with no 2headed giant available as of yet...\n7. There are no stupid slots you have to pay to unlock! WOOP!\n\nNow you take all that.. and it is still a good version of magic online. Well worth buying and playing. If you love deck crafting this is the best version available. Could use a larger card pool, but at least they are giving you a great lake to play in rather than the typical large pond the hand you. I just wish they'd give us the ocean.","February 2, 2015","true","117.7"," 110 of 168 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","110","168","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuietTime/recommended/255420/","QuietTime","QuietTime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuietTime/","218 products in account","While I have purchased and enjoyed every DotP game to date, this game reinforces that the magic franchise wants your money more than they want you to enjoy their product.\n\nI was exicted about the promise of this game, and even went so far as to pre-order, having overall enjoyed their previous games despite their faults. Won't make that mistake again.\n\nMy biggest qualms thus far are the crawling rate to acquire cards that seems to imply they'll want you to buy many of them, the abundance of crappy animations and transitions that you can't disable, the strange requirement to unlock the game modes, and the removal of team play (previously seen in the form of Two Headed Giant). While previous magic incarnations have allowed you to unlock a deck after completion of each campaign leg, now you do not unlock enough cards to make a full new deck in a campaign leg. While I'm intrigued and excited by the new deck building format similar to the 2014 sealed, it's looking like you'll be paying a lot of money for boosters if you want any decent cards. I have no problem with grinding for them, but I hate pay to win games, especially when i've already payed for the base game. Again, there are unlocks, but it's taking me so long to get enough cards for a new deck that makes sense that I'll likely have to finish the full campaign before I can make more decks. I'm excited for deck building, but the starter materials are a little too scarce for my liking, especially since you can't change your starter deck if you find you hate it.\n\nI found it curious that even as an accomplished magic player I was forced to play through a really slow and annoying tutorial teaching me how to play. While some players have reported that there should be an option to skip, I'm not the only person who couldn't find it and instead had to waste half an hour on the tutorial before they could touch anything else. Also, you have to finish the first leg of the campaign before you can play multiplayer. Since the multiplayer is all I usually play for, this was frustrating, and it was a whole hour spent on this game before I realized the real deal breaker for me- the changes in multiplayer game modes.\n\nRegarding the ever present 2-headed giant complaint, I started playing magic online for the co-op. My boyfriend and I love the franchise because it gives us something we can do together even when we're far apart. Since the begining we loved the 2v2 mode that magic provided. While this evolution of the game still allows multiplayer, it doesn't allow for teamplay. For that reason we're probably going to stop playing 2015 within the week and go back to playing 2014. And we certainly won't be pre-ordering the next iteration if there is one, for fear that they'll continue removing features we liked.\n\nAlso, in addition to removing 2HG, there is no longer local co-op.\n\nRegarding the UI and AI, they both are still pretty crappy and annoying. Broken cards, cheating AI, wasted space, and clunky, laggy menus are still the norm. Also, there are only 2 resolution options, which are the same in both full screen and windowed mode. Which means if you have a large screen you're really going to want to be playing windowed, and you don't get to choose how your window is sized. Also, they still have that derpy bug where the game tries to start full screen, and if your resolution isn't one of their favorites, it just sits there confused and refuses to load. At least we've encountered that one enough to have a work around... The game continues to be technically buggy, and despite hopes that it will be patched, there were never fixes for a number of bugs in 2014, so I'm not terribly hopeful. All in all Wizards of the Coast continues to disappoint, and I'm left wondering why I yet again let them have my money.","July 16, 2014","false","6.1"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

Reminiscent of something along the lines of a sealed pre-release deck, no play sets, just random single cards put in.

Except not actually because we only put 1/3rd of the set in the game. We totally ignored all the dual creatures from RtR, and if you think you're using a heroic deck from theros then think again because we ain't having none of that."

As soon as you lift it from your hand thats it, you have to play it. The Mana usage in the game is also terrible. Sure theres an option that lets you toggle what mana the cast will use.

Otherwise I recommend you stay clear.\n\nPrevious versions of Duels of the Planeswalkers (which I generally enjoyed quite a bit) had a multitude of different decks, a few already unlocked, and many unlockable by defeating the AI. You also could upgrade them by winning games. Enter Magic 2015, which was advertised to have full deck building. Boy was I excited! And boy was it a let down.\n\nFor starters you get to blindly choose a starting deck based on a two-color-combination. And let me get this straight: the deck is terrible. Also: it's the only deck. Everything else you have to piece together from booster pack unlocks, which contain a hand full of cards.\n\nNow this wouldn't be too bad if the AI wouldn't be playing decks that were approxinately 100 times better than yours. Oh yes, you unlock new cards whenver you win (not only in your colors but in all five) to upgrade your deck, but playing feels like smashing your face into a brick wall that is the much better deck of the AI.\n\nBut not all hope is lost! You can just buy new cards for 1,79€ a pack! Isn't that great?! Yeah no, not for me. The intent is crystal clear: Give the player a crappy deck, give the AI good decks and create the incentive to spend real money to stand a chance.\n\nAll in all the game is already uninstalled and left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Until now, Duels of the Planeswalkers was an instant-buy for me, including additional decks and all. But I don't think I will be falling for this money-grabbing-scheme again.","July 16, 2014","false","2.1"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","41","57","0","0"

In the 2015 game, it has no new feautures, seems very dumbed down, gives slim to none explanation of the plot, and the deck creating system looks as if it was thrown together last minute. You are given a choice of 2 colors in your deck. The game randomly gives you a deck, holding no synergetic qualaties, and having only monocolored cards. The booster packs you earn from defeating opponents and encounters in the campaign contain only 3 cards, and usually don't contain the colors in your deck. They, like the deck you are given, seem htrown together. Even though this game only cost me 10 dollars, which in of itself shows that the game doesn't seem to be that much of a breakthrough, I feel it was a complete waste of money. 2/10","July 16, 2014","false","9.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","2"

For the most part: it is just as disappointing as all the other DotP games. While it is nice that we finally have the ability to build decks however we want, the game has a fatal flaw: the NPC decks are WAY stronger than anything you can build as the NPC has a MUCH larger card pool to pull from. The first world is relatively timid, but as soon as you get to Theros you will want a refund. The very first deck you face in Theros is amazing (Hydra deck), and as soon as it wipes the floor with you, you will want to go into deck builder and build the deck....only to find you can't, as the Hydras you want aren't available for use, nor are the sorceries that let you double your lands to your hearts content. once you finally have a deck worthy of speed wiping the hydra deck, you face off against the Journey into Nyx Minotaur themed intro deck, only to find you will need to spend another hour and a half building a new deck to compete against it because, like the Hydra deck, you can't use the cards that are in the minotaur deck. I paid $35 to unlock every card upon release, and still can't compete with the NPC decks as they use much stronger cards than what's available for PC use. I do NOT recommend this game, and it pains me to say it as i play every format of Magic that exists.

The biggest seems to be the lack of 2HG.\n\nMicrotransactions. This series has always had them but there is a lot more "day 1 DLC" than in the past. Personally I wish that Wizards would just realize that the UI for MTGO is unacceptable and update it to look as good as Duels but with a bit more functionality.\n\nOnly 1 starter deck is unlocked. The rest of the cards have to be unlocked via exploration boosters, premium booster purchases, and the optional collection purchase (the collection cards can be unlocked via the $5 each, $20 total or grinding out exploration for each collection). That can be a problem if you pick a deck that has weak matchups. After beating the last tutorial mission, you are locked into your 2 color starter deck.\n\nIt is a yearly release that makes players start over every year. Series like Call of Duty get plenty of flak for being a yearly, iterative release. CCGs can, to some players, feel worse. Players are used to being able to use their collection of older cards for CCGs... maybe in just a different rules format. In Duels, your collection starts over every year. Some people like the change in deck metagame. Some people are annoyed at the amount of DLC that comes out and becomes worthless at the next release.\n\nPersonally... I get the base game every year. During a Steam seasonal sale I usually buy the expansions or new deck DLCs that come out when they are at least 50% off. I get 20-50 hours of gameplay over the course of the year and spend <$30. So I do not feel cheated. I do think that Wizards is squandering a chance to expand their game to being far larger in the digital world by releasing Duels and leaving MTGO in the state that it is in. And that is even worse with them suing CZE over Hex which may not have ever existed if MTGO was even halfway decent. But I find it to be a fair model most years. My biggest complaint usually is the fact that purchases are not cross platform. Why can a small studio like Stoneblade manage to make SolForge cross platform on one account for IOS, Android, and PC and yet Hasbro cannot hire someone to let me play with my same collection on my tablet?\n\nThis year though? $10 for base game. $20 to unlock the base cards. And I think I heard there were 15 premium boosters needed to unlock all premium cards. That means that if you preordered and want the full collection but do not want to grind, you are looking at $48 on day 1. About 10-20 higher than previous years. Between that and the loss of game modes I can understand some of the frustration.\n\nMy recommendation is wait and see. I feel that the $10 is fair for the game (even though I wish we could unlock the other starter decks like we could in the past). More freedom in deck construction is always nice. But the extra day 1 purchases and loss of popular game modes will annoy many players. So wait and see how this game handles future content. Will there be more premium cards requiring more $2 boosters during the upcoming expansions? Will the new deck lists be unlocked or require either more grinding or more "collection packs" in addition to buying the extra deck lists, campaign, etc? Will Wizards add back in some popular features from previous years? If you are a fan of MTG but no longer player paper and hate MTGO the base game is not an awful deal. But this may be the year to give it a few weeks/months before jumping in unless you really want to play with the new cards and deck building.","July 16, 2014","false","9.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","3"

I'll get into that again in a second however.\n\nThe first 2 installments of MTG I think they got down rather well, while the first didn't have deck customization fully, all 3 did allow for more of "play how you want" playstyle, with decks that closely related to many different styles, whether you liked full color decks, mixed, defensive, offensive, etc. There was a deck for you.\n\nYou also got to play ALL of the decks in the game, you got 5-6 starter decks, then you could unlock each boss deck once you beat them. Allowing for many decks to be played.\n\nOntop of that, all the past MTG installments allowed you to unlock up too 50 new cards for every deck, letting you either use them all if you like large decks, or pick and choose what cards you want.\n\nIn the 2014 series you had the additional option of "foil decks" which let you create 5-6 additional decks off of random foil packs, while unlocking additional foil packs to build up on.\n\nIt was a good amount of customization. While you couldn't build a deck totally from scratch, having over 50+ extra cards ontop of the already 30+ cards at the start for every deck allowed for you to customize any deck how you want.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSo what about 2015? I was astounded at the stunt they pulled. Not only do you only get the 1 deck of your choosing, but you do not unlock extra cards specific for that deck. Instead for every win you get a foil pack with random cards in it. Much like the foil deck play in 2014, except instead of getting 5-6 decks, you get 1.\n\nYou do not ever get to use the other starter decks unless you buy them.\n\nThe foil play style for your 1 deck is also limited. If you are a casual player, and don't want to put money into additional "lottery foil" luck to try to get the 1 card you want, you'll quickly find your deck lacking and unable to be competitive in the campaign, or multi-player.\n\nWhile the past installments of MTG were fair, in that even casuals could unlock good cards, specific for every deck in the game, this is not the case by any means in 2015.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf that isn't bad enough, they also took out the most played game, which is 2 headed giant. They also took out many other game modes from past MTG. This truly is a cash cow in the sense they took out all game modes from past MTG, force players to buy foil packs through steam to "maybe" get a card they can use in their 1 deck.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, it gets even worse...\n\nThe way the game plays is still an obvious cop out with built in mechanics. The game is scripted not to read what card the AI has in its hands, but rather, what cards are left in the deck.\n\nTo many players this wont be obvious until they play several games, however if the AI has 6 cards in its hand, those are all in essence, wild cards. The Game waits to see what you do, then see's what cards are potentially in the deck it has, and then decides what card to play from the deck as a whole.\n\nThis becomes very obvious at medium/high difficulty setting, when the AI will start pulling the perfect counter card 10 times in a row, despite having no cards in its hand, and it will do this consistantly every battle. -IF- it truly was random, the mathematical impossobility of this is enough to say, there is some serious bs built in "cheating" the AI is doing.\n\nBasically if it doesn't want you to win, you won't. This is also done on purpose as a time sink. To make you play through longer as you lose more often, and attempt to make you buy more foil packs for better cards.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, avoid this game like a plague.","July 16, 2014","false","14.7"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","1"

Instead of unlocking each deck and playing them to unlock additional cards you must earn boosters and random chances. They've brought a profit mindset forward to mimic the the physical version and the likes of Hearthstone.\n-And mentioning Hearthstone brings up the next issue. I assumed they would have two-headed giant like in all previous versions, but they have removed two-headed giant and made no attempt to make new playing formats. For anyone familiar with Magic this is a travesty given the number of game formats they developed over the years, from three headed, Emperor, and even their mis-balanced Arch-enemy from Magic:Planeswalker a few versions back. Co-op was and is possible in Magic, but they have ignored it. My only guess is the programing got too hard and they wanted to just do simple AI programing.\n-The small issue is the extensive graphics they've addded to the game. The board shifts and moves each time you go into your attack phase. They've added fluff that wastes time and burns polygons.\n\nSo I can't recommend this game since I know I might play the singleplayer campaign once through and then shelf it for the lack of dynamic multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crafterod/recommended/255420/","crafterod","Krafty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crafterod/","489 products in account","After seeing a lot of terrible information being passed around in the knee-jerked negative reviews I felt compelled to write this. Although this game is flawed and not as good as previous editions I think it's only fair to actually discuss the issues factually rather than react emotionally to some of the negatives.\n\nI have played every single Duels of the Planeswalkers since they first came out and (so far) I have actually enjoyed this one the most. However my aim with this review is to try and offer a different outlook on certain contentious aspects of the game because I don't beleive it is anywhere near as bad as people are making it out.\n\nBefore I mention some of the issues in the game I'd like to give one piece of advice, when you start the game you are asked what colour you want your first deck to be and then once you answer this you are given another choice that will determine the content of your deck. For example I picked black and my second option was red and I got a rakdos deck based on\nsacrifice, zombies and some low curve red stuff. -THIS CHOICE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT-\nYou will be stuck using this deck for a while until you can unlock enough cards to make a deck of different colours or themes. This was a pretty terrible design choice as it won't let you change and it doesn't really stress the implications of your choice either. The game really suffers from a lack of information about how the deck building and card unlocking works and i would strongly recommend you read into how it works a bit before starting. (ALSO, you can skip the tutorial there's an option near the bottom left of the screen I saw some people complaining that you could not skip)\n\nMost people's biggest complaint about the previous versions of Dotp is that you have always lacked the ability to fully create your own decks; now you can. You can create a deck with any of the cards in your collection which can be obtained through playing the single player campaign. There are 6 sets based around different planes in the Magic multiverse and the cards that you unlock for them are also loosely based on the corresponding sets, apart from one. There is a "Premium" set of cards that can -only- be obtained through buying virtual booster packs and this is where the main controversy lies. I'd like to supply some further information about these sets. Each set has a number of cards within them that you can unlock here are the totals for each plane or set.\n\n(Also note that you can obviously get multiples of the same card I have just looked purely at the individual cards)\n\n49 - Zendikar\n49 - Shandalar\n49 - Theros\n49 - Innistrad\n59 - Ravnica\n[43 - Premium cards]\n\nSo that's 255 cards available without spending a single penny on micro transactions. 255 out of a total 298 cards in the game which is ~85%. Now you also have the option to fully unlock these sets through micro transactions but that is -entirely optional- as you can unlock them within the game. You do so by playing the story battles that put you against certain themed enemies in different scenarios and a win will award you with one booster pack that contains cards from the corresponding set. In addition to this there is an option named "explore [set name]" that will put you in a random battle against an opponent themed to match the set. (Think like playing an rpg with random encounters or Pokémon walking through grass). Winning these battles  will also award you with a booster pack and this seems to be the method you would use to "farm" the cards from set you can repeat this process -infinitely-. This does appear to be a bit on the grindy side but it is also giving you a reason to play the single player against the AI. Something else that was pointed out to me was how the AI decks get to use lots of cards that you don't have access to. This was definitely the case in the previous games but it's more of a glaring issue in dotp15 due to availability of a deck builder. It's pretty frustrating that some really interesting cards were coded into the game but for whatever reason you don't get to use them (you can't even "pay to win" for them).\n\nTo address the premium set, I have not bought any of it and nor do I plan to but I took a quick look into the pricing and the way it works and found the following. The premium boosters are semi-randomized, you will never open a card that you already have the maximum playable number of. So there is a limit to how many premium boosters you would need to buy and that limit is 14, which is £16 in total. I have had a look through the cards included in the set and on the whole it doesn't appear to be any more or less powerful than the other cards in the game. However, it clearly gives you an advantage having access to these cards as you have more choice in your deck building and sometimes that can be an upper hand against an opponent online. To speak less objectively here I don't think duels has ever been a competitive game, it's great fun multiplayer with friends but there's no real ladder or reason to take it too seriously especially in 2014 where the online game was full of hackers. This brings us to another issue though, Dotp15 does not have any additional multiplayer modes like two headed giant, archenemy or planechase. It only has free for all supporting up to 4 players. This sucks hopefully they will release some other options later.\n\nThe final aspect of the game I have seen people complaining about is the interface. The interfaces of the older dotp were just absolutely awful. 13 improved it a bit but not much,\n14 did a better job but still fell short of fixing the unclean feel that it had and people complained about it. In m15 they have obviously tried to take these complaints into account\nand it looks great. It's sharp it's nicely animated it's clean and it's clear.\nHowever it functions... weirdly I don't know how else to put it. The menu's still feel clunky and the animations, although they look nice, feel like they might be lagging the navigation. It's an interface clearly designed to feel sexy on a touch screen and maybe it does but on the pc with mouse and keyboard it's a bit wonky -but it is not game breaking-. As for the actual gameplay and in-match interface I feel like it's smoother, more responsive and clear. The mechanics of the game work perfectly and the AI is pretty decent on the whole, I've seen it do a few weird things (cursed itself and shocked its own creature in response to my shock) but other than that no problems in this department.\n\n\nTL;DR\nTo summarize, I think that for £6.99 (or equivalent) you really can't complain too much at all. It's a game with flaws that vary to differing degrees but for its price I think it's great.\nIf you want to mess around with some cool -casual- magic deck building in a limited environment against the AI or with friends I would strongly recommend to give it a shot. Unlocking the card sets is rewarding and fun and can be a great time sink. However, if you are looking (for some reason) to take this game super seriously and play at a high level in multiplayer I would not recommend it, you'd be better just playing something else like "real" magic or magic the gathering online (good luck).","July 16, 2014","true","54.0"," 238 of 424 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","238","424","0","13"

I know there have been complaints, but I loved the single player campaign and such - just a nice way to pass time and destress. I have bought all and was planning to buy the game every year - but because of this one, I won't. I refuse to give them my money now. I'll explain why.\n\nThe core is the same. It's not a AAA game, the animation is so-so, but it's Magic, we all know it and love it. The cards and decks are great.\n\nHowever - NOT when you have to GRIND for your deck. That's right. Forget the previous games, with this one you have to either buy or grind boosters until you collected enough for a pre-made deck. Insane. It makes the campaign and multiplayer rather boring - because you can't switch decks as easy and change tactics were as appropriate.\n\nIt's an insanely greedy, unneccesary step, only to bring in more money because the grinding is painstakingly boring.\n\nThere are more complaints such as mediocre storyline, The menu is horrific. Looks pretty, but the usability is horrible, there's just no oversight.\n\nThe worst complaint I have is for the expansion where you play as Garruk. Pretty cool - only for the fact if you follow the single player story line you can NOT change decks. You play only with Garruk's deck. And guess what - they made your opponents in a way they COUNTER your deck.\n\nAnd you cannot change! This is a classic example of extremely poor gamedesign. It has become a game of luck. You have to get JUST the right cards and hope your opponent (AI) doesn't get theirs in order to win. F*ck being clever or involving strategy, them not allowing you to pick your own deck was the worst they could do. In the expansion it's all luck and no skill - which is extremely poor as game mechanic, but even more so in a strategic game as Magic the Gathering.\n\nIt's sad. I really had fun for a while with the other parts. Them going for the option to cash in doesn't sit right with me as life long fan. I don't want ingame transactions to make it more fun with Magic. I paid for the game - let me enjoy all of it damn it.\n\nJust play the old games - and ignore this one and future games. I wish I had listened.","February 10","false","27.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

In fact, I played it a few days before the release of 2015 to get used to MTG again. It had its flaws, including but not limited to: a mediocre campaign, unbalanced decks and somewhat poor AI. But it was still really fun, with 2HG and most of the decks having strong themes that were flavorful and unique. A variety of cards were included, all sorts of color combinations, and 2013 even had a rainbow deck that was very strong apparently.\n\nAnd then there's DOTP 2015. God. I literally didn't get to play it, it crashes on startup constistently. After browsing reviews and various websties, there seems to be a consensus that the game has poor optimization, the UI is poor, and the deckbuilding is practically imprisoned in the Helvault that Avacyn for whatever reason doesn't want you getting into because the starter decks are terrible and the AI decks ACTUALLY HAVE SYNERGY. And the lack of other modes doesn't help, and even if they existed you would have to complete the campaign to get to it.\n\nIf you want to buy it, don't. Instead walk across a highway on rush hour while pouring tar on your feet and walking a Chihuahua with rabies.

While it is there, the card pool is extremely limited.  So limited that you'll end up building the standard archetypes anyway because there's just not that much flexibility for synergy available.  Even if you buy the "Complete Bundle", or the card collections, you will be missing a portion of the available cards.  Those cards - the more powerful cards in the game, of course - are locked away behind Premium Packs, which you have to pay extra for and are, of course, random.  Beyond this, there are several cards with art and rules in the game that are locked away from the player to ever get, even with premium packs.  They removed several game types from previous games as well.\n\nDon't buy this game, especially if you already have one of the old versions.

As someone who has played all of the DotP games, this is probably the clunkiest release since the first game. I mean, if you can get past that, it's still pretty fun, but I wouldn't go out of the way for it. If you're looking for a decent MtG game to while away your time, I would personally recommend DotP 2013 or 2014 over this one. If you enjoyed those, you might like this one, but I'd advise you to wait for a sale.\n\nFor one, the menus are AWFUL. They're a pain to navigate, somewhat unresponsive, and the design direction just so unnecessary. Thankfully, the main dueling UI is very nice and clean, though it also suffers from a lack of responsiveness. The AI is still horribly flawed and I've noticed that it still likes to "cheat" in cards that it shouldn't have in it's hand, namely spells that had already been cast the maximum times for the deck in use and had never been retrieved from the graveyard. The game also looks to favor customers who pay for card unlocks. All cards can still be unlocked, but it'll take a metric ton of time and grinding to do so.\n\nIf you can get past the serious flaws of the game, it's still quite enjoyable and it's still a fun and cheap way to enjoy Magic without dropping a fortune on the physical cards or MtGO.","July 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I bought the expanded edition so after beating Innistrad I had access to a whole bunch of cards and could make my own decks, which is supposed to be a advantage of this game over previous versions.

I picked up the 2015 edition and the expansion a few weeks ago from a Humble Bundle -- it was the main reason I picked up the bundle actually.\n\nI kind of regret buying this game though. Whatever Wizards of the Coast changed between this year and last, it's made the game really frustrating to play. I am by no means a great Magic player, but neither am I totally terrible. So, y'know, I expect to lose a match or two as I figure out the AI's deck and playstyle, and adjust my own to suit. But something seems incredibly wrong to me when I go up against an AI opponent and lose eight or ten times in a row.\n\nPart of the problem, to me, is the way the game gives you more cards to build decks with -- you complete (or skip, I guess) the tutorial and choose a starter deck (there are, I think, 10 starter decks? One of each mono-color and then various permutations of color-combo decks). You play through the first match and when you (finally) win, you get a booster pack. For the first few matches, you can't even make use of these cards because deck-building isn't unlocked until you beat the first "plane". So you slog through the first plane, playing each match over and over again hoping you get lucky this time.\n\nIf you played the 2014 edition of the game, you'll get to the last match, the Planeswalker/boss match, and finally win and get all excited because you're expecting to unlock a whole new deck to play with. Nope. No new preconstructed decks unlock. Only booster packs. And if you get all the cards in one of the starter decks through booster packs, then you'll see them pop up in your deckbuilder as starting points for new decks. But new cards only come from booster packs.\n\nAnd that's the biggest problem. Your collection doesn't grow fast enough to enable you to tweak your deck effectively to combat the sometimes radically different playstyles between two matches.\n\nThe other problem is that the AI's decks all seem to be some degree of overpowered; they've all got cards and combos that seem miles above whatever the player has available, so too many matches comes down to dumb luck -- each match is somewhat scripted; the AI is drawing the same cards in the same order every time (if I'm not mistaken), so you just have to hope that your randomly shuffled deck gets you the cards you need to throw wrenches into the AI's plan and keep them from playing those cards and combos. 60% of the time, you don't get lucky.\n\nOf course, there's also the online component. Could be fun if it didn't require slogging through the tedious and frustrating grind of the single-player campaign -- or, I suppose, pay for the collection unlock -- in order to unlock better cards so you can stand a chance. The Quick Match matchmaker doesn't seem to take skill and deck power into account when it matches opponents up.\n\nAll in all, a terrible entry into the franchise. The UI is ugly and hard to navigate, but that's overshadowed by the massive hits to playability. Buy one of the older editions if you're after a fun single-player MtG experience.

It is much more difficult and focused much more on selling you product; many of the cards gotten from premium boosters (which reward cards at random) are flat-out better than what you can get playing the game (those boosters can award cards that can't be gotten otherwise).\n\nThere are serious issues playing the game at the start  You'll be locked into a single deck for the first campaign, with no ability to "grind" more cards for your collection (as the "Explore" options aren't unlocked and scenario opponents do not give rewards on subsequent matches).  Effectively, if you are not able to win the first couple of campaign scenarios with the deck you picked, you will not be able to proceed, or even collect cards you paid for (which are rewarded at the end of the first campaign).\n\nIf you really want to play MTG on the computer either play one of the older Duels games or play MTGO.  This game tries to cover both the experience the previous Duels games had and MTGO without being either and is just not as entertaining as any of them.","July 20, 2014","false","38.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I love Magic the Gathering.  I have never played Magic The Gathering Online.  I play the real card game and I've played all of the steam released Magic games.  Also this is pretty much a single player review, I don't do multiplayer personally. That being said.\n\nTLDR Summary: Brutal AI, Not instant acess for content you paid for, Clunky menu navagation, micro-transactions, unable to get certian content without micro-transactions, Developers don't care arn't listening, No 2-headed giant, and the computer has acess to cards you do not.  Buy the older games.\n\nDo NOT buy this game.  It thrives on micro-transactions and micro-payments.  The other games did thrive on DLC, but, there was a limit and if you waited long enough it would come along reasonably priced.  There is nothing reasonable about this game.\n\nThe menu interfaces are loud and have this weird fog outlaying it, which takes up alot of processing power to show (The game being what it is), and its confusing, there is alot of rooting around to find what your getting to, like if your in the middle of a campeign and go fiddle with your deck, you have to manually go back through the campeign.  It's a hot mess to navagate.  The other magic games had this but it was smooth and streamlined to a degree, you didn't get lost doing it.\n\nWhen you do buy DLC content or pre-order your not allowed to access any of it, the game forces you to do the tutorial, which is fair enough for new players, then it forces you to do the first area of the campeign before it gives you the stuff you bought already.  Which is time consuming and pointless.\nSpeaking of the above when you come out of the tutorial you are given acess to ten Ravnica decks, One deck for each of the two color combinations, you are not allowed to look inside them and have to take them on face value depending which two colors you like to play with the most, from my understanding each deck is crap and isn't properly balanced you need to keep restarting duels to get a mirical hand and pray for lucky draws.\n\nThe AI is downright unforgiving aswell, and seems to cheat, not as much as in games of this franchise previously, but the game seems to be able to draw just what it needs when it needs to screw you over.  It can put you in your place in a manner I come to believe the game is resenting me playing it.  Even on the lowest difficulty the game seems unforgiving.  I always start low and then increase the more and longer I play to ramp up the challenge.  I dread to think of ramping up the difficulty.  (I kinda invision it with you starting a duel and it telling you that you lost by default.)\n\nNow lets talk about the big one, the fact you can build your own deck from scratch.  2014 had a minor version of this, which wasn't well implimented.  In this one... its even worse.  They do give you a good chunk of cards to play with, and it goes pretty far back in the magic timeline (Still no Mirrodian, or Time Sprial, or further back), but it gives you compleate and utter crap to work with.  I have to keep tweaking and tweaking and tweaking to get my deck juuuust right and I still get pummeled by the computer.  While I am not a world reknowned magic champion, I do think I can throw together a pretty mean deck in real life, and I honestly believe the game gives you crap to work with, even if you do buy all the cards.  In the previous games the decks they offered were fun, and intresting and designed by professionals that you could tweak to make it feel like your own.  When playing those I kinda wanted something like this, but with this poor implimentation I honestly yearn for the good old days.\n\nAnother thing about Deck Building, the game determines if your deck is 'valid' or not.  If your deck is not valid you cannot use it, nor can you give it to a computer to use.  So your deck needs to be just perfect or the computer tells you to fix it.  I tried to make a deck spesficly to do pratice duels with, the computer wouldn't let me use the deck I made because it wasn't valid, and I had to go in and out twenty or so times before I had something it would let the computer equip, and then it cheated so bad it wasn't even a test, nor fun.\n\nAlso If you do buy the DLC the game still snags you with microtransactions.  Or if you want to grind yourself silly and save a few bucks (More power to you.) you still have to pay for premium boosters.  Now you may be asking what are premium boosters.  Premium boosters are boosters that cost $1.99 in game and give you ten cards and the only known way to acess them is to have preordered (You get one free, also you get a second premium pack free if you have magic 2014), you get ten cards, like a regular booster pack, six commons, three uncommon and one rare, and Premium has it's own set, so you cannot grind for premium cards, you have to throw real money at the game.  Some say Magic is an expensive hobby, this is true, but I play a computer game to simulate it, if I am going to waste this kinda money I will go to the store and buy a real pack.\n\nAlso the AI has acess to cards you do not.  I see this as a grossly unfair advantage, the games are there, programed into the game, and we, the players cannot acess them?  I always said in the older games it would be fun to mess with the AI's set decks.  The AI has had some pretty fun decks in the past games, this one seems more unfair with the brutal AI, but they seem to be able to acess cards you can't.  I view this as highly unfair, and unpleasent.  The cards are already programed in, we should have access to them even more so when the entire game is rigged around building your own deck!\n\nAlthough if you ARE going to buy this game and you are a hardcore player of magic.  I suggest buying the compleate edition, unlocks all the crap and saves on grinding.  It is also cheaper than buying each peice individually through DLC or microtransactions.   Though if you want my opinion, save your money, or buy Magic 2012-2014 and enjoy those.\n\nAlso from my understanding the developers don't listen, don't care, and don't even visit steam.  So they put out crap they got their money and Im sure they are going to be putting out more crap DLC and more crap micro-transactions like premium 2,3,4,79\n\nI'll try to bully through it, try to see if it goes anywere or gets better later in the game.  I honestly, seriously doubt it does.  I want to like it.  It offers features I, and many other players have wanted, but it impliments them so poorly, and so expensivly, its just not worth anyones time.\n\nSeriously this is one of the worst purcheses on steam I have ever made.","July 18, 2014","false","5.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

If it were not for me having already unlocked the multiplayer, my desk would be split in half and pieces of my mouse would be embedded in the drywall for how hard I would have smashed the "delete local content" button.\n\nThe reason for my rage is the single player campaign. Put simply, it is god-awful. It is terrible. It is horrifically unfair and completely stupid. You will have the bone-stock vanilla uber-generic weak deck up against ridiculously powerful enemies. You will lose and lose and lose and lose unless you just happen to start with a great hand AND your opponent simultaneously gets a bad one.\n\nLet me know if the following scenario sounds fun: You go to the local game shop where Magic players gather, you buy a $10 starter deck, and then sit down to battle a pro-level player who has a masterfully-built multicolored deck filled with holographic, prismatic, epically-rare legendary creatures.\n\nSound fun? NO!?? Well, gasp and shock! OH, UNKNOWABLE UNIVERSE! I would have to take off my shoes to count how many things I would rather do than slog through that garbage. I'm honestly having more fun typing up this review than I did playing that stupid campaign.\n\nYou might be thinking "well just play multiplayer!" and you're right, to a point. The multiplayer can certainly be fun (assuming you're against a player with a similarly-terrible deck), but unfortunately, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE CAMPAIGN TO UNLOCK MULTIPLAYER!!! 4 tough battles, one of whom is a boss.\n\nMagic is a multiplayer game. Magic has ALWAYS been a multiplayer game. The card game version has never been anything BUT a multiplayer game. Before the elctronic version, it was literally impossible to NOT play with other people. So kudos to the devs for locking the main feature that the game was built around and that 99% of all players want behind hours and hours of campaign-fueled frustration and nonsense.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun, but the rest of the game is terrible. There are SO many other card games to play with friends (many of them free) that unless you can pick this game up for a couple bucks or you have a superhuman amount of patience, don't even make direct eye-contact with it.","January 25, 2015","false","7.0"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","27","43","14","19"

This time I said to myself "dude, preorder it, 30 bucks includes 5 complete collections!" That was one of the worst decission I made in my game-buying life, if not the worst (right after Fable 3). I wanted to start with good cards right after the first match. I didn't start with good cards, I didn't even know which cards had the starting decks.\n\nPros:\n\n- More options to customize your decks.\n- Higher AI level.\n\nEnd of the pros.\n\nCons:\n\n- The game content said "Complete collection", which doesn't mean complete. It means "the complete list of the cards we selected". You get 6-10 colour cards from each collection (6 green cards from Ravnica, 6 from Theros, etc...). If this won't be enough, selected cards are a laugh at your face. And if that won't be enough, you need to fight 6 matches with your starting deck (should I say di ck instead?) to unlock them. And finally, you won't get 4 of each, some will get 4, some 2. Sad, very very sad. Full edition NOT RECCOMENDED UNDER ANY CIRCUNSTANCES, QUARANTINE.\n- Menus are slow as hell for some reason.\n- Slowest game of all those DOTP series.\n- Random crashes. Game crashes slowly too.\n- Pay 2 win system, so you figure out where this is going.\n- No fun cards at all. Standard standard gameplay, some good picks for the make up.\n\n\nDo not expect to find:\n\n- Coolest cards from other DOTP games. They are by far much much worse.\n- Fun right after starting. Farming cards from the ridiculous starting decks could be a pain in the ♥♥♥ (not for me, cause I paid the money for non complete complete collections)\n\n\nA complete waste of money, should I have read the forums first.

Menus are a little faster but need a total redesign as they're still a bulky slog. Deck equipping was and is a dumb idea.\n\nThe expansion has 51 damn cards.

It was worth the price I paid for it at least, since I got it for "free" after I bought a couple of premium boosters before they became a multiplayer only reward.\n\nStill a bad game.

Sealed =/= Constructed, but apparently nobody told Stainless. If you like slow paced games where you drop 1/1 creatures waiting for a 7 mana 4/4 bomb, you're in the right place.

True, they did add full deck building, but they have destroyed almost all other aspects of the game in the process. They removed the 2-Headed Giant game mode, making any games with friends Free-for-All. They have reworked the controls so that there is no pulling a card back in that you might have accidently clicked on. And if you use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in, it won't allow you to zoom back out again most of the time.

I'm a mediorce magic player. The last games had some hard decks and the AI was pretty good.\n\nThis deck is a step in reverse. The AI has made a couple easy mistakes despite me being on the toughest difficulty. The design team took the 'play stuff after combat' too far. It has failed some game winning turns by using auras after combat. Even if it were playing really defensively, I've seen a few screw ups.\n\nThe biggest is I can't complete the first part of the campaign. At all. I can't beat Avacyn. She has a much better mana curve than I do and a far better deck. Even trying to get the perfect hand, the Green/Red deck is just so bad, it's impossible to do anything.\n\nI suspect this game is Pay 2 Win. I don't have the shop available yet here, but I get the strong feeling that if the FIRST CAMPAIGN is impossible to beat, the rest of the game is going to require I have a lot more boosters.\n\nI can't recommend this game at all.

Even as a learning tool, this version may leave you bitter and disilusioned in magic as a whole.\n\nAfter the first deck you recieve, all other cards have to be obtained through booster packs, which you earn by playing. However, the idea of booster packs is only an illusion. You recieve the cards in a set order depending on which plane you play on. So if you want Brimaz, you have to unlock every other card on Theros because he is the last. And after you unlock every card on a plane, THERE IS NO REASON TO CONTINUE PLAYING THERE. You cannot gain additional copies of cards, so you'll only ever get one Brimaz.\n\nAdditionally, not all cards can be found in free booster packs. Some cards can ONLY be obtained through "premium" packs bought for real money. These cards include:\n-Kozelik\n-Stoneforge Mystic\n-Maelstrum Archangel\n-Kitesail Apprentice (Really?)\n-Blasting Station\n\nBeing able to construct your own decks is supposed to be a major draw this time around, however it came at the expense of all pre-made decks. You can ONLY use the first deck you recieve (nearly all commons and uncommons) and decks you've built out of a pool that only reaches 300 cards. This ends up with you having a lot less variety and synergy in your decks, especially if you're new to the game. Additionally the constructed deck mechanic fails in that you're basically building a 60 card sealed deck to face against pre-made decks until you reach the point where you've unlocked enough to make a confident constructed deck... but at that point you've probably beaten most of the single player campaign.\n\nAdditionally there are cards programmed into the game that you as the player cannot use. TONS OF THEM. Now, older versions of the game have all done this, it's not new. BUT in those versions it kinda made sense as all you had was pre-made decks and perhaps those cards didn't fit in any of them. But now when you can make your own decks, every card programmed into the game should be avalible to you at some point. There's no reason not to give the players cards like Grey Merchent and Honor of the Pure when you already put them in the game!\n\nThere's no secondary game mode this time around, such as Planechase or Archenemy. Also gone are the entertaining and sometimes even tricky challenges that would give you one turn and a set of cards to get out of a bad situation.\n\nOn a plus side, the game looks very pretty. Backgrounds and menus look very stylish as do all the booster pack arts. The downside is this comes at the expense of actual functionality. Even the escape menu during a game is a mess, and is really more form coming before function.\n\nThe game runs slow unless you turn off shadows and the audio is always popping for me.\n\nThe game is also very buggy. Often, when too many triggers are going on the stack and some form of lifegain is involved the game will break and make whoever was gaining life invincible. You can tell this has happened because their life total won't change. I've had to happen to the AI as well as myself.\n\nAdditionally a lot of cards don't work as they should (Ajani's pridemate still only gets 1 counter when there are multiple lifelinking creatures dealing damage) and targeting creatures during combat can get messed up by some strange bug that returns a "cannot target creatures in that zone" error.\n\nSo, once again, do not purchase this game. Purchase duels 2014 or 2013, they are much better and worth it especially if you're trying to get into magic.","July 17, 2014","false","10.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

So, despite a few shortcuts provided by the bottom-right corner avatar pop-up menu, there is a lot of unnecessary action required when navigating the menu.\n\nA minor gripe for experienced MTG players is that you're being forced to at least partially go through a tutorial session that explains the most basic game mechanics. Not being adequately informed that the deck you choose to play the campaign with is going to be the deck you are stuck with until you manage to unlock a fair amount of cards that will allow you to adjust the deck to your liking, is an unnecessary nuisance that should annoy both experienced and inexperienced players alike. While these two gripes are not a deal-breaker per se, they do make you question the developers' design choices. If these choices were made for their for 1st MTG:DotP games, they might have been understandable; however, for them to make these decisions for a 5th incarnation of the game is incomprehensible. The design curve for an annual game series such as this should easily show an upward curve, and not a downward one.\n\nSome cards can only be obtained by purchasing premium boosters, and you will have to spend at least as much as you spent on the base game to unlock all of those. While that is a pity, it is another pity to find out that many of the great cards played by the AI are not at all available for the player.\n\nThe biggest fun should be found in deck-building, and then trying that deck out against real opponents. However, despite its size, the card pool is a bit underwhelming in terms of what it has to offer and generally steers the player in the same direction; fast aggro-decks. While there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of opportunity for creative deck designs as of yet, seasoned players of this game series will be aware that more DLC is to be expected, which might spice up the deck design possibilities some more.\n\nSo in conclusion, full deck building is the long-awaited great step forward, and it certainly adds alot to the fun of the game, especially in multiplayer games, and with that step it's finally approaching the feeling of the real game, but it's very likely that we'll only see the proper implementation of it in the next incarnation of this game.","July 26, 2014","false","103.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

While it does finally let you build your own deck and manually change how many lands are in said deck, this year's version is quite stripped of content. 2HG, Planechase, and Archenemy were taken out (or just never implemented) for whatever insane reason, sealed play  is nonexistant, and no challenge modes.\n\nAnd don't buy the Complete Bundle or any Card Collections, you will regret it. Why? I will tell you why: by winning games you get booster packs which gets you more cards that you can use to further customise your deck. It takes time and effort, and if you buy the Complete Bundle or the Card Collections you miss out on a big chunk of content.\n\nThe game is also has its fair share of bugs and glitches, as well as having a feeling of not being polished. I get random framerate drops for no apparent reason; I had to go and manually change the resolution to 1366x768 in the config file because there isnt an option for it, and the menus are lackluster.\n\nI give this game a 2/5 for now, until they send out updates and hopefully release more content.

Also the whole dlc costs even more than the game itself, no joke.\n\n- No 2-Headed Giant: there is no reason at all for this removal, the offcial comment from Wotc was that only a niche played the mode (?!?!?), probably the real reason is that they want to add it in another dlc and make you pay extra money.\n\n- Cards implemented used only by the PC.\nThe cards are there ready and working but nope you cant use them, only the AI can. This issue has been pointed out a lot but there is stll no official reason for this.\n\n- Microtransactions and balance.\nIf you are familiar with diablo 3, the game was ruined by the choice of balancing the whole game around the AH. In the same way this game is ruined by its design around microtransactions:\n1) Grindfest to unlock the cards. In this edition wotc push hard to make you buy even the unnecessary DLCs.\nEspecially with some of the starting decks that are no where near the powerlevel of the past editions the gind will be real. A solution can be to lover the difficulty to mage level to speed up this process but yeah.. ask yourself if a good game design would require something like this.\n2) P2W.\nThere are pay2win components where paying extra money give access to more premium cards and not only to cosmetics like in the past editions.\nThe base game is just there to tell you "Hey spend more money!!" and playing it gives you the feeling that it is a rushed money grab.\n\nA quote from the Lead Designer Nik Davidson (From his reddit AMA):\n"(1)One of my foremost goals on Duels was to control and minimize the impact of the Premium boosters on the overall game, (2)while still providing good value to players who wanted them."\n(1) Mission failed.\n(2) !!!!! "players who wanted them" And they removed the 2HG Because "was a niche feature"!!! Ask yourself if there are more people who want the 2hg or people who want to pay more?\n(Here the point isn't the extra 20€ but the bs in the head designer thought.)\n\n- The menu is slow and buggy.\nIt is probably designed for tablets and the port sucks.\n1) Super slow screen transitions.\n2) Unresponsive clicking.\n3) Bright white background.\nA couple of comments from the forum:\n"Now I'm blind, too much white screens in my eyes...."\n"Pointless "equip a deck" requirement making you go all the way back to the deck creation menu in between games."\n"This menu is absolute garbage how they could even come up with something so messed up!!!"\n\n- The multiplayer:\n1) There are pay2win components.\n2) Your opponent can pause the game forever and go afk waiting for you to give up. The fact that this is possible just illustrates how poorly the game is designed.\nThere are people that when you play a premium card will accuse you of pay2win (sadly rightfully) and pause the game forever to "punish you". I know this because I got a premium booster pack with the preorder and since the cards are obiuosly broken as ♥♥♥♥ I put some of them into a deck I used online...\n3) The blocking system is messed up. When someone attacks you with more than 10 creatures some of them can't be effectively blocked because the UI sucks.\n4) If your opponent leave the game the AI take over and you'll be trapped in playing a match vs the AI. They already had this problem resolved in the past editions but who knows how this time they "forgot" to put the option of conceding a duel.\n\nUpdate 07/08/2014\n\n- Completing the game:\n1) A bug today still not fixed prevent you form obtaining the "Explorer Title" and completing the game 100%.\n2) For those who buy the game only for the achievements there is a 100 online win achievement and the grind will take a good time, especially be prepared to meet:\na) People with full pay2win decks.\nb) People that when they are about to lose freeze the game forever waiting for you to leave..\n\n- False Advertisement:\nThe Complete Edition is not complete at all so if you would do the huge mistake to buy it for 35€ you would still have to pay the 28€ for the premium cards spending a total of 63€. Let's be real, this game isn't even worth the base 10€ and there are people who were deceived into paying 63€ for it!!\n\nTL;DR:\nDotp: another good franchise ruined by the greed. This game is garbage.\n\nUpdate 19/11/2014\nI got the expansion for free since i had the preorder and the 2014 edition. The expansion add more cards to the pool and remove the premium boosters but the game is the same... and still no 2hg...","July 19, 2014","false","39.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I have a disscussion up regarding what happened and it seems this has happened to many others as well. Waste of money and time. I'm serverely disappointed in WotC as they are offering NO support of any kind for the glitch. If you want a better, free MTG experience check out Untap.in it has all cards available and free deck construction.\n\nLets just step away from my terrible bug experience.. surely the game was good before my data got wiped right..? No? Damn.\nDeck construction is a joke, limiting the player to 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 mythic of an y one card? Why? What is the purpose? You want long games with decks full of unplayable cards? No 2HG which is the sole reason I bought this game, and no reason or indication given at all. Premium cards that can ONLY be gained by spending REAL money. A tedius process for unlocking cards, remember how in previous games you only had to unlock the cards for decks you wanted to use? Well not anymore now you have to unlock ALL of them. Still no Planeswalkers and we are just now getting dual lands.. and by that I only mean guildgates. This game feels stripped and pushed to sell DLC and Micro Transactions.

It will often immediately tap you out of one color in order to pay colorless costs.\n\nThe interface has obviously been designed for tablet use but in the process has been made clunky for traditional PC play.

Overall the experience is very watered down and I find myself getting more frustrated with the game then actually enjoying it. I get that DOTP is suppose to be the gateway to playing MTGO (MODO) or the actual card game, however this is a poor way to do it.\n\nI'm a long time Magic player (20 Years) and I literally struggled to beat the game on Planeswalker difficulty but not because the computer played better, but just the power level imbalance. Honestly the cards we are given to use are a mash up of some of the more popular Standard (Type 2) cards mixed in with a few but not overpowered Modern cards. However... the computer gets acess to a HUGE pool of cards we don't get that are grossly over powered.\n\nExample: Lillana played 2 Demonic tutors on me in the same turn ~ Really... TWO! that's not even legal in Vintage (Type 1) less on a level where we have no where near the power level to compete with this and the game seems to more of a luck factor then simply playing the right cards.\n\nThe Interface sucks ~ its slow, laggy and sometimes unresponsive to my choices. With the Machine I am running, NOTHING SHOULD BE RUNNING SLOW! 8 Cores @ 4.0 Ghz, 8 GB of DDR3 Ram, Nvidia GeForce 760, Navigating around just seems clumky compared to 2014, not sure what they did but its not working right,\n\nNot sure why but I cant go above 23Hz... well I can select above it and it changes it but it changes it back from 60hz the moment i get into a game (Bad coding maybe?)\n\nLack of modes is still an issue ~ we had a lot of great modes from the previous games (2HG. Archenemy, Planechase) so why are we limited to single and multiplayer games? Newsflash Wizards... NO ONE PLAYS MULTIPLAYER MAGIC UNLESS ITS COMMNADER!\n\nSo why not commander?\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHighlights\n\nPros:\n-Finally full deck customization\n-Lots of computer oppoents\n-Limits on Cards to add a new experience\n\nCons:\n-Bad interface\n-Extreme lack of cards despite many more have been programmed.\n-Lack of Modes (Only single and Multiplayer ~ No 2HG and others)\n-Difficulty Imbalance and bad AI (Seen the computer kill one of his own creatures for no reason on planeswalker)\n-Poor shuffle simulation (I shouldn't be getting mana screwed/Flooded so often in a deck that curves out on 3 thats is running 26 lands just becauase I can rarely get past 2 lands 18 cards deep into my deck)\n-Random crashes\n-Needs to be more like the Yu-Gi-Oh!

The problem with that is that you have a insanely small selection of cards at the start and once you finished the Campaign you cant unlock more without paying.\n\nUnlocking Cards, due to the randomness of the boosterpacks, can leave you with nothing to really add to your Deck.\nWhich wouldn´t be that much of a problem if you could just get more and more Booster packs. But you only get a set amount.

They finally added the ability to make your own, custom decks. It's really fun to unlock the cards and build your own decks. Although, everything else about this game is worse compared to the previous versions of the game. There are 14 premium booster packs that you have pay $2 each to get those premium cards. The menu systems is terrible and not meant for mouse. When you play a multiplayer game, it doesn't take you back to the lobby when the match is over. Instead, it takes you to the main menu so you can't rematch a play. They took out 2 headed giant, which is a coop mode that was really fun in the previous games.

One might expect this to lead to a wider variety of decks seeing play, and to allow for greater individual self-expression. To an extent, this is the case. In practice, however, the fact that any card available to one deck is available to all decks means that, for balance reasons, Duels 2015's card pool ends up feeling somewhat bland and mechanically tame by comparison to some of the more exciting and idiosyncratic decks available in past games (such as my personal favorites, the "Up to Mischief" Faeries deck and the "Lords of Darkness" Demons deck from Duels 2014). That said, the open card pool was executed about as well as it could be; while there are a few deck archetypes that are clearly much stronger than others, that's the case no matter how you're playing Magic, and the higher-rarity (and therefore, theoretically, higher-power) cards being restricted to fewer copies in a deck than cards of lower rarities helps keep things unpredictable and forces you to play a little more thoughtfully.\n\nWith only a few exceptions, I found the AI battles in the single-player campaign also less interesting than the single-player encounters in previous Duels games. I did, however, appreciate the "Explore [Plane]" function, which added a quite large chunk of content to the game without tediously bulking out the single-player campaign.\n\nDuels 2015's multiplayer function is actually a step backwards from the fairly basic multiplayer options of Duels 2014. The popular Two-Headed Giant team play mode is no longer available; the only options are two-player duels and three- or four-player free-for-alls. A minor loss, weighed objectively, but it stings disproportionately. I also, for the life of me, cannot figure out how to make the "invite player" function work for multiplayer matchmaking.\n\nDuels 2015's user interface is, frankly, obnoxious. While the animations for the various menus may be slick and polished, they also add quite a bit to the time necessary to navigate them. It quickly becomes tedious. Additionally, it is frequently unresponsive to mouse-clicks, requiring several clicks of a button or rolls of the mouse wheel to have any effect. Something as simple and routine as clicking "Start" on the game's initial loading screen to access the main menu should not be an effort-intensive chore, but it is. If mere clunkiness was not enough to condemn this game, I have on more than one occasion actually had played cards not take effect, which is absurd.\n\nMany people have complained that Duels 2015 is "pay-to-win," in that the cards available only in the Premium Boosters that must be purchased with cash rather than unlocked through play offer deck-builders a substantial advantage. It's true that there are several cards only available through Premium Boosters that are quite useful, but at best the Premium collection takes bad decks up to mediocre; it is trivial to build a competitive deck with only the base collection. Especially with that in mind, Premium Boosters are unquestionably overpriced.\n\nIn summary, while there are definitely worse ways to spend $9.99, just buy Duels 2014 instead.","August 1, 2014","false","238.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Overall the experience is very watered down and I find myself getting more frustrated with the game then actually enjoying it. I get that DOTP is suppose to be the gateway to playing MTGO (MODO) or the actual card game, however this is a poor way to do it.\n\nI'm a long time Magic player (20 Years) and I literally struggled to beat the game on Planeswalker difficulty but not because the computer played better, but just the power level imbalance. Honestly the cards we are given to use are a mash up of some of the more popular Standard (Type 2) cards mixed in with a few but not overpowered Modern cards. However... the computer gets acess to a HUGE pool of cards we don't get that are grossly over powered.\n\nExample: Lillana played 2 Demonic tutors on me in the same turn ~ Really... TWO! that's not even legal in Vintage (Type 1) less on a level where we have no where near the power level to compete with this and the game seems to more of a luck factor then simply playing the right cards.\n\nThe Interface sucks ~ its slow, laggy and sometimes unresponsive to my choices. With the Machine I am running, NOTHING SHOULD BE RUNNING SLOW! 8 Cores @ 4.0 Ghz, 8 GB of DDR3 Ram, Nvidia GeForce 760, Navigating around just seems clumky compared to 2014, not sure what they did but its not working right,\n\nNot sure why but I cant go above 23Hz... well I can select above it and it changes it but it changes it back from 60hz the moment i get into a game (Bad coding maybe?)\n\nLack of modes is still an issue ~ we had a lot of great modes from the previous games (2HG. Archenemy, Planechase) so why are we limited to single and multiplayer games? Newsflash Wizards... NO ONE PLAYS MULTIPLAYER MAGIC UNLESS ITS COMMNADER!\n\nSo why not commander?\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHighlights\n\nPros:\n-Finally full deck customization\n-Lots of computer oppoents\n-Limits on Cards to add a new experience\n\nCons:\n-Bad interface\n-Extreme lack of cards despite many more have been programmed.\n-Lack of Modes (Only single and Multiplayer ~ No 2HG and others)\n-Difficulty Imbalance and bad AI (Seen the computer kill one of his own creatures for no reason on planeswalker)\n-Poor shuffle simulation (I shouldn't be getting mana screwed/Flooded so often in a deck that curves out on 3 thats is running 26 lands just becauase I can rarely get past 2 lands 18 cards deep into my deck)\n-Random crashes\n-Needs to be more like the Yu-Gi-Oh!

At the start of the game it has you choose a combination of two colors to create a deck.\n*An insight to the story of the MTG universe for those that don't read the books.\n*A tutorial to learning MTG and construction of MTG.\n*A campaign expanding five planes with about five matches each. This totals to around 25-30 duels.\n*Online competitive play with up to four people.\n\nPros-\n*(Can be) cheap alternative to playing the actual card game.\n*Construction of your own deck(s).\n*Quick way to get some games in if you don't have people to play with or don't want to drive to a nearby MTG store.\n\nCons-\n*No premade decks to play as. Only to play against. This forces you to grind up for your cards in order to play online efficiently.\n*The deck building is pay to win. Premium boosters can be bought that include cards you cannot get normally. This is slightly adjusted as you can only have a certain number of copies for any one card (4 copies of any common, 3 for uncommon, 2 for rare, 1 for mythic).\n*No two headed giant. This is the 2v2 mode that has been offered in every DOTP game until now and was a huge reason for me to buy it.\n*The menus of the game are awful. I don't have too much of a problem with this because I use a keyboard but when I do I am easily frustrated.\n*The decks you are given are just terrible. Consisting of only commons (from my experience) which requires you to get all of your good cards from boosters.\n*Some of the opening draws you have will force you to restart the duel.\n\nOverall, if your looking for a solo experience of playing against other players with a custom deck you may want to give this a try.\n\nBut if your like me (and many other MTG players) you will want to play this game 2v2 with your friend against others in two headed giant mode which this game DOES NOT OFFER.

But the option was there.\nYou could eitherway play lots and lots to unlock all the cards or just pay a small fee and unlock it right away.\nThat's okay, not such a bad option and it still leaves all players in an equal situation.\n\nIn this game, well.\nFirst you choose a Deck which contents you do not know, except the starting color/s.\nI went for a black one which had the description about leeching life away.\nFound that pretty cool, since I have a mono-black Deck in real life which just works on draining away the opponents life.\nWhat did I get in this game? A white/black deck which is WEAK, and I mean really really really WEAK!\nLike so many comments before: You have to be darn lucky with your opening hand or how you draw, or you can just quit right away and save yourself some 20-30mins painful playing time where you somehow hope you might still turn things around, cause in most cases you just won't!\nLike I said, I'm not a pro, but I've been playing the game for about 20 years and I feel totally gutted in here.\nIt has nothing to do with your skill, your starting Deck is just sooo weak.\nBy now I set it on Mage, just so I can play a bit and I still sometimes lose without a glimmer for a chance.\n\nI was hoping to unlock a bit more cards and yes, you do, but it takes a long time.\nThe RNG for drawing new cards and strong cards I could live with, but first you go through such a painful game to actually win (otherwise no Booster Pack) and then you usually get the same cards over and over again, which don't really strengthen your Deck.\nChecking the list of possible cards and where they from you think it's possible, but you're so tempted to buy your easy way out you lose your ability to think rational....\nAnd what the heck is the section "Premium Cards" which has some really cool cards?\nDo I HAVE to buy premium boosters just to get those? Or have a chance for those?\nNo, that's not okay, not at all.\n\nThe menu style is from some of the previous games, and at first glance it looks nice, but I really don't want a slow responsive menu and where I have to click 4x "back" only to get to the main menu.\nThe 2014 menu was simple, but fast responsive and decent enough.\nThis one is just terrible - graphics are simply not everything.\n\nMultiplayer, well, where's 2 Headed Giant? And where are some other cool game modi like Arch-Enemy. I thought they'd come up with something nice again but this time it just has FFA (or I'm too blind to find a way to change it).\n\nI'm happy I just pre-ordered the normal version of the game, I think I'd spend a week crying if I bought the complete bundle... at least.\n\nSo final conclusion: Hands off! Don't buy it, don't support this. I love MtG, supoort it :P But not THIS game.\nIf you want an OK digital version of MtG, go with the 2014 one, that one is okay and even though you're quite limited, it is fun.\n\nSorry for the wall of text - rant over now.\n\nAnd thank you for reading it (if anyone did :P)\n\nUpdate:\nI completed the single player story now and even played as much as to unlock all cards from all plains.\n88% complete, just missing the cards from the premium boosters.\n\nSo now I'll just deinstall it and that's it.\nYes, the Deck Building is awesome.\nBut having to spend ~20€ just to unlock all cards isn't enjoyable.\nIn the previous game you could unlock everything by just playing.\nAnd that's how it should be.\nI don't mind paying a couple of € for extra content (Expansion Pack, Deck Packs), but Premium Boosters? No, if I buy a game, I want to have full access to everything and not feel forced to pay extra just to get 100% completion.\nIf they made it so you can get Premium Boosters by winning in multiplayer only, okay, that would have been acceptable too.\nAsking for money: Just NO!\n\nSo now I feel disgusted whenever I log into the game and know I'll have never 100% of all cards cause I refuse to pay.\n\nAlso without 2HG multiplayer is not appealing to me at all, since I was never a fan of FFA.\nIn real life yes, but not in this game.\n\nUnless they fix at least one of those issues I'll probably not play it again.\n\nSorry for 2nd rant :P","July 16, 2014","false","23.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I got the bundle which was pretty cool so I already had some cards to make decent deck. The Booster packs are really weird though? I figured they would of been something like getting a normal booster pack with the Premium ones just having 3 extra cards in them with maybe the possiblity of extra foils or something but no that is not it. All in all I have enjoyed it so far. I have not gotten to try multiplayer yet sadly still trying to get cards for at least a couple decks before I go play it but 10/10.\n\n\nI had to edit this\n\nEDIT- After playing the game a bit more I wanted to let everyone know that I can no longer recommend it after beating Avacyn I got buy cards from the bundle and proceeded to play the next few matches and the AI have the decks set it seems. I go up against the minotaur deck and it is the same cards each time and I found this to be true with the Hydra as well. I understand its story line but litteraly it makes it almost impossible to beat some of these guys. If you are playing and did not get the bundle I am sorry because the crappy started deck will not pull you through these matches. I can not recommend this after playing a bit further in. I still have not gotten to try multiplay but for the Story Line Battles I would say no.\n\nI would also add that you can not tap your Mana the game does it for you and so far I can not find a way to cahnge this so basically say you have 2 Forests on the Field and 2 planes. You have an Ordeal of Heliod that costs 1 Colorless and 1 Plains and you have Swift Justice in your hand that costs 1 Plains. If you go and use Ordeal of Heliod the game makes you use 2 white mana so you are screwed on using your swift justice during the combat phase. The game makes it impossible to make any plays at all.

If you really like magic try to go find a copy of the game from back in 95 or 97 where there were no limitations or micro purchases to buy it. IMPORTANT: Some people have mentioned your stuck with one deck and while you get to build there's no previews of the deck. That is indeed true, but it's only until you fulfill the first quest set of like 4-5 bosses. That last boss can be a super pain, but you get the right combo and get by her and you're off to freedom, sort of...\n\nAfter that you can freely build other decks. If you didn't buy the full version you'll have to slowly earn your cards or buy boosters.\n\nThis game does have some additional negatives: Slow game play as people mentioned. Also the game's ai for picking which lands to tap for you is horrible! Sometimes completely screws you over for tactics because it decided to take all of one color mana over splitting it, and after trying every option in the settings there's no apparent way to allow you to choose what to tap and when. Also the game AI seems to be horrible at advising you even in the tutorial. It recommended i remove one of my best cards in my deck for a card that wasn't as good. Fortunately i did have the option after the little deck builder tutorial was over to go back and promptly add the card back in, and it may be the case that other decks they advise you better. Note also you can choose to skip the tutorials, which I kind of had to go back through the game choices and find where to do it.\n\nThe only positive thing i can say about this is it's better than 2012-2014 series they were pawning off on people. I'd recommend if your going to buy it, spring for the whole set so you have all the cards to freely build with. Otherwise you're probably going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the micro purchases like everyone else.\n\nStill my ultimate advice is to go find the earliest instance of the game and play that. It's out there modified for windows 7 & 8 with fixes to some of the old bugs, but you might need to wade through some unsavory waters to find it if you catch my drift.","July 17, 2014","false","21.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It was a great tool to teach me how to actually play Magic, which before was too daunting of a task. Now I buy the games every year, with each game adding more to the experience. As any iterative game, there are cool new features and drawbacks. However, Magic 2015 takes out all the features that I enjoyed for a system meant to manipulate you into microtransactions. I already paid money for the game, please give me the full game.\n\nNegatives:\nFirst Noticed that the game overall is slow. The menus are painful and AI is slower/dumber.  Another is no Custom Duels-- My favorite mode Two Headed Giant was taken out. Why? Each year they take great modes away, but this was a staple. I actually reinstalled the other magic games to replay those modes I loved so much. I also loved the decks provided in the previous games, which for this game doesn't have any themed planeswalker deck.\n\nYou can create your own deck?! Well yes, this year you can actually do that. However, to get the good cards you need to unlock them through the campaign (random chance boosters). To get all the cards... well you will have to pay to do that.\n\nPositives:\nThe Art can be cool at times. Sometimes.\n\nIf you want to get into magic I suggest buying Magic 2013, or even Magic 2014. This game however is trying to ride the card game microtransaction systems of FREE to Play card games WHILE making you pay for the initial game. I regret two purchase in my life for games-- Dragon Age 2 and Magic 2015. I guess another postive at least I didn't spend 60 dollars and have to install Origin. But that is like saying, at least I didnt walk out my front door into traffic today.\n\nSo buyers beware.","July 17, 2014","false","56.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

The only thing that is worth noting of this game is that they've added some of the Theros block set to play around with. The "Deck building" gimic isn't much to get excited over since They limit your decks to what you can create with the arbitrary rarity lock (meaning 4 Commons to unlock, 3 Uncommons, 2 Rares, and 1 Mythic) which isn't exciting. To add to the muck that the game seems to irk myself are two things: The Menu is (or was for me) at my friends house was auto locked to a 29p Refresh rate, then playing this on my own rig started at 50fps. Now it might be saying that I'm expecting a lot out of a simple card game would be right but it wouldn't be an issue if the menu screen was incredibly unresponsive and relaxed, It took about 3 or 4 Clicks on the start game promt to let the game know that I wanted to play. Lastly the other thing would be noting is that the AI is pretty sad. Most of the time getting mana screwed won the game by having 2 mana with two 1/1 soilders with a flying enchantment that gives +1/+2 This happened about 6 or 7 times Even on the final boss, Hell infact Twice on the final boss. If I had to give an honest statement, I would have to say that this version is possibly optimised for iPad or Android tablets. Final Statements: Avoid getting the game since its less of what the previous verison is and if you want to get this game and/or want to try it out to see what magic is either look into getting M13 or M14 or wait until a sale for at least half off. 38/100","July 21, 2014","false","6.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The problem is, that anyone CAN BUY SPECIFIC CARDS that you don't get on the campaign, making the online victory something harder an unfair. So if you like PAY MORE MONEY TO WIN, then this is a game for you!\n\nCampaign - The campaign is just a mess: there are about 16 matches, and then there is the final boss. The boss itself is not that hard, but after you win, you have to fight him again, and now he has better cards. On this new match, if you lose or restart duel, you go back again, and you have to fight the inicial boss again and then the renewed boss. This doesn't mean that the final boss is harder, it just means that you have to play more and more to win.\n\nDecks - everyone likes the idea of making your own deck, which this game has. You begin the game with choosing two colors (one main color and another to help it). The problem is that you keep this two colors till the end of the game, which means you have to win every game WITH ONE DECK. After winning a game you get boosters, but this system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because you'll encounter enemies that don't fit your deck - which means you'll play again and again till you're lucky with your cards and the enemy is unlucky with his.\n\nFinal Boss and other game modes - since the magic 2012 that the final bosses are becoming easier and easier. This one is not hard, it's just plain stupid that you have to play him twice and win both times - it doesn't mean his hard, it just means that  if you don't get good cards, you have to start all over again. Apart from the 16 matches, you have NOTHING MORE. No TWO HEADED GIANT. No ARCHENEMY. NO CHALLENGES. NO GETTING NEW DECKS, JUST ONE DECK FOR WHOLE CAMPAIGN.\n\nThis game is a step backwards in the saga...","July 22, 2014","false","71.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I agree with the overall sentiment of said reviews, with special disdain for the increased amount of micro transactions sprinkled throughout the game. Every iteration of Magic since 2012 has had micro transactions as a way to decrease the amount of grinding necessary to unlock cards, but what's interesting about this iteration is that the campaign play-through, including completing every "exploration" for every plane will unlock most of the cards with very little grinding necessary thereafter. WotC has charged more for unlocking less. The plan, from my perspective, was to lock the player's deck choice, forcing battle after battle against AI opponents with powerful decks while utilizing the weakest form of whichever deck the user selected. The player then is confronted with two choices: sit through loss after loss (you'll lose a lot in the beginning btw) and slowly unlock cards through boosters (some of which may or may not have anything to do with your deck archetype) or pay 20 dollars to unlock every card available in a booster pack normally unlocked through winning matches. There are also cards that can only be unlocked by purchasing premium booster packs.\n\nWhat one gets from the purchase of Magic 2015 are the campaign, cards, and the ability to fully customize one's deck. Multiplayer has been severely truncated and only now consists of 1v1, 1v1v1, and 1v1v1v1. The removal of Two-headed giant was extremely disappointing to say the least, but I have recently learned that one team can only have a total of 4 of the same card. I don't know much beyond that when it comes to multiplayer rules governing the universe of magic however. Challenge mode has been removed as a category and implemented within the achievements. The issues is that instead of clicking on a challenge without having to worry about decks, one may need to rework one's deck to complete these challenges because specific cards must be utilized. For example, one "challenge" requires one to kill an angel with Shadowborn Demon. If you don't use a deck that includes black mana, you'll have to modify. Unfortunately, there is only 1 Shadowborn Demon card in this game, making the completion of this achievement based largely on luck and staying power (if the card is pulled late game). I use life-gain by default so I got lucky because I was able to build up enough life to withstand the onslaught; but most of the creatures cast by Avacyn are flying and if decks have no way of dealing with that, it will be a grind.\n\nThe animation on every screen is terribly long. Choosing to go forward to another plane or back to the main menu is a chore because the animation cannot be overridden or skipped and it cycles through every choice before going to the first one. For example, if one wishes to go back to the main menu, by clicking "Esc", to play multiplayer, the animation will start at the end of the selection and work its way down to the first selection. Check the status of your card collection? That selection is close to the end, so one must wait until the animation completes, cycle to "Card Collection", click it, and wait as the animation cycles through the other choices (about half a second), load, and then display the card collection.\n\nAll in all, what one is paying for is full deck customization. It's an extremely high price to say the least. It almost feels like a punishment; WotC gave us what we wanted but had to take back other things to justify the action.","July 29, 2014","false","194.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Most of the time...\n\nBUT\n\nIf you're an experienced player and you want to play it with your friends and see what kind of awesome deck you can make with the newly-implemented pre-built decks, look the other way. The pre-built deck system is not quite what everyone else was hoping it would be as every deck combination you could possibly use starts you with a vast number of inferior cards. Of course, there's supposed to be weak cards in every deck, but these decks are built with cards that don't have a fine and polished pattern that work efficiently. I guess that makes sense knowing that every card combination, whether it be Red and Blue, Green and White, or Black and Blue, has many ways for you to customize them to your own liking and build your own kind of strategy.\nBut here's the kicker; the way you get cards is by beating people with a very unefficient deck. If you don't go with white, you're likely going to lose a lot. And the designers planned that. Because once you beat Avacyn, if you can because she's the final boss of the first plane in the campaign, there's an option for you to BUY CARDS. Seriously. I'm not kidding. You can waste $35 of your hard-earned money to get every card IN THE GAME. NOT in as every card in existence. Every card that was PUT INTO THE GAME. And it doesn't bother telling you that either.\nNow there's two things that aggravates me about this: First, people who have a lot of money now have the ability to create a terrifying-powerful deck just because they have money. That ruins the experience of learning how to use what you're limited to and formulating your own unique strategy. Now they can use all the best cards and get bored with the challenges and regret their purchase because they wasted their money on a game they'll never play again. Secondly, for the people who don't have money all over their floors, they have to constantly beat annoying people with annoyingly polished decks that crush you if you don't draw all your good cards early in the game. Constantly. And even then, the best card they could get is something that doesn't fit well in any of their decks. The booster packs you earn for beating the snot out of the computer will ALWAYS give you defective cards that don't help your weak deck. And the worst thing about it, is that if you can't do anything but lose and you think you made the wrong choice for what deck you thought would be suitable for your playing style, guess what? You can't change it until you unlock all the cards that would be in the other pre-built decks, or if you reset your profile and risk losing all the cards you so painfully earned.\nThis game is almost able to classify itself as a pay to win game. You know, like those games on the iPod Touch where you have to pay to unlock certain things that you need in order to progress in the game. Now I haven't spent thirty-five dollars, but just because others fell for it, that upsets me. You're stuck, so you have to pay. Unless you have a lot of free-time at home, which I doubt, or you have the patience of a god.\n\nSo in conclusion, only buy this if you have no idea how to play Magic and are interested in learning the fundamental concepts of Magic. Otherwise don't buy this friggin' game.","August 6, 2014","false","19.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

After only a couple of hours of play, I've come to the conclusion that Magic 2015 is a lot worse.\n\nThere ARE some improvements compared to 2014, but overall this game is nowhere near as good as its predecessor.\n\nThe good\nFinally, proper deck building! You start the game out (after the tutorials) choosing a mana color, after which it gives you a choice of starting decks that are a combination of your chosen color with another mana color. The starting deck is not bad, it's at least enough to get started earning extra boosters by playing the game, improving your deck by playing.\nThe deck builder actually works pretty well, giving you stats on the colors in your deck and how many cards of each color you have, your land/spell ratio and graphs on how many cards you have per mana cost, allowing you to easily optimize and save your decks.\nVery slick presentation, both in menus and ingame\nIt's MtG and plays as MtG\nCheap option for new players to get into MtG and see what it's all about without having to spend a fortune on booster packs (though you canif you want)\nThe bad\nNo fancy game modes or coop in multiplayer, just straight 1v1 or 1v1v1 or 1v1v1v1 free-for-alls, and no local multiplayer either. For me, especially the omission of 2HG is a big negative, seeing as that's pretty much the only game mode for me.\nThe best cards are only in paid packs, making this more Pay2Win than it should.\nAI has a bit too much luck in having/drawing just the right cards that it needs\nEven though the menus and game look very slick, it slows down the game a bit too much. You can't just click on the menu option you want anymore, you have to scroll through the menu animations. Same with the table 'opening up' every combat phase regardless if you or the AI even does something there. All small delays, but these do add up\nIf you're new to MtG and want to try it out, i'd recommend going for one of the earlier versions instead, the only thing you'll miss is the deck building.\n\nIf you played earlier versions, skip this and wait for 2016.","July 17, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I love the card game, its intricacies and depth, which puts to shame other trading card games like Hearthstone at the moment. There's so much work behind each set, it's nothing less than amazing.\nSadly, Wizards seems determined to destory all of their reputation with their DotP series, and this is one of the top fails.\n\nIt is curious to me that throughout each and every iteration of DotP, I've felt as if the games were beta versions at best. They had an unfinished feel to them: as if they were not tested by actual players, but only by the developers blind to their own shortcomings. This game has exactly the same feel, but worse. The menus are horrible to interact with. They're slow, unresponsive, inelegant. The system and the game itself is slow even on my new computer, the AI is taking the wrong decisions, and the land tapping is messed-up so that whenever I want to cast a spell I have to manually adjust the lands being tapped, or the wrong lands would be chosen.\n\nNow compare this to Blizzard's Hearthstone slick inteface, their attention to every minute detail (even when you need to wait for online players to connect, there's a 'wheel of fortune' that revolves with good music, so that you feel like you're actually doing something), and their willingness to actually change the format by ignoring things like 'lands' and thus making the game less dependant on chance and shuffling than MtG.\n\nI used to think that Wizards could've made the DotP series much better, but they didn't want to because they simply don't want players to be hooked up on DotP as opposed to Magic Online. This is no longer the case, or not completely. For games as badly wrought out as DotP 2015, which 1st year design students (or anyone with skill...) could probably have designed better, I must come to the conclusion that Wizards just couldn't find someone competent enough to program it for them. Obviously, there is a management fluke somewhere here, and it reflects on what Wizards think of their audience. That's us.\n\nWhen somone in the street asks for my money and then screws me over, I will not buy from them again. When a company asks for money to create a game, and then provides me with a shabby, barely-coherent result, I will not buy from them again. And I do not see any reason to buy DotP 2016 (or for you, kind readers, to buy DotP 2015) before Wizards have shown their commitment to the player base and the game by fixing the huge, glaring problems with DotP 2015.\n\nSad that I do not believe this will happen.","July 17, 2014","false","298.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you don't own the previous years, buy any of them instead.  This feels like half a game compared to them.  There is no Two Headed Giant, there is no special mode like planechase or archenemy.   The bosses have cool decks and you can continue to play against them as AI, but most of those cards don't seem to be in the set you can use so your own deck doesn't feel as interesting.  At least last year when they had sealed play there was the entire other side of things with the preconstructed decks, it feels like there should have been something like that here.\n\nIt doesn't help that this year didn't offer anything new to offset the lack of a special mode.  You have a completely customizable deck, but all your cards are just randomely given to you from boosters.  I preferred getting a single card every time I won that was at least mildly useful to the deck.  Over time I could unlock all the cards that would make my deck better, but that's left up to chance or by paying money, and while I spent hundreds of hours playing last year's game this year doesn't seem like it will even hold my interest for the next few days.\n","July 16, 2014","false","22.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

As it turns out, it only unlocks all the cards already in the campaign for free for you, after defeating the first chapter.\n\nI would not recommend the DLC or Special Edition.\n\nAs for the base game, it does include an open deck editor. The problem is you don't really get much more customization then previous iterations of the series, So long as you are focused on one or two colors your options for synergistic cards aren't really much better than the old closed deck system (Re: Actually feels like less choices). In addition, you appear to be locked into a single deck after selecting a color at the beginning. This lead to a little frustration as the last fight in the first chapter included a hard counter to my choice and lead to several restarts before a victory was possible with the cards available.  Normally such a challenge would prompt me to switch to a different color deck, change my playstyle, and unlock more cards for a different deck. (In previous DotP games) however here I was forced to face roll and restart-mulligan my way to a cheap victory. And now if I want to switch to a different color, It appears I would have to do up to 60 random encounters to unlock all the cards I would want for the deck first, (At least I assume thats how it would work, I never got to unlock singles from exploring because of the DLC deception)\n\nIn addition to this, its is impossible to complete the entire card library without dropping even more money on now RANDOM card packs as some cards are exclusive to Premium Packs available for $1.99 each. (12% of cards can only be bought) Buying new decks was acceptable in my books, but random cards? I would rather play physical magic or MTGO.\n\nThe UI while stylish is a pain to navigate, you are unable to see all the options without scrolling through them one by one. Automatic land tapping is a joke, you have to turn it off and tap manually or it will lock out colors needlessly which wasn't an issue in previous games. The tutorial was much more in-depth this time around, but it felt very long even when skipping through all the dialouge and several times it missed easy damage or had sub-optimal plays that might lead less experienced players into bad habits.\n\nIf you don't already own Duels of the Planeswalkers, I would probably buy a previous years version over this one.\n\n\n\n","July 16, 2014","false","9.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Instead we get a barebones version of MTG that does everything wrong that it possibly can. Problems are apparent right when you start up the game; the UI is slow and heavily animated, obviously being designed for a touch screen interface. Instead of being given 1-2 prebuilt decks like in the previous two annual releases, you are given a choice between deck archetypes. However, you have no idea what cards are actually inside your deck before you lock in to using that "Intro Deck"-strength deck which can really screw you over at the start of the game. For example, I picked a supposedly B/G Reanimator deck but the only reanimator card in it was Rescue from the Underworld (a high costed, slow reanimator that requires saccing a creature as an additional cost). Because you are picking an archetype and not an actual deck, you also don't get unlocks specifically for your deck; while this gives you more freedom in deck construction, new players will be baffled about what they should add to their deck or how to edit it properly. A "Suggested Cards" tool is available but it isn't very trustworthy; using it with my best deck (G/W tokens), two of the three recommended cards are Phytotitan and Pelakka Wurm.\n\nWhile you can finally build your own decks with DotP 2015, you will really struggle to put something playable together without buying cards for real money. Buying all the cards in the game will cost you $20 and individual "planes" of cards will cost you $5 each. If you could just drop $20 on unlocking everything in the game you would be looking at spending only $30 total on DotP 2015. Of course, it isn't that easy... many of the best cards available (including Stoneforge Mystic, Doubling Season, Kozilek, and more) are locked behind "Premium Boosters" which give you 10 random cards for $2 (physical boosters in Standard cost between $2-4 and have 15 cards each). Last year's gambling mechanic was bad but it was only restricted to the Sealed Deck mode. DotP 2015 has essentially become Pay2Win with these boosters because the cards inside can be used in any game mode, including online.\n\nSpeaking of online play, there barely is any! 2-Headed Giant has been removed for no reason and no other game modes have been added. You can only play 2-4 player FFA with your custom built decks; no Archenemy, no Planechase, no new modes. With the addition of deck construction and the rise of popularity in Commander/EDH, it is really disappointing that even that wasn't added.\n\nThe only good thing that I can say about this is that they finally added non-basic lands. Deck construction is a nice touch finally but the rest of the game has suffered for it. It seems that in order to release the same game on every platform they had to cut content to make it work on mobile devices. DotP 2015 has a tedious, boring, and grindy single player campaign, no Challenges, no multiplayer modes outside of FFA, and no tools to introduce new players to MTG except for the tutorial. This is the worst DotP game made yet (even worse than the original DotP which was removed from Steam) and not even fans of the series should bother with this blatant cash grab.","August 21, 2014","false","18.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its the main reason i have over 100 hours played on DotP2014\n\n- Poor card pool selection, sure they added the much requested deck builder tool into this game but its with such a lacklustre card pool that deck construction can only really follow their intended pre build deck archetypes with no real other options that would be competitive.\n\n- Suspect deck shuffling that seems to give very bizzare results of 10 land draws in a row even happened when i was running just 22 in a 60 card deck! Losing and winning all feels far more down to card draw chance and less about your card selections and skilled plays that it's redundant.\n\n- A poor campaign that sees you fight yet more gimmicky encounters and less "proper" MTG opponent decks, where a single strategy is spammed at you until you can overcome it which usually requires deck re-editing and scrapping the barrel of your currently unlocked card pool looking for decent counter cards (then praying you draw them; read as " hit restart 5 times till you win")\n\n-Card unlocking and campaign feel more like a grind than ever before with the "reward" of opening boosters to find that you rarely get anything that complements your deck .\n(I went through 6 booster unlocks in a row once till i found any cards appropriate to enchance my deck I had chosen)\n\n-A barebones multiplayer that gives minimal modes and where you can't even change your deck selection without backing out of the lobby again\n\n- Bugs still present albeit better than previous offerings (why the game crashes out when i choose custom match in the multiplayer lobby 75% of the time I do not know)\n\n- Poor cards choice and terrible tutorial that you are forced through even if you are a MTG veteran like myself.\n\n- Lack of modes (2 headed giant removed as well as the challenges from previous titles in the series)\n\nOverall:\n\nI wish I had not purchased this game and found out about some of these changes before blindly buying this product fasely assuming that all the features of the previous title would be present.\n\nDO NOT PURCHASE, if you wish to have a good Magic: The Gathering experience I would highly reccommend DotP 2014 if you do not own it already.\n\nUnless they patch the game to increase card pool offerings and options and add in the missing modes I will not be returning to this game.","July 25, 2014","false","43.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It should be noted that this is my first DotP experiance but I've been playing paper MTG for a while.\n\nThere are some issues; it's slow and sometimes the AI cheats and does things that aren't legal.  For example, I was playing against the Kor deck and lost to my opponent "Kicking" his creature to make it unblockable for lethal (I had like 4 blockers for his 2 creatures and the creature he "kicked" had been in play since the 3rd turn - it was about the 8th turn at that point so legally it shouldn't have happened as "Kicking" is an entering play ability - SUPER ANNOYING and I would have won the next turn had this not occured).  It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't the kicked creature that then attacked and killed me.\n\nI like that you can create your own deck but dislike that it has such hash restrictions like only being able to play 1 of each Mythic, 2 of each rare and 3 of each uncommon.  It's particularly annoying when the bosses tend to have such a tempo advantage against you anyway as they're running Tropical Islands and Bayous, etc. against my crappy Guildgate lands.\n\nAnyway, I've just completed the single player game playing a GW Token deck.  The only really difficult games I came accross was the Mirror guy (playing my own deck against me only with insanely lucky hands) and Garruks' game 1 (who just drew perfectly every game).  Its a bizzarre system, I lost a few rounds to decks that seemed impossible then I'd rematch and they'd flip to being almost too easy! That's MTG I suppose.","July 17, 2014","false","30.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Instead we get a barebones version of MTG that does everything wrong that it possibly can. Problems are apparent right when you start up the game; the UI is slow and heavily animated, obviously being designed for a touch screen interface. Instead of being given 1-2 prebuilt decks like in the previous two annual releases, you are given a choice between deck archetypes. However, you have no idea what cards are actually inside your deck before you lock in to using that "Intro Deck"-strength deck which can really screw you over at the start of the game. For example, I picked a supposedly B/G Reanimator deck but the only reanimator card in it was Rescue from the Underworld (a high costed, slow reanimator that requires saccing a creature as an additional cost). Because you are picking an archetype and not an actual deck, you also don't get unlocks specifically for your deck; while this gives you more freedom in deck construction, new players will be baffled about what they should add to their deck or how to edit it properly. A "Suggested Cards" tool is available but it isn't very trustworthy; using it with my best deck (G/W tokens), two of the three recommended cards are Phytotitan and Pelakka Wurm.\n\nWhile you can finally build your own decks with DotP 2015, you will really struggle to put something playable together without buying cards for real money. Buying all the cards in the game will cost you $20 and individual "planes" of cards will cost you $5 each. If you could just drop $20 on unlocking everything in the game you would be looking at spending only $30 total on DotP 2015. Of course, it isn't that easy... many of the best cards available (including Stoneforge Mystic, Doubling Season, Kozilek, and more) are locked behind "Premium Boosters" which give you 10 random cards for $2 (physical boosters in Standard cost between $2-4 and have 15 cards each). Last year's gambling mechanic was bad but it was only restricted to the Sealed Deck mode. DotP 2015 has essentially become Pay2Win with these boosters because the cards inside can be used in any game mode, including online.\n\nSpeaking of online play, there barely is any! 2-Headed Giant has been removed for no reason and no other game modes have been added. You can only play 2-4 player FFA with your custom built decks; no Archenemy, no Planechase, no new modes. With the addition of deck construction and the rise of popularity in Commander/EDH, it is really disappointing that even that wasn't added.\n\nThe only good thing that I can say about this is that they finally added non-basic lands. Deck construction is a nice touch finally but the rest of the game has suffered for it. It seems that in order to release the same game on every platform they had to cut content to make it work on mobile devices. DotP 2015 has a tedious, boring, and grindy single player campaign, no Challenges, no multiplayer modes outside of FFA, and no tools to introduce new players to MTG except for the tutorial. This is the worst DotP game made yet (even worse than the original DotP which was removed from Steam) and not even fans of the series should bother with this blatant cash grab.","August 21, 2014","false","18.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Other than that I feel like you'd probably be disappointed.\n\nThe Rest:\nAs an avid player of the previous 3 games in the series, I was hugely looking forward to this being released. I enjoyed the sealed deckbuilding in Magic 2014, and looked forward to having even more freedom with my decks in 2015. But having now played it, I feel that Magic 2015 is trying too hard to be Hearthstone, and without all the diverse prebuilt decks (not to mention the Two-Headed Giant and Challenge gamemodes) it gets pretty boring after only 5 hours of play, and probably less than that for some others. For me personally that's roughly 1/20 of my recorded playtime on any one of the previous three games, and I could probably still go back and play those some more.\n\nWith the complete lack of anything more to do now that I've finished the main Campaign mode, I have to say that it feels more like a demo or an early-access game than a full release title. It wasn't worth the money I spent preordering it, and it certainly isn't worth spending any extra money on Premium Booster Packs.\n\nI hope that Wizards Of The Coast listen to my review, and others I've seen here on Steam, and bring out some sort of update for the game to bring back the long-term fun of the previous games. When they inevitably bring out an Expansion Pack and/or Deck Packs (or card-pool equivilents to Deck Packs) I will think twice about bothering with them this time around unless they make some big changes.\n\nMaybe I'd see it as a better game on it's own, without having to live up to the previous games in the series. But unfortunately Wizards Of The Coast didn't have that luxury, and they've left this Magic: The Gathering fan feeling pretty much done with the Duels Of The Planeswalkers series.","July 16, 2014","false","23.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This is the third of the games that I have purchased on Steam, and let me tell you it is a disappointment.  The card collecting is nothing like the the previous installments.  There's virtually no replayability in single player unless you really want to dedicate the time to opening enough random cards that you may actually collect each one.  And even if you collect each card, what will you do with them?  The pool is so weird and scattershot in terms of mechanics and card quality that it's just silly.  Multiplayer is a joke, as in everyone else is also limited to this strange selection of cards so games end up usually uninteresting and just waiting for someone to draw that bomb.  It has no point.\n\nI must also mention the aesthetics of the menus.  It's 2014 as I write this , and maybe it's a bit cliche to state, but holy moly talk about dated looking menus.  It's like navigating a flash-based website circa the year 2001 complete with unwelcome dissolve animations and unacceptable load times.  Yes that's right, I hope you enjoy menu screens because you're gonna spend a lot of time trying to get around in an ugly and clunky system.  Not to mention the layout and navigation of the game screens, which for some reason change every year.  I don't get it, isn't this designed with controller support in mind?  Why is everything such a pain to navigate with a controller then?  And why is it that using a mouse instead is somehow no better?  Everything about this seems like it was designed by 15 year olds, no joke.  It's a whole lot of "Wouldn't this be cool?" instead of what it should be, which is "Shouldn't this be seamless and functional considering this is the fifth version of this game we've put out?"\n\nI honestly regret buying this game, especially at full price.  Yeah I've put some time into it but just in the hopes that it will become fun.  It has not.  For what it's worth 2014's "sealed" mode was a huge letdown coming from the point of view of someone who plays MTGO exclusively for the limited tournaments.  But you know I've sunk a lot of downtime into 2014 because the theme decks were fun, and there's a concrete goal of unlocking the next card for that deck and figuring out how to tune what you have into not only playable but just downright fun decks.  2015 has no such charm.  It's a complete step backwards in the series, there is absolutely no improvement in this version over the previous versions.  They had a single good idea -- custom deck building -- but top to bottom this game is executed poorly and not worth your time or money until it gets some very deep discounts.  If I can just convince one person to trust me and spend their money elsewhere that'll be good enough for me.","August 22, 2014","false","30.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have spent far too much time on the previous games and on Magic in real life, so I wanted to try this one out no matter what.  Let me elaborate on why this game is awful.\n\nYou start with one deck.  This deck is composed entirely of commons.  You enemies in the campaign, however, are similarly matched.  For about the first three fights.  After this, you start having to play against real decks.  During the interval of time while you get to this point, you are given about 9 more commons.\n\nThe first real opponent is a stall deck based on life gain.  You can win it basically by getting an opponent with a bad draw.  Your deck is totally inferior.  For winning this, you finally get a booster pack.  If you had Magic 2014, you get two.  You can then go wander and play a few more minor enemies and net about another 7 or 8 boosters.  Then you get to the stupid fights.\n\nYou are now fighting decks composed entirely of rares with no ability to get any more cards.  Replaying fights nets you nothing except for the ones against the all rare decks.  Obviously, the solution to this is microtransactions.  Just buy the cards you are missing.\n\nObviously, this is a game built in the style of free-to-plays with all of their nastiest tendancies.  Wizards should be ashamed of this game.  They won't be, as they are a business already built on this business model in real life, but still.

The reason I can not recommend this game is because there is an entire category of cards hidden behind a paywall. These premium tier cards are stronger than the default and hidden behind a paywall. Really starts to make multiplayer feel more, pay to win than it should; you will be less competative in multiplayer if you do not purchase some of the premium cards. I prefer the way Hearthstone goes about this.\n\nAnother complaint is that the deck you choose to complete the tutorial with is the only deck you will be playing with for a long time; lets hope you make a good choice.\n\nWith all of this said, it is not a bad game and I will continue playing it, but I feel that it was a very bad move to have a special pay-only card tier.","August 1, 2014","false","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As soon as you do, the game stops giving out the booster packs for that particular plane.   A lot of the fun just drained from the game at that time.\n\nb) The game cheats.  Playing through the entire series I never saw the computer muligan.  Never fought it where it had a flood or a drought of land.   This became particuarly evident when fighting the sliver deck as every game.  *every game* I played of the 20+ times to get past it, they had 3 different mana colors by turn 3.  Perfect curves.    Yes, I know this is necessary for AI's to stand a chance against humans but it still rankles when it's so damn obvious.\n\nc) The new layout is not convenient.   I'd much rather look at options and navigation on one screen then have to slide through a whole bunch of other options first.   This lay out seems designed for phones where a swipe of the finger is more convenient than the click of a mouse.   If you're on a PC it's just tedious.\n\nd) The card choice is poor of the cards given.  Yes there are some good cards and some favorite cards, but the cards that become available to build your deck are mediocre at best.   Nor do they allow you the cards that their own decks are built.   This causes (at least me) to feel like I've been given stone-and-stick tools to face foes outfitted in iron.   It's another means of giving the AI a necessary boost to make it competitive.   It still feels lame.\n\ne) The auto-adjust of land is either on or off.  In 2014 I could put my deck together and click on "suggest land" and then tweak as I want.   In 2015 you can either accept what MTG2015 says you should have or you have to do it manually.   This wouldn't be so irksome except that to change the option to auto-adjust you have to leave the deck building screen, find the settings, make the adjuistment, and return to the deck building screen.\n\nf) I'll say it again:  Don't buy the expansion card sets that just give you all the cards.   It really did ruin a lot of the fun.\n\nI played 2014 all through 2013 and up to release of 2015.   I'll probably play 2015 whenever an expansion comes out but to be honest it just doesn't inspire the urge to continue playing.   Even with the chance to build my own deck, I feel like the mediocre decks I can manage just don't warrant excitement.\n\nBuy for the 9.99.  Don't spend much more on this and be happy updating the included decks with whaterver wheat you can seperate from the dross of the booster packs.","July 18, 2014","false","209.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you want my opinion of the game itself, it's Magic. It's no different from any of the years before it besides the card library.\n\n=======================================================================================\n\nThe intro is simply annoying. It plays the same whispering wind four times in a row for each of the devs or publishes and their alienware advertisement (because I need top of the line equipment for a digital card game) before finally getting to the intro custscene which repeats the same whispering wind. This one, you have to sit through a few seconds before being able to skip it. We then hit the Start screen where the player is prompted to click start. There is then a two second delay before the fog ever so slowly begins to engulf the screen and take me to the main menu.\n\nI know this sounds like nit-picking but the menues are beyond awful to navigate. Rather than a standard push button menu or even a left and right option, it's uses a front/back layout so you can see the icons for the options behind your current selection, but the icons are just card portraits. How am I to know that "Dictate of the Twin Gods" is "Restart Battle". How about a clock or a back arrow or a curved arrow or something to symbolize restarting. Anyone familiar with the card will tell you that the card has nothing to do with reversing time either, the icons are simply arbitrary to look pretty leaving you to one by one, scroll through your options one by one and read the text underneath until finding what you want. Oh and guess what. The lingering fog is back.\n\nEven if you do happen to manage to memorize the icons, it doesn't make enough of a difference. The one you're on is selected and focused, you cannot see any options you have already passed and any yet to come forward are out of focus and slightly to the right so you can easily click on them. Guess what, it doesn't matter. I can see that icon in the back and I know it is the one I want to click so I'm going to click it but it only shuffles over once to the next option forcing me to click four times just to open the option I want to get to.\n\n2014 gave me a loading screen inbetween menues that lasted maybe a full second at most. I have a 4 gigahert processor, it loaded and then the game started. That's it. Quick and simple.\n\nThe game itself has become increasingly annoying as well. The table pulls itself apart like an antique dining table that has an optional insert every time your attack phase comes up and it makes this god awful clang of a forge when it does this. This all happens regardless of whether or not you are attacking. And guess what. That whole nonsense takes another three seconds per turn.\n\n=======================================================================================\n\nIn the end, I used to play M14 to kill a few minutes while waiting for my friends to finish whatever they were doing so we could all play the same game. This terrible design couple with these nuisences have ruined that for me as I spend more time looking at WotC's pretentious smoke effect than actually playing the game. Do not bother with this purchase, just buy the movie "The Fog" instead. You'll get about as much entertainment out of it.","July 18, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is the third of the games that I have purchased on Steam, and let me tell you it is a disappointment.  The card collecting is nothing like the the previous installments.  There's virtually no replayability in single player unless you really want to dedicate the time to opening enough random cards that you may actually collect each one.  And even if you collect each card, what will you do with them?  The pool is so weird and scattershot in terms of mechanics and card quality that it's just silly.  Multiplayer is a joke, as in everyone else is also limited to this strange selection of cards so games end up usually uninteresting and just waiting for someone to draw that bomb.  It has no point.\n\nI must also mention the aesthetics of the menus.  It's 2014 as I write this , and maybe it's a bit cliche to state, but holy moly talk about dated looking menus.  It's like navigating a flash-based website circa the year 2001 complete with unwelcome dissolve animations and unacceptable load times.  Yes that's right, I hope you enjoy menu screens because you're gonna spend a lot of time trying to get around in an ugly and clunky system.  Not to mention the layout and navigation of the game screens, which for some reason change every year.  I don't get it, isn't this designed with controller support in mind?  Why is everything such a pain to navigate with a controller then?  And why is it that using a mouse instead is somehow no better?  Everything about this seems like it was designed by 15 year olds, no joke.  It's a whole lot of "Wouldn't this be cool?" instead of what it should be, which is "Shouldn't this be seamless and functional considering this is the fifth version of this game we've put out?"\n\nI honestly regret buying this game, especially at full price.  Yeah I've put some time into it but just in the hopes that it will become fun.  It has not.  For what it's worth 2014's "sealed" mode was a huge letdown coming from the point of view of someone who plays MTGO exclusively for the limited tournaments.  But you know I've sunk a lot of downtime into 2014 because the theme decks were fun, and there's a concrete goal of unlocking the next card for that deck and figuring out how to tune what you have into not only playable but just downright fun decks.  2015 has no such charm.  It's a complete step backwards in the series, there is absolutely no improvement in this version over the previous versions.  They had a single good idea -- custom deck building -- but top to bottom this game is executed poorly and not worth your time or money until it gets some very deep discounts.  If I can just convince one person to trust me and spend their money elsewhere that'll be good enough for me.","August 22, 2014","false","30.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Some Planeswalkers have cards that aren't even IN THE GAME.\n\nExamples: Terramorphic Expanse, Phantasmal Bear, a bunch of Extort cards and more.\n\nThat's not a challenge. It's an un-fair advantage.\n\nSo after going through the simply annoying campaign you decided to start playing online against other players.\n\n"Finally, I can now start getting to the fun of all this."\n\nBAM!\n\nYou're hit by a bunch of players who have paid $36, $56 or $76 for cards so again having the max quantity allowed for each card that make their deck strong. When you only have 1 or maybe 2 of the max quantity allowed for each card that make your deck strong.\n\nBy this point I can almost assure you that you will feel the need to buy the premium boosters, or the all the base cards so that you can have a deck that is capable of not getting completely slaughtered.\n\nSo what the hell, you go for it. You spend the $56 on the cards while mouse wheeling threw an annoying and buggy menu obviously made for tablets, and non-stopping mouse over sounds from their menu buttons that make you wish you were deaf...\n\nYou try to make you're deck how you want it and notice that you can only have 3 of the same uncommons, 2 of the same rares, and 1 of the same mythic. Completely changing the way decks are built in magic.\n\nSo not only did they give the A.I. a bunch of cards you can't get (even if you pay the $76 you don't get the cards the A.I. has access to), not only did they set up the campaign to be un-fair and limit your deck to almost trash to push you towards paying for cards, not only did they design a complete pay to win model no better than StarTrek Texels, but after paying the $36, $56, or $76 they significantly reduce the limit of customization and what you can do with the money you just spent compared to Magic: The Gathering's official rules.\n\nDo not buy this game!\n\nBut hey, at least they spelt the name right.\n1/10","July 22, 2014","false","30.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ideally, you should play shandalar from 1997.. but you will likely regret playing MTG 2015. On one hand, they address the problem with many other of the modern magic games: you have genuine deck building freedom. You gain cards from playing matches and you can build whatever deck you want. But just like any of the modern MTG games, the devs have said to themselves "We dont want to make this TOO fun.. or people might spend less on physical cards" and so it is full of grinding.. micro-transaction incentives.. opponents with dumb AI and have way way way better cards than you. Worse is the expansion.. which takes the best thing the game had going for it (deck building) and says "only use this deck we made, you cant customize it at all, and all the opponents have cheap overpowered combos." If you complete the expansion you win the reward of being able to play it again with decks you have made.. but after completing it the last thing i want to do is play this game again.\nAnd i almost forgot to add: it has the worst menu layout i have ever seen.

That's not why I just shut off the game I paid heroic American dollars for, nor is it why I almost exploded my nervous system in my frantic rush to the store page to leave this review.\n\nThis review serves as a monument to the single worst tutorial I have ever experienced in my entire life.  If you bought this game with the purpose of playing the campaign mode, be prepared to be spoon-fed Magic the Gathering by what sounds like a member of the local rotary club.\n\nIt's like being taught to play Dungeons and Dragons one paragraph at a time by Frances McDormand, and she won't start speaking until you say, "Next!"\n\nI seriously cannot explain the hatred I have for this tutorial with weak human words.  This is the Jar-Jar Binks of tutorials.  It may have ruined this and the next two games for me.  By the light of the silvery moon, who in the world thought this was a good idea.  I have had viruses more pleasant than this.  Why no option to skip it?  Did you think that you would be robbing us of hearing the dulcet tones of the soccer-est of moms while she reguritates one pre digested morsel of Magic at a time into our waiting beaks?\n\nI am going to walk away, perhaps shower, and think about utilizing Steam's revamped refund policy.

It's still better than Magic Online, but it's basically crap.  It feels like it's made for consoles and the Steam version is an afterthought.\n\nI'll pick one small example of why this game is designed poorly.  I'm a longtime Magic player, and have played other DotP games, so I picked Planeswalker difficulty and went right to the end of the tutorial, and then onto the first game of the campaign.  At some point in the game, I wanted to cast a spell using certain mana.  I knew that this was something previous games wouldn't always let you do.  So I hunted around in the options for a check box related to it.  I tried one marked "Auto Lands" but that didn't do anything.  Anyway, when I cast the spell, a prompt came up saying "Press the mana choice key to choose how to cast this spell".   Sounds easy, right?  Well I have no way to know what key that is.  I hunted back in the options for a "Controls" setting, but there's none there.  Before I could locate a help page or something that might tell me what key it is, the game crashed.  When I restarted, my progress in the game was lost.  The 20 minutes I had just spent grinding down the AI's zombie deck while I was mana screwed was for nothing.\n\nHow could this have been prevented?  Simple!  The prompt should have said "Press the mana choice key (KEY NAME) to choose how to cast this spell".  But instead of getting a useful prompt, the game persists in presenting me with the "continue" button even when there is no game action I could possibly take.  I'm not going to bluff the AI! The game should really be run in the equivalent of "F8" mode from Magic Online, or at least have the option.  "Auto-continue when no actions are possible" it could say.\n\nOkay, whatever, I've already wasted more time with this than I shoud have.  I'll go back to playing Hearthstone now.","January 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Making your own deck from scratch is really neat, but with such a small card pool, there's only so many viable options. Lack of two headed giant is also inexcusable. The game lags for no reason (and yes; my PC exceeds the recommended system specs by a landslide) and it's just very aesthetically unpleasant; everything is so white that it hurts my eyes. Also the ambient music is lame. I was super excited for this game but I'd say wait until they add more DLC and discount it.

The deck building is really good and fun.  The excitment of not knowing what cards you are going to get when you win in the campaign is fun too.  That is about it for me.\n\nThe cons outweigh the pros by a lot.   The game cheats so bad it isn't even funny.  Playing practice matches is painful at times.   The computer makes horrible plays that just leave me shaking my head and sometimes screaming at the computer.   It could just be a really really bad AI but it certainly seems like cheating.   Also, the "randomizer" for the decks is horrible.  I have never had this many runs of too many lands or not enough lands.  It is completely rediculous at times.   The last complaint about the games is that entirely too often the computer gets the exact card they need to stop any plans I have.   I don't mean once or twice but at least 25% of the time if not higher sometimes.\n\nI really hate having to spend even more money to get all the cards available.   Why not give us the game for free and then let us buy the cards we want?   What a pain.   Also the fact that once you complete the campaign you don't get anymore cards.  I can actually understand not giving out anymore rares or beyond.   That makes them special.   Why on earth can't we get a complete set of commons and uncommons though?  Those are the bread and butter of decks and make it much harder to build a good deck if we were unlucky and only got one or two of a really effective card.\n\n\nIn conclusion, don't spend money on this game.","August 9, 2014","false","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After 45 minutes of playing it was so disappointing to deal with the large amount of wasted time in getting around to find what you need and changes you wanted to make quickly. Also, the battles seem to take up more time with the turns due to the fact the developer thought it would be nice to add more movable graphics to each card play and turn. It's a card game....not an mmo or action game.\n\nI understand its a new game and it should take time to adjust, but the whole point of playing another version of the same game is that it shouldn't change from the simplicity of its functions. 2014 imo gave you that.\n\nThe other thing I wish we could do with Magic the Gathering in general is actually build our own decks and play instead of dealing with the pre-made bull crap combo decks that "THEY" want us to play with.\n\nI had started playing Magic The Gathering during Unlimited and Revised editions, that was a long long time ago.

Secondly I've bought every single Duels of the planes walkers games on day 1. I greatly enjoyed every one of them until 2014. While 2013 was solid and I played through all the content, it did introduce the events. Ok they were boring and NOT what any duels player wanted...but they were few and far between...I forgave them.\n2014 came along and it was just plain bad...where as 2013 had a few events....2014 was only events with an actual AI fight here and there... I have never found a single player who has claimed to enjoy these events.\n\n2015 was announced and it sounded like it would be the second coming. Finally we can make our own decks. No more events right?!? Oh you can pay for cards now? well...you can earn them in game so ..thats good right? oh 30$ for the mega edition that just gives you every card? Let's go for that!!!\n\nWell turns out my 30$ bought me...some of the cards... Thats right, paying 3 times the base game price buys you SOME of the cards...not all. As far as I can see I got a premium booster for owning 2014 and another for preordering, but apart form those 2 if you want the cards they arbitrarily decided were "premium" you'll be forking out 2$ for a "CHANCE!" to get some of them..maybe... but that's 1 copy of it...need 4 for a deck idea? Well start forking out those 2$ buddy. Keeping in mind currently the competiton is Hearthstone, and that can be 100% free to play. Everything in hearthstone can be bought with in game gold.\n\nOh and the kicker btw...its just 2014 all over again...."beat these 4 events to face an actual AI". This is just pure and simply LAZY dev. The game should have been: Face off againt all that blocks starter decks as "minions" then face a boss with a constructed deck of that block. Beat the boss unlock the blocks cards to make decks with.\n\nI would recommend you stay away from this game and if you bought it...well..consider waiting next year before buying 2016....I know I will","July 19, 2014","false","26.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.\nEven then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.\nThe menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.\nThere is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.\n\nThe microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.\n\nThis time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€. As well as breaking multiplayer mode for people who are not willing to invest more money into the game.\n\nEven if you are a long time fan of the online Magic series, do not get this game.","July 25, 2014","false","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is plauged with game breaking bugs, such as the one where I have to turn off my internet connection in order to boot up the game, and then reconnect to have access to multiplayer. Or the fact that you dont have access to any card collections you purchased or preorder bonuses until you beat the first main boss, who is nigh impossible to beat, since every single player match is way too one sided in an effort to make you spend more money on cards. The entire game is not so much a Magic the Gathering game as it is a horrible pile of ♥♥♥♥ designed to make you waste more money, and even then, the "entire" card collections you can pay to unlock are just small underpowered portions of their real life counterparts, missing many signature cards, such as the Gods of Theros. The "game", if I could even call it that, is a blatant racket designed to make players continuously spend money just to beat what should be a fun and challenging single player mode, which is really a one sided slaughter where your opponent always has the perfect cards for every situation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warplockjezza/recommended/255420/","warplockjezza","[M&S] Raagentreg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warplockjezza/","232 products in account","As an experienced Magic player I find this game considerably underwhelming considering the past few DOTP series for many reasons. But first let's go over what's good:\n\n- I approve of the open card pool, i.e. the ability to choose any cards to go in any decks, this is a step forward in the series.\n- The UI in a game of magic is very clean and simple to use as ever, I do like the white theme with the red zone opening up for combat.\n- They give you a vast selection of decks to start with, 10 in total, which can be tailored to what you want to play.\n\nThat's honestly about it I'm afraid... Now for the cons... And be ready for this rant:\n\n- The intro decks, all of the ones I tried felt supremely underwhelming to play out of the gate, the R/W deck had problems because the creatures were too small to pass the final bit of the tutorial (Polis Crusher) As well as the R/G deck too, or what I experienced of them. I ended up taking the Black/Blue deck and just taking a very long time in beating that first challenge. Also I've had terrible mulligans several times which didn't help. However the fight to Avacyn was otherwise pretty painless and easy, probably lost once or twice on the way there.\n\n- Now the card pool itself feels very underwhelming indeed, and after looking through the cards there are some very glaring cards that should be in that aren't (This is assuming you have the complete collection and have beaten Avacyn, I'm ignoring the premium cards for this part) Looking through them the first big missing cards are Unsummon, Cancel, Divination, Doom Blade (or Murder), Searing Spear or similar (3 damage for two mana red instant), Runeclaw Bear, Llanowar Elf. These cards are all COMMON cards which are not present. Now these cards are not all powerful, they are very basic staple cards that represent each colour strongly (White was omitted here as they have a decent set of base cards)\n\n- What further hinders this is the limitations on the rarer cards, now I have heard WotC's arguement for this, which is they don't want it to be pay-2-win... But all the decent cards are locked away in premium packs, examples include, but are not limited to: Squadron Hawk, Stoneforge Mystic, Think Twice, Coral Barrier, Several Goblins which would make a Goblin deck possible, Doubling Season, The ENTIRE Paragon cycle, Blasting Station, Kozilek, etc... So despite WotC's arguement, it seems you MUST pay to get these premium packs to have a chance of obtaining these good cards, and seeing as it is £1.50 for 10 cards, you'd think that'd be ok, but the cost quickly racks up. So yes you can limit the card pool, but let it be 4 common, 4 uncommon, 3 rare, 2 Mythic, this would make decks much more consitent and more fun to play.\n\n-TL:DR for the last two paragraphs: Card are terrible unless you pay a premium for them, and even then they're underwhelming due to the restrictions in place with the 4C, 3U, 2R, 1M structure.\n\n- This problem above is componded with the fact the AI have better cards than you and use them constantly in super-synergistic decks, case in point the Orzhov deck in Ravnica setion. They have for starters the shocklands when we are given none to play with, making their deck consistent, and that alongside a deck made up pretty much purely of Extort cards and the undeniably powerful Grey merchant of Asphodel make this deck Extraordinarily aggravating to play against. I'm sorry but if you're going to flash the cards to us, at LEAST let us play with them, not make the AI arbitrarily better than us purely because they've got GOOD CARDS.\n\n- Also the Challenges from before? Not here, nope, gone, poof. Such a missed oppertunity, as I loved them from the previous versions.\n\n- And now for the final point which really kills the game for me, the UI anywhere BUT while playing... My goodness what a mess. It's slow and unresponsive to start, and when tabbed out, doesn't continue to load the next page (if in windowed mode) As well as you not being able to see all the options at once, unlike the old DOTP 2014 menu, which was miles better. This AND the necessity to "equip" the deck you want to use before going into the game make this incredibly infuriating, and have really forced me off the game.\n\nNow, my impressions are limited up to the beginning of Ravnica Part, specifically the "Orzhov Demand" Scenario, and I will probably carry on to the end of the campaign... Because I feel I owe my money that much, but please please PLEASE avoid this game and take any of the other Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers series, as they are VERY good games, this one though... This one is a MASSIVE dissapointment that lets the entire series down, and it's so sad from a game that I play which normally is so much fun to play!","July 24, 2014","false","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.\nEven then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.\nThe menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.\nThere is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.\n\nThe microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.\n\nThis time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€.

Secondly I've bought every single Duels of the planes walkers games on day 1. I greatly enjoyed every one of them until 2014. While 2013 was solid and I played through all the content, it did introduce the events. Ok they were boring and NOT what any duels player wanted...but they were few and far between...I forgave them.\n2014 came along and it was just plain bad...where as 2013 had a few events....2014 was only events with an actual AI fight here and there... I have never found a single player who has claimed to enjoy these events.\n\n2015 was announced and it sounded like it would be the second coming. Finally we can make our own decks. No more events right?!? Oh you can pay for cards now? well...you can earn them in game so ..thats good right? oh 30$ for the mega edition that just gives you every card? Let's go for that!!!\n\nWell turns out my 30$ bought me...some of the cards... Thats right, paying 3 times the base game price buys you SOME of the cards...not all. As far as I can see I got a premium booster for owning 2014 and another for preordering, but apart form those 2 if you want the cards they arbitrarily decided were "premium" you'll be forking out 2$ for a "CHANCE!" to get some of them..maybe... but that's 1 copy of it...need 4 for a deck idea? Well start forking out those 2$ buddy. Keeping in mind currently the competiton is Hearthstone, and that can be 100% free to play. Everything in hearthstone can be bought with in game gold.\n\nOh and the kicker btw...its just 2014 all over again...."beat these 4 events to face an actual AI". This is just pure and simply LAZY dev. The game should have been: Face off againt all that blocks starter decks as "minions" then face a boss with a constructed deck of that block. Beat the boss unlock the blocks cards to make decks with.\n\nI would recommend you stay away from this game and if you bought it...well..consider waiting next year before buying 2016....I know I will","July 19, 2014","false","26.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I even start, they removed the most played format, where previous MTG online games had things such as Archenemy, or planechase, you get my gist, there is none. No extra format and they even removed one. They've said its because it did not look well with the current design of the board, and that certain card interactions was too good. I can understand the second point, whereas the first being a terrible excuse.\nEven then, you do not remove such a feature for that reason, if you don't like the OP card interactions that can be made, its still better than removing such a beloved feature, far better.\nThe menu is absolutely abysmal, there is white everywhere, at all parts of the game, even after transition froma dark cinematic, which hurt my eyes. It is terribly wonky and slow to navigate with tablets being in mind and not the most used way to play it, computer. The fact that they try to make it work well on tablet is great, but again, really not the way to go. They could at least have made a few adjustments to the PC title.\nThere is still so much bad I could say about this game, but I am going to stop beating around the bush and get to the worst feature of the game, saving the best for last.\n\nThe microtransaction system. Previous titles let you pay a minor amount of money to unlock the entire deck instantly instead of unlocking cards for winning with the deck. As well as paying to get those cards in foil. They'd put a slightly higher charge, but nothing extreme on new decks added after the release of the game, long enough to justify releasing additional decks, as well as expansions. Sounds great to me. Previous titles had codes that'd be released now and then to unlock cards for all the decks. Accessible for everyone as far as I know.\n\nThis time around, they have put a incredibly high charge on unlocking all the cards you can unlock from playing the campaign, not too bad, no need to buy that really. But they have added promo packs, 15 packs at about 2€ or whatever currency you use. Bumping the DAY ONE price for full content in the game up to 40€. As well as breaking multiplayer mode for people who are not willing to invest more money into the game.\n\nEven if you are a long time fan of the online Magic series, do not get this game.","July 25, 2014","false","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrStrider/recommended/255420/","MrStrider","Mr. Strider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrStrider/","120 products in account","Let me make a brief disclaimer: I wanted to like this game. Desperately so. I've played Magic: the Gathering for a while now, and have gotten fairly good at it. I keep up with standard builds, set rotations, popular meta builds and have numerous real-life paper decks for anything from Modern to EDH. I really, really, wanted to like this game.\n\nBut, sadly, this game suffers from what I call, "Penny Rare Syndrome." It has a lot of flavor, and is fun initially, but you'll later find that if you spent more than a dollar on it, you're not getting your money's worth. On the surface, it looks like an epic concept: keeping in line with the lore behind the M15 Core Set release, Garruk, the wild planeswalker, has been possessed/corrupted by Liliana Vess, who is now in possession of the powerful Chain Veil. As a planeswalker learned and hardened by various journeys (i.e. the previous games), you embark on a journey to stop Garruk as he hunts down planeswalkers in a wild bloodlust.\n\nSounds cool, doesn't it? Chasing a crazed, homicidal woodsman as you both hop from plane to plane, narrowly missing each other in a dangerous game of cat and mouse? Well, unfortunately, that description is about as intense as it gets. Other than a smattering of graphic-novel stlye cutscenes that are criminally short, most of this "epic" quest is told in the form of text boxes. Boring. Old. Textboxes. I've played a lot of TCGs, I grew up with them. I've played some pretty good TCG video games as well. Portable games that give you a complete experience by letting you explore a world, build a deck, and battle all of your favorite characters, all the while sharpening your skills and becoming a better player.\n\nMagic 2015 is not those games. I know, it never really was, and expecting a massive genre-shift is not really a realistic expectation. But I cannot excuse how Magic 2015 somehow makes one of the most epic stories in the card gaming-world boring. Not delivering a genre-busting epic powerhouse of card-game-playing, open-world-exploring action is one thing: starting with a great premise and watering it down to nothing is another.\n\nNotice I haven't even mentioned the actual systems of the game yet? The deck building, the customization, the collecting, even the UI? There's a reason for that. And it's brief: They're poor. And that's even being too polite, some facets of the game are non-existant. Did you enjoy the sealed campaign from 2014? Gone. 2-Headed Giant? Gone. But hey, you can customize your own deck! Honestly I'd be ok even with that if the deck building wasn't the mess it is. The starter decks are laughably bad. Intro packs are more playable. And even intro packs come with two boosters to give you a shot at something better. Yes, you unlock "boosters" as you play through the game, but they're often pre-determined sets that will give you little if anything truly useful; often they're simpy bad cards that are just slightly less horrible than your current terrible cards. If you want the real heavy-hitters, you need to shell out more money. Yep. Micro transactions. Simply to have access to some of the at least marginally playable cards. That is where I draw the line. I was fine with the previous Magic iteration as it was a decently competent package in and of itself. Buy it cheap (while on sale) and you could have some fun toying with interesting deck concepts and goofing about with friends. But even on sale, I would have a hard time recommending Magic 2015, as the up-front price is essentially akin to paying an entrance fee to walk into a card shop: you're still going to have to pay for anything of value inside.\n\nI hope this game gets more love. I hope it improves. Implement better decks. Implement a way to build and shape your own Magic dream deck in a harmless vaccuum. This is not Magic Online. This is not Paper Magic. If you build here what would be a $250 standard deck for simply the cost of the game, who cares? Nothing in this game pertains to the actual economy of Magic. Nobody at a Pro Tour qualifier is going to pay any heed to my claims that I have my ace standard deck ready to go if it's simply a collection of pixels in my M:DotP 2015 digital deck queue. It is, again, a vaccuum.\n\nThis is the place where casual Magic players can escape to have fun. But, sadly, the game is far too engrossed in its potential profits to care. All I can do is hope that one day it will be fixed. But until then, I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend this game, especially with other far better options out there.","July 23, 2014","false","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unlike the majority of the reviews on here I actually enjoyed this game, putting in almost 17 hours since release. I'll go through a few positives and negatives:\n\n- Clunky, touch optimized interface\n- Grindy nature of collecting all the cards\n- A small subset are premium cards, which you need to buy 14 booster packs to unlock\n- Forces you to pick a deck at the start without knowing any of the cards, then restricts all customization options until you beat the first plane\n- Most of the starter decks are borderline unplayable\n\n+ Full deck customization i.e. you can make a deck using any of the 976 cards\n+ Premium cards aren't any more powerful than the normal cards\n+ Limits each deck to 1 of any mythic, 2 of any rare, 3 of any uncommon and 4 of any common card, so people that have just bought all the cards don't have as much of an advantage\n+ Multiplayer mode is very fun\n\nAs you can see there are a lot of negatives for this game. The most frustrating part for me was they should either give you the option to change your deck after you've beaten the tutorial with it, or tell you that your choice was final and you won't ever be able to change it again. Luckily the deck I chose was strong enough to beat the campaign with, but if I'd have been stuck with a garbage deck from the start it would make progressing through the campaign to unlock decent cards almost impossible. You don't get a large enough range of cards to make any actual other types of decks until you've pretty much completed the campaign mode unless you get lucky through boosters.\n\nOverall I found the game very fun since I didn't have any problems completing the campaign, and the grind to unlock the cards wasn't that bad for me. I'm really enjoying the large variety of fun decks you can make on this game, and trying them out against people online is very fun. I haven't spent anything more than the original asking price and am having just as much fun competing with people online as I do with the deck's I've spent 100's on MTGO. Of course the game only contains a finite number of cards so the online meta will get figured out soon enough and the game will become stale and boring, but until then I'm getting a lot of value out of the small purchase price.","July 17, 2014","true","44.3"," 108 of 210 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","108","210","0","4"

In previous Magic games (2012, 2013, 2014, all of which I own and enjoy) the pre-constructed decks were great for players like me because we had a playable base and we could tweak those decks with some cards. Currently, creating a deck from scratch is rather hard and I can hardly enjoy the game because I am stuck with the same deck and this means I cannot beat some decks (those with flying creatures, just as an example).\nIt might be nice if a future DLC provided us n00bs with a number of basic decks we could then tweak with the few cards we have been able to obtain through boosters.

Basically, all there is is multiplayer (free-for-all only) and campaign mode which is too short on it's own and becomes really easy really quick.\n\n3. The starting decks are a joke. There is no other way to say it. They're literally the worst decks I've ever seen, and trust me, I've seen some really bad decks. In fact, they're worse than the $15 starters you can buy in real life. (If you're a MTG player already, you know what I mean.) Just how bad? They're packed with heaps of common creatures with no special abilities and almost no spells. Playing the first portion of the campaign is literally painful.\n\n4. You get treated like a baby. If you've played MTG before you can skip the tutorial, but you still have to beat the tutorial boss. Then, after that, you aren't allowed to customize your decks until you beat the first "real" boss of the campaign.\n\n5. The difficulty curve is totally skewed. In the begining, before you unlock enough cards, the game is IMPOSSIBLE. Even though the AI's are utterly stupid and easu, the computer is allowed to have much better cards than you. Then, later on when you unlock a few cards, the game becomes trivial because the AI sucks too badly.\n\n6. Microtransactions. Instead of paying $1 to unlock a cool deck like the earlier games, you have to pay $5 to unlock a set. Even if you do, you don't actually get very many cards and most of them suck. It's such a huge rip-off.\n\nSo basically, WOTC sold out. This game was clearly made with minimal effort and is obviously a lazy grab for more money. I pre-ordered it because I LOVE MTG and have been playing for years, including all the PC games, and now I feel like an idiot. Don't let your judgement be clouded just because it says "Magic."","July 18, 2014","false","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For example, aside from the expansion pack, cards are no longer locked behind paywalls (though they do require multiplayer play - which may put off some). In addition, the expansion bringing in new cards has done a remarkable thing for the depth of the card pool and possible strategies - 70-120 or so new cards are much more impressive in a game with true, free deck building.\n\nThat said, I still cannot recommend this game over the previous installments unless you already own them and are looking for something a little new, for all of its flaws))\n\n\n\nI am currently an avid MTG player, having been brought in to the game via DoTP 2013 about two years ago, but mostly playing physical tournaments and drafts at my local store.\n\nPrevious Duels of the Planeswalkers games were great ways to learn the game and some examples of cards and strategies from it, as well as experience a non-competetive, easy matchmaking service and a nice little progression aspect, even with a little light story thrown in. Ultimately, they were all greatly restricted in scope, mostly to avoid treading on the toes of MTG Online and the physical card game - Duels is, and always will be, an advertisement for the CCG and a great tutorial with some fun games to be had.\n\nThis newest iteration allows you to build decks from scratch with the full pool of cards - something that, shockingly, was never in the previous 'modify an existing deck' design of the series - and has a slightly stronger story and cinematics than the previous ones, in my own opinion. It showcases some nice mechanics and visuals, and has EXCELLENT AI at the highest difficulties (with one or two questionable judgements every now and then), given the complexity of the game. The game also has some nice artworks and background lore/information for people new to the MTG universe, who are so interested.\n\nHowever. Even without DLC or Expansions, large amounts of cards are strictly locked behind a paywall. PvP players will note a distinct lack of multiplayer modes compared to previous games, and people seeking to grind cards to complete their collection and enhance the number of strategies will find the largely randomized nature of card acquiring to be infuriating - particularly since previous games allowed you to see which cards, in sequence, you'll unlock for each deck. The UI, while pretty, is clunky frequently when navigated with a mouse, scroll wheel and/or keyboard, likely a mark against the limited effort putting in to porting this game year in year out, when it appears to be gaining traction on tablets/iPad more than anything else.\n\nFinally, the card pool is...horrifically shallow. Multiple strategies exist, certainly, but its smaller than any previous Duels game - even before the DLC and expansions are taken into account, EVEN if you include this game's paid-only 'premium' cards. In addition, previous modes and game formats have been completely stripped from the game, and some of the most interesting mechanics in the planes/blocks/sets the game features are completely absent - or at least, not available to players, only the AI.\n\nAll things considered, this series has taken one step forward and two, three or four steps back. There was never really a noticeable improvement with this series, year by year, but for long time fans this is, frankly, insulting. To call this an 'iterative' series is doing the word a disservice, as 'iterative' implies some kind of development, improvement or progression, which this game lacks. Just buy one of the older ones - there's no reason to get this one for a lot of people.","July 19, 2014","false","49.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is no lobby for multiplayer. Playing with a friend? Too bad, cause you get booted to main menu after every match. There is no deck switching very easily before matches, you need to find it in the menu to switch, then renavigate to the multiplayer menu, all this takes very long with the horrid UI.\n\n+ No 2HG: This is a big one. The cut out this loved game mode. Now there is only 1v1 and 4v4. No one plays 3v3. Worse yet, there was no good reasoning behind it besides the fact one dev didnt like it according to his AMA on reddit. Shame on you.\n\n+ The campaign: Its frustrating when you are given a crap starting deck and faced with a well thought out deck that is stacked. They are stacked to combo as best they can against you. It doesnt feel like a good match, but rather just you hoping you can get lucky enough to win and unlock more cards to make you suck deck suck less.\n\nSome of the AI decks are just plain cheap.\n\n+ Card pool again. This time relating to cards the AI has and can play with, but are not available to you, even though they are in the game! Garruks awesome deck will never be available to make.\n\n+ More on card pool, there are very very few multi-colored cards, and few artifacts. The game is meant to play mono or dual color, limited choice even more.\n\n+ More on card pool. Premium boosters. The 300 card pool was a lie pretty much. You get 255 cards, unless you want to pay 3x the base game cost to unlock the rest.\n\n+ Chat. It is slow, unresponsive, and when its open, you can't interact with the game at all. So get ready to miss pausing for a counter spell if you want to chat in game.\n\n+ Bugs. Reported bugs for crashing. I have experienced crashes after a multiplayer game has ended.\n\nOverall, this is a terrible release and year for DotP. Worth $10? Maybe, but with the frustrations that come with this pile, I'm regretting a little. I would def not spend any more than $10 to be sure.\n\nEdit - what im really regretting is the poor job they have done with the game. I want to like it, I want it to work, but there are just so many flaws.","July 19, 2014","false","98.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To unlock all the cards in the game, it takes a ridiculous amount of wins. This wouldn't be a problem if they gave you cards that would help with the deck you chose. They essentially try to force you into paying more money to unlock all the cards. Which is another $20 for all the blocks, or $5 for one, which would total $25, and to get the premium cards, you have to buy boosters which are $2 each. Oh, they also got rid of all the extra game modes, so its just generic magic now. They also don't even give you all the cards from each block, its only specific selection. Basically this feels like it is only a quarter of the way done.

You play against the AI and think "Wow, that deck seems really cool!" and then realize you can't build anything that comes close to it.

There are other things that make this a bad game. Here are my complains:\n\n1- When you start, you pick a combination of two colors. You're given a deck in that combination and you must start with it. When you win you earn cards. Simple, right? Well, not that much. This starting deck is awful (no matter what combination you picked, they all s.u.c.k. I just can talk about two combinations, but for what I've read in other reviews, it's the same for everything else), so you may need to play a lot before winning. And when you start winning you're given like 2 cards. Seriously. Just until you beat the first "boss" you are awarded with more than 10 cards per match, which is cool, or well, would be cool if the cards were useful.\n\n2- The card pool is poor. there are few cards and the ones available are mostly bad cards. You must play a good while until you have enough cards to customize your starting deck, let alone build one from scratch. You start with 26 lands, which seems an awful lot for me, and that get you constantly mana flowed. Go figure: at the beggining you are so limited that almost half your deck is lands. You can disable auto land-filling in the options if you want to change that, which will be useful until you have something decent to replace the lands you take out. Also, (this may be just my skill level), I have not been able to create a deck that stands good against all opponents. I know this is, almost by definition, impossible, but in previous year's Duels, the decks were more or less balanced and had some rather solid base that allowed you to build your strategy against different opponents, which meant that any single deck was able to overcome the complete campaign. In Duels 2015, I have been in the need of making an entire specific deck for a specific opponent. Try to  use that deck against the next one, and you're screwed. There's few (if any) flexibility.\n\n3- The description of the starter decks is crap. Take this: the red-black one is supposed to be FOCUSED in stealing your opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for your own benefit. Cool sounding? Well, in your 60 cards deck (26 of  which are lands, remember) there are 2 cards that steal creatures from your enemy and 2 that can get some benefit of it. Good luck making that "strategy" work.\n\n4- The menus are awful, you have to stupidly scroll through it, instead of a convenient and simple list as was Duels 2014 main menu. It takes a lot of scroll to get anywhere. Selecting your deck is a long tedious process, instead of being able to simply pick a deck at the beggining of a match. Are those menus good for tablets? so some people say, but I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥, I'm using a PC. And even if I were using a tablet, I'd prefer a simple list that lets me see all that is available in a menu. Also, sometimes when you click, the game does not respond, forcing you to click for a second or third time before something actually happens.\n\n5- Microtransactions. This is not particulary bad for me, since I never make in-game purchases in any game. But be aware that if you want all the possible cards, the price of the game goes, in total, to $40.\n\n6- No extra game-modes. Just campaign and free for all. I loved the coop two headed giant, now it's gone.\n\n7- Decks in campaign mode have access to a totally different card pool than the one you have, usually with cards much stronger than the ones you have. Take this example: a match against slivers. On turn 5 i was crushed by 5 trampling slivers, the weakest being 5/5. It took me like 6 tries to beat the slivers. And do you get some slivers for your pool after winning? Nope, you don't.\n\nThis game had a huge potential, and it was totally wasted. Not buying next year's. They have lost a fan.","August 11, 2014","false","36.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is no lobby for multiplayer. Playing with a friend? Too bad, cause you get booted to main menu after every match. There is no deck switching very easily before matches, you need to find it in the menu to switch, then renavigate to the multiplayer menu, all this takes very long with the horrid UI.\n\n+ No 2HG: This is a big one. The cut out this loved game mode. Now there is only 1v1 and 4v4. No one plays 3v3. Worse yet, there was no good reasoning behind it besides the fact one dev didnt like it according to his AMA on reddit. Shame on you.\n\n+ The campaign: Its frustrating when you are given a crap starting deck and faced with a well thought out deck that is stacked. They are stacked to combo as best they can against you. It doesnt feel like a good match, but rather just you hoping you can get lucky enough to win and unlock more cards to make you suck deck suck less.\n\nSome of the AI decks are just plain cheap.\n\n+ Card pool again. This time relating to cards the AI has and can play with, but are not available to you, even though they are in the game! Garruks awesome deck will never be available to make.\n\n+ More on card pool, there are very very few multi-colored cards, and few artifacts. The game is meant to play mono or dual color, limited choice even more.\n\n+ More on card pool. Premium boosters. The 300 card pool was a lie pretty much. You get 255 cards, unless you want to pay 3x the base game cost to unlock the rest.\n\n+ Chat. It is slow, unresponsive, and when its open, you can't interact with the game at all. So get ready to miss pausing for a counter spell if you want to chat in game.\n\n+ Bugs. Reported bugs for crashing. I have experienced crashes after a multiplayer game has ended.\n\nOverall, this is a terrible release and year for DotP. Worth $10? Maybe, but with the frustrations that come with this pile, I'm regretting a little. I would def not spend any more than $10 to be sure.\n\nEdit - what im really regretting is the poor job they have done with the game. I want to like it, I want it to work, but there are just so many flaws.","July 19, 2014","false","98.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For example, aside from the expansion pack, cards are no longer locked behind paywalls (though they do require multiplayer play - which may put off some). In addition, the expansion bringing in new cards has done a remarkable thing for the depth of the card pool and possible strategies - 70-120 or so new cards are much more impressive in a game with true, free deck building.\n\nThat said, I still cannot recommend this game over the previous installments unless you already own them and are looking for something a little new, for all of its flaws))\n\n\n\nI am currently an avid MTG player, having been brought in to the game via DoTP 2013 about two years ago, but mostly playing physical tournaments and drafts at my local store.\n\nPrevious Duels of the Planeswalkers games were great ways to learn the game and some examples of cards and strategies from it, as well as experience a non-competetive, easy matchmaking service and a nice little progression aspect, even with a little light story thrown in. Ultimately, they were all greatly restricted in scope, mostly to avoid treading on the toes of MTG Online and the physical card game - Duels is, and always will be, an advertisement for the CCG and a great tutorial with some fun games to be had.\n\nThis newest iteration allows you to build decks from scratch with the full pool of cards - something that, shockingly, was never in the previous 'modify an existing deck' design of the series - and has a slightly stronger story and cinematics than the previous ones, in my own opinion. It showcases some nice mechanics and visuals, and has EXCELLENT AI at the highest difficulties (with one or two questionable judgements every now and then), given the complexity of the game. The game also has some nice artworks and background lore/information for people new to the MTG universe, who are so interested.\n\nHowever. Even without DLC or Expansions, large amounts of cards are strictly locked behind a paywall. PvP players will note a distinct lack of multiplayer modes compared to previous games, and people seeking to grind cards to complete their collection and enhance the number of strategies will find the largely randomized nature of card acquiring to be infuriating - particularly since previous games allowed you to see which cards, in sequence, you'll unlock for each deck. The UI, while pretty, is clunky frequently when navigated with a mouse, scroll wheel and/or keyboard, likely a mark against the limited effort putting in to porting this game year in year out, when it appears to be gaining traction on tablets/iPad more than anything else.\n\nFinally, the card pool is...horrifically shallow. Multiple strategies exist, certainly, but its smaller than any previous Duels game - even before the DLC and expansions are taken into account, EVEN if you include this game's paid-only 'premium' cards. In addition, previous modes and game formats have been completely stripped from the game, and some of the most interesting mechanics in the planes/blocks/sets the game features are completely absent - or at least, not available to players, only the AI.\n\nAll things considered, this series has taken one step forward and two, three or four steps back. There was never really a noticeable improvement with this series, year by year, but for long time fans this is, frankly, insulting. To call this an 'iterative' series is doing the word a disservice, as 'iterative' implies some kind of development, improvement or progression, which this game lacks. Just buy one of the older ones - there's no reason to get this one for a lot of people.","July 19, 2014","false","49.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then, after that, you aren't allowed to customize your decks until you beat the first "real" boss of the campaign.\n\n5. The difficulty curve is totally skewed. In the begining, before you unlock enough cards, the game is IMPOSSIBLE. Even though the AI's are utterly stupid and easu, the computer is allowed to have much better cards than you. Then, later on when you unlock a few cards, the game becomes trivial because the AI sucks too badly.\n\n6. Microtransactions. Instead of paying $1 to unlock a cool deck like the earlier games, you have to pay $5 to unlock a set. Even if you do, you don't actually get very many cards and most of them suck. It's such a huge rip-off.\n\nSo basically, WOTC sold out. This game was clearly made with minimal effort and is obviously a lazy grab for more money. I pre-ordered it because I LOVE MTG and have been playing for years, including all the PC games, and now I feel like an idiot.

You can only have 1 mythic rarity card and 2 rare rarity cards in your deck at any given time. Why they decided to do this I have no idea but it doesn't accurately represent the freedom that MTG gives players. If they wanted to do something like this for balance sake it should have been a separate mode within the game. MTG 2014 and 2013 don't work like this and it is a major failing of MTG 2015 to force this restriction on its players.\n\nAs much as I'd really like to give this a recommendation I just can't. At its core MTG2015 is a good game. Just like... all of the past games in the series. The reason why I can't recommend this 'good game' is that it lacks some major features.\n\nFirst of all there is no two-headed giant game mode. This really shuts out the demographic that enjoys playing team games over free for all.\n\nSecond you do not unlock cards via multiplayer. This is a major bummer because, I mean heck, MTG is primarily played for its multiplayer component. Forcing people to grind in random CPU matches for more cards is a major frustration. It forces people into the premium shop to buy boosters at 1.99 each... Which brings me to the next issue.\n\nAsking players to pay for boosters is one thing, but restricting access to certain cards is another. There are something like 300 cards available for the players to get. 300... Now I understand that the MTG2015 core set only has 269 cards but this is a video game. We should have access to a lot more than just the core set. Even if each expansion cost another 5-10 bucks. Avid MTG fans would pay it. Here you'll find yourself playing against decks with some truly awesome cards.. that you can't get... and in a lot of cases you'll get stomped early on because of this.\n\nIn the future, if we see lots of restricted cards added to the mix, and multiplayer fixed I'd totally recommend this.","July 16, 2014","false","4.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is very different.  After you've complete the training, the game prompts you to pick a deck.  Sad thing is that if you ened up not liking the deck, you cannot , repeat, cannot change decks.  Now, if you win a game, it gives you some booster cards (around 5 or so)... thus I expect that you are supposed to build new decks from thiem. Oh yeah, wizards finally got on to the "pay-to-play" sceme, where if you ytally want to modify your decks, you pay a lot and then get them.  This, my friends, creates a huge gap between people who can "afford" the game, and those who can't.  I have to be honest - I feel ripped off by the game.\n\nSo, would I refer this game to a friend? Absolutely NOT.  I'd advise them to play Magic 2014\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is an update on my review.  After playing for well over 100 hours on this game, I have unlocked every card possible - outside of premium. I've won over 100 multiplayer matches, beat the campaign, everything. But guess what? There are cards that I cannot use because I refuse to pay more money for a computer game I PURCHASED and should have everything unlocked already! I don't know if wizards is hurting for money or not, but it I have baught the game, I should have access to all features. I was fine with 2014's option to purchase other DECKS, but come on, this is down right silly. And personally, I feel ripped off. I do have to add, though, that as you progress further into the game, you can unlock new decks. But again, this isn't like 2014, where one deck is a theme of cards and you place the ones you want for your complete deck. No, these seem to be only *guidelines* where you can still build any deck any way you want. Honestly, I'm getting pretty sick and tired of losing games to players, where I had them beat, but they pull out some premium card and end up beating me. The one card that comes to mind is a 12/12 4 annihilation card. Yeah folks, that's right, the only way you'll EVER have access to it is if you decide to give wizards more of your hard earned cash and BUY IT! And unlike the trading card game, you do NOT get an actual copy of the card in the mail, so when a new games comes out, or wizard decides to stop supporting this game, all that money you spent is worthless. So really, Magic 2015 is a PAY-TO-WIN game! If you're rich, or don't mind throwing money down the tube, then this game may be for you. But with the money grubing scheme, the complete absense of 2v2 games, and a very crappy interface (seriously, you have to wait for some stupid cloud animation to finish on EVERY PAGE before you can click to continue), this game is really a major step down from the last!\n\nAnd finally, I also want to note that the game is buggy as hell. The one card (can't remember its name) - an enchantment where if you have or are tied for the greatest power, you draw an extra card, well its broken. I've been in MANY games where I've had the most powerful creatures (many of them) and STILL the other player gets an auto card draw! Also, the angel card that resets your life to 20 sometimes doesn't work, giving the other player INFINITE life and forcing a loss on the other player.

Having to pick ONE beginning deck and being stuck with it is beyond ridiculous.  If you make a bad choice the only way to escape this quagmire is to buy "Premium packs" from WOTC.   While I made a good choice for my first deck, some of my friends did not.  They're stuck in situations where they can either lose every game they try to play to unlock cards, or they can purchase these Premium packs.  To me, this sems like nothing more than an underhanded attempt to extort more money out of players.\n\n2.) They removed the Two-Headed Giant option.  This feature was the entire reason I played the game.  If I had known this had been removed, I never would have purchased the game.  Lesson learned: Read Reviews.  I feel fairly confident this was ono of the most popular features of the game, so its removal perplexes me.\n\n3.) The aforementioned Premium packs contain cards that are inaccessible otherwise.  While I applaud later expansions adding new decks to the game, the initial purchase should allow the player to have ACCESS to the entire game (minus foils and other fluff features that some may choose to spring for).  If someone wants to pay to unlock cards without having to "grind" for them, that option should be available as well.\n\nOverall, I view this edition as little more than a money grab, and quite frankly flipping off the player base.  Do not buy unless WOTC significantly addresses these issues.","July 20, 2014","false","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That and the seemingly random selection of cards with very little cohesion makes themed decks very restricted..so while they took a step in deck building freedom the tiny pool of cards is incredibly hindering the actual number of useful decks you can build. Premium packs in general are idiotic in general since when 2016 comes out you have to start all over and pay all over again, at that rate you might as well play MTG online.\n\nMultiplayer is a blatant miss, it's almost like they threw it in at the last minute and had absolutely no focus on it. 2 headed giant removed which was a huge bonus for 2014. You can't swap decks inbetween duels which leads to most people just scooping up the fight and leaving before it's done as soon as they feel (or know) they've lost.. no reason to stick around if a deck completely crushes yours since you can't swap decks inbetween fights, you've to leave the current game then change decks before joining a new one.   This is crushing to me considering multiplayer extends the life of games like these dramatically, with most of the cards unlocked I'm finding little point besides unlocking the rest before tossing the game away and shrugging off 2016.\n\nGive the game 1.5 out of 5 stars. Singleplayer is still there and they attempted to move into the right direction with deck customization, but the multiplayer was murdered, extra content removed, premium packs required for vastly improving deck building options.\n\nChallenges no longer a part of duel of the planeswalker?

I have very mixed feelings about it.\n\nFirst off, I love the Duels of the Planeswalkers series. Most of my friends are too “poor” (or just cheap) to get into actual paper Magic with me. The closest FNM location to me is almost an hour drive away and I end up spending more of fuel than I do paying at the door. A group of acquaintances play regularly but they're too casual, and that's coming from a casual player. So while I enjoy collecting Magic cards I seldom have anyone of my same caliber to play with. DotP is great for my friends an I because while they can't afford to spend the money necessary to build a strong deck, they can buy this game though sales or ask for it as a gift. In short, this is how I get my Magic fix.\n\nOver the past few installments there have been some serious changes. Starting with D12, the game didn't allow you to remove cards from the base deck, meaning if you wanted to add anything you'd end up with a 60+ card deck, and the balance was chaotic (but still fun). D13 introduced a far more balanced environment to play in, as well as the ability to truly change each deck any way you wanted, removing base cards and replacing them with newly unlocked ones. D14's balance and deck structures were a step down from those of D13, but the game had a more story focused approach and featured the Sealed Play game mode which paved the way for D15.\n\nAnd lo, D15 is finally here.\n\nTypical of Wizards, information on the game was either sketchy or non-existent. I had to take everything I heard about the game with a dose of salt. A few things caught my eye, those being the entire game would be run in the Sealed format and 2HG wasn't going to be in the game. Hooray for the first, boo for the second. These opened up a flood of questions: How do we unlock cards? How does the campaign work? What do I do if I unpack really bad cards? WHY ARE YOU REMOVING TWO-HEADED GIANT?\n\nWizards score for answering these questions before the release: 0-4\n\nMoral of the story being don't expect much from the Wizards PR department when it comes to DotP.\n\nEven with these and many more questions looming about, I still pre-ordered the game. Thankfully, when the game was released most of these questions solved themselves. As the game begins, you are placed into a tutorial that walks you though the five colors, creatures, instants/soceries, enchantments, artifacts, lands, etc., etc. This tutorial is clearly for new players, but I appreciated it none the less. At the end of the tutorial, the player picks from any two combinations of colors. I opted for Black/Red, but not before I experimented with each of the combinations. For some reason, Wizards decided that the final fight in the tutorial should be hard as balls, especially if you're on Planeswalker difficulty. Not fun. Once you finally muscle your way through that, though, the game is much more enjoyable.\n\nUpon defeating the tutorial, the next chapter in the campaign is unlocked and ready to play. The player travels to Innistrad and duels several different challengers themed around that plane. For some reason, the first challenge in this chapter was the hardest for me, which was very discouraging considering you have very few options as far as deck editing are concerned. As you progress through the chapter, you unlock several booster packs which add 1 or 3 cards to your pool (which makes finishing the chapter much more manageable) until you beat the final boss of that level. Once Innistrad is complete, the player is allowed to open any Premium boosters they have purchased (More on these later.)\n\nMoving on from Innistrad, the player has the option of tackling the Theros chapter or returning to the main menu to edit their deck or even create a new one with the cards they have unlocked so far (Finally!).\n\nAs soon as the player finishes the Innistrad chapter, the game truly begins. Your options as far as deck creation widen, you can farm for booster unlocks, change your persona and title, or battle others online. However, pushing past both the tutorial and Innistrad can be very disheartening, so I encourage any of you who are hung up on this part to continue giving it your all until the real game begins.\n\nNow. Let's tackle a few of the negative comments on the game I've seen so far:\n\nTwo-Headed Giant\nYes, there's no 2HG mode in the game, which sucks. However, the public outcry at this during the development was severe, and I can't imagine Wizards won't throw us a bone and add it as a DLC or expansion.\n\nPremium Boosters (AKA Pay-2-Win Boosters)\nYes. They're pay to win. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. These boosters cost $1.99 and unlock 10 new cards for you, featuring a few you can't get from regular boosters. Playing the campaign without them is hard, but read my comments on Card Collections first.\n\nCard Collections\nIn the store you can purchase each of the five card collections (Innistrad, Ravnica, Theros, Zendikar, and Shandalar) which will unlock all of the non-premium cards from that collection for you without having to grind them. I pre-ordered the edition of the game that came with these collections, and I highly regret it. Grinding out boosters is a part of the game, just like playing to win boosters from FNM is a part of the experience of paper Magic. Now read “Card Collections or Premium Boosters?”\n\nCard Collections of Premium Boosters?\nAs I said, the cards came unlocked for me, which I regret. Personally, I enjoy the part of the game where you have to grind out new cards to improve your deck, and I really really miss that. I would actually recommend buying Pay-2-Win Boosters over purchasing a Card Collection.\n\nThe card pool is too small!\nYes, the card pool is pretty small, but that's what expansions are for! In the past games, Wizards has released expansions featuring several new decks to play with. Since there aren't per-constructed decks for you to use, I'm calling it now: Wizards will release expansions featuring new Card Collections for players to unlock!\n\nEdit 1:\nAs I continue to derp about with deck creation, I keep thinking to myself how limited the pool is. There are a few combinations that work really well, such as BR Control/Sacrifice, GW Landfall, Pure U Control, and even BW Lifegain. The problem is once you've seen that particular strategy, there's not much you can do to create a better variation of that. Now, some of the different strategies are really fun to mess with, like Pyxis of Pandamonium Landfall, or RGU/UBR Defender, but they get old pretty fast. I've started equating this to playing paper Magic within only one expansion. Right now, D15 only has the first part of a three part expansion (I hope, anyway), so it's like playing with only Return to Ravnica or Theros expansion cards, leaving out the rest of the block. The more I play, the more I want to reinstall D13. Heck, I'd even reinstall D14 for the custom mod decks.\n\nThe sad, sad irony of D15 is that this is EXACTLY what the player base has been asking for. In my opinion, DotP should stay as far away from MTGO as possible, but MTGO could be made to look a little more like DotP.","July 18, 2014","false","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you choose an option, it has to have this fog envelop the screen first before showing you you wanted to go. This gets so frustrating after a while, especially when you figure out that your deck you get for the first time was utter ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThat leads into ANOTHER problem with this game, the decks. You'd think for an intro deck, it should be pretty good against your enemies for the first time and it IS pretty cool that you can get booster packs from defeating enemies. That's where the problem comes in. On the first enemy I had to face, I lost so many times with my first deck. I was getting nothing but land for the first few games, then nothing but spells and creatures for the next few games. The only way I was able to win was because the enemy started to draw nothing but lands. And that's the case with A LOT of these enemies, there will be a lot of games that you will win because the enemy hit a mana vein or is getting nothing but creatures. If you beat these enemies, you get a booster pack, which is pretty cool, but ONLY when you beat an enemy. If you want a booster pack, you have to use REAL money to pay for them. If I wanted to pay for magic cards, I would have actually have gotten my cards from a game store and used them to play the actual game.\n\nIt's fun after the first few minutes of the game, but it gets frustrating and painful to play after that. My recomendation is to go out and buy a deck box or some booster pack instead of playing this train wreck of a game.\n\n1/10\nThere is no pit in hell hot enough to burn this game.","July 23, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having to pick ONE beginning deck and being stuck with it is beyond ridiculous.  If you make a bad choice the only way to escape this quagmire is to buy "Premium packs" from WOTC.   While I made a good choice for my first deck, some of my friends did not.  They're stuck in situations where they can either lose every game they try to play to unlock cards, or they can purchase these Premium packs.  To me, this sems like nothing more than an underhanded attempt to extort more money out of players.\n\n2.) They removed the Two-Headed Giant option.  This feature was the entire reason I played the game.  If I had known this had been removed, I never would have purchased the game.  Lesson learned: Read Reviews.  I feel fairly confident this was ono of the most popular features of the game, so its removal perplexes me.\n\n3.) The aforementioned Premium packs contain cards that are inaccessible otherwise.  While I applaud later expansions adding new decks to the game, the initial purchase should allow the player to have ACCESS to the entire game (minus foils and other fluff features that some may choose to spring for).  If someone wants to pay to unlock cards without having to "grind" for them, that option should be available as well.\n\nOverall, I view this edition as little more than a money grab, and quite frankly flipping off the player base.

Other than the beautiful yet short cinematics and the fact that the game is a licensed Magic: The Gathering product, there are very few positive things to say about this game.\n\nThe user-interface is done in a clunky, slide-show format, making only four options visible on the menu at a single time. Numerous game modes present in prior editions have been removed. The Two-Headed Giant (cooperative) format for multiplayer will be the most noticeable for many players, who probably purchased the game for multiplayer games. The Challenges (puzzles) and Revenge Campaign - a second campaign with more difficult opponents, which appears after the completion of the original Campain mode - are also no longer present.\n\nThe largest and most noticeable change to the game is the way decks are chosen and constructed. The prior editions of DotP contained numerous pre-constructed decks. The player unlocked additional cards for your deck by playing and winning with it. the player would then use the cards you received to improve their deck, win more, and repeat the cycle. In Magic 2015, this is no longer the case. Decks are now individual constructed by the player from a card pool. With every win, you unlock boosters, which contain new cards for your card pool. Besides who makes the deck, it would still seem that the player win cards to improve their deck to win more cards. This is not the case however.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about the prior DotP games was the pre-constructed decks. The decks were mostly balanced and - barring a few exceptions - almost all of them were playable with zero cards unlocked. This was great for new players. They could learn the mechanics of the game without being punished for lack of experience with deck construction. Many of the decks were well constructed and included cards that I simply cannot afford to play in real life. This was great for experienced players on a budget, such as myself. The deck construction was constricted, but that kind of constriction prevented too large of a metagame from forming. I'll stop lamenting, but I guess my favorite part of the old DotP games is that every deck was playable to everyone, regardless of a player's skill level.\n\nWith Magic 2015, the player starts the game by choosing a deck archetype composed of two colours. Once the player chooses their deck, they are stuck with it. These are the only cards that they're going to have to play with until deck construction opens up. This is not a good thing for new players, who will be stuck if their skill level is not enough to overcome the handicap of terrible cards. Once a player has won a few matches, they will have unlocked a few booster packs. The cards in the packs by this point will likely not be enough to make a new deck, and if so, not one of any value. In fact, one of my largest issues with the game as a whole was that the card pool was terrible. Green decks have Cultivate, but no Rampant Growth. Red decks have Shock and Bolt of Keranos, but no Lightning Bolt. Black decks have Assassinate, but no Doom Blade. Griselbrand is all but unplayable in a Black-Green deck designed to get him onto the field.\n\nRegardless of how terrible the cards in the card pool comes my other large issue with the game - the metagame. The other DotP games had a metagame, but it is much more mild than the metagame of Magic 2015. This game's metagame is similar to that of Block constructed. In time, only certain decks will be viable in multiplayer, making multiple other decks and cards unplayable. By creating a card pool with flexibility, Wizards of the Coast only limited the amount of playable cards even further.\n\nIf you want other decks to be useful, then you may have to pay. Pay real life cash. Monocolour decks benefit greatly from their respective Paragon, and a Five colour deck is only justifiable with Maelstrom Angel. These cards are only available in a Premium Booster, which are two dollars a piece with no other way to unlock them. I would have rather payed $20 for a game with all of the card unlockable in game, than $10 for a less than complete game. If you want a card game where your cards are determined by chance, you have infinite flexibility of card construction, a strict metagame, and pay real money for cards then play Magic the Gathering Online. It has all of that and more.\n\nIn short, Magic 2015 falls short of Magic 2014 by trying to be Magic Online. Magic 2015 has less features, a terrible card pool, a strict metagame, and a pay to win mentality. It is neither a true DotP game or MTGO/MODO. If you want to play real Magic in a digital format, then invest in MTGO/MODO. If you want to play a smooth game with smooth decks, get Magic 2014.\n\nPositive:\n- Beautiful cinematics\n- Magic: The Gathering licensing\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Poor user interface\n- Poor deck construction\n- Poor card pool\n- Locked content\n- Removed cooperative multiplayer\n- Removed Revenge campaign\n- Removed challenge feature","July 28, 2014","false","70.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The interface is annoying and clunky. It forced me into the first round of the tutorial before I was able to find the 'skip' button. You are forced to choose 1 starting deck with no information on it other than a very vague description and the colors.\n\nThat's where the real problem is, the starting deck IS AWFUL. You will be frustrated out of the gate with how horribly underpowered your cards are. Giving you bad cards does not make the game challenge it makes it unfun and annoying. You will be constantly conceding out of the box as you will need to get a near-perfect draw to be competitive with the AI. Even then sometimes you will have a good inital draw then flame out too quickly afterwards and have to start over yet again.\n\nAnyone who's played magic knows that luck is involved but with a decent deck the unlucky draws are somewhat minimalized. When you have just crap cards then you are fighting an uphill battle from the start.\n\nI suspect all of this is caused by the new deck building / microtransaction system. Yes the one thing I always pined for in previous versions was a decent deck builder and finally we have it.. but at the cost of needing to get a constant flow of cards to make the game playable. You have 2 options to get cards.. you can win them by sludging through the game with your horrible starting deck or you can buy them. I'd imagine the goal is to get you to do the latter.\n\nIf i wanted to be constantly paying for virtual cards I'd go back to Magic: Online. The Duel games are meant to be stand alone games that give you a fun challenge based around a set of cards. For the last few years I've felt this series has been pretty consistant with delivering that.. until now. Magic 2015 sucks. I'll be going back and playing a previous version.\n\nIf you haven't bought this already please don't. Check your Library.. do you have all of the previous editions? If not go back and buy one of those.\n\nOh and no Two-Headed Giant. :(","July 27, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you already really like Magic and are the kind of fellow who bought every single other DotP game, you're gonna be addicted by this until you've got every single card unlocked (too bad there's the unholy Premium set which costs a small fortune to unlock). However, you will also be very frustrated because this installment in the series is in a lot of ways inferior to the others. In either case, I wouldn't really recommend this game.\nIf you're new, I urge you to buy DotP 2012, instead. The decks in that one are the best - there are some really awesome decks in that game.\n\nAnd that already leads me to the biggest problem with this one, in my view. There are enough people who have written about the abysmal way the game starts you off (which, by no doubt, is designed that way to make you pay money to unlock cards quicker). It is abysmal. And it also leads me to my main problem - the card pool is severely limited.\nI have picked the Black/Red deck at the beginning of the game. It was based around stealing creatures and sacrificing them. One of the best things about Magic in general (and, notably, the other DotPs) is that you get to improve the strengths of your deck as you go along and collect cards. I eventually saw that I was unable to do that. Sure, I got stronger cards which made my deck stronger - but only very few cards improved on the theme of my deck. Eventually, I simply won because I got to draw and play those strong cards, not because I utilized the mechanics and themes of my deck to their fullest. I thought that I just had poor luck with my booster. I didn't. There simply were almost no cards at all which built on that theme. The best permanent card which allows you to sacrifice creatures was already in the deck.\nAs I found out about that fact, I abandoned the deck and made a series of other decks, which all disappointed me in the same way - there was little possible interaction between the cards, or the interaction was simply too weak to hold up against the extremely powerful decks you fight in the campaign. Even if you just want to make a powerful deck with strong cards, you will find that, for some unknown reason, certain mana ranges only have rather weak or situational cards to offer. Eventually, I managed to make a deck I had fun playing, and also was able to win with, by combining three different colors so as to have more choice in cards (something which I highly recommend if you find yourself in the same position I was in).\nThe card pool is cripplingly small. By now, I have unlocked every non-Premium card and have already taken a closer look at the cards available. A lot of really popular and neat card archetypes just simply aren't there at all, or are extremely underrepresented to the point that their corresponding cards aren't only very poor representatives of their archetypes, but will also take you a long time to find in the first place. Since I have always heavily prefered Red and Black over the other colors, I mainly noticed which of their archetypes fall into this category; these would be: black reanimation, black sweepers, big black demons which require sacrifice, red board-changing sorceries, red sweepers, red creatures which come back from the graveyard, etc. But I have also noticed that decent blue card draw is very hard to come by - let that sink in for a moment.\nLet's go back to DotP 2013. The decks weren't quite as good as DotP 2012's, but I still clearly remember some of the decks in that game (while I remember none at all from Magic 2014, on a side note). That game made me learn to appreciate Phoenix creatures, and I had turned into a bit of a fan of them. They may not be very impressive as you initially play them, but as the game goes on, you'll be more than happy to find a Phoenix in your graveyard, and some of them lend themselves to some really tricky plays. There's nothing at all which resembles that archetype in Magic 2015, not in Red, not really in any other color, either.\n\nTo add insult to injury, if you play the game on the harder difficulty settings, your opponents will have access to strictly better cards than you have. Sometimes, you may find yourself facing off againt a deck using a similar theme as you are, but with much, much better cards, and more cards to fit the theme.\n\nThere is also a lack of just plain gimmicky cards. There are very few cards which would lend themselves to have a deck built around them. Give me Coat of Arms or Adaptive Automaton and I will build a deck around whatever creature type I like. Eh, probably not, since I could only put two of either one into the deck because of how the deck building is limited in that regard - you may have 4 of the same Common card, but only 3 of the same Uncommon, 2 of the same Rare, only 1 of each Mythic Rare.\nIn fact, there's very few cards which promote any creature type. From the top of my head, I only remember there being some cards promoting vampire creatures, for some bizarre reason, and also one card making beasts stronger. There's also a creature which makes goblins worse, so there's that.\n\nEven the Premium set sucks. There's some interesting cards, but also some really bizarre picks. The Premium set seems to be aimed to promote mono-colored decks, but with the most boring of cards - cards which simply say they promote a certain color, but don't really fit their color.

While I appreciate some of the things they did with this release, ultimately I don't think it is worth the money or the huge time investment.\n\nPros:\n- Actual deck building where you can use any card from your collection, building new decks from the ground up.\n- Unlocking booster packs after wins is fun and prolongs the amount of time you can have fun playing the game.\n\nCons:\n- You can't complete a set of 4 uncommon or rare cards, at most you can get 3.\n- The interface this year is very clunky and slow to navigate through, feels like it was made without any regard for the PC market.\n- The starter decks are awful, and you can't select a different one if you hate the deck you selected.  If you're getting stomped early on, it is very difficult to earn enough cards via winning to change your deck.\n- I did list unlocking booster packs as a pro, but it also gets VERY grindy.\n- Microtransactions are required to unlock the most powerful cards.  I believe its something like $38 to unlock all of the "premium" cards in the game.\n\nFor $10 it's not that bad, but I won't be buying the game again next year if they don't rethink their strategy with this game.","July 27, 2014","false","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even after unlocking all cards other than the Premium cards, I've still yet to be able to put in my deck:\n- A sliver. Seriously. Magic 2015 adds bunch of interesting new Sliver cards and I was looking forward to playing with these and the 2014 slivers in a sliver deck, but no. An enemy has a sliver deck, but you don't gain access to any of them\n- A planeswalker. Magic 2015 adds new planeswalker cards. I never saw one the entire game.\n\nOn top of that, the extra content you pay for in the complete bundle is a total joke and even once you've spent $40 you still need to spend another $30 on the premium boosters if you want to unlock all cards. $70 for a game may not be that excessive, but it is for a game as weak as this.\nEven when you do, the provided cards are pretty lousy. A basic white weeny deck is probably the best thing you can make in this game and it absolutely smashes every opponent, but it's a shame the cards aren't available for any more interesting strategies. The starting decks are some of the worst I've seen in Magic. The first real battle (at the end of the tutorial) isn't so much hard as irritating. Guaranteed both you and your opponent will end up topdecking lands for half the battle - but don't worry, because your opponent doesn't have anything to cast with them either. Just comes down to who can get a couple of creatures out early on and 1-damage the enemy to death.\n\nDon't play this.","July 27, 2014","false","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some are for the better, but overall, I think the series took a step backward with this installation.  The new single-player card collecting experience is nice, but restricting some of the best cards to microtransactions leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, making it difficult to recommend the game overall.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game.  Well, it's magic.  There's a great variety of cards and the "booster collection" system actually lets you put together a deck of your own creation, rather than relying on the premade deck templates of the previous series.  Unfortunately, this system is let down by some arbitrary limitations, both in the variety of cards, and how many of each card can be unlocked.\n\nThe menus are preposterously slow.  They look fancy, sure, but it quickly becomes frustrating to navigate the menus as you have to watch the wispy animations.  Hell, it takes the game about 10 seconds to get to the main menu after you click "start" on the title screen.  There's just no reason for this.\n\nThe core game is good though if you're a fan of MTG.  The duel interface is great as always.  There are a variety of encounters in the single player experience and the acquisition of boosters does a nice job if creating a sense of progression.  One criticism I might levy - which could be said to some extent of all DOTP - is that increasing the difficulty really just makes it so that the AI has ungodly luck.  That is to say, if their deck has an answer to a card you just played, it's a surefire bet that they will draw it in short order.  It definitely amounts to an increase in difficulty, but it never feels like you get outplayed; it just feels like you lost to impossible luck, and that can be frustrating.\n\n\nNow, perhaps the most vehement criticism levied against this game is that it is pay to win, and to an extent, I would tend to agree.  While there are some very good cards that you can collect in the single player experience, the premium booster packs (purchased with real money) contain several extremely powerful bombs.  While these cards may not win a duel by themselves, there is an obvious difference in a deck without them than a deck with them.  For example, G/W tokens with doubling season is far scarier to me than G/W tokens without doubling season.\n\nSo, I will say that as a fan of MTG I enjoyed the single-player experience.  I liked the card collecting and the ability to create my own decks.  But overall I have to recommend passing this one up; I think the previous DOTPs were superior, and the money-grab scheme in DOTP 2015 leaves a sour taste in my mouth.","July 21, 2014","false","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This net change feels like regress rather than progress.  The game still offers some fun, but I can see it getting very stale very fast.\n\nPros:\nMagic: the Gathering\nCustom Deck Building\nThe pool of cards is fairly close to those that are currently standard-legal in the paper game.  The set pulls heavily from Return to Ravnica, Theros, and Magic 2015.\n\nCons:\nArguably worse than DotP 2012, 2013, and 2014. (Did not really play the original).\nThe UI is painfully sluggish, and is less efficient than previous iterations.\nThough one can manually change how mana taps, the AI is less intuitive with its automatic mana tapping than before.  I've seen it tap all of my mana of a color and leave open a color I didn't have spells for.\nThe base card pool feels very lacking.  I have not yet pin-pointed why.\nTo unlock premium cards, one must buy boosters which contain random cards.  I personally find this annoying as one can pay $2 with no guarantee that the card (or any card at all) that they desire will be included.\nThe only multiplayer versions are Free For All with varying numbers of players.  This gets boring really fast to me.\n\nI consider Magic: The Gathering to be a major hobby of mine, and I have enjoyed the past DotP games despite any faults.  However, this game feels like such a downgrade, it's very hard to enjoy.

The new single-player card collecting experience is nice, but restricting some of the best cards to microtransactions leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, making it difficult to recommend the game overall.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game.  Well, it's magic.  There's a great variety of cards and the "booster collection" system actually lets you put together a deck of your own creation, rather than relying on the premade deck templates of the previous series.  Unfortunately, this system is let down by some arbitrary limitations, both in the variety of cards, and how many of each card can be unlocked.\n\nThe menus are preposterously slow.  They look fancy, sure, but it quickly becomes frustrating to navigate the menus as you have to watch the wispy animations.  Hell, it takes the game about 10 seconds to get to the main menu after you click "start" on the title screen.  There's just no reason for this.\n\nThe core game is good though if you're a fan of MTG.  The duel interface is great as always.  There are a variety of encounters in the single player experience and the acquisition of boosters does a nice job if creating a sense of progression.  One criticism I might levy - which could be said to some extent of all DOTP - is that increasing the difficulty really just makes it so that the AI has ungodly luck.  That is to say, if their deck has an answer to a card you just played, it's a surefire bet that they will draw it in short order.  It definitely amounts to an increase in difficulty, but it never feels like you get outplayed; it just feels like you lost to impossible luck, and that can be frustrating.\n\n\nNow, perhaps the most vehement criticism levied against this game is that it is pay to win, and to an extent, I would tend to agree.  While there are some very good cards that you can collect in the single player experience, the premium booster packs (purchased with real money) contain several extremely powerful bombs.  While these cards may not win a duel by themselves, there is an obvious difference in a deck without them than a deck with them.  For example, G/W tokens with doubling season is far scarier to me than G/W tokens without doubling season.\n\nSo, I will say that as a fan of MTG I enjoyed the single-player experience.  I liked the card collecting and the ability to create my own decks.  But overall I have to recommend passing this one up; I think the previous DOTPs were superior, and the money-grab scheme in DOTP 2015 leaves a sour taste in my mouth.","July 21, 2014","false","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's honestly the only way to describe this version of a once great series.\nIt's mired with grindy mechanics for getting cards for the deckbuilding, 90% of the time you get useless crap (as with paper magic), but unlike the cardboard crack you can't trade (that's reserved for MTGO) so your collection of rubbish grows. Also, there's no ratio of mythics upheld (the 1/8 packs for mythics holds more or less true in real MTG, but not here) so expect to see the same cards over and over and nothing good.\n\nOf course you can always pay for the cards you want (and the very best cards seem to be locked behind microtransactions anyway) and that's not really what I play DotP for. I have to pay enough for real cards, if I wanted to buy digital ones, I'd do MTGO.\n\nOn top of this the UI is incredibly choppy and slow and quite bland. Everything is hidden in multiple depths of menus, which would be fine if the UI wasn't so slow. Furthering the problems beyond the campaign grinding and multiplayer there's nothing really in the game. There's no Archenemy or Two headeded giant or any of the cool features from the previous games that made them cool experiences and breaks from the campaign. Instead there's just the artificial slog of getting cards.\n\nOverall I just cannot recommend this version. Stick with 2014, MTGO or even the cardboard crack and hopefully next year they'll learn from how badly this was recieved.","July 23, 2014","false","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best cards in the game are blocked off behind $2 a pop for premium boosters, so players who have dished out cash for these will always win online matches. Deck building is something fans have wanted for a while, and while it works in itself, it is extremely limited, almost as much as the atrocious sealed play in the last instalment. Once you choose a colour you are locked down to it, and you must build a deck focused around that and one more colour. This cannot be changed. You can create a new deck using unique colours, but with the small amount of useful cards you pick up from random boosters (one per victory) these decks will inevitably lose every time.\n\nBesides these drawbacks, the user interface is slow and clearly designed around a tablet device. Transitions and loading times are appaling and the game is bland and dull to look at. Swiping through icons for every menu choice should never be a feature in ANY PC game. There are also significant problems with the AI - some blatantly cheat and use cards that are unavailable in the game. When a loss comes from a lack of fairness the game becomes incredibly frustrating and even less fun to play.\n\nThis is a joke of a game - a truly pathetic, lazy attempt to please fans who have demanded full deck customisation for years. Well, they gave it to us, but they also took away everything else. With Hearthstone being as popular and well received as it is, this game needed to be great to compete, and it is not.","July 23, 2014","false","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apparently all it does is ruin the point of playing through the campaign by opening all the "boosters" you would have normally won anyway.  Further, "Includes the following card collections: Innistrad Theros Ravnica Shandalar Zendikar" does not mean that you can custom build decks from the entire Gatherer/Oracle collection as it would seem to infer.

Some are for the better, but overall, I think the series took a step backward with this installation.  The new single-player card collecting experience is nice, but restricting some of the best cards to microtransactions leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, making it difficult to recommend the game overall.\n\nSo, let's talk about the game.  Well, it's magic.  There's a great variety of cards and the "booster collection" system actually lets you put together a deck of your own creation, rather than relying on the premade deck templates of the previous series.  Unfortunately, this system is let down by some arbitrary limitations, both in the variety of cards, and how many of each card can be unlocked.\n\nThe menus are preposterously slow.  They look fancy, sure, but it quickly becomes frustrating to navigate the menus as you have to watch the wispy animations.  Hell, it takes the game about 10 seconds to get to the main menu after you click "start" on the title screen.  There's just no reason for this.\n\nThe core game is good though if you're a fan of MTG.  The duel interface is great as always.  There are a variety of encounters in the single player experience and the acquisition of boosters does a nice job if creating a sense of progression.  One criticism I might levy - which could be said to some extent of all DOTP - is that increasing the difficulty really just makes it so that the AI has ungodly luck.  That is to say, if their deck has an answer to a card you just played, it's a surefire bet that they will draw it in short order.  It definitely amounts to an increase in difficulty, but it never feels like you get outplayed; it just feels like you lost to impossible luck, and that can be frustrating.\n\n\nNow, perhaps the most vehement criticism levied against this game is that it is pay to win, and to an extent, I would tend to agree.  While there are some very good cards that you can collect in the single player experience, the premium booster packs (purchased with real money) contain several extremely powerful bombs.  While these cards may not win a duel by themselves, there is an obvious difference in a deck without them than a deck with them.  For example, G/W tokens with doubling season is far scarier to me than G/W tokens without doubling season.\n\nSo, I will say that as a fan of MTG I enjoyed the single-player experience.  I liked the card collecting and the ability to create my own decks.  But overall I have to recommend passing this one up; I think the previous DOTPs were superior, and the money-grab scheme in DOTP 2015 leaves a sour taste in my mouth.","July 21, 2014","false","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the start of the campaign (after a forced tutorial), you pick your starter deck from a selection of premades. Unlike the previous iterations, and certainly not mentioned at any point I noticed, you are locked into that deck for the entirety of the campaign. You might be wondering why, because it will most likely lead to a point where your chosen deck cannot beat a challenge, and gone are the days where you could swap to a different deck to beat that part. You're left completely stuck.\n\nUnless you pay to unlock cards, of course. That'll be why.\n\nAs someone that has voluntarily spent money unlocking cards in previous releases, nothing will make me condemn something more than feeling forced into payment for progression. It shouldn't be mandatory to pay to unlock content already in the game that you simply cannot reach without hair-tearing frustration, or pay for additional cards not included in the base game. A challenge is fun, but this is beyond compare, and feels much more like a money-grab.\n\nAs far as the graphics and UI go, it's underwhelming and slightly clunky.

That's honestly the only way to describe this version of a once great series.\nIt's mired with grindy mechanics for getting cards for the deckbuilding, 90% of the time you get useless crap (as with paper magic), but unlike the cardboard crack you can't trade (that's reserved for MTGO) so your collection of rubbish grows. Also, there's no ratio of mythics upheld (the 1/8 packs for mythics holds more or less true in real MTG, but not here) so expect to see the same cards over and over and nothing good.\n\nOf course you can always pay for the cards you want (and the very best cards seem to be locked behind microtransactions anyway) and that's not really what I play DotP for. I have to pay enough for real cards, if I wanted to buy digital ones, I'd do MTGO.\n\nOn top of this the UI is incredibly choppy and slow and quite bland. Everything is hidden in multiple depths of menus, which would be fine if the UI wasn't so slow. Furthering the problems beyond the campaign grinding and multiplayer there's nothing really in the game. There's no Archenemy or Two headeded giant or any of the cool features from the previous games that made them cool experiences and breaks from the campaign. Instead there's just the artificial slog of getting cards.\n\nOverall I just cannot recommend this version. Stick with 2014, MTGO or even the cardboard crack and hopefully next year they'll learn from how badly this was recieved.","July 23, 2014","false","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best cards in the game are blocked off behind $2 a pop for premium boosters, so players who have dished out cash for these will always win online matches. Deck building is something fans have wanted for a while, and while it works in itself, it is extremely limited, almost as much as the atrocious sealed play in the last instalment. Once you choose a colour you are locked down to it, and you must build a deck focused around that and one more colour. This cannot be changed. You can create a new deck using unique colours, but with the small amount of useful cards you pick up from random boosters (one per victory) these decks will inevitably lose every time.\n\nBesides these drawbacks, the user interface is slow and clearly designed around a tablet device. Transitions and loading times are appaling and the game is bland and dull to look at. Swiping through icons for every menu choice should never be a feature in ANY PC game. There are also significant problems with the AI - some blatantly cheat and use cards that are unavailable in the game. When a loss comes from a lack of fairness the game becomes incredibly frustrating and even less fun to play.\n\nThis is a joke of a game - a truly pathetic, lazy attempt to please fans who have demanded full deck customisation for years. Well, they gave it to us, but they also took away everything else. With Hearthstone being as popular and well received as it is, this game needed to be great to compete, and it is not.","July 23, 2014","false","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game "rewards" you with a booster, which cotain 15 cards each, at the end of each battle with the AI, but that is not enough to actually modify your starter deck.

I already paid for each card individually, with money, you know? That thing that does not grow in trees. I'm not paying again to have the digital version of something I already have phisically. Wizard of the Coast already tricked me into paying 10$ for this game, and I'm not giving one more cent.\n\nIf you like to spend money in something that doesn't exist, be my guest, but if not, go buy the real thing, so you can at least actually own cards.\n\nAnd to think the game system is working just fine.

Apparently all it does is ruin the point of playing through the campaign by opening all the "boosters" you would have normally won anyway.  Further, "Includes the following card collections: Innistrad Theros Ravnica Shandalar Zendikar" does not mean that you can custom build decks from the entire Gatherer/Oracle collection as it would seem to infer.  Instead, it means you get a couple copies of a small selection of cards from each set that would otherwise be available after playing through the campaign I think.  It's a rip off if you ask me.  I'd like my 25 bucks back.\n\nEdit: Also forgot to mention, the AI playing skill seems more sloppy compared to previous versions.  The default mana tapping behavior is absolutely terrible, and everything about the in-game menu navigation  screams "tablet version!" even worse than on previous versions.  Literally every menu is designed in carousel-style spinning behavior like you'd expect to use with touch screen gestures... great if you have one, but ridiculous if you're using a mouse.","July 23, 2014","false","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is pay to win! So many things wrong with this game. The number one issue is this... You can start with only hybrid decks with little to NO synergy. The first person you duel against in campaign mode is far superior to you in every way. The only way to beat any of these guys is pure luck. Their decks are setup to counter your every move. Your chances of winning are pretty much 20:1.  When you do win you only get 3 random cards, that may or may not be for the hybrid deck you picked. After you struggle to beat the 4 guys in each tier you can do a random encounter for that tier that will reward you with more cards. The issue here, your deck is still as basic as it can be. These guys youre facing will again be far superior to you. Also you cant attempt to build a deck to beat them for two reasons: 1) you still have crap cards 2) you have no idea which one you'll get so it is impossible to build a strategy.

If I wanted to pay microtransactions for boosters to be competitive at the game and build custom decks, I'd be playing MTGO. I've been a MTG player for 20 years. I'm thoroughly familiar with the game. MTG, on the whole is pay2win. All CCG's pretty much are. The fun thing about Duels of the Planeswalkers was it wasn't. It was a game for newcomers to get introduced to the game in a casual low-pressure environment or for more experienced players to kick back and enjoy MTG without having to worry about tuning their Vintage deck to stand up to Spike at FNM. Now DotP is about making money on micro-transactions. Its going to scare away new and experienced players alike. The basic formula here is start you off with 1 nerfed deck and ramp the difficulty much faster than you can improve your deck without either long sessions of grinding or ponying up a lot more cash for virtual cards. and to top it all off, they reduced the available game modes and made a menu system that is painfully slow.

When you start the game, you have to press "Start" to get to main menu.\nWell, I manage to press "Start" 5 or 6 times before it decides to react, it is that unresponsive, and the entire game menu navigation is cluttered by useless animations that slow the progress of getting to where you want down, and it is annoying to say the least..\n\nAs a person who owns every Magic game so far, Im just sad based on how the makers approach player feedback, or rather, how they ignore it, and sad to see what they do with this franchise, as it would deserve a quick responsive menu, larger selection of cards, and great choice of game modes, not actually lesser number of them than before..\n\nThere are good points about this game too, mainly the single player part which is pretty varied and can test you against all kinds of gamestyles.\nAnd of course the fact you can make any deck you want, any combination of colours and cards you have, and any number of decks except, as I mentioned before, the total amount of cards to choose from is in my opinion dissapointing.\n\nBased on everything said above, I cannot really recommend this game right now for anyone who would expect a great multiplayer experience. It is fun to play but it can get really hard to impossible to play a mp game.\nI for example prefer to play 4 player game instead of the missing 2HG mode and thats the least played, and as a result, sometimes I simply dont get to play it when I want to because there is no one playing it, not very good for a game just released..\n\nIf you were a single player only player however, you may still want to consider it.\n\nRating for SP players only - 75/100 -\n\nFun gameplay but you may wish there was more cards to choose from, bad sluggish menu may annoy you, but the gameplay may still be worth it.\n\nRating for players expecting a full Magic SP and MP experience 55/100 -\n\nMissing 2HG mode, very low amount of games hosted at the time of the review, a disastrously annoying menu navigation on a pc, and last, but not least for me on win 7, 6core phenom cpu, 8gb ram and Gigabyte 7950 HD 3gb gpu, a shocking amount of crashes, mostly during menu navigation, so anyone with a similar pc setup beware.","July 24, 2014","false","120.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whereas the previous game has several decks that you could choose to play at anytime, in this game you choose a deck after the tutorial and if you don't like it then tough luck. Seriously, I chose White/Black after finishing, played a few games with it, decided to change and was astounded to learn that you can't. The only way to play other colours after making your choice is to unlock more cards but you only unlock 3 after a victory. So, I wont be playing any more of this until that is fixed and I can choose any of the starter decks. In addition, the menu interface is appalling, phases take forever and the whole experince feels like a cash grab rather than an MTG game like the previous.\n\nIf you're for an introduction to magic: the gathering, get Magic 2014, NOT this.","July 20, 2014","false","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The removal of 2v2 matches, the microtransactions, the awkwardly designed UI (clearly made with the ipad version in mind), but in truth none of these really bothered me. What really makes this kind of a worthless product to me, and I tried hard to like it, is the extremely limited and poorly chosen card pool. You can't really build......any of the classic archetypes of magic. It seems all the colors are missing major elements of their design.\n\nWhite has no oblivion ring, or equivalent. This makes dealing with certain threats outrageously difficult, and building white/blue control really impractical.\n\nGreen lacks cost effective low mana creatures. They're bogged down with 5+ mana drops, usually without trample.\n\nRed has absolutely no instant speed 3 damage burn spell. No Lightning bolt, strike, searing spear, or similar. This makes burn largely unviable, and izzet control/burn awkward at best.\n\nBlue has negate but no essence scatter, putting their already weak creatures in an even worse spot. They get Inspiration instead of Oppurtunity, a huge downgrade.\n\nBlack has no doom blade or equivalent. The closest they come is assasinate, which is more expensive, at sorcery speed, and doesn't work against creatures who aren't tapped.\n\nAll of this doesn't make the colors imbalanced, just extremely awkward and clunky. Its particularly irritating when some of the needed cards are actually in the game, but not unlockable. The AI only decks have many cards permanently unavailable to the player, even after you pay extra for the premium booster packs. The Duels series has always been designed for newer players, and this should be taken into consideration. Sadly though, I'd have to reccommend 2014 instead. It may not teach you how to build decks, but at least the decks you see will be a little more represenative of what you'll see if you go down to your local Friday Night Magic. I'm hoping the card pool issue is fixed with updates and dlc. I don't want to wait another year for them to have a shot at getting this right.","July 20, 2014","false","71.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than the beautiful yet short cinematics and the fact that the game is a licensed Magic: The Gathering product, there are very few positive things to say about this game.\n\nThe user-interface is done in a clunky, slide-show format, making only four options visible on the menu at a single time. Numerous game modes present in prior editions have been removed. The Two-Headed Giant (cooperative) format for multiplayer will be the most noticeable for many players, who probably purchased the game for multiplayer games. The Challenges (puzzles) and Revenge Campaign - a second campaign with more difficult opponents, which appears after the completion of the original Campain mode - are also no longer present.\n\nThe largest and most noticeable change to the game is the way decks are chosen and constructed. The prior editions of DotP contained numerous pre-constructed decks. The player unlocked additional cards for your deck by playing and winning with it. the player would then use the cards you received to improve their deck, win more, and repeat the cycle. In Magic 2015, this is no longer the case. Decks are now individual constructed by the player from a card pool. With every win, you unlock boosters, which contain new cards for your card pool. Besides who makes the deck, it would still seem that the player win cards to improve their deck to win more cards. This is not the case however.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about the prior DotP games was the pre-constructed decks. The decks were mostly balanced and - barring a few exceptions - almost all of them were playable with zero cards unlocked. This was great for new players. They could learn the mechanics of the game without being punished for lack of experience with deck construction. Many of the decks were well constructed and included cards that I simply cannot afford to play in real life. This was great for experienced players on a budget, such as myself. The deck construction was constricted, but that kind of constriction prevented too large of a metagame from forming. I'll stop lamenting, but I guess my favorite part of the old DotP games is that every deck was playable to everyone, regardless of a player's skill level.\n\nWith Magic 2015, the player starts the game by choosing a deck archetype composed of two colours. Once the player chooses their deck, they are stuck with it. These are the only cards that they're going to have to play with until deck construction opens up. This is not a good thing for new players, who will be stuck if their skill level is not enough to overcome the handicap of terrible cards. Once a player has won a few matches, they will have unlocked a few booster packs. The cards in the packs by this point will likely not be enough to make a new deck, and if so, not one of any value. In fact, one of my largest issues with the game as a whole was that the card pool was terrible. Green decks have Cultivate, but no Rampant Growth. Red decks have Shock and Bolt of Keranos, but no Lightning Bolt. Black decks have Assassinate, but no Doom Blade. Griselbrand is all but unplayable in a Black-Green deck designed to get him onto the field.\n\nRegardless of how terrible the cards in the card pool comes my other large issue with the game - the metagame. The other DotP games had a metagame, but it is much more mild than the metagame of Magic 2015. This game's metagame is similar to that of Block constructed. In time, only certain decks will be viable in multiplayer, making multiple other decks and cards unplayable. By creating a card pool with flexibility, Wizards of the Coast only limited the amount of playable cards even further.\n\nIf you want other decks to be useful, then you may have to pay. Pay real life cash. Monocolour decks benefit greatly from their respective Paragon, and a Five colour deck is only justifiable with Maelstrom Angel. These cards are only available in a Premium Booster, which are two dollars a piece with no other way to unlock them. I would have rather payed $20 for a game with all of the card unlockable in game, than $10 for a less than complete game. If you want a card game where your cards are determined by chance, you have infinite flexibility of card construction, a strict metagame, and pay real money for cards then play Magic the Gathering Online. It has all of that and more.\n\nIn short, Magic 2015 falls short of Magic 2014 by trying to be Magic Online. Magic 2015 has less features, a terrible card pool, a strict metagame, and a pay to win mentality. It is neither a true DotP game or MTGO/MODO. If you want to play real Magic in a digital format, then invest in MTGO/MODO. If you want to play a smooth game with smooth decks, get Magic 2014.\n\nPositive:\n- Beautiful cinematics\n- Magic: The Gathering licensing\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Poor user interface\n- Poor deck construction\n- Poor card pool\n- Locked content\n- Removed cooperative multiplayer\n- Removed Revenge campaign\n- Removed challenge feature","July 28, 2014","false","70.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That and the seemingly random selection of cards with very little cohesion makes themed decks very restricted..so while they took a step in deck building freedom the tiny pool of cards is incredibly hindering the actual number of useful decks you can build. Premium packs in general are idiotic in general since when 2016 comes out you have to start all over and pay all over again, at that rate you might as well play MTG online.\n\nMultiplayer is a blatant miss, it's almost like they threw it in at the last minute and had absolutely no focus on it. 2 headed giant removed which was a huge bonus for 2014. You can't swap decks inbetween duels which leads to most people just scooping up the fight and leaving before it's done as soon as they feel (or know) they've lost.. no reason to stick around if a deck completely crushes yours since you can't swap decks inbetween fights, you've to leave the current game then change decks before joining a new one.   This is crushing to me considering multiplayer extends the life of games like these dramatically, with most of the cards unlocked I'm finding little point besides unlocking the rest before tossing the game away and shrugging off 2016.\n\nGive the game 1.5 out of 5 stars. Singleplayer is still there and they attempted to move into the right direction with deck customization, but the multiplayer was murdered, extra content removed, premium packs required for vastly improving deck building options.\n\nChallenges no longer a part of duel of the planeswalker?

I haven't played the previous year versions and the last time I played real life MGT was well over 10 years ago. Interface is a bit cumbersome but works fine during battles.

You can now get all the cards in the game without buying premium boosters! See details here:\nhttp://toucharcade.com/2014/11/05/magic-2015-update-includes-pay-model-rework-and-garruks-revenge-expansion/\nI have also heard that many alternateive game modes have been removed but I never played much of those so that doesn't bother me.\n\nI mainly play Dotp because I dont want to spend any more tham I have on the real game and because I have noone near to play.\n\nThat said, I've been having a ton of fun playing though the campaign and unlocking cards - I haven't played multiplayer yet. I've been playing on Archmage difficulty and itfeels pretty good - not too hard not too easy though it was more difficult starting out - not having many cards to customize my decks. Its a lot better now I've unlocked more cards. Be sure to unlock as many cards as you can in each "Expleore" area before moving on to the next to get some great cards for your decks. AI seems pretty good to me - and I've even seen them get mana screwed on Archmage so I feel like its pretty fair at the moment. You can make some really fun decks from these cards. beaing able to build a real deck form scratch in a DotP has improved the gameplay here 100%. It's like half the fun was missing in previous incarnations. If you enjoy building your own deck form scratch and trying new strategies then you owe it to yourself to try DotP 2015, unless of course you must have the alternate game modes that it is missing.\n\nThe menus are also a pain to traverse but thats a small gripe.","January 19, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are only given one deck to begin with, and if you pick a deck that can't beat all of the initial fights, you lose the ability to unlock more cards. This means that the only way to progress is to buy more cards, or to win multiplayer matches against superior decks. The fact that you have to buy additional cards with real money makes the cash grab obscenely obvious.

This is balanced and in the end crippled by two things.\n-The fact that card variety is very limited, (Little over 300 different cards counting the expansion)\n-Card set limitations based on rarity. (4 common, 3 uncommon, 2 rare, 1 mythic)\n\n\nShort version:\n\nslow and kind of a luck based progression in the beginning unless you pay for expensive microtransactions that unlock more cards for your deck. Even then the planeswalker difficulty really feels luck-based on some battles. Building the deck is fun but UI is extremely clunky and almost certainly ported from tablet.\n\nThis takes the whole game down a notch as it is tedious to make menu selections, scroll cards, tap lands, using abilities and just about everything else when played with a mouse and keyboard. The menus use mouse scroll when they feel like it, but they favor using drag as if played with a tablet. Menus don't activate if you drag a slightest bit when clicking with the mouse, cards zoom if you give a light touch to the scroll. The gamepad controls probably work as intended but I haven't tested. The game also feels slower than previous versions.\n\n\nLong version:\n\nThe game can be very frustrating because you are against pretty competent decks with better synergy for the most part than is available to the player. They have a huge amount of cards not available to the player and they don't share the rarity limit.\n\nYou choose a deck with two colors and kind of a weak description at the end of the tutorial. Then you need to unlock rest of the cards by defeating opponents. One win equals one booster pack and you can't get more by defeating the same campaign opponent multiple times.\n\nDifferent planes reward different cards, but you need to open every plane separately by defeating the campaign levels in the previous plane. This makes building a decent deck even slower because there are only about 10 or so different cards per color per plane.\n\nThe final opponent gets a special mentions as you need to win two battles in a row and if you're not lucky it can take frustrating amount of retries.\n\nI don't really think the expansion is worth the price, It features a single plane(Alara) and you're locked to garruks deck without having a good idea of what cards you actually have in the deck, the deck also changes in every battle according to the storyline. The cards awarded are fun but have limited synergy with the rest of the sets and there are too few from the alara set to really construct fun decks from that block. It does feature a couple of triple lands available for deckbuilding though.\n\nOpponents seem to think longer than they used to in previous versions but I'm not 100% certain about this. and all the rules don't seem to always work. One opponent played two of the same legendary without the ability to sacrifice one. The other went to graveyard, the other to the battlefield with tokens from the legendary that went to the graveyard. Also the game sometimes hangs up when you want to cancel a spell with multiple targets.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer but from what i've read from other reviews, there isn't much variety on strategies and decks because of the limited card collection. Also Free for all is the only supported multiplayer mode.\n\n\n\nIn the end i really can't recommend this one over previous editions unless you're dead set on making you own decks from a shallow pool of cards.","January 25, 2015","false","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This version of DotP also seems to make more mistakes when tapping your lands, which makes multi-colored decks a hassle to play.   2015 has a story, and I suspect that an unreasonable amount of time and money went into the cut scenes, which look about as nice as good Playstation or crummy PS2 scenes.\n\nI realize most people who buy DotP do it for the promo card, but if you're getting it as an actual game and are still on the fence, this is not for you.","July 20, 2014","false","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First time in my life I'M ASHAMED TO HAVE BOUGHT A GAME.\n\nHere are some list of things why Magic2015 is garbage:\n\n-The UI is horrible. Everything is designed with consoles in mind, you grind the screen with mouse to go anywhere and it usually spins you back to where you were anyway. From deck builder to "equipping" a deck, everything is made to be played with a gamepad. You can't even use mouse scroll in collection where they have a scrolling bar. Welcome back to 1980s.\n\n-The AI is terrible. In hardest difficulty, it does such stupid mistakes it just boggles my mind how it's even possible to be so incompetent.\n\n-The cardpool is BORING. Of the 300 cards we have, a gigantic portion of them are vanilla creatures with no text. Not only they are boring but they are also underbudgeted. I saw some 3/2 for 4 mana with no effect on it, while AI was using a 3/2 for 4mana that had a great EtB effect. If you are familiar with old games card quality, everything is at the quality of the garbage tier.\n\n-The mana tapping is incredibly ************. For an example, when you have 3 mountains and 1 island, and have a 1 island cost card in your hand, if you would use a spell with 2uncolored 1mountain cost, in older versions of magic, the game would be smart and save up your 1 island so you wouldn't have to deal with spamming control key all the time. Now it messes you up all the time. Even when not using dual lands. It's like the game uses the only mana combination that will screw you up, EVERY SINGLE TIME. WTF.\n\n-Multiplayer is garbage. Appearantly some genius(!) decided you need to "equip" your decks. So you go and select a deck and lock in before you join a game. So if you thought you wanted to play your green blue deck but you forgot to change from your previous black deck, well you have to QUIT YOUR MULTIPLAYER GAME, go main menu, change deck, crawl back to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ menus while waiting for stupid foggy animations to happen 5+ seconds each click and go back in. Oh and you enjoyed playing with someone and want to play again? Or quickly swap your decks (like in sealed mode 2014) and keep going? WELL YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DECK BUILDER SO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME HAS TO BE ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-You spend half your time in menus. Yeah, to change a deck, or go to deck builder and change 1 card, you have to click back 5 times, and go click same steps, while struggling to move around stuff with mouse.\n\n-Despite claiming they fixed the bugs this year, guess what, so many of my friends can't even launch the game, it crashes before starting. GREAT JOB.\n\n-The game is stripped down from all fun multiplayer modes, no 2HG, no planechase, no archenemy, nothing. FFA FFA FFA OR FFA OH MAN SO EXCITING I CAN'T DECIDE. Countless posts about it, our genius lead dev decides to cut down one of the most played game modes from the game.\n\n-The campaign is BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING. I spent hours finishing it. And every campaign mission apart from 2-3 were aggro decks. The ones that weren't aggro are the decks that you have to be aggro to beat because at certain point they cast overpowered spells.\n\n-Ever since 2012, i played every DoTP game, over a thousand hours in total. And i loved the time spent. But this is the last straw. I'm done with magic. The only reason i was playing DoTP instead of MTGO is that because the game doesn't look like from 90s, Well, this one looks new but has less functional interface than 90s games.\n\n184 of 186 reviews on steam is negative.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silfir/recommended/255420/","silfir","Silfir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silfir/","104 products in account","This is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding.\n\nPrevious incarnations of the Duels line featured preconstructed decks that could be modified with a limited card pool, which were used in all of the game modes. Some of them could be played more than one way, some really couldn't. You took those decks into various game modes, like Free-For-All, Two-Headed-Giant, or "guest modes" like Archenemy (2012) or Planechase (2013). In 2014 it was Sealed, where you were able to experience deckbuilding in a limited manner and take the decks into a mini-campaign mode of its own or online multiplayer.\n\nWhat does Magic 2015 have as the guest mode? It doesn't have one. They also removed Two-Headed Giant. There are no Challenges, either. There is no Revenge campaign; if you play through the campaign on the highest difficulty the first time, there is nothing past that point but unlocking more cards through exploring or replaying challenges and try to do it all over again with different decks.\n\nThis is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding - because there is nothing else. If you've played one of the previous DoTPs, and you've never felt the urge to try your hand at building some decks of your own rather than being stuck with the decks and their respective card pools, there is zero reason to get Magic 2015.\n\nIf you are completely new to Magic and would like to play a DotP incarnation to get your feet wet, I would most certainly recommend Magic 2014, or 2013 over this edition. That's because starting with a choice of multiple mostly decent decks that you can slowly expand and unlock and a choice of different game modes offers greater variety. Here, you will start with a preconstructed deck "archetype", and you will have to bite your way through the campaign or "Explore" opponents with a comparatively subpar deck that you can't swap out for one easier to deal with. Making things worse, Magic 2015 on the PC features a downright unbearable UI. In-game, it's mostly decent, but the menus are a nightmare. You're essentially playing an iPad port, and for some reason that means sitting through elaborate menu animations every time you want to do something as outrageous as, say, add a card you unlocked to your deck. Every startup, you lose 10 seconds to the "Start" title screen, because it has to go through all the haunting animation of Garruk as he slowly gets corrupted by the chain veil and then stands there being menacing. It sets the tone for the rest of the experience.\n\nBecause you start with a small card pool and steadily expand it, the campaign mode actually starts at its hardest and gets easier over time as you gain the ability to refine your decks. (Unless you're so bad at deckbuilding that having access to more options leads to you making your deck worse.) There is very little guidance when it comes to deckbuilding, as far as I could tell, but I did skip the inane tutorial. Though considering the (unskippable) tutorial sequence once I unlocked my first card recommended that I take out Nullify (a decently usable two-mana counterspell four copies of which would become the mainstay of the mono-blue bounce/counter/cheap flyer deck that beat the campaign) and replace it with Mercurial Pretender (which is pretty much complete tosh), I'm tempted to say the game leaves new players out to dry in that regard.\n\nI'm actually a little tempted to reset the entire game and start with a different archetype and see how the early game with it compares to my blue/green one. I'm not sure they entirely thought this through; the most challenging bits in terms of beating the game are very early on.\n\nI had some fun with this game for my 10 euros, because I do happen to enjoy deckbuilding. But the game really didn't make it easy on me with some utterly inexplicable flaws. Selecting that you've played "a lot" of magic will set the game on the highest difficulty, but still start you at the tutorial. (The "skip" button is there, too, on the bottom right. Of course, you could have asked the player right out whether they wanted to skip the tutorial, seeing as they've just told you they've played "a lot" of Magic, but noooo.) The absolute most infuriating thing is, however, the mana tapping. Magic 2014 actually did a decent job on guessing which lands to tap for spells; it checked your hand for other cards you could potentially play with leftover mana, and if there were none, it would still at least leave open mana in equal proportions. You often had to use Ctrl to correct its choices, but the cases you did were understandable and manageable. Magic 2015 just doesn't give a flying rude one. It will gleefully use all your green mana for a spell with three colorless symbols even though your hand is full of green instants. How this could happen in a game in which *all* starter decks are two-colored, when they had it pretty well covered just one edition before, is completely and utterly beyond me.\n\nFollowing the rule of three:\n\nThis is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding. The game gives you no real guidance on how to do it, but you can slowly expand your card collection, read up on it possibly, and start tinkering and toiling.\n\nOtherwise, I recommend Magic 2014 or Magic 2013. Even Hearthstone, actually. Hearthstone lets you build decks *and* play Arena, a randomized draft format. That is the extent to which Magic 2015 disappoints; previous DotPs could at least claim they had more ways to play, even co-op multiplayer, than Hearthstone. What Hearthstone also has is a functioning, polished UI. In this edition once more, if you click on a card in DotP and change your mind midway to putting it on the field, you're boned. Hearthstone lets you put it back in your hand. Why can't DotP do that? Do the developers not care, or do they just not get the time they would need for polish and Q&A? It's heartbreaking at times.\n\nSo: Overall, not recommended. If you're a Magic nut and have always wanted to play a DotP that actually lets you build your own deck, here you go.\n\nIt might be a lesson to all of us: Be careful what you wish for. You might get it.","July 17, 2014","false","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The whole point of shuffling a deck in a card game is to randomize the deck, and when literally the exact same thing happenes fifteen times in a row, i dont think that's exactly "random".

I usually try them out first on my friends computer since he likes the virtual version of Magic. I on the other hand don't like it. I hated that you can not make you own deck, and had to use the premaid decks that I didn't even find fun to use. So my friend tells me to get this game, because you FINALLY get to make your own deck with cards from the past five blocks. IF YOU BUY THE COMPLETE EDITION...... so thats what I did. I thought all the cards would be added to the collection, like it stated in the description of the packs, but only to find out for some reason. I don't have any of the cards from any of the packs except the weaksauce deck you start out with and loose with a lot. I'm not sure if you get all the cards from the packs for doing something, or you just need to waste more money on booster because it's not like I blow tons of money on real Magic the Gathering. I just want my $35 worth of cards that they said "added to collection", not you can get some cards of the blocks that we allow you to get since you got the complete edition.\n\nPros-\n1. Magic the Gathering is always fun to play online with friends\n2. Cool that you can build you own decks finally (Not much of a Pro. I explain why in Cons.)\n\nCons-\n1. A little disappointed that the menu is slow. Not that it's to terrible, just dont know why they haven't figured out how to fix that.\n2. Complete Edition, is a complete waste of money. SInce I thought you got five blocks of cards free, so you can hop on and play with your friends. Nobody is looking for a long compaing with a weak deck that wins one out of every four times, IF YOU ARE LUCKY.......\n3.NO TWO HEADED GIANT!!!!!! I mean come on guys. You have been making this card game since 1994 and you "missed" the two headed giant mode. I'm not the only one mad about this, especially since this is like the sixth game they have produced. Very dissapointed in this.\n4.Game play is still slow, but I am okay about this.\n5.You can't actually build a deck since you have to play hours on end just to get some cards. (I know I haven't played much of this game, but this still stand from mt friends opinion)\n\nOverview-\nI thought this game would be different from the last ones, but they have proven me wrong once again. This is still just as terrible as the last ones. Maybe, just maybe, even worse than the other games. To be honest, make the 5 block collections that I payed for to have in my "COLLECTION", whatever that means, and use them to make a deck and play with my friends and this game will be amazing. That's all I want. that plus two headed giant. Can't forget that.I think this can be an amazing game, I really do.

I regret my purchase completely, and here is why.\n\nThis is a ten dollar game, with two dollar "microtransactions." 2015 claimed it would finally have real deck building, which it does. I didn't know part of that deck building experience was going to be paying money for cards. Yes, you can unlock cards in the game. It's pretty tedious, and the starting decks are mostly so awful that I'm pretty sure they made them that bad on purpose so as to try to get people to buy cards sooner. This might pass on a free to play title, but I already gave you ten dollars. I know one of you idiots is going to say "BUT ARBY REAL MAGIC COSTS MONEY," and while that is true, it is also true that this isn't real Magic. I was under the assumtion that these releases weren't money grabs. My bad, I guess.\n\nThe above point makes this game Pay-to-Win. No thanks. Again, so is real Magic. I get it, shut up.\n\nSpeaking of the starting decks, they aren't explained well at all before you pick them. The text on them is almost misleading. You can try a deck out before you confirm that it's your choice, but once you have made the choice final, you're stuck with it. An option to look through the deck first would have been nice here. Even if I play against the tutorial guy with a deck two or three times, I might not see every card in the deck or even get a good feel for it as a whole.\n\nPuzzle mode is gone. What. The. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you can deal with all that, go for it. It seems pretty solid other than my complaints, which are pretty huge.

I had played Magic many years before the first duels of the planeswalkers game, granted it wasn't competitive or anything but I have experience with the actual card game.  I loved the first few games because I was not an expert player.  It reintroduced me to Magic, and grinding to unlock all the cards gave me something to do and work for.  After the first few games I got sick of not being able to build my own deck.  I don't play the card game these days because of how expensive it is, but the video game wasn't quite satisfying my magic curiosity.  With the last game, they gave us a half ♥♥♥ tool to make our own decks that to me seemed to always be terrible.  With this game, it is straight up pay-to-win.  I beat the campaing in a matter of a few hours an quickly realized I wasn't unlocking cards anymore.  I would have to pay to get the boosters to continue.  This just instantly turned me away from this game.  The amount of decent cards that are available to be unlocked in the normal campaign pales in comparison to what you must buy.  Maybe they will be able to fix this with a DLC that is worth a dam but I don't see that happening.  I would stay away from this, whether your a hardcore Magic fan or just someone trying to pick it up for the first time.  Go check out some of the earlier games in the series.  Also, the menu system and user interface has always been absolutely terrible with these games.  How hard is it to fix that?

One step forward, ten steps back. Firstly, I haven't put a ton of time into this game, so much of this is a reaction after only about a few play sessions, but this game really takes the cake for stupidity in design.\n\nThe UI is the first major step, back... glitz over usability. Slow, and unresponsive, though I do have an older computer. The menus are nested in a way that makes them even slower, then they should be.\n\nThe game first asks your skill level, so I chose Planeswalker, the highest, which then immediately goes to a tutorial. So, this seems to be the theme of Magic 2015, ask what people want then ignore that info, and give us what you think we wanted.\n\nThey got rid of old model, which while limited, in that you had many premade, but customizable decks, into you get a deck that you can customize. Now, when this deck fails misarabley because of design restrictions, there are no falling back to another deck that's more appropriate to the challenge, this is frustrating, and leaves you feeling screwed.\n\nNow, when I checked years ago, MTG had over 11k cards in it's catalog, but here they give you access to around 300 after you unlock them through cash or play. It's just greed, even the orignal PC game that came out last century, or last millenium, if you prefer, had more, but your left feeling like the game should be a lot more satisfying then it is.\n\nI realize Magic 2015, and the others are part of an effort by Wizards to get people to go to Magic Online, but I'm thinking that won't happen. What's the benefit, people can pay and pay for virtual cards they have no ownership of. Now, you may say you're doing the same with this, but that hasn't been true in the past. You pay an amount you have access to a mostly workable game with other unlockable cards. This game was dissapointing in the pay aspect of the bonus cards. Really you should be getting a lot more for what they're asking, since these cards won't move to the next Magic.  Magic cards are expensive IRL, so you really are paying for nothing when it comes to virtual cards. You don't own them, can't trade them.\n\nI'm not going to bother with the rest of this review. Maybe, I'll just play an older versions of MTG when i need a fix, or find a new card game that's going to be more inclusive. I think if Wizards wants my cash in the future, they should seriously consider easing up on the stupid restrictions that these game artificially put in. Use the computers ability to take away restrictions and give us freedom, and decent priced addons not stupid packs.","July 19, 2014","false","70.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

ATTENTION:  This game has a risk of crash when u launch.\n\nNo matter how good is a game, the developer should Never sell a game to their customers with this kind of risk.\nOn steam forum you can see endless update of complaining for this bug every day. Lot of players and fans are suffering from this stupid bug which should have been tested and debuged BEFORE the game release.\nOn 1.Aug, they made a 319M patch, but this problem is still not solved.\nMaybe only 5% players have this problem, but for a game, it is a huge failure and shame\n\nEven for this single point, some people should be fired\n\n\n2. Game Pros\n\n1) You can cumtomize you deck and it is easy\n\n2) The interface looks clean and cool (BUT, see below ... )\n\n3) It is interesting that you can explore a planet and meet random encounters to collect cards\n\n3. Game Cons\n\n1)  Cards are not in good quality nor quantity\n\nYou have c.a 300 cards and can make lots of interesting decks by your creative ideas and personal understanding of Magic.\n\nHowever, if you play and test, you will find the White color is a gay lord in this game and actually this game is a TOKEN-to-WIN game.\n\nBlack is much weakened in 2015 and has no wipe removal spells, thus token strategy is over powerful in 2015\n\nYou do have some cards for every idea, but you do not have some powerful core cards for a core concept, e.g mill decks\n\nIf you played 2013 and 2014, you will find the card quality are much better than this version and the decks are more interesting to play even you can not fully costumize.\n\nBy this point, even you buy all 10 boosters and built some interesting decks such as "Cloudshift + Liliana Spector", still no chance to play againt a noob token deck, that is the reason why I say, 2015 is not Pay-to-Win\n\n2. Interface is too horrible for operation\n\nThey want to SHOW how beatiful it looks, and you suffer from the operation time\n\nJust to put the icons there and use the interface of 2014 can be much better\n\n3. You can only player 1v1 in multiplayer\n\nThus, it much depends on your luck and oppo's deck if you want to win\n\nA lucky noob token deck can beat you in within 4 turns, u still think your creative idea is awesome?\n\nA pro with 2-3 turns no-mana-in row or 3-4 turns all-mana-in row will lose a noob who copies exactly ur idea\n\nIn paper magic, of course you also mainly play 1v1 and DO willl meet the same mana problem.\nBUT, How Many cards can you play in real life magic game?\nAnd How many crap cards in 2015 are you using in your real life magic decks?\n\n4. About Two-Head-Giant Mode\n\nIn the beginning, I complained a lot about the missing of THG.\n\nHowever, with the card pool provided so far, THG makes no sense, it will be a Token-and-More Token mode or worse, some deadly combo will come out and win within 5 turns\n\nA player enters random lobby will have nearly no chance to play against a pre-mate team\n\nThis a not fair and not what we want for THG at all.\n\n\nIn summary, I will give 3 of 10 for Magic 2015.\n\nI would pay 100$ for a good game which I can share fun with friends, but even 10$ is too much for a crap\n\nIf you still no buy, surely can spend 10$ and try the basic version. ( If you are lucky enough to have no crash )\n\nFor myself, I will take a serious look on the new card pool in further expansion or DLC before spend my money.","August 3, 2014","false","235.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got a simple deck, which I understood.  I figured I'd get more powerful cards along the way.  But then by my third battle when I saw the caliber of cards that the AI got and the crap that I had in my deck, I didn't know how I was going to even get past the third game.  Even after playing 5 or 6 games, I wasn't really getting anything good in the "booster packs".  I have some pictures on my site that show me playing against the Hydra AI.  He had 3 or 4 hydra's out and started stacking the counters on it.  One of them ended up 130/130 with Trample.  Even if I was able to kill them off quickly, he always managed to pull another from the deck.  and I'm sitting there with a 1/1 fighter.  GO FORTH AND CONQUER!!!\nI didn't buy any packs (which I'm assuming is their plan), but from what I read about the other reviews, isn't worth it.\n\nLove the game, hate the program.

I love the card game and I liked the earlier video game installments.  However, the most recent version of Duels of the Planeswalkers has been (to me) monumentally disappointing.  The entire game works like the Sealed Deck campaign on Magic 2014, which I though was an interesting concept at the time.  It was extremely challenging as a quirky off-shoot of how the main game worked.  Instead of starting out with a good, working deck, you had to hobble together a ramshackle deck to beat your opponent, which often required immense amounts of patients, do-overs and careful manipulation of your deck between matches.  I though it was fun after I beat the main campaign.\n\nBut now with 2015, that's all you have!  A ramshackle deck that barely works and a horribly frustrating method of unlocking new cards.  Worst of all, the card selection on the game is TERRIBLE!!  I can't stress that enough!  I typically play with a mono-Black deck, with plenty of kill cards and lifelink, but low and behold, none of those cards exist in this game!  No Doom Blades, no Murders, or Corrupts or Tendrils of Corruption, none!  The only kill card is a worthless 5-drop!  If you enjoyed the last installment of the series and/or enjoy playing Black, I would highly advise that you avoid this game...","August 6, 2014","false","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silfir/recommended/255420/","silfir","Silfir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silfir/","104 products in account","This is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding.\n\nPrevious incarnations of the Duels line featured preconstructed decks that could be modified with a limited card pool, which were used in all of the game modes. Some of them could be played more than one way, some really couldn't. You took those decks into various game modes, like Free-For-All, Two-Headed-Giant, or "guest modes" like Archenemy (2012) or Planechase (2013). In 2014 it was Sealed, where you were able to experience deckbuilding in a limited manner and take the decks into a mini-campaign mode of its own or online multiplayer.\n\nWhat does Magic 2015 have as the guest mode? It doesn't have one. They also removed Two-Headed Giant. There are no Challenges, either. There is no Revenge campaign; if you play through the campaign on the highest difficulty the first time, there is nothing past that point but unlocking more cards through exploring or replaying challenges and try to do it all over again with different decks.\n\nThis is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding - because there is nothing else. If you've played one of the previous DoTPs, and you've never felt the urge to try your hand at building some decks of your own rather than being stuck with the decks and their respective card pools, there is zero reason to get Magic 2015.\n\nIf you are completely new to Magic and would like to play a DotP incarnation to get your feet wet, I would most certainly recommend Magic 2014, or 2013 over this edition. That's because starting with a choice of multiple mostly decent decks that you can slowly expand and unlock and a choice of different game modes offers greater variety. Here, you will start with a preconstructed deck "archetype", and you will have to bite your way through the campaign or "Explore" opponents with a comparatively subpar deck that you can't swap out for one easier to deal with. Making things worse, Magic 2015 on the PC features a downright unbearable UI. In-game, it's mostly decent, but the menus are a nightmare. You're essentially playing an iPad port, and for some reason that means sitting through elaborate menu animations every time you want to do something as outrageous as, say, add a card you unlocked to your deck. Every startup, you lose 10 seconds to the "Start" title screen, because it has to go through all the haunting animation of Garruk as he slowly gets corrupted by the chain veil and then stands there being menacing. It sets the tone for the rest of the experience.\n\nBecause you start with a small card pool and steadily expand it, the campaign mode actually starts at its hardest and gets easier over time as you gain the ability to refine your decks. (Unless you're so bad at deckbuilding that having access to more options leads to you making your deck worse.) There is very little guidance when it comes to deckbuilding, as far as I could tell, but I did skip the inane tutorial. Though considering the (unskippable) tutorial sequence once I unlocked my first card recommended that I take out Nullify (a decently usable two-mana counterspell four copies of which would become the mainstay of the mono-blue bounce/counter/cheap flyer deck that beat the campaign) and replace it with Mercurial Pretender (which is pretty much complete tosh), I'm tempted to say the game leaves new players out to dry in that regard.\n\nI'm actually a little tempted to reset the entire game and start with a different archetype and see how the early game with it compares to my blue/green one. I'm not sure they entirely thought this through; the most challenging bits in terms of beating the game are very early on.\n\nI had some fun with this game for my 10 euros, because I do happen to enjoy deckbuilding. But the game really didn't make it easy on me with some utterly inexplicable flaws. Selecting that you've played "a lot" of magic will set the game on the highest difficulty, but still start you at the tutorial. (The "skip" button is there, too, on the bottom right. Of course, you could have asked the player right out whether they wanted to skip the tutorial, seeing as they've just told you they've played "a lot" of Magic, but noooo.) The absolute most infuriating thing is, however, the mana tapping. Magic 2014 actually did a decent job on guessing which lands to tap for spells; it checked your hand for other cards you could potentially play with leftover mana, and if there were none, it would still at least leave open mana in equal proportions. You often had to use Ctrl to correct its choices, but the cases you did were understandable and manageable. Magic 2015 just doesn't give a flying rude one. It will gleefully use all your green mana for a spell with three colorless symbols even though your hand is full of green instants. How this could happen in a game in which *all* starter decks are two-colored, when they had it pretty well covered just one edition before, is completely and utterly beyond me.\n\nFollowing the rule of three:\n\nThis is the DotP for people who really, REALLY like deckbuilding. The game gives you no real guidance on how to do it, but you can slowly expand your card collection, read up on it possibly, and start tinkering and toiling.\n\nOtherwise, I recommend Magic 2014 or Magic 2013. Even Hearthstone, actually. Hearthstone lets you build decks *and* play Arena, a randomized draft format. That is the extent to which Magic 2015 disappoints; previous DotPs could at least claim they had more ways to play, even co-op multiplayer, than Hearthstone. What Hearthstone also has is a functioning, polished UI. In this edition once more, if you click on a card in DotP and change your mind midway to putting it on the field, you're boned. Hearthstone lets you put it back in your hand. Why can't DotP do that? Do the developers not care, or do they just not get the time they would need for polish and Q&A? It's heartbreaking at times.\n\nSo: Overall, not recommended. If you're a Magic nut and have always wanted to play a DotP that actually lets you build your own deck, here you go.\n\nIt might be a lesson to all of us: Be careful what you wish for. You might get it.","July 17, 2014","false","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let's get on with this review.\n\nNow yes, this game is hard at first but when u poured in countless of hours just trying to find a deck that can beat the tutorial deck easily thats where the fun part begins....and by that i mean realizing how this game works in terms of deck colors and what not and how to use the combos in the deck you choose to beat your opponent.\n\nBut besides that, this game is also a far greater version of it's predecessor (at least imo). It's very fun, not really noob friendly, makes you rage at RNGesus for giving the opponent a better 1st hand than you. Another thing is, once you get the hang of this game, you can start creating your own deck and improving agaisnt other players WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT.\n\nIts harder to actually find a pub match rather than just playing the singleplayer.But once you do find a game with someone and get to the point where u have a 14/14 creature with flying and they have to counter to it, you basically achieved that point in the game where you graduate from MTG school and realize that there is so much more in this game than skills, its about knowledge and understanding of what ur deck can do.\n\nTL;DR Just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buy the game and play it and just get that x5 14/14 creature with flying on ur field TODAY!\n10/10 would get mana flooded again ;)","April 5","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can say that the future does not involve going across town to hang out at some comic store playing a few games of “magic”.  It’s the Digital Era and I got ♥♥♥♥ to do.\n\nThat said I have the following to say:\n(1)	Interface with xbox controller is sluggish\n\n(2)	Menu layout: Feels like I am using and old school rotary phone… google it\n\n(3)	Game board: Most unimaginative piece of ….\n\n(4)	Two Headed Giant: I have played against my friends since 1994, I want to play with my friends… I would even want a 4-way 2-headed giant game\n\n(5)	Magic Online (Digital) interface & quality sucks: This is way all the veterans are playing this game.\n\n(6)	Combine “Magic Online” with “DOTPW” into one game:  Have an “Arcade” mode (DTOPW) option and a “Tournament “mode (Magic Online) option with cash prizes and awards.  Allow accounts to transfer from the current “Magic Online” game so that users can keep the cards they have paid for already.\n\n(7)	The Digital Era is the future and Hearthstone is currently out playing MTG in all areas (already) except in “in-depth game play” (which only comes after years of growth)\n\nIn short MTG needs to commit to 1 platform (Digital Era …*cough*) and to offer all-in-one game (Digital & DOTPW) in which they update and upgrade the software over the years.","July 19, 2014","false","209.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Also it should be noted that you can't see what cards are in what deck before you choose.) There is no way to rechoose or restart the campaign. (You only unlock the other decks when you gain all the cards to be able to actually construct them anyway.)\n\nSure you can build a new deck as you get more cards every time you win a game, but that depends solely on you being able to win with a really crappily constructed deck a huge number of times. (You get maybe 2 or 3 cards of the color you want each win if you are crazy lucky, but, because the starter decks are so bad you probably only win 1 out of 6 games.)\n\nA huge number of gametypes and features have been removed from the previous versions. Two Headed Giant is simply no longer an option. Probably because the AI in the game took a huge step backward and they didn't know how to cope. It almost always selects the worst possibly option for any targeting, and seems incapable of choosing cards to autocomplete your decks. (It stuck 4 blue cards into a red/black deck that contained NO ISLANDS)\n\nThe menu is so slow that I'm pretty sure NASA has less wait time when getting responses from to the Curiosity Rover on Mars. The title screen takes 15 seconds to get past. There isn't anything to load other than the menu, but the developers were so proud of their crappy smoke animation that they insist you watch the whole thing every time. There is also a ton of lag when playing the game. I have a PC capable of running Skyrim on the highest settings with some pretty nice graphical mods, but this CARD GAME lags like a snail through molasses.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS! IT SERIOUSLY SUCKS!

But they managed to ♥♥♥♥ it up by making it so the card pool is super limited and if you want to get the best cards you have to fork out extra AFTER spending 35 dollars on the "Complete" edition (Which i regret both because this is the worst DotP IMO and because I've essencially cheated myself out of the enjoyment of actually unlocking the cards myself... no one to blame but myself for that though.). Looking through the card pools it teases you with some decent cards in the otherwise abysmal selection, making it seem like "Oooooh, I'd love to build a deck themed around that sweet goblin." but then fail to deliver in bringing the selection needed to actually make a deck that feels good to play.\nThey might be able to redeem themselves (Somewhat, at least. I mean saying sorry doesn't make it all better but it helps.) if they make it so you CAN unlock premium cards without paying and release updates to the card pool. But it's obvious that this is the DotP that wanted to get as much money from fans as fast as possible before everyone realized they were paying for something not worth the money.\n\nIf you do buy this game at least don't get the special edition or complete bundle, it is a regretted purchase.","July 17, 2014","false","48.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The result is you wind up with a random selection of the games cards very quickly and then can't get any more. This is also primarily an ad for Magic 2015.

New campaign story.  Fully customizable decks as opposed to premade decks with a certain degree of customization.  Booster-pack-style unlocks allow faster progression toward having all the cards available through progression.\n\nCons: Bright white interface and transitions are not easy on the eyes.  Game gives you one deck's worth of cards and forces you to either run through the campaign with it or shell out more money to unlock additional cards.  Booster-pack-style unlocking makes acquiring specific deck improvements a matter of money or time and luck.  Sound and damage effect animations appear entirely unchanged from Magic 2014.  Ads are still displayed at launch but also sometimes appear before a match.  Certain animations and controls during matches are sluggish, such as transitioning to and from combat and trying to un-zoom from the graveyard browser.  Lastly, it has been recited ad nauseum, but: lack of Two-Headed Giant game mode, or anything besides campaign, practice, and free-for-all multiplayer.\n\nTL;DR: Consider getting/sticking with 2013 or 2014, much more entertainment and less headache for the money.","July 16, 2014","false","56.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I read the forums before buying this and once you get past the screaming idiots demanding a refund, you see people actually giving their opinions on the game. From what i could see, people were saying that the deck building is good, the UI is terrible, the game is too hard and just flat out unfair and also that microtransactions near destroy the game.\n\nSo buying the game, i went into it seeing if these things were true. The UI. Its atrocious. Clearly meant for a tablet and no effort was made for the PC port.\n\nThe deck building, if im honest, im yet to actually get that point, which will be explained in a minute, so you'll have to take other peoples word for it being decent.\n\nThe microtransactions. Ive looked into at the game is clearly Pay2Win. I, as a newcomer, wouldnt have a big issue with this as i only bought the game for the standard stuff to see if i liked the game. So in that regards, its clear that Wizard are marketing this to newcomers to get them into the game so they will buy more of their stuff. This whole plan will fall through for them however, as the difficulty is where the biggest issue lies in my expeirence.\n\nOnce going through all the tutorials of the ins and outs of the game, you have a final test. You are given the choice of multiple decks from different colours. Ive probably fought this boss 9 times, a new deck each time.\nIts like you're playing on ultra hard. It is ridiculous for Wizard to expect someone like me, a man thats never played Magic before, to actually win this fight. The problem that ive faced in every game of the 9 is lack off land cards im getting. The game i can remember most is me using a Green/white deck. I went into this game expecting to summon some powerful green creatures with some white, small ones as support. Nope. 7 turns in and the game was over. At the end of that fight i had 5 green creatures in my hand. How many green lands did i have that entire game? NONE! I dont understand why it was so unfair.\n\nThe opponent summons these huge creatures with 5/5 stats whilst im with my 1/1 white creatures.\n\nOverall, would i recommend the game to anyone, newcomers or veterans?

(skip ahead if you dont intend to have DLC) If you have got the expansion, grinded all the cards and have the 5 free update packs, you have a variety to play with and can evem make a strong mono-color deck, maybe a tri-color deck. Options are more viable now. Even with all the cards unlocked things can be a little difficult, but a deck may be crafted that comes out ontop and if cards are put together properly i feel that the game can be taken to new heghts, If you plan on paying 15$ for the game, you will have lots of fun. It especially helps when you fight the last boss (garruk) twice and if you restart you have to play both of them all over.\n\nFor those who dont buy the DLC you still have some options, Tri-decks will not be nearly as viable though, so if you prefer to stay in the dual deck range you are fine, decks made without dlc interference will be a little more rigid, but you can still craft something from the battle packs you unlock and the 5 free update packs. Again, it will be rigid, but sometimes it can be okay to be rigid, some of the cards in the DLC will never find a place in my deck, but boiling soup is a pain in the butt if Griselbrand or a Dragon is on your field. Note: this is still difficult to play if you dont buy dlc, however using the free update packs may help, I refuse to pull an IGN and say "give them your money" the game can be difficult, annoying and you may want to throw something, I got angry with it before DLC came out but i will have a rating down below.\n\nOverall comparison:\n\n2015/2014: 2015 increases versatility, we dont have people running around with a crappy samurai deck nor a supra eldrazi deck, it isnt impossible to win games and have fun.\n\n2015/2013: 2013 in my opinion was my favorite, the decks were all balanced so anyone could win no matter what deck people were playing, but in this game we see a little unbalancing issue, there are many ways around it since it is a deck builder and we can have any number of decks (from what i can see) but some cards from some colors are just too powerful to ignore.\n\n2015/2012: 2015 is a miraculous improvement, 2012 simply gave us a better version of 2010.\n\n2015/2010: the original game that started the series has faded, and in many ways I could say that both have very positive attributes, while two-headed giant is gone, i still have fun absolutely destroying my friends, and i enjoy fighting mirror matches on practice mode. however 2010 had more options for a dual, you couldnt edit decks as much as the other iterations but you could change the life amount, hand size (and for some who dont know there was a "revenge" version of nicol bolas for his original deck in 2010 that you could play against in 2-headed giant which was insane) all of this changed the way the game felt.\n\nIf 2014 were a 10/10 this game would be a 7.65/10 (I argued with myself on this one...)\nif 2013 were a 10/10 this game would be a 6/10\nif 2012 were a 10/10 this game would be a 11/10 (vast improvements that made it better than the best possible product)\nif 2010 were a 10/10 this game would be a 10/10\n\nRating:\n\nOverall the game w/ DLC is a 7.5/10 (this refers to how much i wanted to keep playing and had fun)\nwithout DLC this game is a 5/10 (in my opinion it really does add that amount of flavor but you might think differently if you play it the base game was good enough for me to play through but not replay over and over like after the updates and expansion)","March 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Being able to build your own deck is easily the best part of the game, although the starter decks they give you are absolutely horrible compared to the starting AI decks. Do yourself a favor and pick the red/black combo at the beginning of the game, then grind out cards exploring planes after you beat the first plane to get cards to build a deck of a color you actually want. The game has yet to freeze on me, but I have been playing on a gaming desktop so that might be why. I briefly played on my laptop (stock) and it was slow but it worked okay. I don't know why this game has been getting so much hate honestly, I find it much more enjoyable than magic 2014. One potentially negative aspect is the lack of 2-headed giant, but at the same time I also don't care so....yeah? This game is very well priced at $10; you can unlock all of the cards just by playing the game. As far as the interface of the game goes, I don't really see it as a problem if you play using a mouse. When I used my laptop the touchscreen didn't handle it nearly as well, but at the same time I'm not a gamer so I can complain about having to take a few extra seconds to access a video game: If I want to play, I'll endure five extra seconds of scrolling.\n\nBottom line: If you like Magic, and you want to build your own decks, this is easily the way to go. If you're a nancy boy (or a girl named Nancy), I suggest you knock it off and buy this game anyways.","May 1, 2015","true","69.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

After 226 hours of playing this game i think its time to write a review. This game is good in some ways and bad in others.\n\nTHE REAL PROBLEM with this game is that it doesnt have many gameplay mods. for example 2HG. I LOVED playing 2v2. It was one of my favourite mods. And they just took it away from the game without caring about the people that loved it or for those who were just playing it for this particular mod or others.\n\nTHE REAL CON is that you FINALLY can construct your own decks. Putting in any colours you like, creating your own combos and unique ideas. That and one more thing is what kept me into the game. The other factor that made me play this game for so many hours are the new cards that were added and keep being added to the game.\n\nNow i want to say something to the company that made this game.\n\n1) Keep adding cards in this game.\n2) In the next magic game KEEP the abillity and the freedom of constructing your own deck.\n3) In the next magic game PUT MANY MODS and new cards and make a better ui u can rise the prise a little bit but many will buy it and you will keep the players IN the game.\n\nI am going to recomend this game. Only to the players that like 1v1 and prefer to play as a lone wolf. I am not one myself   But i still liked the game even if i am realy disapointed about the lack of mods.","March 25, 2015","true","261.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2moo/recommended/255420/","2moo","moo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2moo/","","This game came as part of a humble bundle I purchased.  I wasn't expecting much from it because I was under the impression that online magic games were pay2win crap, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the cards can be unlocked just through playing.  If you are impatient and hate money you can pay a certain amount to get everything immediately.  I usually feel cheated when people play cards against me I don't have access to (e.g. when I play in a casual modern tournament and realize the guy sitting across from me has a $800 deck), but the pool of cards in this game is fairly small and you will be able to make a decent PvP deck very quickly.  I actually enjoyed trying to find a way to turn a handful of bad cards into something usable when I first started playing this game.  It's like playing a draft.  I can't imagine why other reviewers are complaining about the starter decks being weak, do you really need Black Lotus to beat a laughably stupid AI with a deck full of 2/2s?  It took me maybe a day to run through the campaign and I've been only playing PvP since and I find it strange how easily I can get a match, even when I play at odd times in the middle of the night or very early in the morning.  One thing I like about this game is that Wizards seems to have hand-picked the cards available in it.  There are still cards that are much better than others, but it makes the meta unique to just this game.  The graphics in this game are a bit buggy, but overall the interface is nice in an dumbed-down Apple product kind of way.\n\nAll in all, it's a cool game if you like Magic.  Cockatrice is better, but this is still a nice change of pace from playing the same worn-out netdecks over and over.","February 12, 2015","true","266.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Perspective: I have played the original Magic game in the 90's, and I did get the 2012 edition of the game. I do not play IRL Magic.\n\nPros: 1) DECK BUILDING! I despised that I could not actually craft a meaningful deck in any of the prior games like 2012.\n2) Multiplayer seems relatively stable in 1v1 duels, which is what I usually play online.\n3) The AI is reasonablystrong, although it does get a bit predictable with extended playing.\n4) I am disappointed that WOC seems far more interested in their pocketbook than customers' enjoyment. The  pandering to buy DLC is rather demoralizing. The good news here is that if you just PLAY THE GAME through,  and are willing to go win a few duels online, you can get all of the cards that are available in the DLC for free.\n\nCons: 1) The fact that some of the higher end decks you fight in the single player mode have cards that you are not  allowed access to again speaks to the fact that the game is more about filling WOC's pocket than providing an experience that is as good as playing the IRL card game. That said, I still feel it was worth the $10 or so I spent on the game and the expasion. It would be nice if these cards were added to the player pool at some point.\n2) Again, you (don't) get what you (don't) pay for: the single player game is bereft of almost all semblances of a  single player game: animations, cut scenes, etc. There may be a total of 25 seconds of unique graphics in the entire base game, including the intro animation. The original 90's game had a significantly better developed plot and GUI for travelling and having random encounters/duels.\n3) Others have complained that the multiplayer lacks certain 3- and 4-player options that were present  previously. I cannot comment on this, but you can read others' reviews for the details.\n\nIn short, the game is not perfect, but few games are. I find it a good way to blow off some steam playing online 1v1 or vs. the AI, but it is not a game you will spend 100 hours or 100 dollars on. Get it for cheap on sale, and enjoy what is there.","January 19, 2015","true","294.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

That said, if you're willing to experiment, the card collection on tap allows for many flexible and entertaining archetypes, and offers some of the first real support for 3+ color decks (your decks can include all of the Ravnica dual lands, as well as the cycles of Alara and Tarkir tri-lands). If you like building decks, this has a pretty interesting metagame, and you can now unlock all of the cards just through play (no more irritating pay-walls for the premium cards).

But I simply can't recommend it unless you're like myself - nowhere near a card shop and/or have no friends to play it with. Allow me to clarify - the game /works/. You play cards and they do things. You can make your own decks from a library of existing cards (a big step over the last few versions of Duels of the Planeswalkers). Everything is functional... But the variety feels lacking. With the Garruk's Revenge expansion, this has been remedied to an extent, seriously switching up the experience. Maybe if they keep releasing expansions in a timely fashion and they contain interesting cards to make more and more interesting and viable decks, you should pick it up (probably during a Steam sale).\n\nTime of writing this, I believe I have just under 30 hours in Duels 2015. I played 2013 and 2014 for ~150 hours a piece. For some reason this version feels... Less.
