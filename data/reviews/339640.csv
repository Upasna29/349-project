So i hit the review button and let rip!\n\nThen something magical happened, a dev made it all better. Let me repeat that. A dev made it BETTER! Not worse. Not promising to fix it in 6 months. Not blaming anyone else. Not getting my review deleted, or sending me dog poop in the mail. Better, and he did it on a weekend and sent me a message to say so.\n\nWell im not far enough into the game to really tell what is like. But at the £5 price break is seems solid enough. Afterall if the dev can be bothered im sure gonna give it a fair crack of the whip and come back and review it properly later.\n\nNow take my fiver and buy a cold beer with it. I salute you.\n\nUpdate: Well this is tough for me. I really wanted to be able to say this is a great game and you will love it garanteed. But its not that straight forward. The Devs obviously care about this game and the players, but like a resue dog the game bears many scars from its tough and abusive past.\n\nFor me i didnt find one single thing thats wrong with this game, rather a collection of minor (but basic) gripes that just made the game rather hard work. For me it really highlights how clever a game like XCOM is and explains why they cost so much to make. Its hard to make things seem simple.\n\nFirstly although there are some nice ideas around mouse contols, controlling the troops doesnt feel that enjoyable, and in my first few missions i never did work out if there was even a simple way of rotating troops (so i guess that means there isnt!). This is important due to a harsh Line-of-sight mechanic that means you while you look out from cover you might not see the guy running accross the open car park toward you because he was 1 square to the side of your LOS.\n\nNext pacing. At the moment I think this is where the past abuse shows the most. The gameplay vs the business model is still a bit muddled. At the begining cash is so short that you cant afford basics like paying the mercs wages and health packs never mind guns and armour. It still thinks its a pay-to-play and it made me feel less 'special forces' and more 'special needs' while i rummaged through my fallen foes and the bins looking for a half eaten KFC to keep the team going.\n\nI dont want to sound too down though. For a fiver i think it is ok value, and if you like turn based games its worth ago because its solid enough that you might really like it and all the minor bits might not bother you. Plus with the devs working hard to get the game back to how they want it, many of my gripes may disapear over time. But at the moment i just didnt find the gameplay that fun or adictive like XCOM, Shadow Run, or even Silent Storm and have drifted away for now to play other stuff.\n\nI can't bring myself to change my recommendation. But is more of a yes-maybe, than a yes-yes","September 26, 2015","true","9.5"," 76 of 88 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","76","88","10","5"

It kept all my progress, which is handy and I have been able to play a couple of missions. The game plays the same as the online version without pesky micro-transactions. You unlock missions across the map as your mercs progress and can upgrade their weapons/armour/ammo with those you buy or find. You also have a mini-base to upgrade, if that takes your fancy.\n\nIt is a fun turn based game and although there are some limitations like no higher ground or explosions. The combat is still enjoyable and now it can't be accused of being P2W. Although I think they would be silly not to offer some mercs as permanent DLC. Luckily I was able to carry two of mine across already.\n\nAt a price of £5-£6 I think you should definately get your monies worth for a casual turn based combat game. The developers also appear to be fairly active and hope they will continue to support it. There is also a multiplayer mode if you want to fight other pesky humans,\n\nHowever, I have been told it is isn't the best JA game, so you will have to ask a real fanboy for that.","September 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","29","37","3","0"

The details and variety of the mercs, weapons, armour and crafting options was cool. I like to do a bit of micromanaging anyway. Of course, there's no grand strategy mechanics like in JA2 - just playing bland missions after another.

For long-time Jagged Alliance fans, this is more similar to JA: Deadly Games than JA1 or JA2 due to it's mission based approach. If you buy this expecting an open world, RPG/Strategy game like the classic JA2, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a well made turn-based strategy game, then JA Online Reloaded might be exactly what you are looking for. Just give it time because the difficulty of the missions, and the quality of the AI, improves after the first dozen or so missions.\n\nI also want to quickly say how impressed I have been by the responsiveness of the developers. There was a major issue on launch day that prevented me from playing the game. A developer responded to my query within 30 seconds of asking it and they worked through the night (on a weekend) to fix it.\n","September 27, 2015","true","23.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

It's like twice the content for half the price. I got my company back from when I tried the f2p version, kept all my campaign progress.\n\nSeems a little buggy atm, might just be my laptop. Got most of the way through a campaign mission and the end turn button bugged out. Still had alot of fun though. Good tactical combat, can build stealth characters, combat is similar to that XCom feel. You've got cover, line of sight, spending extra action points to aim, level system, gear customization.\n\nIt's been a long time since I played this. My sniper had some pretty sweet special gear I think I got from some side missions. I think it's kind of cool that she's got gear that provides next to no defense but gives her lots of crit chance and some percision to help aim.\n\nI dont remember what the economy was like in this game, but they said they rebalanced it to feel less grindy. I'm really glad they did this, but one thing I'm confused as to why they kept it in the game was that you have to pay upkeep to refresh your contracts with people you've hired. Your main character is free forever but I had to pay a little to refresh my contracts with my old sidekicks. Thankfully I already had enough to re hire them. I think it would be better to just have a base price to hire people rather than having to renew their contracts, it's not all that expensive but I think it's kind of annoying to have to keep money for that. But as for everything else, I definately think there's alot less grind for gear. Plus there's that dank side mission reward stuff.\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for this kind of game. I love tactical combat RPGs. If you like strategy games, tactical shooters, squad based RPGs or any combination of the 3, you'll like this game.\n\nNOTE TO THE DEVS: I love that you put this game into one package rather than having its old F2P stuff, but there's still some things that make it feel like a F2P game, such as renewing contracts and whatnot. Base upgrades, Im not sure how I feel about yet, but I guess having some sort of base progression could be nice. I'll update my reveiw upon playing this version more.","September 24, 2015","true","6.2"," 28 of 44 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","28","44","0","0"

The upgrading of your base is not my cup of tea, but I guess looking at the original monetization model, it is understandable.\n\nThis was the first JA title that "encouraged" me to go online and play with other humans...

Owing to the low money you get for missions, you can't equip all of your team with decent equipment. Subsequently later levels become an exercise in frustration. Only rarely, after repeadtedly redoing earlier levels, did I ever manage to get some decent equipment, but no extra cash (in game). Can't even afford medical equipment much less decent weapons and body armor.\n\nNot that it matters, no matter what I do, my mercs are instaintly overwhelmed and cut to peices within three-five turns. Repeated requests to fix the imbalances have been ignored such substantially lower the prices in the store and increaseing the rewards would help. Most other games your characters can use things like explosives and knives, but they seem to be unable to add those items here.\n\nSo unless you enjoy hour after hour of frustration and tedium, avoid this game.

Laughable and repetitive voice acting. Inability to rotate camera. Perception system and mechanic seems off to me.\n\nVery linear missions. If Gus Tarballs wants me to take out more bikers in the USA, I guess that's what I'll do because there's no other choice at this point. Everybody has to do the same PvE missions in order to upgrade their same hospital and same stoarge. One cannot even truly customize the hired mercs except by buying or finding equipment; there's an inability to change their names, outfits, or appearance.\n\nThe online component of game seems best suited for those interested in PvP, daily return rewards, and grinding the honor system so as to have their company name ranked on the leaderboard. Personally, I'm more interested in a single player experience.","September 25, 2015","false","4.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","2"

It limited the level I could get to with moderate gameplay so when the pay to own version came out I bought it and I was surprised that it had plenty of things for me to do to get higher level. I think it's worth the money to pay once to own the entire game. I am having fun and it's a good time killer. If you wait for it to go on sale, it's cheaper than a hamburger so give it a try if you like turn-based strategy games with the action-point system. I can't think of any cons at the moment so I will update this if I find any.
