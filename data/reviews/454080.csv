Its fun and somewhat difficult (if you suck like me) anyways, if you have trouble, download an .mp3 file, open audacity and change the file type to ogg vorbis, then save to your desktop, choose it and have fun! Great game but I dont see much replayability unless you have a library of songs you want to play with","March 14","true","1.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The game is very cheap but there isn't too much replayability.\nSomeone who likes arcade type games might enjoy this but this is just not my cup of tea.","March 14","false","0.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Level designs are different when you put your own music or use the built-in game tracks to play. Game is super fun but there's a few features that it lacks and I'm sure the dev will implement soon. Lack of leaderboards, controls are a bit iffy and you cannot use .mp3 only .ogg files but other than that it's more bang for your buck.. As of this writing the sale launch for this title is 1.59 and with levels changing drastically using your own music this game is a complete steal. Would recommend if you're on a budget.","March 16","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noteswift/recommended/454080/","noteswift","it emb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noteswift/","82 products in account","An interesting idea, I'll give it that. It's a unique combat-centric game that works to your own music while providing appropriate bundled tracks. (The metalstep really works well, and I've found electro does the same.) The game overall is a bundle of nice ideas, but the game lacks polish. I understand the minimalist style you're aiming for, but...graphical details? Backgrounds? In-game sound effects? More than 1 kind of enemy behaviour? Particles? Hello?\n\nAgain, the gameplay is unique. The methods of fighting back each serve a purpose, but the fact that you have options only comes in handy in the harder difficulties, where the game presesnts a proper challenge in terms of how well you can manage the horde behind you, other than the constant challenge of dodging pitfalls. The fact that you can even accidentally veer off into a pitfall and have to restart is irritating, and the comments putting your low score to shame don't help either.\n\nWhat I hate is that Burst is an arcade game with a score system, but earning points don't feel like they have any meaning; What's much more pressing are the enemies and pitfalls which have the potential to end the run entirely. If there was a better emphasis on unlocking things (through means other than getting better high scores) for something other than more enemy types, then I would be pleased to use what downtime I have for colouring the board for extra points. This would be a great time to include cosmetics or weapon upgrades or something. Most developers have the process backwards where they have a terrible idea ripped from a successful game and then expand on it too much, but you've got the opposite problem: a game that is unique and has potential but lacks in substance. Burst lacks in anything to give the game energy, and a proper lifespan to exist alongside the other use-your-own-music games.\n\nOne last thing is the requirement for .ogg files. I don't mind using them if it didn't mean having to pre-determine what songs you want to play before playing, and having to convert them all. It's a real hassle, and this is definetly what sets Burst back over other games where you can blow through your music library in one sitting if you like.","May 21","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
