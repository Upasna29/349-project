It is available for €5 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night 2 allows you to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha with Sam, Brock, Claptrap and Ash. And to hear the sarcastic lines of science fiction's deadliest A.I., GLaDOS.\nSo what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. While you are playing, you can complete quests to unlock Bounties. If you complete all four tasks, one of the characters will use an item to play. If you manage to beat that character you'll get a TF2 and Borderlands 2 item.\nFurthermore you'll earn chips that you can use to unlock special tables, decks and chips. The Inventory, the casino, will get a different appeance if you use a table, deck and chips of the same theme.\nI won't explain the rules of Omaha and Texas Hold'em, but i can tell you that this game is really awesome. While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!\n\nVerdict\n--------\nThis game offers a lot of fun for just €5. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!\n\nThis game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want to get all decks, cards, tables and unlockable items, you will be staying at the Inventory for 50 hours.\n\nScore: 81/100","November 27, 2013","true","39.1"," 116 of 151 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","116","151","0","1"

Poker system is good, it's classic poker and you can play Texas Hold'em or Omaha style., but ifyou just want to play poker this game is not for you, it's frequently interrupted by chatting of other players and you can't do nothing but wait till they finish. So I recommend this game just in purpose to enjoy the scene and atmosphere. Stories and statements are quiet repetitive, but what would you expect, when you are playing 156th game of Poker, just to make your account balance not be in red numbers.\n\nKinda funny and interesting.\n6/10","January 22, 2015","true","18.8"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","51","53","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizzquik/recommended/234710/","bizzquik","Bizzquik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizzquik/","674 products in account","I wholeheartedly recommend this game as a great way to relax after a long day of work/school.\n\nFor the most part, the characters around the table are fun and have lots of personality.  If you know their history, its nice to see these licensed characters play poker the way one might imagine.  But even if you've never heard of most of them, you'll come to know them - and their interesting quirks - in short order.\n\nSam is conservative with his betting, almost achingly so.  Ash is just as keen on bluffing as he is on raising the stakes - he *wants* the player to squirm.  Brock comes across as more studious with his bets, but won't hesitate to bet big when he feels he has the advantage; it is fun to just *watch* Brock think.  Claptrap is a wild card, and he knows it; he is fairly easy to intimidate and he seems eager to win the approval of his competitors.  His failures - and constant excuses - will make anyone familar with Borderlands want to hug him....and then hit him in the face.\n\nWhat makes the game particularly fun is that the characters seem to actually enjoy each other's company.  The lines are well read and the timing of their usage accurately reflects the events of the match.  GLaDOS is a perfect addition as supervisor for the evening's events - just as much as the other characters seem to like hanging out together, GLaDOS seems just as eager to be rid of them.  The dynamic works extremely well in keeping the match engaging.\n\nAs for the poker itself, its pretty conventional stuff; no doubt you've played similar games with similar mechanics before.  But the matches move right along at a good pace, and the "Showdowns" are enjoyably tense.  These moments also have the funniest lines, in my opinion.  (...Brock...poor Brock...)\n\nIn sum, Poker Night 2 is a presentation 'tour de force' with very competent game mechanics.  If you like card games, its not one to be missed.  Oh, and the price is great, too!","June 28, 2014","true","58.8"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","52","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/234710/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","A virtual poker game from the Telltale studio, with four characters from different titles, mingled together for your pleasure. And it gives you some items for Team Fortress AND Borderlands 2! Other good thing is what it is a relatively fast full-complete game, where you can get some basic poker skills, if you wasn't familiar with all that poker stuff before.\n\nSurprisingly, it is a second game! So I can't be helped but to compare it with the first chapter. Though before I'll drown in the collation, I'll give you some general info.\n\nAs a virtual poker player simulator, this particular game have many flaws. You have to listen an idle talk of some weird NPC characters, and the most of that talking is amusing at best, and, the worst, it gets repetitive quite fast. To succeed in the game, you need to complete some "goals", which can be easily seen as dumb moves. Like struggling for the showdown with only the kicker card, without any combinations... So, eventually, you'll make that goal, but how many times you'll fail miserably in the process? Only Fortune knows.\nIn short, Poker Night 2 almost non-recommended for normal poker game. If only you're not absolutely green in it, so you need a simplistic stuff for getting started.\n\nNow, to comparison with the first game:\n\nLike Brock (one of the characters there) saying: I guess it's one of those "take the good with bad" things...\n\n1) Characters. They are much less attractive than in the first game. Less talks (less lines, and especially good lines for every character), less of this "friendly" atmosphere, which was created by the predecessor. While I'm usually a big fan of Ash Williams from Evil Dead franchise, I really have to say that it was his worst appearance in the video games (and I've seen them all). Other opponents are also of almost no fun. Brock and Sam have maybe two or three funny lines each, and even Claptrap isn't that shiny thing to save the day.\nWorst of all, while trying to make them all a better players, Telltale wiseguys do not give them personal characteristics, behavioral patterns, which was a catchy feature of the first game.\n\n2) While failed miserably with characters, Telltale has improved other aspects of the game, like: fixed stability issues, added more skins to background, and more little features like ability to order some drinks to your partners, to weaken them... There are much more various music now, visual part is a way updated from the first game.\nThat's more, there you can play not only in the basic Texas Hold'em, but in the Omaha variant of poker as well. Which is good for your poker skill and flexibility of your mind.\n\n3) So far it sounds like "less talk, more action" stuff, which may be good, if you Just Want to Play a Poker... But alas! For some evil reason they cutted the ability to skip all those fuzzy repetative talks. So, when Claptrap is looping and freezing in the first time, it is fun, sure. But after you hear him 10-20 times, you obviously will be wanting to skip that *beep*. No such luck.\n\nI summarize:\nIt is not very good poker game, besides the fact it is easy to adapt and there are an Omaha variant as a plus to the classic hold'em. Play it, if you are getting the items for Tea Fortress or Borderlands 2, or collecting acheievements on gold. But if you are looking for an atmospheric and fun poker game, I suggest to play the first Poker Night game instead. It is better.\nMy mark is 6.2/10.","September 19, 2015","true","12.0"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","64","80","10","0"

If you have no clue what I'm talking about, then it might be best to mosey on. However, if you recognize the references above and laugh at the very thought, then have a seat at the table.\n\nLike the original, your enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend greatly on how well acquainted you are with the different franchises showing up. The group is a little more eclectic this time around, pulling names from television and film as well as video games. You're now playing cards with Brock Samson, the kill-crazy bodyguard from Adult Swim's Venture Brothers, Claptrap the robot from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams, the cursed warrior from the Evil Dead film series, and Sam, Max's long-suffering talking dog detective partner. To top it off, GLaDOS from the Portal series has dropped in to act as dealer.\n\nThere's at least as much dialogue as the first game had, and conceivably much more. Themed games (available once the player has unlocked a deck, chips, and table from the same franchise and activated them all at once) include exclusive conversations you wouldn't hear otherwise, and GLaDOS will often interrupt the players to ask if they could hurry up so she could get back to observing her tests. This is a far more volatile group than the original lineup. Brock has a temper that is always threatening to surface (especially when he loses a hand), while Claptrap and GLaDOS both make several remarks about killing humans. Ash seems rather calm, almost dazed, but he's just happy to be away from deadites for a couple hours. And Sam is the most level-headed of the group, even though Max is sitting in the booth behind him trying to throw him off his game.\n\nPoker Night 2 has loads of additional content, including a new game mode (Omaha Poker), unlockable decks, chips, and tables for each character that offer new dialogue and a complete redesign of the Inventory (the Sam and Max 25th anniversary set is my personal favorite), and 5 bounty items to collect, one from each player and GLaDOS. The unlocks are gained by spending Inventory tokens earned while playing, while the multitude of unlocks for both Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 get handed out when the player wins another player's bounty item. Unlike the first game, bounty items are not put up randomly, but made available when certain challenges are met in-game. Another change to the bounty mechanic has the item won once the player simply wins the tournament, rather than having to knock out the character who put it up. Cameos and in-jokes abound, some of them pretty freaking obscure. It's a treasure hunt for detail lovers.\n\nAs before, there is the chance of dialogue repeating. Unfortunately, Telltale did not include a skip option this time around, for no discernible reason. Another letdown is the fact that Ash sounds nothing like himself. Nothing against the actor who voiced him, but why not try harder to get Bruce Campbell? It would've really added to the experience, especially when all the other characters are faithfully recreated down to the original voiceover.\n\nStill, this is a dirt cheap title with a fun premise and solid execution, and I for one would like to see it continue. I've even had fun just speculating with other fans online about who should be included in the next installment. If you're a fan of any of the properties that Poker Night 2 has brought together, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you won't regret the purchase. Telltale Games has added more unlocks, more characters, and more dialogue, all for the same price. It's hard to beat such a deal.","July 29, 2013","true","38.8"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","51","62","0","0"

Seems you got money on you grab a set and relax lets just play some nice friendly games with big watts of cash.\n\nWhat is really good about this game is not the poker itself. Which you can find anywhere on the internet anyhow.\n\nCharacters\nIt is the characters and the humor they bring to the table. The characters were pretty enjoyable to play against and that is its strongest selling point. Yes, if you play enough you will hear repeated dialogue but thats not an issue if you play in small session for the long term replay value say 30 minutes-1 hour a day.\n\nPrizes\nI found earning items and skins to change the style of the environment also a nice touch that adds some value to the overall game.\n\nConclusion\nI would recommend this to anyone who just wants a quick break from their other games to enjoy hanging out with character personalities in a poker game.","February 3, 2014","true","28.4"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","4"

It continues bringing together many popular characters from different video games. This time Poker Night features Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (The Evil Dead), Sam (Sam and Max series) and GLaDOS (Portal) as your dealer.\nIn Poker Night 2 you have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in.\nAn humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory and introduces the characters. These characters will have fun lines to say on their own, but the real treat is when two or more characters talk with each other.\nEach character also has a special item that you can win from them that unlocks items in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.\nLike in Poker Night at the Inventory the sequel has no multiplayer option, so you always play against the same opponents.\nThe audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next.\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good poker game, then you should try Poker Night 2. The funny conversations and the items you can win make this a fantastic little game.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 2, 2013","true","10.4"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","0"

Even if you have a very good hand, they will most of the time beat you with unbelievable "god hands". This is one of my core complaints.\n\nSome people may say that I'm whining. It is definitely possible to do well against the A.I., and I've found the correct rhythm to regularly win against the computer. However, doing this requires you to be incredibly defensive. You must play much more conservative in Poker Night 2 in comparison to real life poker games because of the complete BS hands that the computer can get. Even when you have a very high hand, the computer will manage to tie with you. When combined with the gruelingly repetitive dialogue, this game can really feel like a chore for the items.

It is probably the best poker game for this price, or even any price.\n\nLong version:Poker Night 2, just like its predecessor, tries to do what a few other poker games did by enhancing video poker with quality writing. Everyone you meet here is a known character from a known franchise (video games and motion picture alike), and they chat a lot. Their banter is not only full of humour, but somehow manages to feel natural, even when they talk about time travel or demons.\nThe amount of spoken lines is impressive, and it can be boosted further by unlocking character-specific themes which all come with their unique bonus dialogues. This little addition can keep you in the game for quite a long time; it may take up to ten hours to unlock and hear everything.\n\nGood dialogues are great, but they couldn’t keep you around if the game is bad. Luckily TellTale managed to program a rather impressive AI for Poker Night 2; an AI that follows the characteristics of your opponents. They all have personalities and play accordingly… they sometimes even give small tells, if you look closely. Naturally they cannot substitute human players, but far as poker games go, Poker Night 2 is probably the best one you can get– and for a rather low price.","October 13, 2015","true","79.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

It happens on a regular basis.\n\nIn the first game it wasn't the matter that much but in PN2 it's just horrible.\n\nOn the other hand the AI is just annoying and stupid as hell. Yeah, go all in before even the flop is out, with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 and 7, and yeah OF COURSE WIN THE GAME WITH IT. I could headdesk from the start to the end of every game.\n\nThen the annoying lines of every character, it's just a bad joke. Recently you were busted out because you dared to go all in with 2 Aces when you discovered there was even another Ace on the flop, YEAH OF COURSE in the showdown you suddenly had a win chance of 16% or something because you only have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ three of a kind and both other guys definitely a straight or flush, OF COURSE. And then GLaDOS turns to you only to tell you how dumb and stupid you are. THIS GAME IS. It's not funny or clever, it just sucks. It's like stepping on an ant and then mocking it how weak it is and why it didn't defend itself. Dafuq?\n\nClaptrap, don't get me started. Squeaky, annoying voice, stupid wannabe funny lines, AND YOU CAN'T SKIP. You can't skip lines, that means you will hear some of them OVER AND OVER. While it's not soooo bad for some of them because at least they continue playing while talking, there are a few that interrupt the game, are annoying, lame, boring, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, not funny and when you have seen Claptrap stuttering w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wub for the 30384238273209213. time because his voice processor is broken while you just had to watch this scene and weren't allowed to keep on playing or skip this ♥♥♥♥, you just want to take your whole computer screen and trash it, throw it out of the window, stomp on the hard drive or shoot a kitten.\n\nThere should be an achievement "Endured 2219482934 not funny voice lines during poker".\n\nOh and I'm sure this review won't come back and bite me in my ample posterior.\n\nFOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE. If I had a huge hammer I'd smash GLaDOS and Claptrap to pieces, and if I have to hear Brock's stupid "BOOOYA" again when he wins a showdown AGAINST ALL ODDS, I'll rip my own ears off and stuff them into Steve's dumb face.

Can't say I've mastered the game for sure since your enemies are basically AI and Poker mostly deals with more of bluffs and body language than luck. This game would have been a plus had it had an online multiplayer feature, but i guess this will do.\nWhat I enjoyed most about the game were the characters and in-game conversations. They are so funny, especially Glados.

I must admit, I was pretty ecstatic about this before release.\nThis sequel to the original Poker Night at the Inventory combines the personalities of CL4P-TP from the Borderlands series, Ash from the Evil Dead series of movies and video games, Sam from the Sam and Max series GLaDOS from the Portal series, and lastly, Brock (What?) From the Venture Bros. TV Series. (Oh, also, Mad Moxxi from Borderlands is the bartender but she never says anything so ignore her.)\nWell, I'll just make this short and quick for all of you, just DON'T. This game, in my honest opinion, is just not worth buying. This game is not only a poker game, but it is also meant to be a comedy that you can get a good laugh out of as Poker Night 1 was. In Poker Night 1, I considered the interactions of Tycho (Penny Arcade) and the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) to be truly hilarious. However, this game in particular falls flat as both a poker game and a comedy. Firstly, to me, anyway, most of the lines were simply unfunny. They were either stale jokes that were easy to see coming, or puns. Plus, as if the lines weren't enough to ruin the comedy, there simply aren't enough of them. I can't count how many times I've heard Sam say "Sure is, exciting, isn't it?" in a row every single time he placed a bet. As a poker game, I'd say it falls flat in that the bots are far too ridiculous. It seems like every single hand the bots get is simply one card better than yours. For example, I got a flush with both of the cards in my hand, I enter a 1v1 showdown with Brock, who then beats me with a 1 card higher kicker than mine. (In Poker-ese, that's incredibly hard and unlikely.) But, if this was a one-time experience, I could understand it, it's just poor luck. But this seemed to be the case EVERY SINGLE TIME I got a good hand, though it may just be me whining, there seems to be very little reward for being able to read the bot's faces. They seem random, if anything, which in a poker game, is truly ridiculous.\n\nI do not recommend this game,\n»ZCC« Zombie Chicken","November 15, 2013","false","20.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","1"

It's a quirky game, with colourful visuals, great characters, great dialogue and some neat rewards. Oh, and there's poker. I had never played Texas Hold'em before (to this day, I think it's the only proper card game I've ever played) and after looking up the rules and having the tutorial fill in the blanks, I had a good idea of what to do. So much so, that I bought the sequel to play more and, more importantly, get more items for Team Fortress 2. I'll say it now; Poker Night 2 is definitely better than the first PN. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend it, mainly if you play TF2 like me. Now, that's enough backstory. On to the good stuff. (This review might be a bit on the long side).\n\nSo, once again, you're back at the Inventory, playing poker against 4 colourful characters from various entertainment. The first PN had Strong Bad (Strong Bad), Max (Sam & Max), the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) and Tycho (Penny Arcade). Now, we have Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Ash Williams (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam & Max). In my opinion, this is a much better cast. It certainly feels more balanced as opposed to the craziness of the first game. Oh, and did I mention that GLaDOS is the poker table and commentator?\n\nI won't explain the rules of poker (the game has another tutorial for that anyway) but I'll list off the features. In PN 1, you would play poker, win different decks and tables and stumble upon a chance to win a TF2 item by beating the retrospective character yourself. This chance was entirely random, so if you only wanted the item (let's face it, that's what we all came for) you would have to keep hitting the 'restart' option and hoping that someone would put their item on the table. When you take into consideration the fact that characters would occasionally fold frequently (I'm looking at YOU, Tycho), this would make the matches rather tedious, as you have to keep trying to make characters bet whilst not making poor decisions and giving them more money (making it even more long and tedious). Thankfully, this system has changed. Now, you complete challenges to have a player place a bounty on the table. Win the tournament and an item for Borderlands 2 and TF2 is yours. Lose the tournament? The item will be back on the table by the next match, no resetting needed. Also, there are new tables, decks, chips and the introduction of themes. Apply all the items in a set and the Inventory gets a BIG visual overhaul, changing the lighting, the background and giving the retrospective character a slight outfit change. There are also special cutscenes and dialogue that occur with these themes, both of which are quite entertaining. Seriously, the cutscenes with Steve in the Borderlands 2 set are some of the funniest moments in this game. More features include a second mode of 'Omaha' poker (again, there's a tutorial) and being able to buy drinks for the other characters, making them reveal 'tells' more often (basically, hints about the strength of their deck Yes, I said DECK). There's also a cheatsheet that covers all the possible hands but if you've learned poker then you'll probably know these.\n\nFinally, the dialogue is worth mentioning too, it's that good. It ranges from references, to asking others about their universes and some great humour (particularly with Claptrap). It stops the gameplay from seeming too stale and makes it more entertaining, even if you hear certain lines multiple times (I'M LOOKING AT YOU GLADOS). Now, the game isn't perfect. Some challenges may take time to beat and despite this, the replay value isn't that large. But, for what it is, Poker Night 2 is a solid sequel and a great poker game. If you own TF2/Borderlands 2, played the first PN, or both, pick it up for some good entertainment. 8.5/10","January 10, 2015","true","13.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Poker Night at the Inventory was fun, and Poker Night 2 theoretically improves on every aspect of that game; the decks, tables, and themes you can purchase in-game are of an even better class than ever before, and Telltale pits you against a whole slew of characters who not only live up to, but surpass those of the first installment. On paper, everything is jolly and lovely. But when you first start up the game, you realize something is wrong...horribly wrong. The effort this game forces you to put in to earn its touted TF2 items is a far cry from the laid back nature of Poker Night 1's system. By the time you've earned the fifth, and arguably best, item the game has to offer, you've trudged through 15 disgusting challenges the game concocts for the sole purpose of extending the longevity of the game, all at the expense of the player's mental health. Any joy you may have derived from listening to the delightfully witty banter of characters such as Claptrap or Brock Samson will quickly turn in to teeth-gnashing fury as you feebly try to find a way to skip past all the fluff just to fail the tournament at a critical moment, with the bounties right out of your reach. What's worse, the items you can earn are intrinsically linked to the Steam achievements for the game, which means that, for the unlucky few out there (yours truly included), playing in offline mode prevents you from reaping your hard earned rewards. The proposed solution to this issue?\n"Like we give a ♥♥♥♥, we already got your money, fool. Delete your save and try again"\n- Telltale Games and Valve Support.\n"P.S. You're our ♥♥♥♥♥ now, LOL"\n\nIn short, this game can only have concievably been concocted in the deepest wretches of Hell, created through an unholy union between Satan, Cthulhu, and Duma Key, and fashioned from the filthy excrement of a million aborted fetuses. Do yourself a favor and pretend the Poker Night series never made it past the first installment. Even the greatest of masochists would pale at the thought of playing this   inhumane creation.\n\nAlso, Sam is a ♥♥♥♥♥.","May 21, 2013","true","28.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's a Texas Hold 'Em tournament featuring fictional characters from somewhat recent games, and two cultural characters known from outside gaming.  LucasArts and Telltale veterans Sam and Max, and the damaged robots Claptrap and GLaDOS represent gaming, while Ash from The Evil Dead and Brock from The Venture Bros. round out the group.  Moxxie is the bartender, but you never interact with her.\n\nYou play as yourself, never seen, against Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam, while GLaDOS hosts and Max messes around off to the side.  The game then pretty much consists of playing Texas Hold 'Em while the characters chat and wisecrack at each other during the game.  While that's pretty much all there is to it, they do say some really funny things.\n\nAs you play, you can unlock special items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 by winning hands and completing challenges.  You also earn tokens you can use to buy drinks and themed items like cards, chips, and tables based on the franchises featured.\n\nFor me, this is one of the games I play just to wind down, and when I can't sleep.  It's not too involved, it's not risky or complicated, it's just poker.  With video games characters and jokes.

A poker sim with 5 players total. 4 From Different franchised games plus you the mute. This is a fun little poker game with very unique dialogues featuring Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from borderlands2, Ash WIlliams from Army of Darkness, Also Sam and max tag team this time around. GLADOS is the overseer of your hectic underground illegal poker game mocking you at any chance she gets. Some scenes will make you LOL. The core game is fun and quirky but is missing a lot of features to make this a complete poker game. You are forced to do 5 players  no more no less. There is no online or multiplayer at all. There are a few sets of unlockable decks, chips, and themes  based on each character to add some replayability and try to experience all the dialogue. CPU strategy can be messed around buying them drinks from the bar so they are not always predictable. In the end Poker Night 2 does leave you wanting so much more and proves poker games have a  place on steam. You can't beat its asking price of 5$ 1$ if on a sale.

A lot actually.....\n\nThis game is really frustrating and has nothing to do with poker, the players have no range at all and you don't have any fold equity. One exemple: 3 players with the same stack, 2 of them go all in on a A J 9 flop, the third one then call with 3 6 offsuit (no flush draw possible, no odds whatsoever). No one would ever do that, and it actually happens every two hands on that game. At no point I felt like playing poker or had any pleasure sitting at the table.\n\nThe characters are not funny, especially when they only have 5 different lines each. So you'll hear them making the same comments again and again.....and again. The pace of the game is very slow, every time someone talk, the game is paused even if the people talking are not in the hand.\n\nIf you like poker, don't play that game. If you don't know poker and would like to have a taste of it, for the love of god don't play that game and seek any other poker games out there. The only point of playing it would be if you really want the downloadable contents for Borderlands 2 or TF2\n\n2/10 (1 point for the downloadable contents and 1 point because Claptrap), would fold again","February 4, 2015","false","7.8"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

Taking place at the same old Inventory, only this time it's a game of Texas Hold Em or Omaha against Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams from Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max, while the mechanical GLaDOS from Portal acts as the dealer in this game. The gameplay is more challenging this time with more money then the last game, and every so often the players will either try to raise the blinds or go all in, it's a real gamble to see if your going to win or not. The game introduces the Inventory Tokens that act as your currency to buy beer for the players or to purchase Table Felts, Cards, and Chips, as their are 5 Table Sets. Buying drinks will sometimes help the player see their tells while unlocking the Table Sets from a specific theme will give the Inventory a new look, as well as some special dialogue for the characters along with some entertaining eliminations to the players. The exclusive items are back for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, by completing specific tasks, someone will place a Bounty Item on the table in which you have to win the tournament instead of knocking them out to win the item. I recommend playing Omaha to win the Bounty Items as you'll have a better chance in getting a good hand most of the time. Just like it's predecessor, the dialogue is wonderful to listen to, it's not that often you see 3 video game characters, a TV show character and a Film character having a nice friendly and comical chat together. I only had a few issues with this game, mainly the missions you need to complete to unlock a bounty challenge, some of them are simple while others rely on luck to complete them, and that tends to be annoying. And once again, no Online play. But other then that, Poker Night 2 is an epic game and since it's only $5.00 like it's predecessor, it's worth it.

For example:\n\n-- There's plenty of dialog in this game that not only gets repetative and annoying, but also is unskippable. This is simply frustrating.\n\n-- I don't play a lot of poker outside of this game, nor do I know the probabilities associated with different hands, but the hands will go on seemlingly long streaks of good or bad cards on the same players over serveral hands. What I mean is: you might have bad cards for up to ten or so hands while one or two of the AI have great cards for the hands. Whether or not this is typical of poker, this does get infuriating.\n\n-- The AI bet without logic a lot of time. I've seen the AI go all in to $10k - $20k+ on an Ace High hand after the River (5th) card has been delt. Nobody in their right mind goes all in on that much money with only a high card. There are so many other betting discrepancies that it's not funny.\n\n-- Going on the above point, the amount of betting that occurs before the first three cards are delt is rediculous. With a $20k buy in on you + 4x AI players, I've seen the pot hit $30k+ before the first three cards are delt. There is no hand worth a pot that much without seeing those first cards.\n\n-- The AI don't change their play styles and if you're paying attention even a quarter of the time, it's very predictable who you'll be facing off againt at any given point. For example, I've elimintate 3 out of the 4 AI players many times, but never have I ever not eliminated Ash.\n\n-- Another example is early game, Sam folds a lot. I'm not kidding. I've seen a player been busted out and somebody's up $20k+ before he ever makes any bet what-so-ever (apart from the blinds).\n\n-- There are too few unlockables and you earn way too many tokens. It is so easy to earn the tockens required to unlock all the skins for the decks, table and room, so you're left with all these excess tokens. The only thing other than those unlocks that you can spend the tockens on is drinks for the other AI players. This is not only fruitless half the time, but also doesn't seem to stem the tide of tockens you earn.\n\n-- This is perhaps my biggest complaint: There is not Multiplayer! No multiplayer mode, no online server (dedicated or otherwise), no LAN, no nothing! This means that not only can you not play with your friends, but the game itself gets extremely repetative after while because there's not enough variety in the AI and, as mentioned before, there's problems with the hands delt and the AI betting.\n\n\nAs you might be able to tell from my above list, there is so much about this game that annoys me. That being said, I kinda like and kinda dislike how easy it is to grind out all the achievements. Also, it does seem to be a half-decent time filler or TV companion. For example, if you're watching a movie or TV (especially if you're watching it on a second computer monitor), it's a fun enough game to play while watching.\n\nOverall, it's not a particullary great game and is definitely lacking (especially in the multiplayer department), but if you can pick it up cheap, then it's definitely worth it. Giving it a 6.5/10","June 21, 2015","true","31.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

First and foremost, you can no longer skip the table chat and cannot change the amount of discussion by the other players. While amusing at first, it doesn't take long to exhaust the included dialogue, leading to hearing the exact same gags game after game after game. There's also the bizarre choice by the developers to include Ash from the Evil Dead film series, yet the character isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. Instead we're treated to a thoroughly awful impersonation, both in terms of performance and writing. Furthermore, the way they use Claptrap makes me even less likely go any further with Borderlands, though in part this stems from how often he repeats himself, yet never shuts up. The high point of the game would be GLADOS from the Portal series, handling the job of dealer. Sadly that doesn't do too much for me when I really dislike most of the other players. Sam from Sam & Max is cool, but as is true to his character, also rather low key. I really thought this would be an excellent sequel, but I'm disappointed to say that I'll be keeping Poker Night at the Inventory as my default casual poker game and will merely make use of Poker Night 2 on rare occasions when I feel like something different.

Williams from Evil Dead.\n\nThese guys have the most amazing and hilarious things to say, and I can honestly say I'm not sure I've heard it all even though I played a lot of hours! The screenwriters in this game have tied together these characters in a way that many other games can't do, and since these are all loveble characters from already known media, you will probably already know them and recognize some things they talk about.\n\nThe thing that keeps one playing this game is first of all the conversations, but secondly the achievements. when you play against these guys you unlock different boards and enviroment of the room you play in, you also win different "famous" items from these guys, so there are quite a few things to do.\n\nBut yeah, I really recommend this game AS LONG as you enjoy poker.\n\nOh, and did I mention Glados is the one who's the dealer?

There simply isn't that much content to justify even a $5 price tag. You only get two poker modes, Texas and Omaha, and the dialogue becomes very repetitive after awhile. You CAN unlock some new dialogue options by winning consistently and buying full sets of unlockables (card decks, chips, and table covers for each character) but the dialogues are still random so the new stuff may take awhile to pop up.

It's not about ploughing through those hands per hour and getting as much action in as you can. It's all about attempting to create an atmosphere akin to a game with friends.\n\nThe most important thing in the game for me, is the characters and how they interact with each other and the player. The game has a lot of dialouge, and there's a few conversations between a couple of the characters, which is a nice change from the odd quip here and there.\n\nThe addition of a GlaDOS as the dealer is great, I could listen to her speak all day I think. I also like that Moxxi's manning the bar, I was disappointed she didn't even have a word to say though.\n\nOverall the characters have a good amount of lines, but not enough. I was getting repeats of the conversations within an hour of playing. I'm sure there's stuff I haven't heard yet, but I can tell that there's not enough dialouge. On the other hand. The game is priced at £3.99. I can't expect the voice acting that we've come to expect in our games.\n\nI would've really liked to have seen more characters. Even another two characters would make things more exciting. I don't mind playing short-handed (there's only ever a maximum of 5 players at the table), and having two characters able to rotate in with the rest would make each game feel a little different.\n\nThe AI has been vastly improved since the preceeding game. The NPCs all seem to have a distinctive style of play, which once figured out makes things a little easier. The tell system is often a complete giveaway. An observant player should never lose a tournament.\n\nOne thing that hasn't improved from the last game is the horrible UI. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to find the right raise sometimes. I'd love to be able to type in a number, or have incriments of chips I can drag to the table. It does the job, but it could be better.\n\nThe bounty system is quite fun, being presented with challenges to complete keeps things interesting. I'm enjoying unlocking the chip-sets, decks and felts as I accumulate more tokens based on my performance on each table. One of my favourite features in the game is that if you activate the deck, chip-set and felt from the same set the UI changes to be stylised to match. There's also a couple of other changes, but I wont spoil them for you!\n\nSomething else that I like is that if you're unfortunate enough to be knocked out you can watch the rest of the game play out. The game will even show you the NPCs cards.\n\nOverall, every damning point about the game can be easily defended by it's wonderfully low price. Personally, I would love to have seen a bigger game, even if it was sold at 3-4 times the price. I think they could have increased the price point to $10 and added some more content without losing a considerable amount of sales, but I guess that's not the type of game this is.\n\nBottom line: Casual poker fun with great characters at a great price.","January 2, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not great mind you, but good.  Anyone who has spent a significant time playing poker in the real world and then attempted to play it in video games would tell you that most poker video games are crap.  This makes sense, as trying to replicate the human mind as it plays poker would prove difficult.  Consequently, most poker AI is overly simplistic and not true to life.  This game is no different in that sense, but thankfully it's still an improvement from the previous installment.  The AI is a little off at times, but for the most part the computer players play a solid game and aren't prone to the ridiculous aggression found in the previous installment.  That being said, the betting is still off as it's quite common for a computer player to open a pot with a bet that's 10x the current pot.  If you have a good hand and are trying to get action that makes no sense, and if you have a marginal hand and are bluffing then why not go all in?  It's a confusing play that happens often.  Thankfully, the characters and banter are a huge improvement over the previous game (which was already quite good in that department).  The number of comments from characters and the various unique interactions between them makes this game less repetitive than the previous one.  Overall this game is a good one, but I still long for the day when we're able to better program poker AI.  This is likely the best poker game on Steam at the moment, but it's a 7/10 as far as I'm concerned.","October 22, 2015","true","37.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

XD\nAnywho I definitely recommend this game if you're into playing poker.\n\n"Poker ain't a game for cowards!" - Ash Williams","May 21","true","80.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Your opponents will frown, laugh, chat, bluff and make threats in order to win the tournament. There are two modes of Poker to play for each tournament that will offer new challenges and achievements to complete. When the player successfully completes a tournament, money will be won, tokens to be gained and a possible prized trophy to be received. The player will laugh or cry and possibly kiss his/her money goodbye.\n\n\nWhat Are The Pros Of This Game?\nMovie/Cartoon/Game Characters (Original Voice Actors)\nGood Game Controls\nGood Graphics\nFun & Entertaining Conversations\nAlternate Setting Changes\nAlternate Elimination Sequences\n\nWhat Are The Cons Of This Game?\nLimited Players (No Variety Of Characters To Play Against)\nNo Conversation Interaction With Players\nRepetitive Conversations\nOpponents Have Higher Luck Advantages\nEmpty Threats\nNo Fighting (Who Wouldn't Enjoy Seeing Brock VS Ash)\n\nWould You Recommend This Game?\nYes, I recommend this game for the fans of the characters in this game. It is interesting to see such characters interact with one another, but it is a shame the player (he or she) cannot engage in conversation or interact with them too. Puchasing drinks for other players is the only interaction with the characters in this game. I know this game is purposely released as a "Poker" game, but the developers could of enable more options for the player to interact by asking or answering questions or get into a brawl. However, the game does very well of being a simple card game simulator. My other complaint is there should of been more opponents to play against other than Ash, Brock, Claptrap and Sam. **Game Tip: Expect to "Fold" a lot in this game due to bad hand dealt to player percentages.\n\n\nFold, Bet, Raise or All-In For A Game Of Poker !!!","February 18","true","10.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

David Nowlin (Sam) is in way over his head as usual, failing to add the comedic punctuation and nuance that Sam's lines demand (one of the many reasons why the Telltale incarnation of Sam & Max has fallen far short of the original). Brock Samson is about as bland a character as it gets - deliberately so or not, it makes no difference; intentional blandness is still blandness. And finally, Claptrap manages to be even more obnoxious than both Strong Bad and Tycho combined - an achievement of sorts, I suppose.\n\nThe lines themselves repeat much quicker than the original Poker Night (it seems each character only has one "reaction" to an all-in, and given that all-ins occur quite often in poker, believe you me this is quite noticeable), and the TF2 rewards are a pair of Scout socks without a football (objectively inferior to the Football Manager socks), a mediocre Pyro hat, a Spy mask which by virtue of being a Spy cosmetic means that nobody will ever notice, and a Sniper hat that looks like five other Sniper hats. In other words, honestly nothing worth suffering through the stilted dialogue and soulless emptiness of "Poker: Vs. CPU".\n\nJust because it's cheap doesn't mean it's worth it.","December 31, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

It's not serious card-playing but it's fun, and counter to what some claim, I'm pretty certain it doesn't cheat.  The dialogue starts to repeat a lot after a while, but even now at over 28 hours played I occasionally get a piece I haven't heard before.

GLaDOS is excellent as always, and having her as the dealer was a wise move.\n\nWhen it comes down to it though, actual poker players say it's nothing like playing poker, and the unlockable bounties for Borderlands 2 straight up don't work; it's possible to get them if you contact Gearbox support, but I think when you have to open a ticket to recieve what is debateably the biggest selling point of the game, the product is fundamentally flawed.\n\nThis isn't a game for poker players or collectors.","April 1, 2015","false","3.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.\n\nAnd the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.\n\nSo at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.","January 9, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After all, Portal 1 was only the test subject.\n\nThe selling point of the game and what it's most known for is its cross-universe character interaction.\nHow would Sam react when Ash goes all-in?\nHow would Brock  feel under the control of GLaDos?\nThis is the best  feature, and it is very well-done. In the first game it was only characters that were licensed to Valve and Telltale, but now it includes a lot of new  faces and some that people may excite themselves over. The cross-promotional items are another reason why you should get this game too, I guess.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\n+Some dialogue are pretty funny (the first time)\n+Includes a new game, 'Omaha' as well as Texas Hold 'em\n+Dat suspenseful card reveal\n+Quirky personalities\n+I just think that what the game gets right, it gets it perfectly, but the things it doesn't quite acheive, fails\n\n-Claptrap\n-The dialogue may be the best you've ever heard, but it keeps repeating and some actually stops the game just to play it out. Nice watching it for the first time, not so much at your 5th.\n-I don't know, but I feel that the dialogue has much less lines that the first game.\n-When they are bluffing, they bluff to the point where they actually go all-in. If you try to bluff, they call even when they have crappy cards. I think it's much harder to bluff them into folding, unlike the first game.\n-Claptrap (again)\n\n\nReally good game, better than the first. 7/10 for me\n","May 3, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But Bruce Campbell, who portrayed him in literally all of his actor and VO appearances (excluding the musical) doesn`t voice him here.

I am comparing Poker Night 2 to several other games I've played, including DD Poker 3, Dogs Playing Poker, the free Yahoo poker game, and Governor of Poker.\n\nFirst the good.\n\nCharacter animations. Poker Night 2 is the best of the bunch, since DD Poker and the yahoo game have no player animations, Governer of Poker has 2D animation consisting of the player's hat and hands only, and Dogs Playing Poker is quite old and low res. But best among a terribly weak field is not much of an achievement.\n\nDialog. Funny once. Unfortunately it quickly runs out and you start hearing repeats. Over and Over. With no way to turn it off.  And appreciation of the humor depends on picking up the various game culture references. I loved Portal and Portal 2, so GladOS as a dealer works for me. I never played any of the Borderlands stuff, or Ace Ventura, so those references pass me by.\n\nAnd the bad\n\nTournament structure. You start with $20,000, the big blind is initially $800, and it goes up in $400 increments pretty rapidly. So it's no limit, and you're starting off with just 25 big blinds. Suppose your first hand is pretty good, and you get a good flop. You'd typically bet before the flop, and make at least continuation bets after the flop and on the turn. Well if you do, and one of the other players doesn't fold, you're going to be all-in by the river. Its not uncommon to see all-in's on the first hand, whether you play it or not. So the structure of the tournament means the game is over pretty quickly. You won't spend even an hour patiently and slowing grinding down your opponents in this tournament structure. No matter how solidly you play, you're on thin ice from the start due to only having 25 big blinds -- a level at which some players are already looking for their last-stand hand.\n\nPoker AI. The four opponents do have distinct personalities and play styles. Sam plays fairly solidly. ClapTrap is random enough to be difficult to predict. Brock is aggresive, and Ash is a maniac. And what a maniac. As in ten-seven off suit all in before the flop kind of maniac. On the first hand, just because one player raised and another one called ahead of him.\n\nAnd this brings me to the biggest controversy about this game. Quite a few people have accused it of cheating. And the accusers seem to be the more serious poker players, not just whiners. The developers have denied this, and claimed that writing a game that cheats would be harder than writing one that doesn't. I don't believe that. I'm a professional programmer, with nearly 30 years of industry experience, though not in games. What I think is that writing a bad AI is easy, writing a good one that can beat good players consistently is very very hard. It's a lot easier to cheat.\n\nLet me explain why I think they'd be motivated to do this, other than because it's easier. Have you ever watched poker on TV? You do realize that it's edited, right? The boring hands are almost all edited out. They don't show you the hand where one player raises before the flop and everyone else folds. It's not entertaining. They show you the big confrontations, the sweats and especially the outrageous bad beats.\n\nSo if you wanted to make a non-serous poker game that's fun, you'd do the same thing. And that's what I think Poker Night 2 has done. Because comparing playing it versus the other poker games Poker Night 2 deals many more bad beats. Many many more. It works both ways, as a player you get to apply bad beats as often as you receive them. This is not cheating to make you lose, it's cheating to make the game more exciting. Because lets face it, poker for play money isn't all that exciting by itself.\n\nPoker night 2 deals many more flushes, straights and full houses than I think you'd see from an honest dealer. Because my dry ace beats your dry ace isn't as exciting as my full house beats your flush. Or your flush beats my straight.\n\nI can't prove this, of course. I suppose I could write a bot that played the game and leave it running for a week and record the hand distribution, but that still wouldn't satisfy some. And what's the point. It's supposed to be a fun game, anyway. The game even hints at this. After raking in your chips, Sam will tell you "You didn't stand a chance once I decided to win". And GladOS, after you win a head, may say "Now lets see how you do when I'm not stacking the deck in your favor". If nothing else, these kind of lines are why the developers shouldn't be surprised if someone thinks the deals are set up. I think this "game design" philosophy is also why the blinds are structured the way they are, to get the excitment going quickly, and keep the game short.\n\nSo on that level, I think the game succeeds. If you like having plenty of chances to win and lose big, quickly, without having to grind through a ton of boring hands first, then this game is far less boring than an honest game like DD Poker 3. It's cartoon poker, for the impatient kid in you.\n\nSo after a mostly negative review I have given this game a 'yes', but it's really provisional: it depends on what you're looking for. As a serious poker game I can't recommend it. But who looking to buy this  really expects it to be a serious poker game? If you want serious poker, I recommend DD Poker 3 -- it's a free download. On the other hand, if entertainment means lots of crazy hands and few boring ones, with a cartoon backdrop, then this game is going to entertain you. And I think the deck-stacking is very well done -- you have to play quite a while and switch back and forth between it and other poker games before you feel certain the hands here are crazier in general.\n\nA couple additional notes: Poker Night 2 also can play Omaha. Omaha is also no limit, with the same blind structure as the Texas game. That added a little value for me, because I didn't have an Omaha game. And if anything, the Omaha game is even more conducive to crazy hands. Second note: the dealer isn't the only one that can cheat. You can search the web for the tells that the game regularly gives you. Just in case you weren't born with the inate ability to read poker tells off of an animated dog.","April 5, 2014","true","360.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But Bruce Campbell, who portrayed him in literally all of his actor and VO appearances (excluding the musical) doesn`t voice him here. It`s just jarring, like someone trying to do an impression with none of the charm.\n\nAdd to that the unlocks are also pretty ehh as well, none of them particularly stand out compared to the Poker Night 1 unlocks.

As it is, the canned diologue gets stale fast.  I turned it off after a couple games, but now I have to watch them miming their lines.  That's right - you can't skip the incessant dialogue.  It turns fifteen minute games into thirty minute games.  It turns thirty minute games into purgatory.  Then there's the menu - even the *menu screens* take forever.  There's like a four second delay to move between them.  And when you press escape, it likes to default not to the actual menu, but to the unlocks screen.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.  I can only recommend this game to Buddhist monks for whom limitless patience is a possibility.\n\nBut if you find it for $2 then, meh, it can mix up your game library when other games get stale and you forget how much of your time Poker Night 2 loves wasting.

Because Poker Night 2 isn't for everyone. But, you may very well be that person, and this reviewer says, you most likely are.\n\nI'd go really overly-in-depth, because it's my preferred critical style, but Steam has a text limit I'm wasting...with a superfluous sentence, anyways, here's what you really need to know about Poker Night 2.\n(Spoiler alert: It's really not that much, just a few things.)\n\n1: It is absolutely sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory, and it has changed a lot of things.\nNow, the game presents the really cool new changes in an interesting and cool way, so I'll put this part in a spoiler. Don't worry, it's not some kind of big story-driven game, I just respect the way that they knew people would come from the first Poker Night expecting the same thing, and they have a fun way of introducing the new stuff. As a gamer, I implore you to skip this if you care about Poker Night as an experience, but encourage you to read it if you're trying to be careful about your money.\n\n\nChange A: $20,000 buy-ins starting with 400 - 800 blinds.\nThe game no longer limits you to a puny $10,000 with starting blinds of 200 - 400. All the virtual preliminaries have been multiplied by x2. Little thing, but I think it was a great idea. It makes everything feel that much more valuable and, literally, high stakes.\n\nChange B: Inventory tokens.\nYour proficiency is rewarded with tokens. The tokens can be used to buy new chips, decks, and felts, as well as to buy drinks for each character, making them infinitely usable. Buying drinks for other players increases the amount and clarity of their tells, or for non-experienced poker players or the layman, it makes the characters tipsy and makes them unable to keep a focused poker face. A pokused facer foke. A hocus pocus trace.\nSorry.\nAnd, like I said, they are used as currency towards getting new chips, decks, and felts. Like the first game, each of them are based off of the 5 new characters, and in order of how much their sets cost: Borderlands, Sam & Max, Venture Bros., Army of Darkness, and Portal. That's 15 things to buy. And, the felts now change the look of the inventory, as well as character appearances, and tons of new dialogue for having different felts and combining the chips, decks, and felts of a single canon.\nThe amount of tokens you get are as follows:\n5th place - 0\n4th place - 10\n3rd place - 20\n2nd place - 50\n1st place - 100\nThe cheapest item is the Borderlands chipset for 20 tokens, and the most expensive is the Portal felt for 480. Buying drinks also costs 5 tokens per character.\nSo, that pretty much covers tokens.\n\nChange C: No dialogue options.\nOther than subtitles and a mute option, you're stuck watching/listening to the animations and dialogue of each character, even if that slows down/gets in the way of gameplay. I'll talk more about that later.\n\nChange D: Bounty Challenges\nAgain, I'll talk about this one later, but I'm sure many of you desire Poker Night's TF2 and/or Borderlands items, and they're not the same as the first time around. Read more, because things have changed, and you'll want to hear about it, trust me.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\n2: Don't buy it if you know you don't like poker games.\nUnless you're one of those people playing for the items, in which case I direct you to skip this and go directly to #3. Otherwise, if you're thinking about buying this game for any other reason, make sure you're anywhere above a hater of poker if you want it. If you've never dealt a hand in your life, or you like/are experienced in the dealing, I give this game a seal of absolute approval. The AI is designed not to give you a realistic feeling of the psychology of poker, but rather the video game alternative. Experienced poker players and ignorants like me before I played the first Poker Night will have fun learning how each character tells, plays, and values their gut over their mind. It is a great game for learning how to play poker, and on its own right as a fun game to figure out how to be good at. Looking at card games as a gamer is like looking at the cavemen figure out how to match star patterns as a scientist: humble beginnings, and fun. You can play Texas Hold 'Em or its alternate, Omaha Hold 'Em.\n*Important note for noobs, poker itself is not a card game, but an array of card games played similarly with changing rules depending on the name of the game. Texas and Omaha Hold 'Em are the two variants you play in Poker Night 2.\nBoth games are extremely similar and friendly to newcomers, and the game includes a tutorial on the game accessible at any time, as well as a cheat sheet which shows the differnt kinds of hands and the hierarchy of their value.\nAnd for the pros, you'll find that the experience of having AI in the place of human combatants isn't entirely jarring, and fun in its own right thanks to their good design and fun personalities.\n\nSo, if you absolutely know for a fact that you cannot stand Poker by all means testable, stay far, far, far away from Poker Night 2. It is practically nothing BUT virtual high-stakes poker.\nBut, for everyone else, hop right in. That is, except for...\n\n3: The poor, poor item junkies that buy this game to get the items.\nYou guys are in for a real crapshoot. Unlike the 1st game, you can't just start a new game over and over until you get the chance to knock one guy out for the item. It's MUCH harder this time around. You are assigned 3 random "Bounty Challenges", that you must complete before you can get a chance at getting the item. But, if you want a specific item, lucky for you, because you can actually just start a new tournament over and over until the character puts up the item you want, and you can try over and over forever. Sound nice right?\n\nWell, unfortunately, it can't be that simple.\n\nFirst of all, the Portal item can only be acquired after collecting all the bounty items. Trust me, it's a headache. Because the challenges couldn't be simple things like "Win a tournament" or "Buy drinks for everyone."\n\nThere are those options, and thank god there are. You can expect to get 3 levels of difficulty from the random challenges: "Easy gimmes, Hard, Extremely Improbable".\n\nYou might end up with the "Come in Fourth place" or "Buy everyone drinks" challenge, but expect it to come with: "Steal a hand on the turn" and "Win with only a high card."\n\nIt may not sound too hard now, but trust me: The 24 hours of gameplay I currently have at the time of writing this review has been done SOLELY to get those items. I am currently on the Portal bounty item. I spent all of my free time just yesterday, as well as 3 hours this morning, ONLY, I repeat, ONLY on a SINGLE challenge: Win a hand with just a high card.\n\nFor you item-seekers, trust me: this is going to be a very. Very. Very. Very. Very. Bueller. ...hard experience.\n\nIf I could get back all the time I wasted getting those items, I would. It doesn't feel worth it at all.\n\nIf you've got a lot of time with nothing productive or of superceding responsilbility to do, and you've got enough patience to justify literally days of being insulted by computers, then I leave it up to you to assume the green light. Otherwise, I advise you to do the right thing and go outside instead.\n\nAnyways, I've reached the text limit, so here's my final statement:\nI definitely recommend Poker Night 2 for everyone except item-seekers and poker-haters.","July 1, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4P\nI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.\nYeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.\nIn my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.","October 15, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings a lot of joy and fustration, but usually my fustration get's cleared with all the side conversations that happen when you play. Not to mention that the characters that play with you are mostly Taletell favorites, Brock, Claptrap, Ash Williams, Sam, and GlaDOS. The bounty challenges are neat, once I complete a bounty challenge then get the prize, I go onto Borderlands 2 / Team Fortress 2 to look at the items (they're all humerous.)

[monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]\n\nSynopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.\n\nThe amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.","March 4, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I came away from my first round of poker thinking, "this is one of the best telltale games I have played in years. The gameplay is simple poker, Texas Hold'em and Omaha. nothing special, just the basic game. The real draw for players to buy this is the interactions between the characters during the games. Each character has many lines of dialogue, almost all of which are great, and they poke fun at  Gearbox studios, TellTale and many TV/Film personalites. GladOs is a great card dealer, and always adds a cynical or homicidal quote after most hands. The visuals are great, the character animation sare clean and smooth, far better than the first Poker Night, and The only drawback to the entire game is that the game might have done better had they included a few more crazy animations when characters are removed from the table.\n\nAll in All, a absolute treat and perfect for a few hours of addictive and cynical fun. If you like TellTale, poker, Borderlands or TF2, this is the game for you.\n\nAnd if you don't like any of the above, buy it anyway.

Amusing High Stakes Poker with a Hint of Potential AI Cheating.Genre: Single Player Comedy Card Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Telltale Games\nPlatform: Windows and MacOSX.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nIt’s a cross-over poker game, plain and simple. Where the player plays against four other characters from different universes in media The four characters, Brock, Ash, Claptrap and Sam, add to the atmosphere chatting and bantering to each other. They’ll talk about events in their universes, stories of what happened to them and generally hang out. It’ll help to know at least half of the cast or much of the humor♥♥♥♥♥♥ences will go over your head. As far as the poker aspect is concerned, there’s the option to play either Texas Hold'em or Omaha rules. The objective is to win the Poker Tournament and not lose the $20K buy-in. Good luck, you’re probably going to need it. This game has a vicious difficulty that I can only surmise is due to quite a bit of cheating on the AI’s part. Far too many times I’d have a pair of aces only for the AI to bet high and get a straight or flush. That’s one example of many where the AI feels far too omniscient for its own good. Even if it isn’t cheating, it’s way too convenient how many times the other players win. Outside of winning poker, you can get chances at earning each character’s special trophy and earn poker coins to unlock cosmetic items. To get said chance at winning a character’s special trophy item, you’ll need to complete the objectives given to you. Once you’ve done that, win a tournament. Again, good luck on that.\n\nThe Characters and Interactions\nIt's a pretty good selection of characters in this game that work off each other rather well. Claptrap is his usual self. So, you’ll like/dislike him just as much you do in Borderlands. GLaDOS makes for an entertaining poker dealer with her usual biting barbs at the contestants. I didn’t find Ash Williams to be all that interesting. I’m curious why they picked him over any other number of Telltale characters they could have used. Brock is an amusing straight man and carries himself well. While Sam makes his entrance to the series with Max in the background being, well, Max. They tell some interesting stories and really, this is where the meat of the game is. Which shouldn't be surprising as Telltale is really good with character interactions. There's quite a bit of amusment to be had just hearing these five characters talk to each other. Whether its about how good that bet was or what kind of dog Sam is, there's quite the range of subjects brought up at The Inventory. You'll get at least a couple of hours of lines that are new or fresh before they start getting repeated. After that, you'll hear quite a few lines repeated with a the occasional story being brought up now and then.\n\nPC Settings and Stability Problems\nGraphics options are pretty limited. There’s a rendering quality slider that swaps between low and high. Anti-aliasing is only switchable between on and off. Additionally, there’s a plentiful amount of screen resolutions and full-screen on/off. There’s music, sound and voice audio sliders as well as subtitles. The only gameplay options are “how to play”...so not much to be found here. There’s no difficulty slider so if you think the game is too easy/hard: you’re out of luck. I should also note that there isn’t any Steam Cloud support.\n\nUpon replaying it for this review, I had it crash on me a couple of times for no discernable reason. I did try making it a windowed game and that seemed to help but I can’t be 100% certain that fixed it. There’s also been a number of reports on the Steam community that also seem to indicate crashing problems with the latest releases of Windows 10. So, I’m not too sure how long this game will continue to run if it’s this unstable already.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you’re going to pick up Poker Night 2, pick it up for the characters and interaction. Playing poker against AI is a tricky business at best and it’s easy to think its cheating even if it really isn’t. Though in this case, I do think PN2 is cheating at times. The convenience of how good their hands can be is just a little too much for me to buy. PN2 is good for a couple of hours and by then you’ll have heard all the fresh lines before the characters start repeating themselves ad nauseam. After that, there’s really not much of a reason to keep playing. Tells are too telegraphed and there isn’t much to really draw you in. Still, if you want to listen to GLaDOS berate Sam for making a lousy bet, I’ve heard of worse ideas.\n\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","July 24, 2013","false","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am comparing Poker Night 2 to several other games I've played, including DD Poker 3, Dogs Playing Poker, the free Yahoo poker game, and Governor of Poker.\n\nFirst the good.\n\nCharacter animations. Poker Night 2 is the best of the bunch, since DD Poker and the yahoo game have no player animations, Governer of Poker has 2D animation consisting of the player's hat and hands only, and Dogs Playing Poker is quite old and low res. But best among a terribly weak field is not much of an achievement.\n\nDialog. Funny once. Unfortunately it quickly runs out and you start hearing repeats. Over and Over. With no way to turn it off.  And appreciation of the humor depends on picking up the various game culture references. I loved Portal and Portal 2, so GladOS as a dealer works for me. I never played any of the Borderlands stuff, or Ace Ventura, so those references pass me by.\n\nAnd the bad\n\nTournament structure. You start with $20,000, the big blind is initially $800, and it goes up in $400 increments pretty rapidly. So it's no limit, and you're starting off with just 25 big blinds. Suppose your first hand is pretty good, and you get a good flop. You'd typically bet before the flop, and make at least continuation bets after the flop and on the turn. Well if you do, and one of the other players doesn't fold, you're going to be all-in by the river. Its not uncommon to see all-in's on the first hand, whether you play it or not. So the structure of the tournament means the game is over pretty quickly. You won't spend even an hour patiently and slowing grinding down your opponents in this tournament structure. No matter how solidly you play, you're on thin ice from the start due to only having 25 big blinds -- a level at which some players are already looking for their last-stand hand.\n\nPoker AI. The four opponents do have distinct personalities and play styles. Sam plays fairly solidly. ClapTrap is random enough to be difficult to predict. Brock is aggresive, and Ash is a maniac. And what a maniac. As in ten-seven off suit all in before the flop kind of maniac. On the first hand, just because one player raised and another one called ahead of him.\n\nAnd this brings me to the biggest controversy about this game. Quite a few people have accused it of cheating. And the accusers seem to be the more serious poker players, not just whiners. The developers have denied this, and claimed that writing a game that cheats would be harder than writing one that doesn't. I don't believe that. I'm a professional programmer, with nearly 30 years of industry experience, though not in games. What I think is that writing a bad AI is easy, writing a good one that can beat good players consistently is very very hard. It's a lot easier to cheat.\n\nLet me explain why I think they'd be motivated to do this, other than because it's easier. Have you ever watched poker on TV? You do realize that it's edited, right? The boring hands are almost all edited out. They don't show you the hand where one player raises before the flop and everyone else folds. It's not entertaining. They show you the big confrontations, the sweats and especially the outrageous bad beats.\n\nSo if you wanted to make a non-serous poker game that's fun, you'd do the same thing. And that's what I think Poker Night 2 has done. Because comparing playing it versus the other poker games Poker Night 2 deals many more bad beats. Many many more. It works both ways, as a player you get to apply bad beats as often as you receive them. This is not cheating to make you lose, it's cheating to make the game more exciting. Because lets face it, poker for play money isn't all that exciting by itself.\n\nPoker night 2 deals many more flushes, straights and full houses than I think you'd see from an honest dealer. Because my dry ace beats your dry ace isn't as exciting as my full house beats your flush. Or your flush beats my straight.\n\nI can't prove this, of course. I suppose I could write a bot that played the game and leave it running for a week and record the hand distribution, but that still wouldn't satisfy some. And what's the point. It's supposed to be a fun game, anyway. The game even hints at this. After raking in your chips, Sam will tell you "You didn't stand a chance once I decided to win". And GladOS, after you win a head, may say "Now lets see how you do when I'm not stacking the deck in your favor". If nothing else, these kind of lines are why the developers shouldn't be surprised if someone thinks the deals are set up. I think this "game design" philosophy is also why the blinds are structured the way they are, to get the excitment going quickly, and keep the game short.\n\nSo on that level, I think the game succeeds. If you like having plenty of chances to win and lose big, quickly, without having to grind through a ton of boring hands first, then this game is far less boring than an honest game like DD Poker 3. It's cartoon poker, for the impatient kid in you.\n\nSo after a mostly negative review I have given this game a 'yes', but it's really provisional: it depends on what you're looking for. As a serious poker game I can't recommend it. But who looking to buy this  really expects it to be a serious poker game? If you want serious poker, I recommend DD Poker 3 -- it's a free download. On the other hand, if entertainment means lots of crazy hands and few boring ones, with a cartoon backdrop, then this game is going to entertain you. And I think the deck-stacking is very well done -- you have to play quite a while and switch back and forth between it and other poker games before you feel certain the hands here are crazier in general.\n\nA couple additional notes: Poker Night 2 also can play Omaha. Omaha is also no limit, with the same blind structure as the Texas game. That added a little value for me, because I didn't have an Omaha game. And if anything, the Omaha game is even more conducive to crazy hands. Second note: the dealer isn't the only one that can cheat. You can search the web for the tells that the game regularly gives you.

On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.\n\nUuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it.

[monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]\n\nSynopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.\n\nThe amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.","March 4, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I will anyway.\n\nI just want to take the developers by their shoulders and shake them violently until they come to their senses.  The simplest changes would improve it dramatically.  As it is, the canned diologue gets stale fast.  I turned it off after a couple games, but now I have to watch them miming their lines.  That's right - you can't skip the incessant dialogue.  It turns fifteen minute games into thirty minute games.  It turns thirty minute games into purgatory.  Then there's the menu - even the *menu screens* take forever.  There's like a four second delay to move between them.  And when you press escape, it likes to default not to the actual menu, but to the unlocks screen.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.  I can only recommend this game to Buddhist monks for whom limitless patience is a possibility.\n\nBut if you find it for $2 then, meh, it can mix up your game library when other games get stale and you forget how much of your time Poker Night 2 loves wasting.  But don't worry.

Amusing High Stakes Poker with a Hint of Potential AI Cheating.Genre: Single Player Comedy Card Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Telltale Games\nPlatform: Windows and MacOSX.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nIt’s a cross-over poker game, plain and simple. Where the player plays against four other characters from different universes in media The four characters, Brock, Ash, Claptrap and Sam, add to the atmosphere chatting and bantering to each other. They’ll talk about events in their universes, stories of what happened to them and generally hang out. It’ll help to know at least half of the cast or much of the humor♥♥♥♥♥♥ences will go over your head. As far as the poker aspect is concerned, there’s the option to play either Texas Hold'em or Omaha rules. The objective is to win the Poker Tournament and not lose the $20K buy-in. Good luck, you’re probably going to need it. This game has a vicious difficulty that I can only surmise is due to quite a bit of cheating on the AI’s part. Far too many times I’d have a pair of aces only for the AI to bet high and get a straight or flush. That’s one example of many where the AI feels far too omniscient for its own good. Even if it isn’t cheating, it’s way too convenient how many times the other players win. Outside of winning poker, you can get chances at earning each character’s special trophy and earn poker coins to unlock cosmetic items. To get said chance at winning a character’s special trophy item, you’ll need to complete the objectives given to you. Once you’ve done that, win a tournament. Again, good luck on that.\n\nThe Characters and Interactions\nIt's a pretty good selection of characters in this game that work off each other rather well. Claptrap is his usual self. So, you’ll like/dislike him just as much you do in Borderlands. GLaDOS makes for an entertaining poker dealer with her usual biting barbs at the contestants. I didn’t find Ash Williams to be all that interesting. I’m curious why they picked him over any other number of Telltale characters they could have used. Brock is an amusing straight man and carries himself well. While Sam makes his entrance to the series with Max in the background being, well, Max. They tell some interesting stories and really, this is where the meat of the game is. Which shouldn't be surprising as Telltale is really good with character interactions. There's quite a bit of amusment to be had just hearing these five characters talk to each other. Whether its about how good that bet was or what kind of dog Sam is, there's quite the range of subjects brought up at The Inventory. You'll get at least a couple of hours of lines that are new or fresh before they start getting repeated. After that, you'll hear quite a few lines repeated with a the occasional story being brought up now and then.\n\nPC Settings and Stability Problems\nGraphics options are pretty limited. There’s a rendering quality slider that swaps between low and high. Anti-aliasing is only switchable between on and off. Additionally, there’s a plentiful amount of screen resolutions and full-screen on/off. There’s music, sound and voice audio sliders as well as subtitles. The only gameplay options are “how to play”...so not much to be found here. There’s no difficulty slider so if you think the game is too easy/hard: you’re out of luck. I should also note that there isn’t any Steam Cloud support.\n\nUpon replaying it for this review, I had it crash on me a couple of times for no discernable reason. I did try making it a windowed game and that seemed to help but I can’t be 100% certain that fixed it. There’s also been a number of reports on the Steam community that also seem to indicate crashing problems with the latest releases of Windows 10. So, I’m not too sure how long this game will continue to run if it’s this unstable already.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you’re going to pick up Poker Night 2, pick it up for the characters and interaction. Playing poker against AI is a tricky business at best and it’s easy to think its cheating even if it really isn’t. Though in this case, I do think PN2 is cheating at times. The convenience of how good their hands can be is just a little too much for me to buy. PN2 is good for a couple of hours and by then you’ll have heard all the fresh lines before the characters start repeating themselves ad nauseam. After that, there’s really not much of a reason to keep playing. Tells are too telegraphed and there isn’t much to really draw you in. Still, if you want to listen to GLaDOS berate Sam for making a lousy bet, I’ve heard of worse ideas.\n\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","July 24, 2013","false","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's Omaha now, which is nice, I suppose, and the unlocks are less random, which means that you'll be able to more easily get to the unlock that you want.\n\nBut that's why you're playing it, aren't you? I can't imagine many people playing this game for the actual enjoyment of it. Honestly, why would you? With the aforementioned betting system, coupled with the complete randomness of your opponents' play, finding this fun is something that's just beyond me. There is some minor amusement to be gained from the conversations, but that doesn't last very long, first because of the terrible writing and second because of how little there is relative to the amount of time required to unlock all the items. By the time you've got all the bounties, you've heard them all at least a few times over.\n\nBottom line: Buy this on sale, unlock the items you want, and then uninstall.

That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:\n\n-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.\n-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.\n-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.\n-The animations are borky\n-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.\n-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?\n-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.\n\nLuckily, there are some good things about the game as well:\n-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.\n-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.\n\nBuy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.","January 1, 2014","false","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's Omaha now, which is nice, I suppose, and the unlocks are less random, which means that you'll be able to more easily get to the unlock that you want.\n\nBut that's why you're playing it, aren't you? I can't imagine many people playing this game for the actual enjoyment of it. Honestly, why would you? With the aforementioned betting system, coupled with the complete randomness of your opponents' play, finding this fun is something that's just beyond me. There is some minor amusement to be gained from the conversations, but that doesn't last very long, first because of the terrible writing and second because of how little there is relative to the amount of time required to unlock all the items. By the time you've got all the bounties, you've heard them all at least a few times over.\n\nBottom line: Buy this on sale, unlock the items you want, and then uninstall.

It's very odd, given the circumstances, I would have thought I'd never get this addicted to a simple card game, and it doesn't help that before playing this, I didn't play card games at all. As I started to play the game more, however, I started getting the hang of how things worked in Texas Hold 'Em and I started developing stradegies. Now, I'm the only one in my family that can play poker, and I won't let them forget that. I've been constantly asking members of my family to learn how to play so I could have someone to play with instead of the computer, and my addiction was only taken further when I started learning other card games outside of poker. I know the story I just told was a little off-topic, but it's a big factor in what made me like this game so much. Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.\nThat's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.\nI also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.\nOh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.\nIn my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker.","March 10, 2014","true","41.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cards that you are dealt can also make you want to uninstall the game, especially when you get dealt dead for 30+ hands. The bots don't know that they're doing, sometimes they flop a house and other times call with air. You cannot predict the bots, and be sure to only all in when you have something higher than two-pair, because this game can screw you up. A letdown in terms of poker, you can't even skip the dialogue; and after a while it just gets so annoying.\n\nOnce I get all the promo items, I'll  be sure to uninstall this one.\n\nEDIT: Lost my first potential bounty item with a Queen 10 to 5 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/234710/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nPoker Night 2 follows a familiar pattern that you have probably seen or at least heard of before, and much like the original title Poker Night at the Inventory, it puts you, The Player against four other characters from different blockbuster franchises not only from the video game industry, but also from television series and movies, in tournaments of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em. This time around your adversaries are Sam from the Sam & Max franchise, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise, and Claptrap from the Borderlands series, in addition to GLaDOS from the Portal series which takes the role of the dealer. There isn't a story that unites those characters at the Inventory poker table, but having them in one place is great no matter the circumstances, and even though there is no adventure or story to follow here, hearing from them once again is just as nice. Even with the thought of the game being a simple poker simulator with your favourite characters as your adversaries in mind, the game does little to set itself apart from other such games apart from having those characters in it; there is only a short introduction cutscene when you start the game for the first time that shows you making your entrance at the Inventory for the first time and bumping into all those characters along the way as you move towards the table, and after that everything will become an endless repetition until you eventually get bored of the game. Even if you aren't familiar with some of the franchises that brought you those characters, they will make themselves known to you as you play more and more with them and hear their stories, but the really pleasure comes for those long-time fans of one of those characters, because hearing themselves explain one of their adventures that you are already familiar with in different way and in some ways making a parody of it is unlike nothing else.\nRating: 7\n\nGameplay\nThere's no catch here, it's poker: you either dig it or you don't, but considering the amount of poker games out there, some of which come at no cost at all, looking at Poker Night 2's only 2 game modes and the lack of any sort of multiplayer you realize that if you got this game for the actual poker playing experience, you clearly got the wrong thing. Sure, Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em are the most popular poker modes, but just like anything else it will get boring to follow the same road every tournament without any twist to change the actual game. Poker was always one of the most popular forms of gambling and even if virtual poker games still maintain that feeling by using virtual money and chips, it doesn't feel like gambling unless you play against other human players. Playing against the AI gets boring incredibly fast simply because their next move will always be predictable in a form or another, and even though the difficulty of the game is somewhere around what would be a normal level, you can't increase or decrease the difficulty to your liking if you're looking for a more intense experience or a more relaxed play. The only things that will change the boring atmosphere come in the form of unlockables, that once activated will change things like the deck of cards, the table or the chips and activating all three of them from the same theme will trigger a different scenery effect specific to that theme, making the Inventory look like the set of another Evil Dead movie or the next chamber of Portal experiments, but even so, those changes are strictly visual and will not affect the core idea of a repeating poker experience that is isolated to the AI battles only. Apart from the items that can be unlocked using tokens that you'll win at the end of each tournament according to what position you finished on and the ability to order drinks from the bar for your adversaries there is nothing else to distract you from what is an incredibly repetitive set of plays that is limited in every possible way.\nRating: 5.5\n\nGraphics\nPoker Night 2 isn't the prettiest game out there, even compared to other poker titles only, but it's not bad looking either; the characters are nicely done, the backgrounds are pretty and those unlockables really change the scenery in a pleasant way, especially when you combine all three of them from the same theme package. The animations are decent, even though the lip sync can be way off at times, but all the funky moves of those characters that combined with audio effects create some funny moments make up for it. Things don't look bad in any way, but you can clearly see some cubic edges when the camera zooms in on a character's face and so on.\nRating: 6.5\n\nAudio\nThe cast, even though small, does its job of creating a rich audio environment as Sam is voiced by David Nowlin, Max by David Boat, Brock Samson by Patrick Warburton, Ash Williams by Danny Webber, Claptrap by David Eddings and GLaDOS by Ellen McLain. The one great thing about Poker Night 2 comes in the form of its epic dialogue between all those legendary characters that will constantly tell jokes and stories, all to the delight of the player. As good as those jokes are however, they won't last forever, and even thought the first hours of the game will be a pleasant surprise for the fans of those characters as you hear more and more stories about them, they will get repetitive eventually and when they do, that fun will almost instantly turn into boredom.\nRating: 8\n\nExtras\nIf you're a fan of those characters or at least some of them, you'll have fun in the game for a few hours, but after you've heard everything there is to hear, which shouldn't take longer than 5 hours to do, your only motivation will come in the form of unlockables which in a worst case scenario will take around 10 hours to unlock all, and after that there really is no reason to come back: you'll hear the same old lines over and over again, there is nothing else to win or see and there are much better poker games out there available for free, which can also be played online.\nRating: 4\n\nVerdict\nPoker Night 2 is a delight for those who appreciate the classics and wanna hear more about their favourite characters and this game is the perfect opportunity to see some of those legendary characters all in one place, but that special treatment will only last for a few hours, and once that is done and you've heard every joke those characters have in store for you, Poker Night 2 is just another game that you won't play ever again.\nRating Overall: 6.2\n\nCheck the full review and a lot more about Poker Night 2 at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=216","January 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although the game is pretty much the same as Poker Night 1. There are still some new things. You can now play Texas Holdem or Omaha, Omaha uses more cards in a hand while TexasH only uses 2 in a hand. The promos of course are back and I figure thats why people bought this game much like the first one. The bots this time are Brock Samson from Adult Swims Venture Bros, Clap-Trap from Borderlands, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max. Others such as Moxxi from Borderlands 2, Gladdos from Portal, and Max (again) make apperances. The bots are improved and much smarter. Brocks AI resembles The Heavys from poker 1 but he is willing to take more risks but may also give up more. Clap-Traps AI resembles Max as he folds very often on the slightest bets, but can surprise you at times and is slightly smarter than Max. Ashs AI resembles Strong Bads as he calls even when he has a bad hand. He also tries to scare off everyone by making huge bets and raises and even going all in just to win the pot. Ash has the best luck of all 4 players(in my experience) and Sams AI resembles Tychos, as he plays very strategically and folds when he knows he wont win. Though he goes all in when he thinks he can scare off the otheres for the pot or when he has a good hand. The dialouge can get redundant and can prolonng the game, but seeing Ash punch ClapTrap as he struggles tosay Boobies is way too funny to skip. If you liked the first game, and also want the promo items, get the 2nd one, its better as has more to offer.","July 14, 2014","true","60.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's one thing to have some level of small talk by your favorite characters... I mean, that's why I bought the game! Initial raise gets you a reaction comment. If you all-in, you get 5+ gasp reactions from the group, even if they've folded previously, then they'll fold 80% of the time, then you'll get a 'player win' or 'player loss' razzing from GlaDOS and whomever won or lost. Also, Sam might be playing, but Max constantly interjects... and I hate those two from the first game. The dealer randomly tosses insults you as you are dealt cards, reraise, win or lose hands... and it's almost always Claptrap at the showdown, so anyone who hates him will hate him on a 1-on-1 level.\n\nThe rewards system sucks! Original Poker Night would give you the 'reward' after you knocked out the one player w/ the item. This one has you complete 3 "challenges" to get a shot at a bounty, then you have to knock out all 4 players. One of the challenges is "Spend 8 perfect tournament's worth of tokens to unlock the Portal set" so those challenges aren't fluff either. There's no reset for them aside from deleting your save. Some folks on the Steam Forums say they have been stuck for over a year on same challenge.\n\nEven if you were magic, you'd have to do 10+ perfect games to get the unlocks... and they're time consuming! Until the blinds are 800/1600, these guys fold neatly on most raises like a pair of pleated pants. Oh, and despite having a SHiFT account and Borderlands 2 installed, none of the Borderlands stuff unlocked natively and I had to submit a SHiFT ticket with Gearbox. TF2 stuff unlocks W/O any hitches, as is the norm.\n\nThe game looks pretty. I hate to badmouth it... but I bought the game because I liked the characters and wanted the unlocks. Spending a ton of hours to get the unlocks, when I'd rather be in B2 or TF2, and starting to hate the characters I liked before I started playing... honestly made me very unhappy.","May 29, 2014","false","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It constantly reads the hand you have incorrectly - many many times I would have a straight or full-house but it'd only see a pair or two-pair. You'll be face palming so often your head will start to concave. Seriously how did this even pass play testing?\n\nIf you want it for the TF2 and BL2 achievement items it's... alright? The items are only for looks. Which isn't really a bad thing. Some look better than others. Overall that's the main reason I keep playing it. I feel the items are needed to get my money's worth.\n\nThe meaty part of this game though really is the characters. That part gets a 10/10. GLaDOS especially is hilarious. The only reason I recommend it is for the character appeal.

The AI are also known to cheat at times, and although they give off tells, they can be completely off the mark.

Although the game is pretty much the same as Poker Night 1. There are still some new things. You can now play Texas Holdem or Omaha, Omaha uses more cards in a hand while TexasH only uses 2 in a hand. The promos of course are back and I figure thats why people bought this game much like the first one. The bots this time are Brock Samson from Adult Swims Venture Bros, Clap-Trap from Borderlands, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max. Others such as Moxxi from Borderlands 2, Gladdos from Portal, and Max (again) make apperances. The bots are improved and much smarter. Brocks AI resembles The Heavys from poker 1 but he is willing to take more risks but may also give up more. Clap-Traps AI resembles Max as he folds very often on the slightest bets, but can surprise you at times and is slightly smarter than Max. Ashs AI resembles Strong Bads as he calls even when he has a bad hand. He also tries to scare off everyone by making huge bets and raises and even going all in just to win the pot. Ash has the best luck of all 4 players(in my experience) and Sams AI resembles Tychos, as he plays very strategically and folds when he knows he wont win. Though he goes all in when he thinks he can scare off the otheres for the pot or when he has a good hand. The dialouge can get redundant and can prolonng the game, but seeing Ash punch ClapTrap as he struggles tosay Boobies is way too funny to skip. If you liked the first game, and also want the promo items, get the 2nd one, its better as has more to offer.","July 14, 2014","true","60.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's one thing to have some level of small talk by your favorite characters... I mean, that's why I bought the game! Initial raise gets you a reaction comment. If you all-in, you get 5+ gasp reactions from the group, even if they've folded previously, then they'll fold 80% of the time, then you'll get a 'player win' or 'player loss' razzing from GlaDOS and whomever won or lost. Also, Sam might be playing, but Max constantly interjects... and I hate those two from the first game. The dealer randomly tosses insults you as you are dealt cards, reraise, win or lose hands... and it's almost always Claptrap at the showdown, so anyone who hates him will hate him on a 1-on-1 level.\n\nThe rewards system sucks! Original Poker Night would give you the 'reward' after you knocked out the one player w/ the item. This one has you complete 3 "challenges" to get a shot at a bounty, then you have to knock out all 4 players. One of the challenges is "Spend 8 perfect tournament's worth of tokens to unlock the Portal set" so those challenges aren't fluff either. There's no reset for them aside from deleting your save. Some folks on the Steam Forums say they have been stuck for over a year on same challenge.\n\nEven if you were magic, you'd have to do 10+ perfect games to get the unlocks... and they're time consuming! Until the blinds are 800/1600, these guys fold neatly on most raises like a pair of pleated pants. Oh, and despite having a SHiFT account and Borderlands 2 installed, none of the Borderlands stuff unlocked natively and I had to submit a SHiFT ticket with Gearbox. TF2 stuff unlocks W/O any hitches, as is the norm.\n\nThe game looks pretty. I hate to badmouth it... but I bought the game because I liked the characters and wanted the unlocks. Spending a ton of hours to get the unlocks, when I'd rather be in B2 or TF2, and starting to hate the characters I liked before I started playing... honestly made me very unhappy.","May 29, 2014","false","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It constantly reads the hand you have incorrectly - many many times I would have a straight or full-house but it'd only see a pair or two-pair. You'll be face palming so often your head will start to concave. Seriously how did this even pass play testing?\n\nIf you want it for the TF2 and BL2 achievement items it's... alright? The items are only for looks. Which isn't really a bad thing. Some look better than others. Overall that's the main reason I keep playing it. I feel the items are needed to get my money's worth.\n\nThe meaty part of this game though really is the characters. That part gets a 10/10. GLaDOS especially is hilarious.

It's actually currently a "free" offering on PSN as well. Wherever you play this though, you are in for a treat. You are the nameless, silent "The Player" and are playing against Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam and Max, and Ash Williams. The dialogue is pretty witty and at times hilarious as the other players talk amongst themselves, have little jokes and jabs they throw your way, etc...the table is hosted by GLaDOS, who is also the dealer, and who interjects passive aggressive hostile jabs at all the players throughout the game. Actually, GLaDOS's dialogue is effective at representing the subtle menace for which it is known.\nThere are a few options in the game that enhance the experience, most notably the ability to upgrade your chips, felt, and cards to the settings from all the other characters origin worlds/stories, which outside of changing the appearance of the room/table/et al, also unlockas new dialogue between the characters. You can also buy drinks for the other characters, delivered by your favorite bartender, Moxxi, in whose bar you are actually playing poker in. The drinks cause the other players to be more obvious in their tells.\nSpeaking of tells, each of the players has them. Brock is a hothead and will often bet without a real hand. Ash plays more like Gus Hansen, Claptrap plays a solid game overall, and Sam almost always folds unless he has a real hand.\nThat's pretty much it. Outside of the setting, dialogue, and some challenges which allow you to unlock new skins and such for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, it's pretty much a straightforward Hold 'em and Omaha game. So, if you like poker and video games, you will probably enjoy this. If not, look elsewhere for sure.","October 21, 2013","true","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I'm sorry to say but for me this poker game just screams computer automated. When I say this I mean to say that every round you come close to winning - you lose. Now I know what your thinking, "you're just a bad poker player". But I'm not, in fact, I've been playing poker in real life and in games for almost 2 years now. As another one of my side-hobbies, now please bear with me when I say this game is a slap in the face to the common poker player. Because 70% of the time you find that your cards are not better, by a long-shot or a short one. Now I know Telltale can do better with this, and it has in the past and the future with their other games. (Including the first Poker Night at the Inventory.) I have played the first poker night, and even on the hardest level - and I could win tournaments. But sorry to say, in this game that doesn't matter if you have a decent hand.  But for some others this might not be a problem, but for me and maybe a couple of other decent poker players it is. I'm not trying to be a sissy when I say I cannot have a decent hand and never win. Frankly I don't care about the achievements at all, I just love poker in general. But to me this game just ruins it, Telltale needs to put some realism into the game.\nThank you","November 30, 2013","false","9.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game was a ton of fun for the first few hours, but between Claptrap being completely annoying and Max just being a d**k, it almost made the items not worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the unlocks, but I nearly went insane having to constantly place insane bets to get even minor pots. If you want a few cool items for Borderlands and TF2, go ahead, you'll probably like them. But if you're new to poker, this game is a cheating motherf**ker that will CONSTANTLY go out of its way to give you absolute Hell. Got a three of a kind? Too bad, you only have a high card. Have a royal flush? Sorry, we're just going to count it as a normal straight. I recomend picking it up while it's cheap, get the items, and either keep it for some themed poker or refund it. I highly recomend the original, even if almost all of its unlocks were merely reskins.\nBTW, why in the Hell are Brock and Ash here? Brock's entertaining, sure, but the theme of this series is gaming/gaming related media. While Evil Dead at least had a game series, Brock's inclusion is just confusing. I personally would have tried for getting the rights to Phoenix Wright, as Phoenix is a small time poker series in the canon of his games, but then again, Capcom doesn't have the best track record when it comes to multi-corperation co-operation.","November 26, 2015","false","20.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

No matter how many times I re-install this game it just won't work at all for me. I've tried installing it on four different computers (multiple times) and each time it crashes before it even gets to the title screen. That's a huge issue, and a lot of other people I've talked to have had the same one.\n\nI've played on a friend's account where it worked half the time, and it was a pretty nice game. It had humourous dialouge and made me feel like I was good at poker. It had a lot of downsides though. The jokes became pretty monotinous after a few hands, often cycling through ones that were said just moments before and after a while you had heard every one. There are non-skipable scenes in this as well, which makes farming for the items that you can get a bit frustrating. It often ignores your hands as well in the game, allowing for an NPC to win when you clearly would.\n\nThe negative aspects outweigh the positive, but since I personally like playing poker games I purchased it I was hoping to play it when I wanted to killl some time (the items being a nice bonus too). Since it doesn't work for me and I ended up wasting my money and my time by installing it over and over, I'm giving it a negitive review.\n\nBut if you want you can take a chance, because it may work for you.

Repetitive dialog that cannot be disabled continually slows down the game.  Although it was a bit fun at first.\n\nThe game also cheats, for lack of a better term.  Based purely on game statistics, it appears that there is a mechanism in place to keep players from going all in.  I play a lot of hold-em and it is pretty obvious to me that the game is not on the level when the player goes all in.  Play the hand with standard betting, no problem.  Go all in with a 80% hand and you will lose 90% of the time.  So, standard hold-em strategy will not work properly.\n\nIn pure English the deck is stacked against you in a way that defies normal play when you go all in.  You will lose a lot more than you should.  I am not talking a little bit either.  They probably did this to weed out the players who go all-in all the time and win based on pure luck and not skill, but it removes an element that makes hold-em the popular go to game every where, the show down.  Couple that handicap with the fact that some of the bounties require you to win those show downs and this gets even more frustrating as the only real way to do this is grind away until the game gives you a break and lets you win a hand you should win with no problem.","November 29, 2014","false","6.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnCaveson/recommended/234710/","JohnCaveson","John Caveson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnCaveson/","100 products in account","A simple poker game in which you play with several fictional characters from several media outlets. (Some of whom I recognize)\n\nThere are only two poker games you can play: Texas Hold'em, and Omaha. (Compared to the first game which only had Hold'em)\n\nAs a sequel, it improves upon several aspects of the first.\n\n1.) The addition of Omaha to the available gamemodes can shake things up a bit. But not much.\n\n2.) You can buy drinks so characters will show their "tells" more.\n\n3.) More unlocks. The addition of different poker chips as well as the ability to change the theme of the entire Inventory when completing a set, adds more variety cosmetically to prevent the game from going stale too quickly.\n\n4.) Challenges. Instead of just knocking out the person for his unlock, you have to complete challenges, and then win another tournament.\n\n5.) Multiplatform. It's not just on Steam this time, it's also on XBox, which means more accessibility.\n\n6.) More 3rd-party unlocks. Just like last game, you get to unlock ingame items for not only TF2, but Borderlands as well this time.\n\n7.) Better graphics.\n\n\nHowever, there are a couple things that makes it worse than the first game.\n\n1.) Less dialogue. There's less voice acting in this one, which means the talking can get repetitive much quicker than the first game.\n\n2.) Less options. There are less options that you can configure, particularly a "dialogue frequency" option that controls how much the characters talk. This helps exemplify the problems of number 1.\n\n\nVerdict:\n7.5/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nCompared to the first game, it improves some aspects, but falls short on others. I gave the first game a 7/10, I'll give the sequel 6.5/10, with the fanboy in me bumping it up to 7.5/10 (like last game) because of the characters and witty dialogue.\n\nIf you're looking for a poker game, this wouldn't be for you. But if you're a fan of the characters, enjoy some witty dialogue, and wouldn't ming getting a few more special items to your TF2/Borderlands inventory, and wouldn't mind the bargain price of $5, then I'd highly recommend this game.","May 30, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I shouldn't need to describe that any further. If you don't already know what poker is then you prolly shouldn't buy this game.\n\n\nThe neat thing about Poker Night 2 isn't in the actual gameplay. Again, it's just poker. What makes the game neat is the fact that you're playing poker with an interesting set of characters. Each character has their own set of tells and conversations they will strike up with each other. It's fun and cute for a while.\n\nI say "for a while" because eventually they start repeating themselves. Once I started seeing the same dialog over and over, I started to tune it out. At that point, I was really just playing computer poker by myself.\n\nSo overall: It's poker.

The first Poker NIght in the inventory had far more options like adjusting the AI's chat and skipping chat altogether.  The first game also had far far better playing partners in terms of characters and humor.  I didn't know who Tycho or Max was but  learned to like them.  In this one, even the characters I knew were annoying, with bad writing and bad interations with both the player and other AI.  Characters insulting you when you play a card is not funny, it is annoying because we know the play better than the AI and you cannot skip it.  The only reason to get this game is to unlock the extras in TF2 and other games.  Other than that stick wtih the first installment of the game, they put sooooo much more into that game and took so much away from this one, it seems like they didn't even care about this game at all, it has 1/10th the effort and LESS customization options for chat, inexcusable.

More crossoveryness, with extra characters besides the 4 other players (GLaDOS is the mother♥♥♥♥ing dealer). Even more unlockables than the first game, since there are 5 items for Team Fortress 2 and even Borderlands 2 this time, with its own set of 5.

The first game had 4 different settings to select from for the conversations, and this one has no such thing, nor any difficulty options. The AI is noticeably smarter than the first game, and this one just a lot more enjoyable all around. You can earn inventory coins to buy sets of chips, decks, and tables, one of each for each of the 5 franchises represented here.

They are funny first several times, but hearing same thing again and again is very annoying. I have to completely shut down sound in game and listen internet radio.

It just gives me an error message every time at the same point in its loading sequence.  I get the logo and the preliminary sound effects, but the game itself just up and quits whenever it tries to load the opening sequence, or the main menu for that matter.  I don't even know which comes first, I've never even seen that far past the loading screen.  This game stole five dollars, except it didn't, the package deal to throw in Poker Night 1 was all I got.  I already had the first Poker Night game, that is what inspired me to buy the sequel in the first place.  And then it turns out from a review that I didn't even miss anything because it wasn't even Bruce Campbell as Ash from Evil Dead.\n\nAnd now all I have to show for it is a broken game and a broken link that takes me to it.  An unfulfilled promise from a overall unfulfilling game.  I cannot say which was worse.","February 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Its funny and the atmoshere is just cool. And for sll achievments hunters, it's easy to earn all of them. If you got Team Fortress 2 or Borderlands 2 you surely want the special items. I love these quests to end. It makes me playing longer than normal. On the first part of this game you could close and open the game until they offer their special items, here is not that easy. You have to end those quests to let them offer their special items. Cool is the new feature where you can buy some alcohol for the mates. This let them say what for a hand they have. I always wanted to change the styles sometimes because to play on the same table, background, cards and chips will get boring and here we can change these styles. Negative is that sometimes the rounds are bugged then you have to close the game to continue. This is the only negative aspect here. All in all this game is just amazing. If you love to poker or want those items then you should buy this game. You won't regret it!","May 21, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have really enjoyed it this game and it was definitely worth the $1.24 I spent. This game got me into Poker (and then all my friends) and actually Sam/Max. The characters are humorous, and they each have a unique poker style and tells. I will say that some of the lines/conversations get played out quickly. I got one conversation b/w Claptrap and Ash 3 times in three hands. That said, thats by far the worst example, I just wish I could skip the banter that I've heard before. Also I have heard from others that if you like Evil Dead, the fact that Bruce Campbell didn't do Ash's voice is weird, but I wasn't a fan so I didn't think much of it.\n\nI recommend this game if you like these characters and want a poker sim.

I consider myself somewhat good at poker. I always seem to win against my friends and in other games. I have played probably around 20 rounds and have not won even once. Maybe I just suck but I have seen things in this game that I have never seen in real life poker. Some of the other opponents just get too lucky...\n\nAnother gripe is that the hands are obviously pre determined and not random at all. I have seen more than 4 of the same cards more than once. It kept happening with claptrap, we would both get 3 of a kind and tie with the same cards. There is no way that there can be 6 aces on the table because there are only 4 in a deck. That in itself is an obvious flaw and is what has made me quit playing this game.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game but I can however, reccomend the poker in Watchdogs.

Even at the title screen, references to the games and videos that the game's characters overflow here.  From the gorillas from Sam & Max to the bartender from Borderlands, there is always something around to tie the oddly matched characters together.  There is even is photo at the staircase showing the characters from the first game.  If you are willing to let your eyes roam, there is plenty to see.\n\nAnother visual detail about the game is the unlockables.  Just like the first game, you can earn unlockables that lets the player customize the look of the game.  Unlike the first game, those unlockables have an affect on the game.  By using an entire set, it causes both how the area looks as well as how the characters talk.  A prime example of this is watching your opponents leaving through the Venture Brothers' teleporter.  Knowing that each set has something special to see, this gives extra variety to what the characters could say and do.\n\nSpeaking of the talking, that is the real draw about the game.  As with most Telltale Games titles, the humor alone makes the game worth playing.  From moments like the robots dealing with paradoxes, Ash learning about his unknown fame, and Brock dealing with dubstep, listening to what they have to say will keep you coming back to more.\n\nThe one big problem about the first game is still present in this game.  That problem is the lack of variety in the gameplay.  Seeing that Texas Hold 'em is the most popular version of poker, it is understandable that they feature it in this game.  New to the mix is Omaha, a variant of Texas Hold 'em.  However, they still choose to ignore other popular variants of the game.  Games like Stud and the classic Draw are out of the mix.  Even within the Community games, there are more games like Razz available to play.  By only focusing on two similar versions of same game, the gameplay still feels limited.  Once you are used to the two games, it will leave you wanting more.  Having Blind Man's Bluff, something featured in Sam & Max Episode 103, would have been perfect for Telltale's style of humor.  If they are going to make a third game, they really need to add more types of games, not just slight changes of the same game.","January 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/234710/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","DISCLAIMER: Don't play this game for too long in one sitting or very often. It could really use some setting adjustments and extra features. If you don't love Poker too much, then don't bother with this game, obviously.\n\nFirst off, I like the game concept in the sense that it's Poker (Texas or Omaha) with the addition of some nice characters from TV and video games: Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands, Ash from Evil Dead, Sam & Max from... Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal. The game has an interesting personality with these characters because there's actually good dialogue and some very funny scenes that happen as you play. Hearing the characters bicker back and forth, or listening to GLaDOS giving sarcastic put-downs is hilarious.\n\nOn the other hand, the above is really the only thing "extra" to the game. Without it, it's just another Poker game, and the bonus characters wear off pretty quickly. It's not that the characters and their personalities bother me, but it's that there simply isn't enough dialogue for the game, and there aren't enough game setting to manage.\n\nI had only played the game for less than a couple of hours, completing a few matches/tournaments, and already started encountering a lot of the same dialogue, thus it became very boring very quickly. The sad part about that is there aren't any settings to manage that. You cannot skip dialogue unless it is before the whole match begins or you just folded and want to skip to the next hand. If you are in the middle of the game, you just have to sit and wait. Many times did I place my bet and had to wait nearly over a minute to make my next move, because the characters would talk a lot before the next person would fold or bet.\n\nA minute isn't a lot of time, but when it happens very often, it can take a lot just to finish one hand and can be very boring if you have heard all of the dialogue by that point. Similarly, you can't change any gameplay settings to limit the dialogue.\n\nOn top of the dialogue, you will encounter certain cutscenes sometimes in the middle of a match or when someone is eliminated or you win the game. You can't skip these either, thus they are just you sitting there for 3+ minutes at a time when you have seen them already as well.\n\nThe only thing to change the dialogue is to change the Unlockables to 3 items matching one of the characters (e.g., a Venture Bros theme for the room). Doing so adds extra dialogue while you have all 3 items activated, and the dialogue pertains mostly to the matching character and things involving the show or game world. While the new rooms are a nice touch, you still run out of dialogue quickly, and further the rooms actually add longer custcenes for elimination and winning, thus you have to sit and repeat things even more.\n\nAll in all, that really makes the game boring and take way more time after you've played a handful of rounds (per room). Being able to manage the dialogue occurrence and being able to skip it and the scenes would be a lot more useful if you're tired of seeing the same thing over and over.\n\nBecause of the above, the game therefore turns into a basic Poker game that is artificially extended by repetitive dialogue and scenes. No other real settings exist for the game, and the only extra addition to the game is the Bounties. The Bounties are essentially goals that you get and you must complete 3 of them in order to compete for a Bounty Item. Once you get to the Bounty Item, you must win the entire match (and eliminate everyone) in order to win the Bounty Item. Once you do, you simply unlock an item for Borderlands 2 and for Team Fortress 2.\n\nThe Bounties themselves are really a pain. They are randomly generated, and once you get them, you cannot change them. Depending on your luck, you may get really simple Bounties like "Order a drink" or "Come in 3rd place or better", which are relatively simple things to do. Otherwise, you will get the worst ones such as "Win with a flush or better" or "Win with a high card" which can take indefinitely to get, because none of those things are up to you. They are just up to luck. Having to win with a high card means pretty much everybody at the table has to get no special card matches and then you just have a King and everyone else has less, for instance. There's a few other ways to get it, but it's really less often than winning with a Pair, for instance.\n\nYou just have to play and play and play and play, eventually getting the Bounties. It is just a waste of time and pointless, since there really isn't any skill involved in those. Poker does require skill, but only in terms of generally winning, not winning with a specific pattern.\n\nAll in all, I don't mean to say that the game is terrible. The dialogue and scenes, when you first experience them, are absolutely hilarious and I loved it. But the game dies out pretty quickly, and it's a shame. They really should have added some extra features and especially configuration to the game.","December 29, 2014","false","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They are just up to luck. Having to win with a high card means pretty much everybody at the table has to get no special card matches and then you just have a King and everyone else has less, for instance. There's a few other ways to get it, but it's really less often than winning with a Pair, for instance.\n\nYou just have to play and play and play and play, eventually getting the Bounties. It is just a waste of time and pointless, since there really isn't any skill involved in those. Poker does require skill, but only in terms of generally winning, not winning with a specific pattern.\n\nAll in all, I don't mean to say that the game is terrible. The dialogue and scenes, when you first experience them, are absolutely hilarious and I loved it. But the game dies out pretty quickly, and it's a shame. They really should have added some extra features and especially configuration to the game.","December 29, 2014","false","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I roll through the hands just taking my best guess in hopes that chance is on my side but chance has no brain nor can it actually make things happen that won't. Listen to that logic children. Therefore, I usually lose a lot. Overall, I am pleased with the game and the dialog of the characters. After a while you do hear the same things over and over but I would rather have that then no conversation at all. The fact that it is humor kind of makes playing more pleasing. I would say it is worth a buy but maybe not if you are a hardcore poker player who wants a challenge. Afterall, it is a game as far as I am concerned to get a few laughs while playing some casual poker. There are bounties as well that can be unlocked to use in other telltale games so that is a perk as well which keeps you playing.

The characters dialogue is very entertaining, and goals and side objectives make Texas Hold'em even more fun.

I'll admit that I bought it for the unlockables and was slightly interested by the characters, but having played it I must say its selling point is the dialogue. It is very well done, with all of the conversations having little to do with what is going on in the hand but more about the games of the characters themselves.  I may have slight bias due to GLaDOS being the dealer (She would not be as funny playing poker, that's for sure) but I would recommend this game to anyone who knows any of the characters here, regardless of how much they like poker. (There is an easy way to win each hand if you suck like I do, just look in the community guides.)","May 24, 2014","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are able to interact with the environment a lot more this time around, from not only being able to customise your decks and tables, but the entire scenary of the hotel. The characters dialogue is very entertaining, and goals and side objectives make Texas Hold'em even more fun. My only gripe is that winning can be very easily exploited by restarting the game, which took away a lot of the high-risk experience that comes with Poker; and yes, you could easily NOT use this method, but knowing the option is there makes the risk feel cheapened.\n\nAt it's asking price, this game is a definate buy, in my oppinion.\n\nHope this was helpful. :)","December 24, 2014","true","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game certainly lives up to it's predecessor quite well. The graphics are smooth and appealing, though some textures are noticeably low-res (Ex: The revolving bit on Sam's revolver, claptrap's texture in general) though this may be my mistake, or possibly intentional, but anyhow the game is still beautifully done. The conversation is more naturally paced this time, though lipsyncing does seem a bit... off... for Ash and Brock (lol, sounds like I'm talking about pokemon. x3) but other than that the conversations are longer, more natural-sounding and less delay between characters. Speaking of characters, the lineup for this one is absolutely awesome! Though I've never heard of Venture Bros... probably gotta get outta the house more... but Brock is definetly quite the funny yet gritty character. As for Claptrap... well... he's... Claptrap. Ash is definetly one of the reasons I got the game, seeing a famous movie character in an actual GOOD video game nowadays is rare and exciting. As for Sam, he's generally nice and polite to all the other players, regardless of thier comments, and with Max standing by to comment, it just adds to the hilarity. Finally, having the soothing, mechanized voice of Ellen McLain (GLaDOS) as the dealer makes this promotional game one for the history books of gaming.

But I'm going to be honest here, the game is fun at first, but then the repeated lines they say whenever you do something is just plain irritating after you played even just three games. Also as I said, the game is fun at first, but then for some reason the game just loses the fun, and after you realize you have to complete another set of challenges just to have a shot at getting a hat...you just quit and think to yourself "sure I'll come back later and do those challenges" but that feel to play again just doesn't come back.\n\nOverall, Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it at first, but if you have the time to just try your hardest at completing a handful of challenges for some TF2 hats, then sure buy the game.

It's great if you know who these characters are, since you can see what a conversation between them would be like, but if you don't there's probably not much here for you. Many of the first game's trophies have been removed -- would you really want to earn those same ones twice? -- in favor of fewer based on milestones. The game itself is actually quite a bit harder, as I smoked the first but can barely dent these competitors, and it looks like they've added the necessity to learn and read their tells. Included are Texas Hold 'Em, where you get 2 cards and share from a pool of 5, and Omaha where there's a ton more cards all around.","May 19, 2013","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's quite slow, and you can't skip through hands particularly quickly without any auto-fold options. The blind structure is strange, and the other players play unconventionally to say the least.\n\nIt's a well-polished game, and the dialogue between the characters is entertaining. However, the cast and the dialogue are not up to the same standard as the previous game. The feel and aesthetic of the game is on point, and for anyone who doesn't play poker much at all, there's fun to be had. The inclusion of Omaha is nice, but unfortunately not enough to cover the fact that this is a pretty terrible poker game, and bar the inclusion of cross-game related unlocks and use as a poker learning tool, there isn't any reason to play this game.","December 27, 2013","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The computer clearly helps the AI by giving good cards to it in the river most of the time (I tested it just for the heck of it by going for the showdown all the time an at around 80% of the hands the AI won with bad cards by getting help in the river). Because of this Texas Hold'em is basically unplayable as it becomes a luck based guessing game with no strategy involved. Omaha is better so if you really want to see Sam & Max talking trash that game mode is the way to go. The AI itself is pretty bad, it makes stupid decisions while every character has a distinct playstyle that is easy to read. They never change their playstyles, they are always reacting the same way which makes the experience boring.\n\nAnd then there are the so called bounty challenges where completing 3 of them will unlock the chance to compete for one of the character bounties. Some of these challenges are nice and they require a bit of skill to pull off, others are purely luck based with a small percentage being outrageously luck based. This last category absolutely destroys the enjoyment of the game because if you get challenges like "win a hand with 2 opponents going all in "or "win with the higher kicker" your next move will be to just go and uninstall this mess instead of waiting for circumstances you have no chance of affecting occur. What's even worse is that you can't skip these challenges so if you get a bad 3 you're basically done for.\n\nAnyway the atmosphere is pretty cool, the unlockable decorations are nice and the characters are funny but everything gets old quickly. There's also no way to skip repeating jokes so you'll hear the same stuff all the time.\n\nBad, really bad game.","December 27, 2014","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(See what I did there? XD) There are guides on steam as well as the internet pointing out the signs which you can refer to and read to gain an idea of the other players' hands.\n3) IMO Omaha is easier to win as the hands are more predictable than Texas Hold 'Em.\n4) Have fun, if you don't win, try try again.\n\nAlso please note that the Ai in this game is fairly easy to win against so if you are on a winning streak against Brock Samson or Claptrap please do not carry it to your local casino and try to win big, most likely you would have to sell your living quarters, computer, body etc to pay off your losses, you have been warned.","October 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Wow! Amazing! I love Claptrap! He's so zany even though he repeats the same dialogue over and over with the same exact tells and resulting actions in the same poker sesh, even repeating himself consecutively! And all of the other characters do this too! I love your repeated naggings, GLaDOS. Please marry me! I read Girls for M and I have some good ideas on how to further highlight how pathetic I am for playing this game, which each and every character in this game rush out to make obvious, and make this all kinkier than it already is, like the repeated flirtations between Claptrap and GLaDOS.

This game is extremly fun to play, and knocking players from your favourite games (such as clap trap and Sam) of the table is very enjoyable!\n\nHowever, there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not, and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game (for tf2 and borderlans). In Poker Night 1, it was random and the players would put their items up, however, now you have to complete a set of challenges, then knock every player of the table in order to win the item. I find this fun and challenging, but i can see why people wouldn't like this change.\n\n(Would reccomend picking Poker Night 1 up as well!)","January 28, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
