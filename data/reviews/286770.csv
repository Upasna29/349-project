Recommended if you played and enjoyed any of the following games:\n\n-Red Faction\n-Red Faction II\n-Half-Life ('98)\n-Killzone ('04)\n-Halo CE\n-GoldenEye (N64)\n-Early Clancy Games (Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon)\n-Gen. 6 Bond Games (Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, etc)\n-Gen. 6 Medal of Honor Games (Frontline, Rising Sun, Allied Assault, European Assault, etc)\n-Early Call of Duty Games (Finest Hour, Big Red One, United Offensive, etc)\n-Old DOS Shooters\n\nWill probably appeal to my generation (I'm 30) more than today's gamer, because this game embodies the type of shooters that we grew up with and includes none of today's modern conveniences/handicaps: There's no automatic health regeneration, no automatic ammo refill, and , as far as I can tell, no quicksaving. Instead, you'll have to pick up health packs, scavange dropped ammo from enemies, and complete missions to save your game and progress. Some of the missions can be somewhat challenging, and you never know if there'll be a mob of enemies, a tank, or an RPG around the next corner. The story is okay (so far), and it's complete with decent voice acting and fully animated cutscenes in between each misison.\n\nKids, if you want to know the kind of game we frittered away hours with before Modern Warfare, then buy this game! Fellas, if you want a trip down memory lane, then you owe it to yourself to buy this game!","April 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","41","47","6","6"

Good gunplay, the ability to lean while aimed down the sights, good difficulty, cool story about nukes... it all plays like a really intense episode of 24.\n\nAnd the sound design: spectacular. Seriously, if you have a decent setup it will blow you away. Guns and explosions are deafening.\n\nThe million dollar question though, does it hold up after ten years? I sure as ♥♥♥♥ think so! I played a little bit of it and was worried that I might be looking through rose-tinted glasses, but I was proven wrong. This game is solid all the way around.\n\nDownsides:\n-Graphics, but c'mon, cut some slack.\n-The FMV cutscenes are potato quality, like a Youtube video on a Comcast connection. Still does the job story-wise though.\n-No real widescreen support out of the box. Check out this page for a fix: http://www.wsgf.org/dr/shadow-ops-red-mercury\n\nIn the end, for such a low price, you can't go wrong. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\n\n\n","July 2, 2014","true","0.8"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","40","51","3","0"

Feels like an early COD modern warfare. It has some grand set pieces and stylistic cut scenes with not bad graphics for the time, feels like an action movie. The story is similar to battlefrield 3, you basically have to stop a rogue agent with a nuke (red Mercury). gameplay wise the guns feel heavy and combat is fast paced and fun. this game uses med packs instead of regenerating health. Also there are no checkpoints! each mission is broken down into a few levels, some are short, some aren't and if you die you restart the level. for the dirt cheap price it's worth a playthrough if you're a FPS fan.","August 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The game is about you, Captain Frank Hayden and your squad of Delta force elites to stop terrorists from getting their hands on WMD's. The graphics aren't the greatest but keep in mind this was for the Xbox one (old one not the new one) and we know what great games came from that console. The Campaing lets you battle the terrorist groups from the dusty streets of the Middle east, to the wet and compact jungles of the Congo. It reminds me of half life a little bit because every part of a level you beat makes you download another part of it. The weapons of the game are very unique because some of the weapons in the game you don't see in many modern shooters today. The beginning level of the campaing reminds me of the ending of COD4 a little bit. Multiplayer is amazing supporting up to 32 players. Overall this is a hidden gem of xbox games. I really hope that a company can make this again but add more campaing levels, update the graphics, and add some physics. 9/10","July 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/286770/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBH8tJxq2g\n\nhttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Shadow_Ops:_Red_Mercury - check here for fixing the FOV and to run the game on widscreen monitor\n\nWhen the gaming world was still on a WW2 wave, one developer saw opportunity to take the action in modern days and Shadow Ops: Red Mercury was born. Well, this is what I think happen.\n\nFirst I want to move out the obvious – graphics. They are bad. There isn't enough video options, but those that are present can't make the game look good. It doesn't matter if you set them on the highest available setting, it's still not a great looker. And the pop in is so obvious at some levels, it's so annoying. This maybe because it's a console port.\n\nIn the audio section you can find 4 different sliders. Music, effects, dialogs and voices. For some reason music is off by default, so crank that music to the max, because it's awesome. Also you can rebind keys and customize the HUD, which is a nice surprise.\n\nYou are Frank Hayden, an elite Delta Force operative, who is tasked sometimes with his team, sometimes alone, to recover a briefcase nuclear bomb from Vladimir Styanovich a.k.a. Vlady the Vicious, a terrorist mercenery. You will travel around the globe trying to stop him. The story is cheesy, cliché and you can see the twist from a long distance. But the action, music and great variety of places you visit are what can keep you interested.\n\nShadow Ops: Red Mercury is military FPS. It was made in 2003, before COD: MW. The game is not realistic, it have arcade feel, but make no mistake, this is not Quake. If you try to run and gun, death will come quickly. This game is tough, but fair to a certain degree. This is because of the AI. It is highly accurate. Sometimes enemies are cheaply placed and this annoyed me a lot. There is not enough time to react. You can take quite a few shots (even a rocket), but they may come so quickly and before you know it, you're dead. Because of the AI, there are a lot of tense firefights in and outdoor. You, as one man army will have to kill waves of enemies and it feels so good, when you beat a level, you overcome the odds. The game grabs you for the neck right from the first level. You are pin down by enemies and you have to get out of there fast. There is two more things that will keep the tension. The health is not regenerating, you have to find med packs and ammo is running fast. Enemies can sometimes drop both of them and they also can be found around the levels, but still you have to be careful and accurate in your shots. Some maybe frustraded by that and I was at some point. I had low health, ammo and only a pistol, but I manage to get through this and it was great feeling. Some of the frustration comes from the lack of checkpoints. The levels are not long, but combine with the all things I mentioned above, thing can get annoying. In the end who will pull the trigger first is what matters.\n\nWhat was suprising to me is the AI of your fellow soldiers. When you are on a mission with them, they can actually kill enemies. But don't expect them to make more kills than you.\n\nWeapons are pretty standard – pisols, sniper rifles, uzi, shotgun, machine gun, granade launcher and so on. They all have recoil and feel good. They kick, so shooting in short burst is recommended . Headshots, of course, are most effective.\n\nLevel design is nice. You will visit the jungles in Congo full with shacks and wooden watchtowers, hightech facility in Kazakhstan, streets in ruins in Syria, harbor in Chechnya, ride a train and so on. They are really diverce, but there is nothing suprising. This is not a open world, it's a corridor shooter, but still be on a lookout for hidden ammo or health packs. Sometimes it will the difference between restarting the level and beating it.\n\nWhat keeps everything together is the soundtrack. It is phenomenal!!! It contribute for the atmosphere a lot. All levels have different theme and fits incredibly well with the pacing and the action on screen. In a snowy level, where is advise to use stealth, the music is calm, but if enemy see you, right at that moment the music picks up seamlessly and so on.\n\nAs a whole the sound design is nicely done. Effects are okay. Every gun sound what it supose to, explosion are bombastic, but granades are weak. The voice acting on the other hand is hit and miss. Hayden have gruff voice. It overdone, but it's still pleasant for the ears. But Vladimir Styanovich, if you can hear him, it's just bad. Other voice actor are just okay. They are doing their best with the cheesy writting\n\nI have two more small problems with the game. The cutscene are rendered with the engine, but why they look worse than the in-game graphics is a mystery to me. The other is you can't use aim and move and this makes you easy target. It took me awhile to get use to it.\n\nThe game feels like it was inspired from of  90's summer blockbuster movies – tons of action, one man army, tense moments, the main character do imposible things and gets the girl in the end, even the cinematography of the cutscene (they are great) scream 90's. And don't think of the plot too much. If you do, you will find a tons of plot holes. The game is janky, rough around the edges, but the great firefights, amazing sountdrack, nice variety of levels and tension are worth overlooking the pop in, dated graphics, cheaply placed enemies, no checkpoints and the cliché story, although the plot in my opinion is working in favor of the game. And I think the price I right. The campaign will take you b 6-7 hours to beat it. The multyplayer is dead, so keep that in mind. The game have one small, but unique feature – except throwing granades, you can roll them. Despite the flaws, I recommend it.","December 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The teammate didnt even react.\n\nThe obvious, the game is old, and the enemy bahaviour patterns are outdated, enemies just run to their waypoints and fire on you, i've played on "Ranger" and enemies tend to have lightning reflexes and Pixel perfect aim combined with X-Ray vision.\nin open firefights this is less of a problem but becomes very appearent in the "house combat" sections. This combined with unfair enemy placement  causes a lot of unpreventable damage.\nan example: you walk up stairs, a window 2 meters in front of you pops open and a guy starts firing at you, there is no cover or way to move to the side, so you have to take hits before you can kill him. Even though you start forseeing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy placements you still take hits due to aforementioned lightning reflexes and aim of the enemies.\nThis poor leveldesign and enemy placement ultimately made me quit this game, since it seems to be designed in a way to be as frustrating as possible\n\nConclusion:\nif you can get over the leveldesign and AI that seems to be dedicated to be as annoying and frustrating as posssible, you will probably find some enjoyment in this game\n","November 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I remembered enjoying the demo when it came on an Xbox Magazine Demo Disc long ago, and was quite surprised to see it on Steam. After all these years, it's still got a thing or two going for it. It's the Michael Bay-esque military shooter of the early 2000's you probably haven't played.\n\nIt doesn't do anything particularly spectacularly, but it does MOST things well enough. If you're looking for a simple fast-paced run-and-gun to feel like a hero and kill a few hours, where your reflexes are tested more than your mind, you could do a whole lot worse. I'd definitely wait for a sale though, as you could do better for the current asking price of $7.00. Overall I had a great time until the later missions of the game, where enemy placement seems rushed and cheap.\n\n\nDetailed Review:\nI Liked it Because:Your standard sidearm is a massively oversized Desert Eagle...Yes, it's as awesome as it sounds. :)\n\nBefore the Modern Warfare games standardized the entire genre, Shadow Ops borrowed heavily from games like Halo to make a cinematic console shooter.\n\nHeavy attention is paid to making the game feel like a film, and this is apparent right from the start of the first mission, which has your Blackhawk crashing into a desert town, surrounded by foes on all sides. The soundtrack, sounding like it was heavily influenced by Hans Zimmer, accents moments like these perfectly. It really lends a heroic feel to the whole experience when the main theme kicks in at climactic moments.\n\nBeing an Xbox game originally, I didn't quite know how well it'd port to PC controls. Fortunately, they're just fine. Controls do what they should, there's no forced mouse acceleration, and your character has that lighter, more arcade-like feel, as opposed to the weighty, more massy dynamics of modern shooters.\n\nThe shooting feels like it should, and the game keeps it simple by assigning your weapons at the start of each mission. Rather than picking up weapons from fallen foes, you simply resupply ammunition for whatever your given loadout happens to be. Some may be put-off by this, but I didn't mind it so much, as the game usually gives you at least one all-around gun that can do everything, in many cases, the standard M4.\n\nSpeaking of simplicity, as expected, the game is 100% linear. Move from building, to corridor, to courtyard, blast all the enemies you just spawned, until you reach the end of each level. Standard formula. I didn't mind it.\n\nAlso, being released before the every-game-hero-is-Wolverine trend, you actually have health and must pick up medkits to stay alive. Sometimes this works, sometimes it's a chore to backtrack, or annoying to waste an entire medkit by walking too close when you're at 80-something HP. But for those who are tired of panting dramatically to dislodge bullets from your body, you might find this refreshing.\n\nBefore the innovations of cover-based shooters, this game contained leaning! And it's not half bad! Can be a little troublesome to get used to, but it works well enough to give you an advantage against your hitscanning foes.\nWhat Could Be Better:As mentioned above, the game came out for the original Xbox. Not the 360, but its enormous rectangular predecessor with the big green gem. That being said, even for its time, the textures can look ruddy and dated, and the video cutscenes are garbled and budget-looking.\n\nThe story is standard fare for the time. Bad guy has a nuke, we're chasing the bad guy to stop him from nuking what he wants to nuke. There's betrayal, intrigue, some backstory for motivation, but it's nothing too special, and rather predictable.\n\nGrenades (in games) are supposed to be fun. They aren't in Red Mercury. While they still have their uses, they plop like rocks, so don't expect to be tricking them around corners.\nWhat Was Awful:\nEnemy AI. Not expecting anything revolutionary here for the budget, but placing stupid enemies in lame locations is 90% of the challenge here. The game will spawn enemies in the CHEAPEST possible places. It eventually gets predictable and infuriating, where no amount of skill will keep you from taking a few shots from cheaply placed enemies.\n\nExpect foes to pop around corners or from behind impenetrable doors, fingers on the trigger, hitscanning the crap out of you. The worst part is, it starts to feel like the game expects you to do the same. It actually becomes a valid strategy to hold down the trigger when rounding corners, in the hopes that you'll only get hit with one or two bullets instead of 20.\n\nMonster closets will also spawn enemies via triggers, to the point where it gets cheesy and predictable to get the game to just spawn dudes from behind a dumpster, who are, naturally, already firing at you with excellent accuracy. (Hopefully you're already shooting the empty air where they're GOING to be to stand a chance!)\n\nThe long-range late-game mission atop the the Eiffel Tower is the pinnacle of this, where tactical ninjas will spawn from areas you already cleared, and snipe at you from ridiculous distances. Again, infuriating and obviously placed to wear the player down without much thought.\n\nIf you can get it on sale, it's not a bad game.

You play as Frank Hayden, a Delta Force Captain and all-round generic bad ♥♥♥ who has to stop the bad guys from detonating some super nuke which is 20x as powerful than a normal one or something like that.\n\nI'll start with the positive. Yes, there is only one. The guns sound pretty good. The assault rifles feel meaty. It's a shame that every other weapon in the game serves little to no purpose. Shotguns are patheticly weak and everyone drops like a fly. The M249 has way too much recoil and shakes the screen way too much. RPGs, Sniper Rifles and pistols may see limited use but you'll struggle to run out of ammo.\n\nFor an Unreal 2 engine game this mofo is ugly. It's a console port and it's obivous. From the 'press the action key' promts to the limited controls to the lack of quick saves. Then again, I don't really care for graphics that much, but I felt it was worth mentioning.\n\nSome reviews on steam mention this game is hard. B U L L ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I N G S H I T. This game is easy, even on the hardest difficulty. The enemies have no intelligence at all. They'll run into their buddy's grenade, they'll form a line for you to shoot them. Add to the fact they die in 1-3 bullets and this game is a cake walk. Even with cheap enemy placement the enemy is pretty easy to defeat. The game play consists of two things. Shoot bad guys and plant SLAM charges to destroy something to pad out the game. It gets old, fast. Thankfully this game is mercifully short.\n\nPickups are placed terribly. Most health kits are hidden in corners in a cheap attempt to amp up the difficulty. During the only boss fight you need to use an RPG and guess what? They hide the spare ammo a floor below you in a dark shadowed area. Gee, thanks guys...\n\nStory is boring. Nukes, Delta Team Six Black Ops stuff, Half ♥♥♥♥♥ love intrest, betrayals and terrible dialog. My favourite line went like this:\n\nFrank: Okay, I'm gonna save the world and shoot some more Russians/Arabs/Brown people/Aliens/Feminists/Nazis/♥♥♥♥♥♥ for freedom.\n\nLove interest: Be careful\n\nCIA Agent: (as serious as possible) "Just stick to the mission and then you can stick it where you want."\n\nThen again, I got it for a $1 on sale, and for that amount, it's okay I guess.\n\nThe mid 2000's produced some fantastic shooters, Half Life 2, SWAT 4, FEAR, Far Cry, XIII, Unreal Tournament 2004 etc. Shadow Ops: Mercury Rising does not hold a candle to this game.\n","July 28, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Back then, it seemed like the most amazing thing ever. Any game that was gritty and realistic had to be amazing, right?\n\nNo. Today, this game is absolutely laughable.\n\nYour teammates have some of the worst AI that I've ever seen. The most entertaining thing I saw in this game was watching Sgt. Gnucci charge up to an enemy, stop two feet away from him and start meleeing the air above the enemy's head all while being constantly shot. This lasted for about a minute until Gnucci retreated and let me kill the enemy.\n\nThis isn't to say that the enemy AI is any better; they constantly shift between having superhuman perception and instantly killing you without you ever knowing where they are and being completely blind and letting you kill them without ever reacting to your presence at all.\n\nThe environments are dull, the music is boring, but the voice acting is okay. That's the only positive thing I can say about this game: it has okay voice acting. That's not enough for an FPS to even be considered passable.\n\nOne can look at this and say, "It's an old game. It just hasn't aged well." That's a valid argument, but I'd like to point out that this game came out the same year as Halo 2, and that game holds up pretty well. It's at the other end of the decade-old FPS spectrum.\n\nIn summary, I'd rather hang out with Sgt. Johnson and kick some ♥♥♥ than watch Sgt. Gnucci get his ♥♥♥ kicked.","August 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I was looking for the Sprint button when I loaded up the game and 3 different buttons including shift were "Hit" with the butt of your weapon.\n\nReminds me of the campaign they tried to throw into Counter Strike Condition Zero. That was awful too. Like Counter strike there is no aim down Sights only scope and hip fire with a crosshair but this isn't a MP game like cs its a single player game.\n\nThis released in 2004 and looks much worse than CS source features no multiplayer and the gameplay resembles Manhunter more than anything a game I enjoyed and finished but purchased for only 74 cents on sale and it was obviously a low budget indie title. I would reccomend Manhunter over this game for a short single player fps experience but Manhunter has more technical issues. I paid  less for it though than I did for this game and Manhunter at least has Sprint.\n\nThe one good thing I can say about this game is that it started up and worked immediately without fiddling around and thats uncommon for old games.","August 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Except obviously, you got ambushed this way and that, enemies everywhere, and the enemy's about to get away... and... jump to couple weeks ago, when the whole mess got started.\n\nThe missions basically mostly have you running around, alone, though occasionally you'll see your teammates shooting at the rest of the enemies, but mostly it's you, everything from taking out AAA to holding back a wave of enemies with a HMG to go through sniper alley, and so on and so forth. Those who play COD / COD MW will see a lot of similarities between this and their game.\n\nThe game is a first-person shooter, though it has rudimentary cover shooting where you can lean around certain covers. How you do it through is a bit dodgy as it involves holding space while pressing left or right. There is no auto-heal. You are constantly on the lookout for first-aid kits and ammo. And enemies can pop up anywhere, even from behind you, as you are constantly looking for enemies around a blind corner and such. Fortunately, there is no "door breach" scenarios (i.e. Matrix-style shoot enemies in the head sequence)\n\nThis game is old and the poly count of the models aren't that high, even at max everything settings. But the models aren't *that* bad. Sound is actually quite good, as are the music.\n\nThe problem is there are just too many "tired tropes" in the game. There are so many betrayals, and the bad guy always get away... or does he? And then there's the question just how many bad guys are there that there's not enough good guys to deal with them (well, all except you). And enemies that pop up behind you, around corners, and so on? BORING! Add some cliche like "bad Russians", "one-armed merc", "I leave no witnesses", "he's getting away!", "take out that tank", etc. and it's getting a bit tiresome.\n\nAll in all, if you want to play a good shooter, play a modern one.","September 13, 2014","false","4.5"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","5","24","0","2"

While that's also fairly effective, the best way to proceed through a level without taking is to check around corners, use cover, and use the environment to your advantage.  As there is no checkpoint system and you are forced to restart the entire chapter if killed, this forces you to at least be somewhat mindful of your surroundings.\n\nTeammates are fairly competent at taking out enemies, although they do have issues with spotting them occasionally.  Enemy AI can be compared to the Call of Duty series: they spawn in, rush into cover, then periodically pop out and fire a few rounds in your general direction.  Thankfully, each individual enemy is hard enough that you'll only be up against a couple at a time, since a few well placed shots can potentially take a quarter of your health away in the blink of an eye.\n\nGuns are fairly responsive and the aiming system makes it easy to scope in around a corner without having to move your hands off of the movement keys and scout out an alleyway.

While you can still get shot at when leaning your head out, this gives you a much better chance of assessing the situation without exposing too much of your vital organs.\n\nAll in all, a fairly decent shooter at its core if one can look past the outdated graphics and lack of proper widescreen support.","December 6, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before you even boot up the first mission, go watch the "making of" videos in the main menu where the developers are ridiculously hyping up (by early 2000s standards) their "realistic" military shooter. Watch them and take them to heart, and then play this game.\n\nYou're welcome.","January 8","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is a dumb blockbuster plot that is pretty simple. Gameplay is pretty simple: Move, shoot and plant SLAMS.\n\nAlso I should note this game runs butter smooth on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ desktop, at a steady 60+fps. There isn't widescreen support but I think you can edit the .ini or some ♥♥♥♥.","April 27","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatehudson/recommended/286770/","privatehudson","PvtHudson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatehudson/","1409 products in account","I still own my original Xbox copy of this game. I didn't like it when I played it back in the day and I sure as hell don't like it now. The PC version is better than the Xbox one in every shape and form however the Xbox one has 10 levels designed for split-screen co-op.\n\nShadow Ops is a cheesy generic linear modern first person shooter where you play as a generic American voiced by Steve Blum who travels around the world fighting terrorists. The level design consists of nothing more than walking down a set path with scripted ambushes thrown everywhere. Turn a corner? There's 5 enemies there in cover waiting for you. Open an elevator door? 3 enemies there in cover waiting for you. All the enemies have perfect accuracy and there's no mid-mission saves. This type of cheap enemy placement results in damage that is unpreventable.\n\nDying has you restart the game all over again. Shadow Ops is a game of memorization. Memorize the placements of cheap scripted enemy ambushes and you win the game. If I wanted to play a game of memorization, I'd play Contra.\n\nAlso, since this was designed for console first, the game lacks sprint, blood, and all the FMVs are low-res and compressed.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVTfdyzOI3M","May 20","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
