Metal Slug is awesome. Yes, yes it is. This port of it however, is not.\n\nWhat you get is a minimum effort emulation of one of the greatest arcade games of all time. Wether or not you enjoy this release depends on how much you care for flawless emulation - as someone who owns a MVS with a couple of Metal Slugs and tried some other alternatives to get NeoGeo running on something that is not a NeoGeo I don't think Dot Emu did a good job so far. In it's current state it is definitely not for the Metal Slug-aficionado.\n\nThe emulation doesn't provide enough options to tailor the visual output on screen to your liking. You get a set of resolution options but none of them allow the display of the game in a letterboxed format - resulting in every other row of pixels getting stretched. Which looks just terrible, especially considering that Metal Slug 3 is a pixelart masterpiece and the lack of not caring from the Developer for preserving it's beauty for newer generations of players pains me greatly.\n\nThere are ways to force the game into "correct" resolutions depending on your screen-size, but you have to fiddle with gamefiles and edit these in order to fix something that should be there from the start. Same goes for the "visual enhancements" - which in their current state are pretty much crap, a super-blur and a scanlines effect that doesn't adjust to your resolution. Again, somebody from the fanbase fixed that - with a bunch of files you can replace, yet again these options should have been there from the start or somebody should have put some thought into implenting them. Also, for whatever reason running the game fullscreen results in a lot of weird issues and glitches - one of my mates controllers doesn't properly respond in fullscreen and we are both having some serious stutter and framerate issues (issues that aren't on the original hardware, mind you - we know the game has some serious slowdown at times) - it's like it is running out of sync or skipping a beat and then suddenly gets it right again. Switching to windowed mode fixes a lot of these issues, but seeing my desktop in the background just feels wrong on so many levels. Also, the forums are full of people having issues with mini-freezes and inconsistent framerates - which is all the more weird since NeoGeo emulation has been around for a while now and stuff like that shouldn't happen nowadays, not when mobile phones are easily more powerful than the actual arcade cabinet this game originally ran on.\n\nSomething else that bothers me is the constantly desyncing music that plays too fast at times and sounds weird in the process. The same applies to some soundeffects (most notably the GO! and Continue-counting noises are just wrong). From what I read this has been known since the beta - and again nobody cared.\n\nFinally, the one sole reason to get this, online-coop, is another minimum-effort job. You get to play people from your friendlist - that's it. No lobbies, no matchmaking, no indication how good or bad the connection is. They didn't even bother to code a proper "invite" screen, basically it is a Steam pop-up that you have to control with a mouse (which might be different in Big Picture mode, but I didn't try that out). Online is better than Kaillera stuff - but it introduces a lot of problems that could make this game unplayable if you are used to the offline-experience - rubberbanding, massive slowdowns (again, not the kind the original machine has) and frame skipping being the biggest ones we encountered. It kinda gets the job done, and is probably better than no online-coop - but it is not a convincing effort.\n\nAnd for all you arcade-operators out there, you have NO control over the dipswitch settings. A couple of options are available under settings, but you cannot change the number of lives per credit or the number of continues you start with, and just you forget about freeplay right away - all of these settings are "hardcoded" into the bios-file that comes with the game ROMs. Also missing is the attract mode / opening of the game - which is a damn shame and no NeoGeo bootup screen either.\n\nYou simply might not care for all of this, the game itself kind of works anyway and that might be enough.\n\nEmulation-issues aside the game is great on its own, but not my favourite in the series (I personally favour X and the original Metal Slug over Metal Slug 3). I am not too fond of the shmup-segment towards the end and feel that especially the final mission could have been split into two parts. It is just not as "on point" as the prequels were. Also, while the spritework is fantastic, I feel that the backgrounds in 3 are less detailed and exciting than in X or the original. I particularly miss the spectacular destruction of big parts of the level, like the residential blocks in the occupied town of the original. They kind of overdid it with the various Slugs as well, I liked it better when there were less "Super Vehicles 00X" - however, all of this is highly subjective and there is really no alternative on Steam to the greatness that is original, classic, japanese arcade run & gunning (if you are thinking of the ♥♥♥♥-poor Intrusion 2 right now, you are wrong!). Which is all the more reason I will not recommend this lackluster port in it's current state - but will happily change that once a few updates fixed at least the emulation issues.\n\nMetal Slug deserves more care and a lot more love from the devs!","February 16, 2014","false","6.9"," 856 of 1,057 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","856","1","0","46"

A day one purchase for all NEO-GEO fans.\n\nI made a gameplay video of the first stage:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221771135\n\nI'll write a better review when the game gets released, but it's looking pretty good. It's better than on GGPO/Supercade when it works. It still has some desync issues, but we'll see if they get fixed. The game has support for 16:9 resolutions and some filters available.\n\nIt's pretty much a 1:1 port of the arcade game. It also has a mission mode, which lets you start from any level you have unlocked. Some people might not like the fact that your credits are limited (as in no infinite continues), but you can always go to mission mode and start from the final stage, if you are struggling to beat the game. EDIT: Apparently the amount of credits will be increased during the beta.\n\nIt's a perfect arcade port, but also a good game to play in CO-OP (local or online).","January 27, 2014","true","23.9"," 868 of 1,083 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","868","1","0","45"

Sure you're a hard nosed warrior with a gun trekking through hostile territory, but you're facing not only well animated soldiers, helicopters and tanks, but giant crabs, yeti, gruesome zombies and squid aliens. In today's video game landscape, zombies and aliens sound mundane like its almost expected now, but with Metal Slug 3's fantastic graphics and animation, these enemies have a style that stands out from the pack. These zombies don't just swarm you, they vomit on you and turn you into a zombie and die. These aren't just aliens, they're squid aliens with lasers and retro 1950s robot that you can turn into junk piles. Its a great level of detail that gives the game its overwhelming charm and enjoyment. You can even bring a friend with two player simultaneous online coop. You can even look for matches, but well, there weren't any when I looked.\n\nYou've heard of NES hard, well then there's arcade hard. You get three lives one hit means death. This version of Metal Slug 3 makes it easier with unlimited continues. You can select the amount of continues in the settings. Each continue doesn't restart a level though, it only drops you back into the game. Every time you use your final life, a heavy machine gun icon drops to give you more incentive to pump in another quarter to even the odds against the enemies.\n\nThe controls are simple, you've got a jump, attack (shoot) and bomb throw buttons. You can't just hold the attack button for rapid fire oh no, where's the challenge in that? You need to keep pressing. Even with heavy machine guns and larger rapid fire weapons, one button press might release a lot of bullets, but those bullets end unless you hit the button again. If you're close enough to something you'll melee it instead of shooting. Its a nice level of detail to see. The sad part is that you seem to shoot in only four directions. I suppose I'm just used to Contra where you have 8 way shooting. Machine guns can still manage to shoot 8 ways, but only if you're transitioning from left to up.\n\nYou start by selecting from one of four characters. These four characters feel important by the end of the game, or at least one does anyway. All  which play exactly the same. The real challenge is that the characters just aren't nimble. You're there to shoot things dead, not dodge projectiles. You can still crouch and jump, but you can easily get overwhelmed. Metal Slug 3 doesn't just let you ignore enemies, it will lock the screen in place until you take them out. They begin with a standard pea shooter pistol so its necessary to find bigger weapons and quick!\n\nThere are new weapons all over the place, and you get them by saving prisoners of war. When a bullet hits them, they're released and pace around. You're just so good that you manage to break them from their bondage without killing them. When you touch them, they reward you with extra bombs, points or weapons.\n\nAs for the weapons, you've got homing crush missiles, a shotgun so powerful that it can literally rip an asteroid in half, a heavy machine gun, some sort of bouncing projectile ball bearing gun and rockets to name a few. The arcade announcer will always tell you what you get and he specifically says rocket launcher with a deliberate accent, rocket lowncha. These great weapons have limited ammunition, but you can always find more. There is even a flame thrower that won't just kill enemies, its engulfs them in flames. These caveman POWs are everywhere. You have a limited supply of 10 grenades that you throw. I always end up forgetting about them. You can even find monkeys with guns to help you and satellites or storm clouds to rain death on your enemies.\n\nThere are vehicles you can hop into, but for a loss of shooting accuracy, the vehicles can take a lot more damage than you can. If the vehicle's health gets low, you can jump out or eject to keep from dying when the machine explodes. By loss of shooting accuracy I mean the turrets seem to rotate around. Like if you're shooting right, then you move left, the turret will be angled diagonally right. The more you move less, the more the turret rotates. Its not like that with all vehicles, just most. The vehicles are a nice touch, I just feel like I'm better without them for the most part. Oh and its not just vehicles, its elephants and camels that you can mount.\n\nIts not just side scrolling run and gun action though, certain segments of the game turn into top down vertical shoot'em ups and side scrolling shoot'em ups. It all fits the game. You'll hop in a jet and fly to the right, if the jet explodes, you'll come in on a jet pack. It always makes me laugh when I've forgotten about it. One stage has a swimming level that is just a side scrolling shoot'em up under water. Its the same for the top down shoot'em up as well.\n\nThe animation and detail hit a whole new level with the Metal Slug series. You'll see a boat take visible damage and begin to sink. Soldiers will come out and start bailing the water with buckets only to have you shoot them. It explodes and sinks.\n\nThe enemies have a lot of flavor to them all with detailed animations. Soldiers won't just run up to kill you, they'll shoot, reload their guns, hit you with the butt of their rifle, crouch, prawn, get scared and run away. Its an amazing level of detail that makes the game fun and memorable. There are giant crabs that shoot bubbles at you. Plants that will chase and devour you if you get close enough. That's why the game lets you get fat, so you can't get swallowed! Even as a morbidly obese soldier, you can jump, and fire fat bullets and throw fat bombs. Yeti will freeze you into snowmen where you need to wiggle and jump to break free before they bash you with a bone hammer. Zombies will smash their own heads to have brain matter fly all over you. Its not just one type of zombie, there are several detailed zombies all with their own attacks.\n\nWhen you become a zombie, you'll move slow and have a drunken walk with a shallow jump. Instead of a grenade, you have a powerful almost screen clearing blood vomit. If you're a zombie and you get hit, you're still dead. For real this time and not just undead. Its all building up to something at the end of the game.\n\nIts not all silliness, there are tanks, helicopters, deadly insects and several other forms of death in the game. The bosses are all giant and diverse. Everything from a super mega crab with guns, to aliens that circle around firing, before they start dropping monoliths from the sky to fighting giant hovering things that shoot white ghost wolves and belch purple energy! Its a lot of creativity and fun, all while sticking within the realm of the game's logic. Like after fighting soldiers, aliens and zombies, you won't suddenly fight a pink cow for the laughs.\n\nThese soldiers, aliens and zombies all tie in together brilliantly later on in the game. Metal Slug 3 doesn't bore you with stories or cut scenes, you see everything unfold for yourself all in game. In fact, I'd say its one of the best stories for a run and gun I've ever seen and I hate story in games!\n\nEven after you complete the game, you realize that there are different paths! So there's incentive for when you go back and play through it! It all so nice, brilliant, fun and detailed. The game's leader boards also help to keep you playing. There are even four levels of difficulty if the game is too baby for you. I still think its a lot tougher than Contra ever was, but this game was meant to eat your quarters.\n\nI've got this game for several platforms, even for Android and X-Box. This feels like the best version for all its settings and great frills. There are several different settings, resolutions and even a gallery full of incredibly detailed if not horrific artwork. Well worth going out of my way to find them all.","March 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","50","54","3","0"

There are some slight sound anomolys with the emulation, but quite frankly it's as close as you're gonna get with the true METAL SLUG experience on Steam.\n\nAs for the game itself, 3 is known to be the best (and the hardest) of the series. And after 14 years, this still holds true. Saying that, once you learn the patterns of the enemies and bosses, and know the best routes to take and where the weapons and vehicles drop, you'll be mastering the game soon enough.\n\nOnline play seems to be pretty solid, provided you and your partner have good connections to each other.\n\nOverall, I would say; Yes, buy this game if you're a fan of the series. If you're looking for a better emulation version, though, see if you can pick up the Metal Slug Anthology for the PS2 or Wii, which has the games 1-6 and is a really stable port.\n\nThis version is still perfectly playable despite the slight emulation annoyances.","October 3, 2014","true","7.2"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","1"

Its levels and missions are much harder and much more challenging than the other Metal Slug games\n\nI Remember my self back long years ago on the arcade i used to play that game and i beat it almost with  2 coins and wow people actually still staring at me and at the game and they actually told me that if im out of money they could give me more coins just to complete the game for them....they was watching my adventure from the start and they just cant go away or get enough of Metal Slug 3 i really used to know that game very well from my heart and i love it so much, even the soundtrack in the game makes me wanna keep going. now enough about me.\n\nNow about the game, well... The game hearkens back to the days of the original Duke Nukem, Contra, or any of the other great twitch-shooters of the past. It's essentially a mindless shooting game, done in retro side-scrolling style, but as that goes, it's a lot of fun. You basically travel through levels, killing anything and everything, grabbing powerups as you go and trying to survive the constant onslaught of enemies the game throws at you. For a retro-style shooter, it's a reasonable challenge, as enemies sometimes overwhelm you with their sheer numbers. The bosses are fairly tough.\n\nPeople feel it is a bit pricey for an arcade game. But that is without considering the immense quality and fun of this platform/shooting game. You will quickly forget the price as soon as you start playing this game ! It is a packed with action, fun and great design !

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/250180/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Metal Slug 3 is one of the most highly regarded entries in a classic franchise that, along with Contra, has pretty much defined the "run and gun" sub-genre of action platformers and shmups.\n\nThe Metal Slug series has an emphasis on enemies crowding around (collision damage can't kill you), conservation of power ups, and a variety of vehicles which appear throughout the game and change the way you move and fight for a limited time.\n\nAs for MS3 itself, it's similar to Contra 3 in that it stands on a  middle-ground between early platforming heavy run and gun shooters and the "boss fest" design of later games like Contra Hard Corps and Alien Soldier. The game is constantly switching up how you progress through stages, so it's quite varied. There are also multiple paths through each stage, each of which plays differently.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is also legendary for its difficulty to 1 credit clear, which is vastly greater than most other shmups and arcade shooters. It's not that it has anymore cheap deaths or memorization than any other shooter, it's just that it's very random (often forcing you to react very quickly), very long, very punishing for even the slightest mistake, and requires fairly high execution. This is all if you're going for a 1cc however. The game is still quite fun if played with more than one credit, so a 1cc should really be regarded as the ultimate challenge to be tackled if you feel brave enough.\n\nAs for the port quality, it's decent. I haven't played the game on GGPO or Supercade enough so I can't quite compare the netcode for co op to those, but it's generally decent, though I've occasionally seen lag spikes that can get both you and your partner killed if you don't pause and wait them out. Similarly, there's occasionally some strange frame rate hiccups during single player, but these are much more rare.\n\nAll in all I'd say definitely buy it if you don't already own it on some other collection. If you've already been playing it on MAME or whatever, now you can have a nice official copy and don't have to worry about pirating an excellent game. If you haven't played it already, definitely go for it 'cause it's a classic.","February 16, 2014","true","39.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","4"

Therefore, this review is no longer valid. However, I experienced some very odd resolution problems causing the game to move off screen and be unplayable still (in that instance). Otherwise, I can say that this game is a decent-to-great port as of current. It's still a steep price for the game I believe.\n\nNew Obligatory Score: 8/10\n\nI recommend this game on the premise that it is playable. I've been a fan of Metal Slug for a while; I've played the first, second, and a cheap knockoff port on my GameBoy Advance (and MS3 in this food court once with an arcade room a decade ago). This Metal Slug 3 game is a port from who knows where (arcade?) that is original but also very disappointing to play. Everyone talks about its poopy resolution, which is true, its constant crashing, which is true, and its un-unpausable menu, which is also true. The resolution never works unless you want to play in the 4:3 standard format otherwise it is just stretched out. MS3 crashed often and required multiple reboots of the game to get working again (hint: don't join a friend's game via Steam chat's "Join Game" function. Works best if you invite someone. lol). The un-unpausable menu is just stupid; why can't I start back into the game in coop? Looks like another reboot.\n\nCoop is decent at the very least. I assume it has split screen of some sort because it allows 2 sets of controls in the options. No online-support to play with randoms.\n\nIf you're looking for that ol' nostalgia feel, then you have it. You have the game that can be finished in roughly an hour on normal difficulty with its 5 missions and newly added achievements that make absolutely no sense. It's as arcadey as you can get with Metal Slug 3. Buy this game when it goes on sale and when you have a high tolerance for game crashes.\n\nOh and the menu looks like some poopy I-don't-give-a-s*** developer made it. But hey! Controller support! It works with my Dualshock 2 + adapter combo!\n\nObligatory score: When crashing 5/10, when playing 7/10, when at the end of the game in an hour, 3/10","May 31, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

You have one hit and many different weapons to blast your enemies away with. The stages are long and ♥♥♥♥ing hard as ♥♥♥♥, so you better get used to continuing a lot.\nMetal Slug 3 introduced branching paths which may not seem like a huge impact on new-comers, but that made this entry in the series one of the best at the time, because there are many different ways to beat the missions.\n\nThe Steam version is 1:1 an exact port of the arcade game. The watered down ports on consoles (especially the Metal Slug Anthology version which had considerable lag) cannot match this version, and I seriously hope SNK releases the entire franchise on Steam.","February 15, 2014","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'm going to quit it with this pattern and tell you exactly why you should give SNK your money to play this video game as if you'd never been into an arcade before.\n\nFor the uninitiated: Metal Slug 3 is a run and gun game that hits all of the nails on the head with the back of a rawket lawnchair that looks like a shotgun for no real reason, doesn't take itself too seriously, has powerups that can't be described using words that aren't synonymous with “fun” or “baller” and has vehicles named “Slugs”.\n\nThe responsiveness and naturalness of the controls is a big point to mention in this game. Your character controls like a dream, with jumping controls to avoid the slew of bullets coming your way being crisp and responsive, and character movement being about as immediate as your thumb, fingers, or hand(joystick 4 lyfe) is. Which is important because it's one shot and you're dead. But you get a total of about 60 lives so it's fine.\n\nFire direction is tied to your movement, but the game is balanced around this in a manner in which you won't miss the free aiming typically associated with modern run and guns, and will probably find it more fun in all honesty.\n\nSpeaking of fire direction, the lack of 8 firing directions like in similar games is done beautifully rather than frustratingly, as it enables you to fire upwards while walking or do things like jump or move and aim straight down while moving in midair, things you'll need to pull sometimes to make it out alive. In places where diagonal fire is even something you'd feel the need for (which are short, infrequent, and don't overstay their welcome), you're always given a heavy machine gun which is capable of fire on diagonals should you aim it upwards and downwards again while firing. These segments are incredibly satisfying to take on.\n\nAND THEN THERE ARE SLUGS. An important part of the series, slugs are the vehicles you're able to get into which just ramp up the insanity to a whole new level. Be it a tank with an aimable machine gun and a cannon, an armored weaponized submarine, or a camel that shoots plasma balls at your enemies, These multi-hitpoint wonders just rain death if you take care of them and it's as amazing as it seems.\n\nI've yet to mention the satisfying little details that this game crammed in to make everything just so much better than any competing games have accomplished as far as I'm aware. Little things like the cosmetic reload animations that happen when you're idle, or that eating too much food makes you fat and melee attack with a fork really complete the game.\n\nThe menus are a bit confusing with a controller, as they were designed with older game pads in mind and not xbox 360 controllers, so there will be some awkwardness when A isn't select and B isn't back if you rebind your controls (you'll really want to, I recommend X for shoot, A for jump, and right bumper for grenade), but I came here to review a game not a menu.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a good time that doesn't involve hand holding, I'd have to recommend this game. If you're looking for some hand holding, Easy mode is still pretty okay, so I'd still have to recommend it.","February 16, 2014","true","16.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

Exciting non-stop action, a lovingly detailed graphics and a brilliant multiplayer mode ensured a triumphant success in the arcades and on the impossibly expensive Neo Geo. But offers 'Metal Slug 3' really more than turbid feelings of nostalgia?\n\nHardly any action series burns such a dazzling display of wacky ideas like 'Metal Slug'. At the beginning you choose one of four protagonists, which however only look different. The heroes are all identical in play-style. Then it goes on in the fight and you beat you through five different levels, which are packed with enemies and insane ideas. Yes, five sections. That doesn't sound straight overly much and experienced players will need despite the crisp degree of difficulty only a few hours to get the end credits to face.\n\nBut it's simply due to the already mentioned change that you will be entertained at this time. Actually, you get barely a second to even take a breath, because something is always happening on the screen: explosions, respawning enemies and hissing through the air projectiles and grenades always keep you in suspense. The type of adversary is just as crazy as versatile: from coated shown pseudo Nazi soldiers to creepy undead to fancy aliens. Even the most hackneyed cliché is actually represented - and all without negative connotation.\n\nA real innovation prize win btw. the famously staged final boss's. Equally varied are the landscapes. So you travel through arid deserts or dive into the sea. The arsenal is a lot here to defend themselves against the baddies: grenades, shotguns and even a flamethrower is available. The shootas are presented of previously released prisoners, expressing their gratitude in this way. So that your feet are not mistreated so badly, you are allowed to take place sometimes on an airplane or on the back of a camel missiles. Crazy, isn't it?

If you haven’t played this before expect to die every three seconds but the chaos on screen and barrage of death is actually part of the fun!\n\nIf you are wondering whether to get Metal Slug 3 or Metal Slug X my advice would be to wait until they are on sale and get both! They are both very good games and it really just depends on what mood you’re in and how much time you have as to which game to pick.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is a longer game overall and a slightly more difficult one too. It has a little more variation in the type of enemies that attack you, at least from level to level and there are branching pathways to explore. There is more variety with some flying and underwater levels and a greater amount of craft and animals to get in/on to mix things up. This along with more actual levels to fight through at the end stages bulks the game out more.\n\nMetal Slug X is a more streamlined game that takes less time to complete and is a little easier overall. It has a more linear level design and more opportunity to pilot the Metal Slug tank itself. This perhaps gives it a bit more of an early arcade experience and possibly provides a little more flow to the feel of the gameplay. This is also good if you’re looking to squeeze some side scrolling Shoot ´Em Up action into a busy day or don’t feel like spending a great deal of time playing.\n\nBoth games have enough differences (as well as positive similarities) in level design and feel/vibe to warrant buying/playing them both if you like this genre of game and it really is more down to what frame of mind you’re in to which particular one you feel like playing. They are such enjoyable, well designed games to play it’s hard to say which is better. I do suggest you get both but I guess if I had a Heavy Machine Gun pressed to my head and I had to choose only one then Metal Slug 3 might come out on top by a (POW´s) whisker but I would miss playing X too.","February 14, 2015","true","27.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The Metal Slug is an SNK gem renowned for it's for it's fun co-op, hectic level designs, and challenging boss fights! It's just a fantastic game overall if you're into classic gaming before the year 2004. I say the year 2004, because that's right when the influx of action/first-person shooters began to flood the market. That's why classic arcade experiences, such as this one must be revisited, or discovered for the first time for the younger audience.\n\nI'll keep this somewhat brief, since it is simple title to break down. Also, I have many hours of this title already onseveral different platforms including:\n\nArcade\nXbox\nXbox 360\n\nPlease take my word for it that I know this game.\n\nIt's Metal Slug 3.You run across the screens shooting and lobbing grenades at as many things as you can while dodging lots of enemies. There are vehicles and mounts to ride with their own sets of weapons. These come in extremely handy, since they can also double as a set of armor for you if you get hit.\n\nThere are five missions, with the fifth being the longest, and you will probably beat this less than an hour, or maybe just a little bit over if you stretch your times. Levels are varied wit jungle, desert, underwater, and temples just for example. You'll fight lots of different enemies too in each one. Every level also has branching paths, so it is possible to make it to the boss by taking one of the couple routes. Some routes are also a bit hidden too, so you'll definitely feel awesome once you find a secret passage!\n\nThe music rocks. Next subject.\n\nSound! However they ported this, they managed to mess up/distort the sound for "GO!" when it tells you to move on. It sounds like "GO!" is old and about to fall over dead. It doesn't effect gameplay though.\n\nControls for gamepad are okay, I guess. I use a Dualshock 3 Sixaxis with Motioninjoy, so the game thinks I'm just using a 360 pad. I have not experimented with keyboard controls yet, nor will I ever attempt them. The biggest bug about the controls, and this is SUPER minor:\n\n(using a 360 pad)\nA = shoot\nX = grenade\nB = jump\n\nThis is changable from the config menu, but changing shoot to X, for example, will default you're "OK" button to X for menus, and that just feel like it could've been avoided. As a Metal Slug player for console, that's super awkward for me to deal with since I've been using X = shoot, B = grenade, and A = Jump for at least ten years. That's it though. THAT IS IT. That's my ONLY moan towards controls, and the controls are so spot-on responsive that I will dismiss that completely as a moan. I just felt it was only appropriate to let everyone else know, because it does not break the game.\n\nI'm running Windows 7, and this game performs well on my Asus G75VW notebook. I've yet to have any crashes, or slowdowns/stutters. This game shouldn't take super beefy hardware to run properly, but I imagine that running this on a rig older than 2004 might prove to be problematic for those complaining on the forums.\n\nYOU'RE GAMERS: STOP USING GRANDMA'S GATEWAY IN THE ATTIC.\n\nThe core game remains unchanged, with the exception of having a limited amount of credits. The credit system varies from various console releases of the game where you would usually have an infinite amount of continues, but you start a new game with 20 credits off the rip. I'm okay with this, because it means I can't just waste all of my lives in the first three levels without consequence. That also means this game has more replayability since you may not pass it the first time on limited continues.\n\nI recommend this game, even when it is not on sale, because even then it's still less than $9.99  It's awesome, and it's even more awesome if you've never had the chance to experience it! Pick it up, and play it with a friend. That's the best way to it, because it's Metal Slug 3!\n\n**STILL TO COME!!**\nI will update this review once I try out the multiplayer, which I have heard mixed opinions about. What I do know about online co-op so far, is that there is no match making. It is strictly private lobbies that you can invite one person from your friends list into.","June 21, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It even has a wide mode (that I think doesn't stretch) but I chose to play in 4:3 windowed mode. I'm not totally sure if this is an emulation, but part, if not all, of the ROM dumps are in the game's install folder. I think it's more like an emulator with a custom front-end on the game.

Are you looking for bullets flying everywhere, everyone trying to kill you and big explosions?? Look no further than Metal Slug 3!\n\nThe game is a port of the classic arcade game. You can play alone, with a friend in the room or with a friend online. The game isn't easy but who are we kidding, you don't want easy anyway! You pick one of 4 players to control and shoot your way through 5 action filled levels. Levels contain multiple routes which can influence how the boss fight plays out. As you fight your way through you can save prisoners and be rewarded with points or one of several enemy crippling weapons. Each level features a large bullet sponge of a boss, but we wouldn't want it any other way now would we? The final level is an endurance round, testing your skills and pushing you to the limit. The game gives you 20 credits (continues) with 3 lives each. Sound like a lot? Well that depends on how good you are, because you might be begging for more. If you're having trouble or finding things too easy, the game does feature four difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard).\n\nNow what are you doing still listening to me? Grab yourself a copy, suit up and mash that fire button like there's no tomorrow, you got a world to save.","June 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I remember playing this game at the arcades when I was younger. There would be this arcade machine that has multiple games on it and this was one of them and it only cost a quarter per play. Basically the game is a action pack 2d side scrolling shooter game.\n\nIt has various weapons, enemies and even different ways to progress into the level so it was never a dull moment and def. has replay value. For the single player mode you only have 20 credits but you can continue from any of the five missions available (which is quite long), so if you died on mission 3 you can select and continue from mission 3 with fresh 20 credits. I probably ate like 100 credits along the way!\n\nWhats even better is that I was playing co op with my friend which makes it even more satisfying. If you live in the NYC area, theres one arcade machine that has this game is located at the chinatown fair, if you ever pass by check it out.\n\nAnd one more thing, if you're trying co op and it lags when you host the game, make sure your friend tries hosting it because when I try to host the game it was lagging terribly. I live in new york and my friend lives in germany. When he tried hosting, the game was lag free. Not sure why since I have fios but hey it works and it was awesome.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=228749313","February 16, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally haven't experienced any AI issues like I've heard (hit detection being off, invincible bosses, etc.) and only had it crash once, and severely lag on only three occasions, but I'm pretty sure it was because I was showing the game to my friend over Skype. It hasn't done that in awhile though. In over two weeks at least. I can't speak for online co-op as I haven't tried it out yet, nor have I tried local co-op*. As for graphics not being as they were on the arcade, I can't speak for that either since I haven't played Metal Slug in an arcade for years but I remember it looking more or less the same.

Those kind of save states really help out when you're trying to practise the game when preparing for a speed run. Other than that, it's sweet metal slug as it always was, albeit with a few scenes in which the speed goes down for a bit and also times in which there were odd lags and bugs, but nothing major and most of those go away if you restart either your game or your computer.

I grew up playing Contra and the gameplay of Metal Slug is similar. Like Contra there are many unique weapon pickups and of course the vehicles. Only real downside to this port is that you cannot adjust the amount of continues. But the plus side is that you can select from any mission in the game. You have 20 continues which is fair amount. The game is rather challenging but I have managed to get to the last chapter on hard difficulty. I highly recommend Metal slug 3 especially if you have a friend to play coop with.","March 19, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But no: there still are some new innovations.\n\nWell, the gameplay is still the same: you run and shoot to take down soldiers, aliens, monsters, vehicles and so on. There are POW, Huge Bosses, There are Metal Slugs and other vehicles, but now there are new vehicles: Camel Slug, Elephant Slug and an Ostrich Slug... Why? Why not, I say... XD\nThere are new enemies, New scenarios of course, Very cool music and the thing that really surprised me is the final mission. Now, I can't say that the story in Metal slug is a greatly written and acted novel... It always has been more like a pretext to give the gameplay a context, and in this chapter... well, to prevent any spoiler all I can say is that the final mission is seriously taken to the next level, to an Epic level, I dare to say. Of course, everything is in the joking tone typical of any Metal Slug, but still I consider this chapter the best most epic of this Trilogy (Here in Steam there are only the first 3 titles... :( )\n\n+++PROs+++EPICNESS.  The game is badass and Fun as usual, but the last mission is something really unbelievable. That one is worth the entire game.\nGAMEPLAY. The simplicity of te game mechanics, the huge hordes of enemies, the innovations introduced in this chapter, everything makes this game just fun.\nCOOP. Clearly this game is way more fun with the help of a friend and you can play both on the same computer and online. Smart move.\nMUSIC.  I Honestly enjoyed this chapter's music in general, besides there's one of my favorite tracks (the desert stage, time ago I've recorded a real instrument cover on YouTube, just to prove how much I love that track)---CONs---PORT ISSUES. This isn't the best porting ever. Seems like this chapter suffer the same issues like Screen Resolution Bugs which caused me problems if I try to set my native 1080p, as it just crops visualizing just the upper left corner of the screen, so I had to play in 720p... Which is not that bad issue as it's not like I'm going to miss high res textures or stuff like that. Another problem involves performance issues: lots of player (if not all of them) noticed there are huge FPS drops in overcrowded situations... Which is ridiculous considering the game and the "engine".","March 30","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afronick/recommended/250180/","afronick","AfroNick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afronick/","357 products in account","It's no secret that I love this entire series and am continually replaying through each one. Metal Slug 3 is often considered to be the best one in the franchise, and for good reason: everything just works. The difficulty, while pretty hard, eventually scales to the point where you understand how exactly everything works and the reasons for your deaths are your own. The levels are incredibly varied and offer several branching paths to ensure multiple playthroughs. And with a game like this, multiple runs are guaranteed. Weapons are fun, vehicles are fun, and that's a good descriptor of the game: fun. If you're a fan of the run and gun shooter genre and haven't played Metal Slug before, do yourself a favor and play some of these games.\n\nAs far as this port is concerned, it's pretty solid. The menu works well enough but feels like it was designed for a controller. The actual controls in-game are fine regardless of your desired input, so don't worry if you enjoy mashing on your keyboard. The sound effects are mostly untouched save for the GO! arrows, which are different for some reason. It's noticeable if you've played a Metal Slug game anywhere else, but not too big a problem. Blood is in the game, which was a big selling point for me (the ports in which it's colored white to be "sweat" or something just make it look bad). There are very little if any at all slowdowns, which is impressive. This is a little bit of an issue though as sometimes I feel that the game almost speeds up past what's supposed to be normal, and I notice it mainly in the music. It's just minor nitpicking from a veteran of the series - newcomers and casual players probably won't notice these things. The stage select is nice because if you want to practice and get good at a mission, you no longer have to play through the earlier levels that no doubt you'll have mastered by the time you get through a no-death run of Mission 4. Leaderboards are fun and nice to see where you are.\n\nOverall, I recommend it and I hope that this is hardly the last time we see Metal Slug or SNK classics on Steam.","February 17, 2014","true","28.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Created in an era where games still involved a little brain stimulation in order to play, it offers a fast paced challenge amidst it's bloody, bullet riddling charisma.  Of course, there's little or no storyline whatsoever, but that's why we have books right?  I'd slap a fat 100% on it, but I found it was near impossible to play without having a USB controller.

But... it didn't age a bit and is still more than up to par to today's standards. The screen is filled with enemies, explosions and projectiles. Everything is nicely animated and the cartoonish pixel art graphics are gorgeous.\n\nThe gameplay is frenetic, and very responsive. It doesn't feel stiff like a lot of old games, this game is very smooth to play. A good point is that it can be played with mouse & keyboard, or gamepads. And it recognizes different brands of gamepads, unlike a lot of recent games that only lazily recognize the traitorous Xbox360 pad.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is the pinnacle of the series. Tons of weapons, different branching paths, tons of different enemies and creatures to fight (soldiers, zombies, extra-terrestrials, snails, wasps, submarines, planes, yeti men, and so on and so on). Moreover, the gameplay sequences undergo a lot of variation: different vehicles, space invaders/shoot-em-up phases, aquatic fight, and so on and so on. The boss fights are very well done (can be very very tough though). Once a mission has been unlocked in the main campaign mode, it is possible to start from it at any time.\n\nThere is an online leaderboard for all the difficulty settings,  but the best thing is that there is an online Co-op mode. ONLINE CO-OP MODE ON METAL SLUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is awesome.\n\nOn the negative side, despite the quite good port, some bugs can appear at times to times, such as the sound disappearing. There aren't many graphical filters, but it is possible to add them if you follow this guide (I recommend HQ4X) http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227190051\n\nOverall, this game is tons of fun, is reasonably challenging and feels great to play. Online Co-op is much appreciated.\n\nI wish Metal Slug X (Metal Slug 2 revamped) will also be ported to Steam by the same team.","May 9, 2014","true","14.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This ended up being the most fun I've had in so long. I have no history with the Metal Slug series but I'd love to play them all. There were so many twists and turns and it was a great adventure to play with a friend. I am honestly in awe for how cool this game was. The art, sound, everything was just well done on this. Although it was only 5 missions, they were the greatest 5 missions I could've asked for. There  were many secret passages along the way, the prisoner rescue was a fun concept, it was all so awesome!\n\nI really, really recommend this game to all video game players, don't bu it and play the first mission, buy it and PLAY IT.","June 26, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's agonizing to crash, especially when you are having so much fun!\nI realized the crash only occurs when any one of the players pressed the pause button.\nIt's a minor bug, but quite major when you have a high score! XD\n\nOther than that, it's fun and I hope you guys put a Free Play mode. 20 credits is a challenge, but for newbies, a free play would be great as it will be easier for them. Plus, it'd great for finding hidden goodies in the game! :)\n\nI also realized when you die and lose a credit, your score resets, which sucks! When I played Metal Slug Anthology, that wouldn't happen, so I was a little heartbroken but at least the challenge was nudged up for better players. I just have to get better.\n\nOverall, it's a game worth getting in my opinion. This game is a true classic, and if you guys could patch it to make it better, it'd really be worth our money!

Levels will pit the play against everything from enemy soldiers to zombies and mutant animals. Players can to make use of various vehicals and weapons to fight through the levels and enemies. The game can also be played split screen co-op, though sadly the online co-op can only be played with people who are friends on steam, there is no random match-making. Also, unless certain steps are taken, it is possible that the achiments will be bugged and unable to unlock.

I've never played a Metal Slug game before, so I was eager to find out why they were so loved.\n\nI'll start by saying that this game is hard. Like, ridiculously hard. I managed to complete the first four levels on medium, but I wasn't able to pass the final level on medium. After six or so tries (getting 30-40 minutes into the level each time) I gave up and switched to easy, which I was able to pass with 13 credits remaining, surprisingly. It was frustrating, but the feeling of relief after beating that last level was enough for me to forget my frustration.\n\nThe game is very short, lasting about two hours (or three, if you're terrible at it, like me), but it was an experience well had. This was my introduction to the world of Metal Slug, and I quite enjoyed it. The gameplay was, for the most part, fun and kept me playing (until the final mission, where I rage quit three separate times) till the end. The gameplay doesn't consist of much, just your average sidescroller with plenty of weapons (too many to name), but the game's humor and variety really made it an enjoyable experience for me.\n\nThis didn't come without its issues, however. The game, being originally for the Neo-Geo, was running through some sort of emulator, and it did quite a bad job at its sole task. Putting the game's resolution at anything other than the default (I played at 1920x1080) results in constant frame drops. The actual fps of the game remains the same (60fps), but the emulation appears to slow down considerably. This really messed with me during the final mission, where I experienced the issue the most. That alone caused quite a few rage quits during my play session with the game.\n\nOn top of the fps issues, the game also appears to have some sound issues. Sometimes, a noticeable increase/decrease in the sound speed can be heard. This is often heard in the game's music, which I found quite annoying. It doesn't happen too often, but it does enough for me to point it out.\n\nRegardless of the game's flaws, Metal Slug 3 does a fantastic job of retaining its fun factor from the original release. The included co-op mode is also a bonus, although I wasn't able to try it out myself. I can recommend the game, but beware of the technical flaws that are included.","March 31, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I suggest you should enable player to host the multiplayer game in which everyone can participate, depend on the region of the player.

It's agonizing to crash, especially when you are having so much fun!\nI realized the crash only occurs when any one of the players pressed the pause button.\nIt's a minor bug, but quite major when you have a high score! XD\n\nOther than that, it's fun and I hope you guys put a Free Play mode. 20 credits is a challenge, but for newbies, a free play would be great as it will be easier for them. Plus, it'd great for finding hidden goodies in the game! :)\n\nI also realized when you die and lose a credit, your score resets, which sucks! When I played Metal Slug Anthology, that wouldn't happen, so I was a little heartbroken but at least the challenge was nudged up for better players. I just have to get better.\n\nOverall, it's a game worth getting in my opinion. This game is a true classic, and if you guys could patch it to make it better, it'd really be worth our money! And also, if you could bring Metal Slug X (Which is my most favorite) then I'd be very delighted.","February 15, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took countless tries, but we finally beat the final boss today, with both of us on our last credits.  It was honestly one of the most satisfying wins I've ever felt playing a video game because it felt EARNED.  We played enough times to figure out which paths were the best to take, how to dodge enemy patterns, etc.   MS3 is unrelenting in the sheer amount of stuff it throws at you and it can feel overwhelming, but actually overcoming all of that is the best feeling in the world. Highly recommended.\n\nNote: This game recently got patched with a couple major changes: 1) MUCH better netcode and 2) freeplay mode.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend freeplay: I feel like an integral part of Metal Slug is the threat of losing, and having unlimited credits defeats some of the challenge.  At the very least, don't make freeplay the only way you play the game: Use it for a "dry run" to get a feel for the game, then set a credit limit to really challenge yourself.","February 5, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entire franchise is so much fun, with MS3 marking the turning point of the franchise.\n\nThe PC port is very faithful to the original arcade release, with welcomed additions like easy, normal and hard difficulties. It also has local and online four player co-op, which adds to the replayability considerably.\n\nOther trademark features of the game are still retained, like different paths to choose, more metal slugs and animals to command and conquer with - this arcade classic is so over-the-top-ridiculous you'll be glad you bought it.","October 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've never played or seen Metal Slug games then I would recommend getting the first one, immediately followed by this one. The gameplay is just as good as ever and it even has online multiplayer, full controller support and remapable buttons.\n\nI think the price tag is a little high for just one game and I'm sure that's the main thing stopping people from picking it up, but I think the bundle for the 3 currently on steam is fair. I think. It's hard to say since they don't have the most replay value in the world and my judgement is a little clouded by nostalgia.\n\nAll in all, there's not really a better 2D shooting sidescroller I can think of.

Many hours of my life were spent playing it back in high school, and even today it never gets old. With excellent sprite graphics (that are often used as THE example for top-tier pixel graphics with smooth animation), multiple branching paths that add replay value, excellent music, and sheer over-the-top action, Metal Slug 3 is an excellent title for anyone who wants to go back to those old days of video game arcade games. Plus, it's got online multiplayer. Which really is what we've been wanting, isn't it?\n\nMy only complaint is that on Harder Difficulties, it seems that they simply ramp up the game speed. This unfortunately speeds up the audio and music along with it, distorting it.

As with every Metal Slug, you get diferent kinds of weapons that deal different kinds of damage, and you can get killed many times before the game says "game over", but with every death, your POW saving count goes back to zero.\n\nThere's only 5 missions so don't get addicted or you'll have finished it in 30 minutes. It's got good replay-value and serves its purpose as relaxing casual fun, so it's a good addition to your library if you have money to spare.\n\nGraphics/Soundtrack\nGraphic options are poor and it looks hideous on full-screen (the pixel-art becomes a blurry fest). It was made with a 4:3 ratio in mind so don't get excited when you see the 16:9 option in the graphic settings. The soundtrack isn't remarkable at all but it does its job.\n\nControls\nAs with every arcade, a controller is a must for this game.

For me, this is the hardest game I have ever played. Harder than games I have beat like Smash TV, Punchout, Battletoads, Street Fighter 2 on 7-star difficulty on SNES without losing even a single round, Contra without dying once, Silver Surfer after dying countless times, Resident Evil with just the knife and pistol, and so on. I'm sure if I put more time into this I could master it, but it just isn't as satisfying on multiple playthroughs. I remember this well in the arcades though and I had a lot of fun with it then. But it didn't limit you to twenty continues when you played it like this Steam version did before a patch. Putting in unlimited continues was a good move on their part. Even ten more to make it thirty continues would've been good. Because the only people in the arcade that had limited continues were kids whose parents didn't give them enough quarters. The graphics and art direction in this are fantastic, the sound and music very memorable, and the controls great. The addition of unlimited continues was a smart move on their part and only ♥♥♥♥♥ing crying whiner girls get butthurt over it. No classic popular arcade games limited your continues, so why should any Steam games? Sorry for your butthurt loss, fans.\n\nMore of a cult classic than a mainstream mega hit. I find it above average, 7/10.","January 1, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The high difficulty is kinda expected to be compensated by the fact you'll have that buddy with you to compensate to lose not so many lives. Twice the damage, twice the cover. The game also gives you what they seem as a reasonable amount of continues.\nI like to try every metal slug game at least once, and I had some fun with 4, so I decided to try going to 3.\nWhat I've always liked about the metal slug games is the creativity the levels give, but i've never ever liked the prisoner rating system of the games, the fact that as soon as you die even once from the hail of bullets and guts that the game throws on you, it's wiped.\nMetal slug 3 can easily overwhelm single players into dying multiple times in quick succession from the ridiculous amount of projectiles that can build up, and the mode of difficulty you choose really means nothing in truth. The control mapping isn't perfect and comfortable, but it's your own customizationable choice as to what you want in the end. By the end of the second mission, I already had enough of this game for the day, and my return to it is not clear. The game only has the arcade mode, and free mode options of gameplay, being an emulation of the original,  so don't expect mass gameplay branching.\n\nBasically the choice at the end of the day is yours, whether the game piques your interest or not, but I will say plan ahead first. Grab a friend, grab a headset, communicate, and have fun while you play. If you're old pro veterans of this game that know the path of every living pixel shot at you, or want a nostalgia pickup, then by all means jump straight in. If you're a solo player and new to gaming, or like me, still rather inexperienced with the metal slug series, this may be a series best avoided and never touched again. There are plently of other screen-scrolling arcade gun games that may appeal as a less torturous (and a bit morbid) experience.","February 14, 2014","false","4.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

There are a lot of great things to say about this game.\n\nIt's a solid single player and co-op experience and with the new Steam edition; there is added online multiplayer, a great addition to the series.\n\nThe core strength of this game is the addicting and fast paced run and gun gameplay, you will never have a dull moment in your mission to defeat the evil General Mordern. The graphics style and music of the game is also another big plus, the design of the sprites have their own unique charming flavour and the music matches the insanity on screen perfectly.  Coupled with the razor sharp difficulty, you'll be back wanting for more and to improve your skills, making up for how relatively short the game is.\n\nHowever, as difficult as this game is, it is very accessible (a huge improvement over the Xbox port). It's easy to grasp how to play the game in the first couple of seconds and it makes sure to make enemy fire and enemies clear. The Steam version also allows you to select a mission (once you at least beat the level previous) and it gives you 20 continues, so you do not need to be a video game master to enjoy this game.\n\nThe only negative I have for this game is when using a control the main menu is hard to navigate. If you rebind your controls on a controller it will also rebind the buttons you use to select options on the main menu, but it is a minor blemish on an overall great experience.","June 25, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/250180/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","To try and put in perspective I’ll start with this. Metal Slug 3 epitomizes everything I HATE about the old days at the arcade, and I still love it.\n\nIt’s aesthetically fun to look at, it’s creative both from a design and gameplay standpoint, it manages to tell a better story in twenty-minutes and with no dialogue than some RPG’s do in 40-hours and with a novels worth of text, and it’s just **** fun to play. It was fun back in the day and it’s fun now.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s anywhere near perfect as I alluded to at first but most of the problems it has are small, with only one big issue in my eyes. It’s a BLATANT quarter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (seriously, that word gets editted? What are you, a snickering 10-year-old Steam?).\n\nEven for someone with a fair amount of time in shmups, shooters, and other action games of this variety this game is still blatantly unfair at times. Going well beyond requiring twitch-reflexes or memorization into the realm of tossing impossible situations at you designed to consume your 12-year-old allowance. For instance the game will drop twenty soldiers on you all shooting at once and since you’re stuck on the limited plain your jump affords you, you occasionally find it outside of your movement scope to even try dodging.\n\nThankfully this version drops you in with 20 continues to start, more than enough for even the most casual player to make it through the game. Otherwise this is a no frills port, which I might hold issue with if the game hadn’t aged well, but in this case it has. Of course some people will argue that in that case you should just play it via some less than legal shenanigans.\n\nBut what sort of a massive ***hat are you?","April 29, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll also notice that this is number one. This game was my childhood, me and my mate would sit on his PS2 for hours, playing this game over and over again. About six or seven years later, I began collecting games and I got this exact game on the Original Xbox and the anthology on PSP. Thanks to\nmy friend, I had this gifted to me as an early birthday/christmas thing.\n\nDon't expect this review to be nostalgia fuelled though, because even if you've never heard of this game, it's great. Simplistic layout, ability to play ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, mission mode and the arcade mode are both readily available. The missions are fairly short, which is good. You don't want to be sat for hours. There's always something going on, a large variety of weapons to choose from and if you can make it through a mission without dying on very hard then well done to you, I earned that imaginary trophy a while back on a dusty PS2 which has since been destroyed, along with the game.\n\nIs this game worth it? God yes. It has multiplayer for when you're done with the single player. It's a brilliant port of the game over to the PC and I'd like to congratulate the people working on this. They even added things to make the game BETTER. For example, some enemies will drop weapons, which lacked in the console and handheld versions. This allows for a more varied playing experience.\n\nGo, buy it now. It's on sale, you'd be a bloody fool to not buy this game.","December 18, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/250180/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","To try and put in perspective I’ll start with this. Metal Slug 3 epitomizes everything I HATE about the old days at the arcade, and I still love it.\n\nIt’s aesthetically fun to look at, it’s creative both from a design and gameplay standpoint, it manages to tell a better story in twenty-minutes and with no dialogue than some RPG’s do in 40-hours and with a novels worth of text, and it’s just **** fun to play. It was fun back in the day and it’s fun now.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s anywhere near perfect as I alluded to at first but most of the problems it has are small, with only one big issue in my eyes. It’s a BLATANT quarter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (seriously, that word gets editted? What are you, a snickering 10-year-old Steam?).\n\nEven for someone with a fair amount of time in shmups, shooters, and other action games of this variety this game is still blatantly unfair at times. Going well beyond requiring twitch-reflexes or memorization into the realm of tossing impossible situations at you designed to consume your 12-year-old allowance. For instance the game will drop twenty soldiers on you all shooting at once and since you’re stuck on the limited plain your jump affords you, you occasionally find it outside of your movement scope to even try dodging.\n\nThankfully this version drops you in with 20 continues to start, more than enough for even the most casual player to make it through the game. Otherwise this is a no frills port, which I might hold issue with if the game hadn’t aged well, but in this case it has.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makerpopo/recommended/250180/","Makerpopo","Marcus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makerpopo/","230 products in account","The game itself, from roughly 14 years ago, is still solid to this very day. However the emulation is a bit shoddy (especially in terms of sound), and netcode (that was originally used for GGPO, or so I heard) could be better. It could be somewhat lacking even compared to AES version and to say about PS2 or XBOX... Well, I don't really want to cut down this game that much.\n\nThat doesn't mean the game is bad. Like already said, the game itself is blast. It is top-of-the-class sidescrolling shoot'em up, with SNK (now SNKP)'s artistic pixel art. The game was originally developed on 304x224 resolution, but it is still pleasing to eye. You can play as 4 iconic, lovable characters (although their stats doesn't vary until MS6), and there are plentiful of arsenal and vehicles in your way. Also this game was the first in the series to have alternative routes, giving players replayability. Also the story, while not serious at all and sometimes over the top, is simply the best among the series and can even bring tears of glory and victory in players' eyes.\n\nStill, many people seems to having problems, regardless of their direness. So I'd suggest you to wait a while until the dust is settled. After all, this game was originally released in 2000, so you're most likely not missing much by waiting. Also, as this game doesn't support any kind of matchmaking, so people can play only with thier Steam friend, I suggest you to pick the two-pack and play with your friend.\n\nIn short, (whoops, it is not short at all!)\n\nCons:\n- Classic shoot'em up masterpiece from 2000\n- Easily the best among the series\n- Online multiplayer with Steam friends\n- $8 without any discount, which is pretty cheap even compared what most would spend on the arcade.\n\nPros:\n- Emulation is a bit shoddy, considering it is from 2000 and was already emulated near perfectly several times. Speed or the game and sound are pretty much the most problem.\n- Netcode is not the best. Even after beta testing, desync issues are reported here and there. In my case, I've experienced quite a bit of latency issue.\n- Configurations are a bit lacking. You can't set the volume of the game, which seems to be looked over as the game seems to be mobile port. Also Slug Attack button and Vulcan Fix option that were available in the original AES version is nowhere to be seen.\n- Some are reporting various freezing and/or stuttering issues. Which could be a big issue considering the game's nature.\n\nI would recommend this game more than I ever can if it worked flawlessly. Sadly, currently it is not. Although some people, including myself, have about no problem. However if I were you, I would wait until those issues are solved.","February 15, 2014","false","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll also notice that this is number one. This game was my childhood, me and my mate would sit on his PS2 for hours, playing this game over and over again. About six or seven years later, I began collecting games and I got this exact game on the Original Xbox and the anthology on PSP. Thanks to\nmy friend, I had this gifted to me as an early birthday/christmas thing.\n\nDon't expect this review to be nostalgia fuelled though, because even if you've never heard of this game, it's great. Simplistic layout, ability to play ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, mission mode and the arcade mode are both readily available. The missions are fairly short, which is good. You don't want to be sat for hours. There's always something going on, a large variety of weapons to choose from and if you can make it through a mission without dying on very hard then well done to you, I earned that imaginary trophy a while back on a dusty PS2 which has since been destroyed, along with the game.\n\nIs this game worth it? God yes. It has multiplayer for when you're done with the single player. It's a brilliant port of the game over to the PC and I'd like to congratulate the people working on this. They even added things to make the game BETTER. For example, some enemies will drop weapons, which lacked in the console and handheld versions. This allows for a more varied playing experience.\n\nGo, buy it now. It's on sale, you'd be a bloody fool to not buy this game.","December 18, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This particular version however is a really sloppy port of a great game. For me to truly enjoy Metal Slug 3 it needs to run as fast as I can react and what with it being so old it shouldn't feel like it needs a day one patch. The menu is bare and what with the weirdly compressed audio it's a shame that there isn't some way for me to turn down the volume as such an option does not exist. Whether you are playing with a controller or a keyboard Metal Slug 3 doesn't feel quite right. Call it blind nostalgia but I don't remember Metal Slug 3 feeling so unresponsive and having this much slowdown originally. Even the music has issues as it constantly cuts in and out thus making it painful to listen to. Most of my issues are not prevalent on the Neo Geo, PS2, Wii or Xbox 360 versions of the game so I'm not quite sure as to just what went wrong. If you want more bang for your buck look for the Metal Slug collection for better performance and a larger range of content at a bargain bin price. All that aside it's really good fun, addictive and highly replayable.\n\nEDIT: This is just shameful. I downloaded an emulator and it looks runs and plays better than the official steam version! Rarely do I ever endorse emulating a game when it can just be purchased and is or has become readily available but honestly I think that the only way to do this game justice is to download it for free.\n\n4/22/16 EDIT: They have since updated the gaphics option menu. It's still not great but the port isn't as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it once was. Metal Slug 1 and the improved Metal Slug 2 (Called Metal Slug X) has also been released. I reccomend the first Metal Slug over this. As the series went on the difficulty came more from the enemies being sponges and from it being hard to tell whats going on due to too many sprites on screen making it hard to see whos bullets are whos and what isn't attached to the background.","February 15, 2014","false","6.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","13"

Be warned that the replayability the series boasts depends greatly on how much you enjoy trying to get into the top of the leaderboards for score.\n\nIf you're into emulation, you've probably come across the Metal Slug series before. If not, you may still know these if you're from an older generation: the time when people would gladly use high-denomination coins to play masterpiece games on huge machines. If you're younger than that and/or don't really care about emulation, then this is probably the crappiest starting point if you want to discover the universe of Metal Slug. If you want the bottom line, scroll to it.\n\nIf you want to know some of the finer points of why this is a bad port, Steam user Aulbath has made an incredibly accurate review of Metal Slug 3 for Steam (before many updates were made to the game) on the following address (http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198000420809/recommended/250180/). You should read his review if you want some of the finer points of what was really wrong with the port at its Steam launch, even if some of it may be outdated.\n\nBefore I begin, I'd like you to scroll to see some of the other reviews and see not what they say, but only if they recommend and how long they played the game. Metal Slug games may be rather short, but take into account its theoretical replay value and consider how long the upvoters have clocked into it knowing many of the reviews have been made significantly close to the date the game was released on Steam (that is to say, people aren't enjoying its replay value that much).\n\nNot only can anyone with half a brain detect that this is a bad port which, as far as I know, was ported into phones before being ported into PCs, but it's an annoying port at that. The biggest gripe I have is the lack of options to let you play at a good resolution full-screened, and until some time recently the way the game handled credits (continues) was in my opinion nonsensical for this day and age.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is also one of the weakest in the Metal Slug series, from my memories. True, lots of vehicles were added in comparison to the first two games, and it's fun being an almost-immortal zombie that can't handle being puked upon, and it probably does boast the most branching of level segments of the series, and you probably will have an enjoyable time playing it... but honestly, the game is somewhat less interesting overall comparing to the classic Metal Slug 2; this is particularly true if you've played some of the latter games in the series as well.\n\nI'm glad that I got this through a game bundle, where I got 5 more games along with it for just 5$. I'm going to simply say this: the game isn't worth the money, maybe only on a 80% discount. Why? Yes, it does have online multiplayer. But at the same time, people have to be on your friends list to play with you; this makes sense, in a way, since you probably don't usually want to team up with people that die each time a boss even budges, but they could have that and an option to partner up with randoms. I haven't tried multiplayer yet because of it, since I'd have to pester someone into buying a game that I'm already telling you should be bought at 80% of Steam's listed price.\n\nIf you really want a decent Metal Slug experience without using emulation, try getting hold of a GameBoy Advance or PlayStation Portable and their respective versions of Metal Slug: hitpoints based system with persistent upgrades is much better than the continues deal, somewhat. If you really really want to play Metal Slug online, I'd go with Mercenary Kings instead; it's a good homage game, and you'll feel that there's a point going on (albeit sometimes poorly conveyed) instead of trying to get a high score that gets thrown down the gutter every time you need a continue. Mercenary Kings also allows for 4-player co-op and you don't usually feel like you're hammering the "fire" key into needing a new keyboard to chew at a tank/building/whatever. And hey, if you do try emulation, just skip Metal Slug 3 unless you really need to play through the events of the game (which you might feel tempted to if you play the more recent titles).\n\nFor the diehard fans, you probably didn't need my review and you'll buy it anyway since you also probably already know the game, better than myself even.\nFor achivement hunters, this game still has some fairly hard achievments that might hurt your 100%, including passing the game without spending 1 continue (3 lives).\nFor everyone else, avoid Metal Slug 3; final mission, start.\n\nEdit reason: With updates to the game, it became somewhat less annoying and the review's tone reflects it. However, I still consider you should skip this game for being one of the weaker titles of Metal Slug.","May 29, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"Impossible to dodge boss fights" - and they are ridiculously long and boring. Spawn - drop all the grenades - shot five seconds the same spot - die without a chance.

I simply cannot reccomend this version in its current state. The most noticable thing that anyone who has played this game before will notice is that there are a lot and I mean a LOT of sound effects that do not sound correct. This version also tries to run the game at 60 FPS and the game simply wasn't meant to run that fast. There needs to at least be an option to lock the framerate to 30. I'd be able to look past these flaws for the most part if the game was actually at least playable for me. Which right now it isn't. I get tons of stuttering and frame dropping when there's a lot of enemies on the screen or when certain effects (like the grenade explosion) show on screen. I realize this isn't an issue for everyone and I don't exactly have a gaming computer, but I used to run this game on an emulator for years before with no performance issues whatsoever, and from what I've noticed this problem has been affecting other people  that actually have decent PCs as well. This is a 14 year old game and performance issues like this on modern computers are simply unacceptable, even if it isn't affecting everyone it's a serious issue that MANY others are having. This is just a weak port of an excellent game. If you already own it on another system, there's no reason for you to pick this up. And if you haven't played it before there's already numerous ports of it on other systems (PS2, Wii, PSP, X360). And if you want online play, the XBLA version already has that as well.","February 14, 2014","false","16.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

A classic from my years of practically living in an arcade, I've sunk numerous hours of my youth in front of machines playing these games. Imagine my suprise playing it on my laptop 14 years later.\n\nAnd unfortunately, my time with it on this platform was barely passable.\n\nThe main selling point for this port of MS3 was online co-op with a friend. I honestly feel that the netcode for this game is poor as I both me and my pal have low ping counts towards each other, and started to play a game to see each  other teleporting and not responding to controls until 3 seconds later. Very disappointing.\n\nAnother issue with the game i have is the limitations of credits. I find this to be a puzzling restriction, as the 20 credits are not change able, and keep only but the good players of the game from reaching the end with a handful of credits left. Perhaps I've been spoiled with emulators and their key to add credits, but even yet, this restriction is puzzling.\n\nFinally, a good chunk of sounds in this port have Very noticible changes in they way they sound, compared to their arcade counterparts. the sub-boss in Mission 2,and the main boss of Mission 4 have a high pitched whining noise that replace the original sounds of some of their attacks. I suspect that this is a result from the game being ported and not an emulation, but as an audophile, these changes are very noticible, and not subtle at all. It may seem like a nitpick, and I would agree if their replacement wasn't an annoying high pitched whine. A real nitpick would be "OKAY!" playing after each selection from their menus.\n\nOther than those issues, the main game is a complete port, no issues.  I can't completely reccommend this game from my standpoint, as the above has left me a tad disappointed, but If you've never played MS3 before, and you don't know how to MAME or other emulators, you could do much worse than playing this port.","March 5, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

There's just something about teaming up with the Commu-Nazis to rescue your squadmates from alien zombie clones that isn't captured by, uh, typical video games. That being said, there's a thin line between bringing a classic back on a new platform and cashing in on a license.\n\nThis is the latter.\n\nPoor graphics options, distorted sound, occasional dropped inputs, and (apparently) mediocre netplay really degrade what MS3 is supposed to be. As others have mentioned, this is a port of the iOS version of the game, and it inherits many of the mobile version's concessions and limitations. I really don't think this is necessary. It's not like nobody has ever partnered with GGPO for re-releases of arcade classics.\n\nThat being said, it's cheap, it's on Steam, and it's Metal Slug.

I'm very happy that it was ported to PC at last, and I'm really enjoying every moment of the game. It has a nostalgic feeling while it is a great platformer even today. I'm really glad that you have finally ported it to PC and left everything untouched in it (visuals, gameplay) while added the online co-op in Steam, which will make it even more viable today and super fun.\n\nThe controls were okay, but I prefer the gamepad instead of the Keyboard. The default keyboard settings were a bit tricky, and the SHIFT key always brought up a "stucked button window" in windows, so i had to reconfigure it which solved the case.\n\nThe game has a huge re-playability either in single player or in multiplayer, the levels are well designed with lot of fun and alternative paths which all justify its value.\n\nI cannot say much. I loved and love this game and recommend it to everybody who also likes this genre or like retro games.\n\nIf I may suggest I would really appreciate to see a Metal slug compilation on Steam, in which you can get ALL of the Metal slug games in one package. ;)","February 6, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're unfamiliar with the series they're run-and-gun, side-scrolling, pixelated festivals for the eyes. It's a good way to kill an hour or two with a buddy, and they even made it so you can play with people online.\n\nMetal Slug 3 is a fan favorite among the series, which seems likely why it was ported first. Many years after the fact the game remains a terrific bit of fun with clean, detailed animation that makes the game fun to watch even if you're terrible at it. The best part is it won't be costing you quarters; however, there is a 20 credit cap, meaning you might need to resort to mission mode (individual level select) to take down the later levels.\n\nThe only real drawback is that the game is short. But there are multiple pathways through the levels with unique surprises, and it has a high level of replayability.","October 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then you fight zombies and if you find the secret cave you fight these ice creatures out of nowhere then you fight giant alians AND THEN fight this future thing that majically pops out of the ground on the second level. THEN on the third level your all of a sudden under water fighting nazis again and you fight into this base with robots than shoot lazers then nazis then nazis in machines then this giant robot thats in this lava room on the third level. Then next your in a desert fighting nazis again then you fight these plants and you have to shoot these tiny plants that come down and blow you up and if you go this secret way you fight mummys or these arab guys then the boss is this random face thing on top of a pyramid for no reason what so ever. THEN THE LAST LEVEL NO LOGIC WHAT SO EVER ok so you start then level above the  clouds then you fight in this jet or heli then you hover down and fight more nazis then you fight this buff guy in an airship after that you go to this base and kill these nazis and kill their leader then he turns into an alien and takes you character away then all of a sudden all these rocket ships appear out of nowhere and you go to space and fight aliens and the nazis are now on your side and they all get rekt as soon as you reach space and so after this long battle you think its over THEN OUT OF NOWHERE this giant alien grabs your tank and you end up killing him game over 5 levels confusing story 10/10","June 5, 2015","false","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","0"

It's impossible to beat without using a significant amount of "quarters" (continues), and it's a nice cartoon to "interact" with if you set it to unlimited continues.\n\nIf you want to waste a dollar for the experience... go ahead.

As you would expect, it is well difficult to even play this game without owning a gamepad, or at least without spending a significant amount of time playing just to get a feel for what should be easy controls.\n\nAs far as Metal Slug games go, this one is deeply lacking: instead of quickly blowing through screens of enemies, this game is a slow crawl, with enemies clogging every hall and corridor of the levels to such an extent that in even early levels death comes quickly because the game makes it nearly impossible to understand what is going on, and this becomes when the game only gives a certain number of lives, for some reason. I don’t know if it is because they think arcade games are just inherently cool or something but considering this epitome of token-taker games already got my money, why is it still giving a game over when I have run out of nonexistent credits in the nonexistent machine?\n\nBetter testaments to its slowness are the underwater sections of the game in which movement speed is greatly slowed, your character remains horizontal rather than vertical with no way to compress, meaning you get hit more with less of a chance to do anything about it, momentum is grossly carried so it takes an obnoxious amount of time to actually change direction and you cannot shoot up or down, only left and right, so not only are you more vulnerable to targets above and below you, you cannot shoot at them without extensive and tediously slow maneuvers, and yes the game capitalises on this. No these parts are not fun, they are frustrating, because often times no amount of skill is going to go a long ways underwater.\n\nIt has got much of the same appeal visually, and does not disappoint in those regards, most of the actual content is the exact same as far as enemies and items go, though some of the bosses, the series’ general high water mark, are a frustrating chore, not in the sense that something is really fast and hard to run from, but in the sense that the game just sometimes gets desperate to take your nonexistent tokens and hardly plays fair,surely to play it off as “Well that’s just the challenge, duuuuh”, but Metal Slug 3 frankly pushes its luck regarding the line between what is fun and challenging and what is frustrating and unreasonable.","June 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not possible without massive amounts of them.\n\nI made it through on 61 continues.  At $0.25 a piece, that's a $15 game.  This game is nice and all, but I think I got it for like a $1 through a Humble Bundle sale.  I think that discepancy should be all you need to understand for how this game is designed to work: it's a $1 game that will be unfair to the point of being a giant waste of time.  It's impossible to beat without using a significant amount of "quarters" (continues), and it's a nice cartoon to "interact" with if you set it to unlimited continues.\n\nIf you want to waste a dollar for the experience... go ahead.

As you would expect, it is well difficult to even play this game without owning a gamepad, or at least without spending a significant amount of time playing just to get a feel for what should be easy controls.\n\nAs far as Metal Slug games go, this one is deeply lacking: instead of quickly blowing through screens of enemies, this game is a slow crawl, with enemies clogging every hall and corridor of the levels to such an extent that in even early levels death comes quickly because the game makes it nearly impossible to understand what is going on, and this becomes when the game only gives a certain number of lives, for some reason. I don’t know if it is because they think arcade games are just inherently cool or something but considering this epitome of token-taker games already got my money, why is it still giving a game over when I have run out of nonexistent credits in the nonexistent machine?\n\nBetter testaments to its slowness are the underwater sections of the game in which movement speed is greatly slowed, your character remains horizontal rather than vertical with no way to compress, meaning you get hit more with less of a chance to do anything about it, momentum is grossly carried so it takes an obnoxious amount of time to actually change direction and you cannot shoot up or down, only left and right, so not only are you more vulnerable to targets above and below you, you cannot shoot at them without extensive and tediously slow maneuvers, and yes the game capitalises on this. No these parts are not fun, they are frustrating, because often times no amount of skill is going to go a long ways underwater.\n\nIt has got much of the same appeal visually, and does not disappoint in those regards, most of the actual content is the exact same as far as enemies and items go, though some of the bosses, the series’ general high water mark, are a frustrating chore, not in the sense that something is really fast and hard to run from, but in the sense that the game just sometimes gets desperate to take your nonexistent tokens and hardly plays fair,surely to play it off as “Well that’s just the challenge, duuuuh”, but Metal Slug 3 frankly pushes its luck regarding the line between what is fun and challenging and what is frustrating and unreasonable.","June 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game was released later for various consoles and is now relesed for PC. Metal Slug 3 is a 2D run and gun game, if like me you haven't played Metal Slug before, you'll basically have to advance towards your goal and shoot at different enemies on your way there.\n\nThe game is great, addicting I must say and unlike the original game (for obvious reasons) includes a online multiplayer co-op so you can play though your missions with your friends.\n\nNow one drawback when playing the game was probably the control system. As someone who isn't familiar with this game I found myself strugling to aim while keeping myself safe from danger as the movement keys and the aiming ones are essentially the same ones.\n\nDespite all that I think the game brings a nice fuzzy retro feeling to my library and is quite fun to play both co-op and singleplayer.","January 31, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Long Review !]\n\nThe first thing wich strikes is the present of the firm "Dot Emu" at the beginning of the game.\n\nThey are specialized in emulation of old games. Quite nice in the fact that they bring to us playable old games like the incredible "Little Big Adventure" (you have to try it !).\n\nThe problem is that this game is just an emulation of Metal Slug 3.\n\nThere is nothing new like the for most controversed Metal Slug: Metal Slug Advance.\nOn this one they tried to bring new elements like collecting cards to customize your game or new characters with new levels and story.\nHere this is just a copy of Metal Slug 3 with new menus, a online co-op and an artwork page.\n\nAnd Metal Slug 3 was annoying. Take all the previous opus and mix them to create a hardcore mess with no structure and balance. Critics in my country were quite bad if i remember.\n\nToo much enemies are over powerfull and appears at wrong times.\nFor exemple in the second level: you were blasting zombies, you take a strange passage to discover a cave full of snow men who launches at you 3 types of attacks with one capable to freeze you around 15 secs ... wtf ?!\n\nFor the story: of course you got the eternal X army with same soldiers and vehicles. They've added (again) aliens, zombies with new one likes insects, lobsters, carnivourous plants, robots, snowmans, ect.... so nothing special. Bosses are uggly like the metal crab in the first level or the robot in the third.\n\nThe order of the 6 levels is not relevant, for exemple at the end you will be in some kind of "organic zone" and after in a metal one with ennemies totally differents and ,again, overpowerfull.\nAs if they've just mixed everything in Metal Slug and threw it at our faces. In the same level you can even pilot copters, jets, submarines, ect... the real problem is , at this point of the game, the lack of quality because thoses very shorts sessions with vehicles are boring (except for the rocket).\nYou can use many junctions in levels but at the end it brings nothing but being unrelevant.\n\nI remember long minutes of fighting with the famous metal slug or with the camel in Metal Slug 2 ( for exemple: the boss of the first level was awesome, a sort of Sadam Hussein in an armored plane).\n\n\nWe had many occasions to laugh in Metal Slug. In the 2 you had a nice vision of the movie "Independance Day "  at the end of the game (thanks to X army's silly soldiers ^^). Metal Slug 1 and 2 were master pieces of this humour SNK have the secret.\nHere, it just have been forgotten (only the soldier in front of the rocket in the last level). There is just no way to laugh and enjoy the game.\n\nThe last mission is a joke because it lasts more than 2 previous levels ! Instead of cutting it they gave use a painfull big one.\n\nThe game is horribly difficult even in normal mod ! I played 100 minutes and i didn't finished the last level (20 continues were used in normal mode !).\n\nYou will say i'm just a "ranting" noob.\nTry to keep your weapons (with full ammo) when you got other weapons boucing all over your screen !!\nKeep in mind that swaping a weapon make you lost the previous amount of ammo and you will understand how painfull it is (especially the rocket moment).\n\nFor the graphics, i have to admit menus are nices like artworks ( btw some are very uggly like the "soldier with breasts").\nBut in game they've done nothing===> emulation !\n\n....\n\nWe pay for playing an emulated game ! Of course many people will say: "but we have online co-op !"\n\nI will answer: and ? Metal Slug was an arcade game for 2 players.\nSo there is nothing new... except the huge amount of bugs, sound problems and lack of controlers.\n\n\nThis game is a joke and i'm sorry for thoses who likes it because they deserve better.\nTry with an emulator of the 2 previous episode for free or buy other shooters ( like Intrusion 2, James Town, Jets and Guns, ect...).\nThere are many other interresting games were you can spend your 6 bucks.","December 30, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't say anything about the story or characters. But that's ok. I didn't need any explination to play the game. It just drops you right into the action.\n\nAt first I wasn't expecting much... and I died in the first 2 minutes or so ;D It has a very simple concept: "One hit,that's it,you're dead!". This game is HARD! Not AS hard as ,say, Ninja Gaiden... But it definatly has the difficulty of Megaman. A good thing is: You have unlimited Continues! And you'll always respawn right where you died. That alone makes the game possible for people like me,who aren't into hard games.\n\nThe graphic is so...so....Beautiful. It totally reminds me of the old SNES games and it is ,as mentioned before, hard as balls,wich kinda fits into the SNES libarary (Looking at games like Contra).It's very detailed (especially the Credits Screen!) wich makes it good to look at. The characters and weapons all look like real things and act this way (Yes,even the guns XD).\n\nThe Soundtrack is hard to categorize...I wouldn't say that the Soundtrack's bad... I just can't remember any of the Songs. IF I remember correctly, the soundtrack was pretty cool and fitting for the Stage/Boss!\n\nOh yeah,talking about bosses. This game has 5 Stages (Kinda remind me of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance). They aren't really that long (Exept for the last one) but they're ,still,Hard as balls. Evey Stage has a boss at the end of it. Every boss in this game is challenging and fun,exept for the last one!\n\n->Spoiler warning: Skip to the next arrow to skip this Spoiler!!!\n\nAfter you defeated the enemy organisations boss,it turns out that the real boss has been kidnapped and you were fighting an Alien instead.The character that you've used to finish that alien of will also be kidnapped by the aliens,making him unusable.You use a rocket and follow the aliens ship into space,enter it and destroy the machine that you character's kept in. This creates tons of "Zombieclones" of that character. I was expecting an epic final fight....Turn out that you "only" fight the alienboss,and you're almost unable to move without diyng. This was a fight that I was looking for,and sadly it turned out to me "Ok" at best.\n\n->No more Spoilers from this point on!\n\nAll in all,I would probably rate this game 8/10 Points. The music is hard to remember and the final boss is dissapointing. Eveything else is Great! You should definatly buy this game (Especially because it's only 1,25€ right now)\n\nWow,if you've made it to this point,let me just say thank you for reading my review!

That is not to say this game is bad, yet it definitely is not as good or as fun as it could have been.\n\nFirst off, the menu is archaic and slightly annoying. The whole interface is a little off: the game *clicks* every time you move your mouse over a button and an annoying voice actor shouts “OK” when you press a button on the main menu. This is slightly bothersome yet doesn't affect the game that much. It just shows how little extra effort was put into this port.\n\nWhen you get to the mode select, it gives you arcade and mission mode. Don't let this full you, both modes are identical except in mission mode you choose where you start. Once the game begins its your typical run n gun game with lots of enemies and lots of projectiles. The character controls well yet a few things like the inability to shoot diagonally can get annoying. The gameplay eventually gets repetitive with little new ideas or innovative level design between levels. Oh, and by the way you will die a lot...\n\nYet, on the default difficulty, this is one of the easiest games I have played in recent years. Why you might ask? Because there is literally no punishment for death. When you die you respawn in the exact same point and you have unlimited continues (I used 61) and all the enemies retain how much damage you gave them after continues and deaths. You could be terrible at this game and beat it. Yet, with the choices of different number of continues and different difficulty level the game can tailor to players with a variety of different experience levels. Though playing on limited continues makes you realize how unfair deaths and spawns can be as at points the game floods the screen with deadly objects that are nearly impossible to dodge (a double jump might have made the game seem fairer). The difficulty is a slight flaw of the game. The default difficulty should be slightly more difficult and make it possible for people to increase the number of continues.\n\nThis game has a few aspects that makes it stand out though. The pixel art is beautiful, the animation is incredible and it is very rewarding to see things explode. This game has some of the best pixel art ever and is a joy to look at. Also, the final level has some decent story and new mechanics (Space-esque shooter which is fun) thrown in even if that level is incredibly long and drawn out.\n\nOverall, this game is repetitive, has a relatively easy default difficulty, over-priced, unfair deaths and can be lacking in fun from time to time. That being said the game has great pixel art and decent gameplay. I would not recommend this game unless you LOVE pixel art or want some average retro run and gun action. If you can overlook some of my mentioned flaws, you could possibly really enjoy this game.\n\n5.9/10","November 20, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/driventodrug/recommended/250180/","driventodrug","devoted pizza pastor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/driventodrug/","24 products in account","Metal Slug 3 is a game that will push your reflexes to its limits. If you've ever played a run and gun game, you should know what to expect, lots of action packed, adrenaline pumping, brutally unforgiving gameplay that's loads of fun whether by yourself or with a friend. I've played multiple ports of this game, and sadly, this is one port I would not recommend, it's simply not up to par with other ports. The game is still the same fun and memorable Metal Slug 3 from the golden days of arcade gaming, but it's simply that, nothing more. No added content or extra bonuses. It plays relatively the same, and it looks and sounds absolutely beautiful, but there are some issues that may hinder your experience. At times, the game won't read your movements, causing you to die from something you couldn't avoid, a problem that was never present in other ports, the smooth, tight controls just aren't there. A few audio clips also suffer a bit of a downgrade which is sad seeing that this is a PC Port of a game almost 20 years old. If you're a fan of the game, or just someone looking for something new, fun and challenging, play this game, but not this port. It's fun, with lots of replayability, but for what it's worth, you get what you paid for.","August 19, 2014","false","7.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'm giving this a thumb down, because the game sucks.  The only people hyped about this game are those into garbage nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia.  The graphics are good, so I'll give it that.  But the controls suck, the enemies are too relentless, especially since everything kills you in one hit. Jumping is weird and laggy, as it turning and firing. There is literally no semblance of a plot.  Metal Slug III offers NOTHING enjoyable aside from nostalgia.  And unless you loved the game when it originally came out you have no reason to buy it.","July 13, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"
