"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tacet_/recommended/282800/","tacet_","Tacet_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tacet_/","161 products in account","Before I say anything, 10/10. If you have ever played and liked Mario Party, Fortune Street, Dokapon Kingdom, or any real or digital board game, this game should be given great consideration.\n\n100% Orange Juice goes into the long tradition of combining characters from different series by making them all into a single card game most recently done on Steam with Card City Nights or a board game most similarly done like Fortune Street. This game decided to do both. What I really enjoy about this game is that it is basically the first of its kind on Steam. It combines many core elements from Dokapon Kingdom like combat and different stats, Fortune Street for “promotions” and board control, and Mario Party for stars and the 3 item max system (no minigames unfortunately).\n\nThe main objective of this game is to get 5 normas. Normas are objectives that you need to achieve by either collecting stars or killing enemies. Once the objective is met, you need to land on an enemy orange or pass your own that you can automatically stop at even if you overroll. Each Norma will give you an additional level up star, from a start of 1, and caps at 5 for the 5th norma is victory. Higher stars mean you can use more powerful cards to help secure victory.\n\nA dice is rolled at the start of each turn. Like other games of its kind, you can also use applicable items at this time, which this game implements as cards. Each card, as mentioned earlier, does have a minimum level requirement, so overly strong cards will not come out till late game. Across the board are many spaces. Green draws a card, red fights an enemy, yellow gains stars based on roll after landing, blue drops stars based on roll after landing, purple warps to another purple, and the orange marker is each corresponding color’s base that can automatically stopped at to get a norma if it is your own or landed on for the same purpose if not your own and can be used to heal. There is also a grey space that does nothing :(.\n\nThe combat in this system is really reminiscent of Dokapon Kingdom. In this game you can choose to fight whenever you pass an enemy or have to fight when another player fights you or you land on a red space. Each player only gets to do one attack and one defend each encounter. You can use applicable cards before combat if you have any that apply. During combat, the main decider of things is how high you roll for an attack and what defensive stance you take. When defending you can either defend, which will reduce the attack into their roll minus your roll with a minimum of one, or you can evade, which will completely avoid the attack only if you roll higher than the opposing roll. There are also boss battles that sometimes occur on red spaces that drop a lot of stars. If you reach 0 hitpoints, you will have to roll a dice to revive. It requries a roll of 5 or higher and then goes does by one each turn you fail. You also lose half your stars upon death and these go to the oppoment if defeated by that person.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and you should strongly consider it. The only complaint one may have is this game contains a lot of pulp. Hours upon hours of "pulp".","May 16, 2014","true","350.4"," 279 of 317 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","279","317","0","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/recommended/282800/","Roserin","❤Roserin❤MissTaxi❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/","978 products in account","100% Orange Juice is an interesting board game that relies heavily on luck, which can complement or negate a player’s skill. The game has a vast array of characters, all drawn from games made by the publisher, Fruitbat Factory, and the developer, Orange_Juice.\n\nGameplayBefore you play the game, you must choose out cards which have a unique effect on the gameplay. Each player puts in 10 cards into a community deck, meaning that any cards put in have a chance of being used by any player (aside from the character’s special ability cards). Each character is balanced in some way so that it is not too powerful, having either raised or lowered stats, as well as a higher or lower hp based on their stats to help even the playing field. I always thought of this game as an anime Mario Party, except without the mini-games after each turn. At the end of the turns, there is a chance of a boss monster appearing, or a board effect (which are chosen before the game starts, or already stuck into effect in campaign), which can damage players, regenerate health, and various other things as well. Each tile has it’s own effect, which makes the game far more interesting, especially for players figuring the game out for the first time.\nVisuals and AudioThe game is very pleasing to the eye, where everything is so lively and colorful. The darker levels have a unique charm that contrast quite nicely with bright colored characters and tiles. The soundtrack is different for each level and compliments that level nicely, making each level have its own unique touch.\nMultiplayerMultiplayer is still alive and well even two years after release. From the games I joined, the community is relatively friendly and is still welcoming to new players that try to pick up the game. Some games within multiplayer can be shorter than others, but can range from around 45 minutes to well over an hour. This is where most people play, as it can be more enjoyable to chat and play with real players while you play than bots. The randomness makes it a big addiction for players, as you never know what will happen that round, nor how good your luck will be.\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nThis game will show you your friend’s true nature, and will test not only your luck, but also your ability to think ahead as well as your patience. Thankfully this game doesn’t have an in-game voice chat, or everyone would hear you scream when you keep getting low numbers.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator here.","April 9","true","26.8"," 129 of 131 people (98%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","98","129","131","14","12"

On this day, you may stumble apon a weird game called 100% Orange Juice. When presented with this title, the first thought through your mind will probably be : "Wat."\n\nDo not be alarmed, this is a normal reaction. It was my reaction, and the reaction of many others who would soon take the journey through Orange Juice together. A game that you buy as a joke, because it looks silly. A game that you continue playing after one match, because it looks interesting. A game that absorbs you, takes control of your gaming habits, and gives you the most fun boardgame experience of your life.\n\nThis is the story of 100% Orange Juice. A game about chibi-anime videogame characters that murder each other in cold blood to get stars and be the first to reach level 6. A game so heavily reliant on RNG that you will go from praising the lord RNGeezus to cursing all that is holy within a matter of seconds.\n\nThe game is repetitive, without a doubt. Each match has the same objective - collect stars or beat enemies, and land on a home space to level up. First person to do this five times wins the match. So what makes it so replayable, so enjoyable, so...citrus-y? The online mode, somehow. Playing with friends and strangers alike over the internet, with weird characters and a constantly changing goal in mind (thanks to the disgustingly RNG-reliant system for EVERYTHING) really makes this game one that you can play over and over without ever really getting tired of the concept. The game doesn't have many, if any bugs. The developers clearly care and add new content at a lively pace. The community is friendly, and the experience unique.\n\nA great experience that most videogame-enthusiasts should give a shot - especially for the low price of $6.\n9.5/10","January 21, 2015","true","250.8"," 140 of 154 people (91%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","91","140","154","49","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/282800/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","100% Orange Juice is a goal focused board game, played with charters from other popular anime games which have been released recently.  The game has been on Steam since mid 2013 and has an estimated 150k owners.\n\nThe rules of the game to begin with seem very overwhelming, dice are being rolled, characters are moving and you have no idea what is going on. I played/read the tutorial and this does help a bit to teach you the rules; but you will get more benefit out of just playing a game and learning as you go.  Each board/stage has various different squares, monster squares, pick up a card from the deck, teleport, coins, drops, and home. You roll a single D6 to move around the board. You have to complete 5 goals to win the game. The first goal that everyone starts each game with, is collect 10 coins.After you have completed this goal you then get to choose your following goals, you can continue hunting for coins, or you can switch to try kill a certain amount of monsters or players. My personal preference was to go for killing players as also drop goal too, meaning I could swap between the two goals to keep them as easy to accomplish as possible.\n\nThe graphics are generic anime style; although I watch a grand zero amount of anime, the art style does appeal to me. The cute sprites and levels are really colourful and are pleasing on the eye.\n\nI did struggle for the first few stages of the game with the difficulty; but this was probably because I was still learning the rules, but once you pass the second level you should be plain sailing, I would recommend you play the game on the highest speed setting as some stages can go on for upwards of 40+ turns.\n\nI finished the single player campaign with one character in just under four hours. Most of the gameplay and content for this game is to be found in the multiplayer mode; sadly I didn't see the option for a local multiplayer but you can certainly connect with friends online to play a round.\n\nI can happily recommend 100% Orange Juice; it will have a home in some people's libraries if they are a fan of board games, it is not a fast paced game so some people may not like it; but if you want an evening of sitting back in your chair rolling dice over a cute little board game, 100% Orange Juice will easily quench your thirst (I'm sorry for that horrible pun!)\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The "cards" are integrated into the gameplay in such a way that they benefit other players the same way they benefit you, so the trick to "deck building" is figuring out which cards are disproportionately favourable to your character.  As for the actual gameplay, there's a high amount of randomness involved but you have to learn how to play the odds.  This is far from just RNG, the game actually has a pretty high skill ceiling.\n\nIt's also really fun because no matter how good you are at it, there is enough randomness that everyone still has a pretty fair shot at taking you down.  Losing is rarely frustrating and usually hilarious, which is part of the charm of 4-player games.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, it's much more than just a Mario Party clone.

With that in mind, I was compelled to write a review for it.\n\n100% Orange Juice is a board game with characters from a number of Orange_Juice's other games like Suguri, QP Shooting, and Flying Red Barrel. It's a luck-based dice-rolling mayhem that's as entertaining as it is frustrating.\n\nPros:\n+ The art style is cute and makes for nice visuals, and there are some catchy tunes to go with it.\n+ The characters have different attributes and hyper cards that make the game fun and unique.\n+ The DLC/bonus characters have their own little niche yet do not make the game pay to win.\n+ Playing online is quick and easy and doesn't have very many problems. Disconnects happen, but they're rare.\n\nCons:\n- It's heavily RNG based. Everything runs on dice rolls - from collecting stars to attacking opponents - which means that very little skill is involved. This will be a turnoff for some, but it also makes for very entertaining matches.\n- Some rolls are rigged. This only applies to Tomomo's rolls in the last part of the campaign (where she is more likely to get 5's and 6's), but it is still a pain. Getting through the last chapters of the campaign (and Tomomo Hell) takes a long time as it is hard to defend against Tomomo's attacks or stop her from winning.\n- The game is hard to pick up. You'll probably want to read the guide first before actually playing as you're thrown into the game without being told what happens. This is a rather big flaw, but, if you're able to look past it, you can enjoy the game.\n\nTL;DR 100% Orange Juice has some flaws, but it's still worth getting if you've been wanting to play a fun board game with friends. If you don't like RNG-based games, then... this game is not for you.","May 23, 2015","true","419.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/282800/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","100% Orange JuiceShort Review Version\n\n\nWhat is 100% Orange Juice? 100%  Orange juice is a board game, despite the name. Yes its weird but considering what else this company have been pumping out the name does not come out as a surprise. Anyways back to the review.\n\n100% Orange Juice is a boardgame that decided dice are not being used enough and that RNG is fun therefor it has decided to combine those two in an unholy union. What this means is in the game you can go from no.1 with only 10 more stars needed and 1 block away from home only to have your game character get teleported to somewhere else to the map most likely right in front of your opponent eager to destroy you. Or that you activated the booster card so you can roll 2 dice at once only for the dice to be 1 1 respectively.\n\nSince this is a boardgame lets go with the gameplay first.\n\nGameplay~If there is a word for this game it is fun. On the chaotic scale. Here is the breakdown:\n\nChoose Map>Choose Character>Choose Card>Play>Win/Lose>Get Stars/Level Up>Buy Stuff>Repeat\n\nYou can choose from a lot of map each with different pattern and different booster locations, once you choose your map you can then play it without modifier for a vanilla but boring experience or turn on a maximum of 3 modifier each with their own unique effect such as teleport, random damage, and even landmine the map.\n\nNow onto the choose character screen. Now one thing I must mention is that there are a lot of character each with different stats but you start the game off with only a few with the rest requiring you to clear their story mode. Its not hard but does take some time. Once you choose your character you pick 10 different cards with different effects that will be shuffled into a deck along with all other player card choices then you are thrown into the map for gameplay with turn order being randomly decided.\n\nAs for the play itself it is rather simple. You collect a required amount of star or beat up a require number of people then roll dice to get back home to level up. Repeat 5 time with increasing number of star/defeated foe and you win the game but it is not that simple since other player also wants to win the game and the RNG cannot be appease.\n\nWhich is to say that you will most likely land on a trap card, get defeated by your opponent who have buffed themselves only 1 tile away from your home, landed on a suddenly appearing boss tile that will most definitely defeat you, or the classic old case of you losing to a chicken opponent after having landed on a encounter tile.\n\nWhen you stumble on a opponent you can choose to end your turn and fight them along with whatever tile they are currently standing on. The way battles are decided is that if any player have buff/debuff card you play that first then the attacker proceed to get first turn at attack by rolling a dice. The defender can then choose to reduce the damage by rolling defence or try to completely negate the damage by evading but failure will make them suffer the full damage without reduction. The character stats modifies the final roll. Once a player is KO or both player have attack the battle is dismiss. If you KO the enemy plus you get half of their total coin amount and if you get KO you must diceroll a number that either matches or exceed the one display or screen with failure to revive cause you to lose a turn but the required diceroll for revive will be reduce by 1. Do note battle can be use tactically such as battling the opponent at their home base so you will stop and level up there but if you happen to challenge them while they are on a boss tile the good luck my friend.\n\nThis continues with player using cards, hyper cards that are unique to each character with profound effects, laying traps, and beating/collecting star until you reach star level 6 which will make you the winner of the match.\n\nOnce the match is over the total points are calculated and exp/star are given to every player with exp unlocking stuff at the shop and star used to purchase stuff [cards, character, hair colour] at the shops. Then you can either repeat again or find another lobby to play in.\n\nOverall the experience is very enjoyable with the match being rather fast paced and minimum interaction needed but if you play with friends like what I did you can have an even more enjoyable time trash talking each other and generally doing stuff friends would do. The randomness of every match means that the game gets bored rather slowly but with more boards and character DLC that were release it does shake up the overall game a little bit more.\n\nAlso despite being a multiplayer focus game it does have bots so you don't have to worry about empty lobbies since you can just invite 1 friend and start immediately. They can be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though.\n\nOption Menu & ControlsOrange Juice custome engine support a rather bare bone option menu.\nIt has the bare essential of resolution support, sound control, fullscreen option and a few other minor things.\nNo disability option here sadly. And yes it runs at 60 fps in case you ever needed this info.\n\nThe game plays entirely using the mouse with the keyboard only use if you ever want to chat. So its 1 handed friendly and with the sound cue that plays when its your turn you can minimize the game and do a little work while you wait your turn. Not recommended though.\n\nSoundEach character has their own theme song that plays whenever you level up and they are pretty good while the overall sound direction itself has neither pro nor con. You can always mute it and play your own song if you want.\n\nGraphicsIts 2D animate sprite that bounces with a bare minimal animated background. What you see is what you get.\n\nConclusionA fun little boardgame that does well with its focus on RNG being the factor on everything. Good game length and fun with friends plus it really has a solid gameplay means you can pick and play it with friends at your leisure. In fact I actually manage to clock 23 hours into this game without realizing it and that is value enough for me.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank - A very good boardgame.\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/282800/","October 15, 2015","true","33.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","5"

The game's assets are not triple A material by any means, but is well polished and works great. The characters, cards, maps, bgm, sound effects, etc are all endearing and very enjoyable.\n\nI had so much fun playing this game. So so so much fun. But now all my friends are dead, or have left me in disgust. This game does terrible things to people. At first, the malice that takes root in your heart is nothing but the result of a natural competitive drive. It grows within you, and as the finish line approaches, it whispers at you words of betrayal, sabotage, and subversion. We've all felt it before, using ghosts to steal stars in a certain party game, or using blood drenched shells to topple your friends in a kart racing game... but it is nothing compared to the devilish desire for victory that 100% Orange Juice instills upon your fragile mind.\n\nYou would see your former comrades burn and wither away, just for the sake of attain glorious norma. They will cry in agony, beg and pray, to cease your ascension to the 6th level of corruption BUT NAY, YOU HEED NO WORDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO DARED CHALLENGE YOU AT 100% ORANGE JUICE, THEIR LAST ATTEMPTS AT APPEALING TO YOUR SENSE OF PITY LANDS NAUGHT ON YOU NOR THE RNG GODS, FOR YOU ARE A WINNER, BAKSING IN THOSE RAINBOW LETTERS, YOU CELEBRATE UPON THE CORPSES YOU'VE TRAMPLED UPON.\n\nBut only once the euphoric high wears off and your adrenaline clears... only then do you realize your mistakes. The carnage left behind. This game. It will leave your friends list empty. I have to start over from scratch now, as if I were a trasnfer student at an oriental high school. And never, will I ever recommend playing 100% Orange Juice with them.","June 20, 2014","false","34.5"," 233 of 397 people (59%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","59","233","397","32","13"

I can't even get sexually excited anymore without picturing that sweet, tender Bonusu, adding stars to my collection with every graceful roll of the dice.

Many of the Characters are equal in strenghts and weakness- not that it will help you especially much though since it all comes down the cards you have! (And your luck) But using cards definetly boosts your chances! I recommend this game since i think it's a fun thing to play with your friends and just throw together a 100% orange juice party! This game is suitable for almost anyone since it has it's unique gaming mode and therefore make it alot more fun! One thing i miss about the mutiplayer is that there's no in game chat! otherwise 10/10 game!","July 1, 2014","true","82.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iridium077/recommended/282800/","iridium077","Sora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iridium077/","112 products in account","This is a board game. Don't go in expecting anything else. Consquently, the game is mostly centered around luck (with a small amount of skill involved) and the single-player is, at its best, an overly long tutorial on why you should hate Poppo. Before you purchase, make sure you understand all of this.\n\nWith that disclaimer out of the way, I would like to say that this is one of the best-designed games released in the last couple years.  If you can find a few friends to play with, or look into the (reasonably active!) community, you'll find quite a bit to love in this game. The mechanics are everything that they need to be, the soundtrack is top-notch where it matters (unless you main Marc or Poppo), and if you're trying to experience everything the game has to offer, you'll actually be here for quite a while.\n\nThe gameplay, while leaving you constantly at the mercy of the RNG, is just as likely to screw over anyone else. In single-player, that can get tiresome, but once you've started playing multiplayer, that's all part of the fun. Life is short and so are individual games. You might lose one round to a crappy defend role, and you might win the next because of a lucky six. With the overall speed at which a game can be completed, it's all part of the fun. You're rewarded almost equally regardless of whether you win or lose, so don't get too caught up with all of that - just relax and let the dice craft wonderful webs of agony while you and your friends suffer in succession. All in all, it's one of the few multiplayer games I can consistently say that I have fun playing. And since this is a game, that's the important thing, isn't it?\n\nThat might not sell the game to you. It should, but it might not. And if it doesn't, then I'd like you to take a look at the update history for a moment. For this obscure $7 board game with a cast that's virtually unknown in the west, Fruitbat Factory has done the most stellar job of supporting a game post-release that I've ever seen. Not only have they added characters and maps to a small-name game released in 2009, but they actively look at user feedback and have introduced countless new features by popular demand, such as in-game chat and online avatars. In an era where publishers are eager to throw crap out the door at the first opportunity, I'm simply astounded at the work they've put into perfecting this little boardgame - for over a year and counting, now.\n\nI have to wonder how Orange Juice feels. Perhaps they're amused at how their shooting-game characters are possibly best-known in the west as characters from a board game? Maybe so. They should be very pleased with themselves, though - they, along with the publisher that they've partnered with, have become one of the most brilliant examples of what the game industry could be in an ideal world. Rather than looking for new ways to milk their audience, they've been constantly at work improving this game from a simple tribute project to what is probably my favorite game that I played last year, and it's only getting better from here as they find more and more ways to add to the game.\n\nWell, that's my two cents. Do you want an interesting and entertaining (but largely stress-free) multiplayer experience? Do you want to watch anime girls, shirtless men, and seagulls beat the daylights out of each other? Do you want to be a part of one of the best developer-user communities I've seen in a long time? If you answered yes to any of those questions, why not make like Yuki and make a gamble? We're always looking for new people to play!","January 15, 2015","true","380.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/282800/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","100% Orange Juice is a board game developed by Orange Juice, starring the characters from their games (such as Sora, Suguri or QP Shooting) in one big crossover battle, with four players fighting against each other (or... avoiding confrontation to just accomplish the objective in peace while everyone else is out for blood) to complete "normas" and gain levels until someone achieves level five and wins the game.\n\nThe players take turns to use cards, roll dice, move around the board, and either attack other players, or interact with the tile they landed on. The main goal is to complete "normas" to level up (which gives you more stars per turn, as well as the ability to use stronger cards) via either stars or combat wins, decided whenever you level up. The main goal is to achieve norma level 5 before the other players do.\n\nSince this is a board game, RNG has a lot of impact here, deciding everything from moving to fights. Those who aren't blessed by the Random Number God should be aware about the kind of sadistic pain this game might inflict upon you. I personally suggest not taking it too seriously - it's a party game, after all. Because of that, it's best played with friends, both for laughs and the fact that single player campaign, while having rather hilarious dialogues, feels as if the CPU players were cheating (and the final boss does actually cheat). Unfortunately you have to beat your starter's campaign to be able to gain access to majority of the other playable characters as well as other starters and their campaigns. And that's nothing in comparison to Tomomo Hell and unlocking the playable version of the final boss.\n\nThe game also has, surprisingly, a ton of replayability. Every match with your friends is gonna look different. There are sixteen different boards to play on, and almost twenty different characters to play as (not counting the DLC characters that come out every now and then to keep the game fresh), each one possessing their own stats, strengths, weaknesses, gimmicks, and (the humanoid ones at least) their own unique Hyper card. Outside of those, there is also another forty or so different cards to use (with around ten more as DLC). While the final outcome is inevitably mostly thanks to RNG, you can vary your playstyle anywhere between passive and aggressive, as well as using character gimmicks to your advantage. Also, you gain experience and stars (currency for the in-game shop) to unlock and buy cosmetics, new characters, new cards, and other things.\n\nIn aesthetical department, all characters look different, most of them obviously swinging towards the "cute" side. The little sprite animations they make in different situations (winning, getting KO'd etc.) are also pretty hilarious to watch.\nMeanwhile, the music seems to be mostly borrowed from other doujin games (I personally have recognized one piece), but it's a rather varied selection overall, with some rather catchy tunes.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, even if frustrating at times, and is very addictive when playing together with friends or complete strangers. I can recommend it to anyone who has a thing for board games, or just having a good time with people you know.","January 4","true","68.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

You go around a board, roll dice, collect cards, and beat up monsters or other players/AI. The AI cheats a good bit and there is a reasonable sized campaign mode because of that and the time it can take to potentially beat just one campaign. Over-all, the game is good, but the bots are ridiculously unbalanced sometimes & it can kind of ruin the game. Lots of card decks you can build around your particular play-style making for a unique game-play each time especially online. It's a great novelty game and well worth the cost even not on sale. I wish there was a bit more unique strages, but for the $0.50 I ended up paying for it, i'm not complaining. Enjoyed every minute of it and plan on playing for many more hours to come. Be warned online when joining with too high of a level people, they tend to use some pretty OP cards so make sure your deck can handle a wide variety of strategies! Turbo mode is included for the campaign modes making games go by quickly and it's a great casual game you can leave open and do other stuff in while waiting for your next turn when it comes to online play.\n\nTLDR:Asian Mario Party, complete with turbo mode & cards dealing various status elements. It was mathematically a good investment as I got pretty much all my money back on cards for what I paid for it. I R mean no offense, but it was the easiest way for me to explain this game. It's a lot of fun! It's intense, and has weird voices that are fitting of these types of games :P","August 6, 2014","true","318.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

A game where your luck comes from the roll of the dice with a little stratergy thrown in. You play as one of a few characters (which are based on level/experience) and inbetween each round you get a little story before the main event. You begin by clicking the left mouse button which rolls an ai dice and you can move as many paces, occasionaly picking which way to turn and continue your run. The goal? One of two choices, either collect stars or defeat monsters and other characters. The fighting is decided by the same click of the mouse and can be boosted by cards (if you have any) that have been picked up around the level.Each goal must be handed in at a spawning point but with members using trap cards, monsters including bosses, transporting squares and those that make you drop stars you can be assured that this game is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nYou can also buy items to help your game play (such as booster cards) and the more you advance in level you are the more you can buy. When I say buy I mean via stars you have collected, not with real currency like some other games do. For such a cheap price this is a great game and it offers great entertainment value. I know I will be suggesting it next time my brothers in law come to town. :)","July 10, 2014","true","40.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

While it may take a game or two to fully grasp everything, it’s fairly simple, but also fairly brutal. Four players are placed on a board and must roll a die or dice to move forward either playing passively, trying to quietly and quickly obtain as many stars as you can, or aggressively, out for blood and attacking enemy spaces and opponents around every corner. The way the game challenges you to choose and alternate these styles of gameplay is what makes 100% Orange Juice an excellent game, as the player must be apprehensive in the face of the unfortunate circumstance where your strategy, and the world itself, has seemingly failed you.Different play styles offer a nice variety to how you approach your imminent destruction. I say imminent destruction because this game is hard as all hell. One big drawback is the intensity the computer AI is set to by default. With some other settings, the average player can ease into the game much more easily. As a result of its default difficulty, 100% Orange Juice can be soul-crushing.Gameplay aside though, 100% Orange Juice has a very nice and clean presentation. Considering all the lunacy going about, its effects are fairly minimal, and it’s probably better that way. 100% Orange Juice is far from perfect, but it’s still an exceptional virtual board game that really pushes your buttons. With some tweaks to the formula, specifically changeable difficulties, more consistent stage design, and some tweaks to the general presentation to help make the on-screen madness a bit more legible, 100% Orange Juice could really pick up speed with a phenomenal little series of board game titles.

This is likely the case with 100% Orange Juice, even if the primarily response is confusion. After all, it sounds more like the description of a drink than any game!

You’ll just have to spend a bit of time learning about its rules to truly enjoy it.\n\nThe name of the game is 100% Orange Juice. Why? I don’t care, and I don’t think the game does either. The strange name is only the beginning, however, of the bizarre realm of 100% Orange Juice. Because I can’t pass up the opportunity to make a citrus joke here, the game is definitely sweet, but at times can appear very sour. In fact, I am pretty sure this game hates me.\n\n100% Orange Juice is, at its essence, a simple board game. While it may take a game or two to fully grasp everything, it’s fairly simple, but also fairly brutal.

This is likely the case with 100% Orange Juice, even if the primarily response is confusion. After all, it sounds more like the description of a drink than any game! But 100% Orange Juice is very much a game and quite the fun one at that. You’ll just have to spend a bit of time learning about its rules to truly enjoy it.\n\nThe name of the game is 100% Orange Juice. Why? I don’t care, and I don’t think the game does either. The strange name is only the beginning, however, of the bizarre realm of 100% Orange Juice. Because I can’t pass up the opportunity to make a citrus joke here, the game is definitely sweet, but at times can appear very sour. In fact, I am pretty sure this game hates me.\n\n100% Orange Juice is, at its essence, a simple board game. While it may take a game or two to fully grasp everything, it’s fairly simple, but also fairly brutal. Four players are placed on a board and must roll a die or dice to move forward either playing passively, trying to quietly and quickly obtain as many stars as you can, or aggressively, out for blood and attacking enemy spaces and opponents around every corner. The way the game challenges you to choose and alternate these styles of gameplay is what makes 100% Orange Juice an excellent game, as the player must be apprehensive in the face of the unfortunate circumstance where your strategy, and the world itself, has seemingly failed you.\n\n100% Orange Juice is far from perfect, but it’s still an exceptional virtual board game that really pushes your buttons. With some tweaks to the formula, specifically changeable difficulties, more consistent stage design, and some tweaks to the general presentation to help make the on-screen madness a bit more legible, 100% Orange Juice could really pick up speed with a phenomenal little series of board game titles. All the elements are there: charm, strategy, and madness.","June 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Do you like watching your strategy absolutely dissolve in the face of a RNG that exists only to screw you over?\n\nThis is the game for you. It's basically Mario Party without the minigames and with even more frustration.\n\nWith a campaign mode and a free-play mode, there are plenty of ways to increase your blood pressure tenfold. The campaign loosely follows little stories of each of the characters who are all pretty endearing. The difficulty increases a bit each time with the people you face, culminating in a boss that leaves you crying on the floor and screaming into a pillow.\n\nThere are numerous characters you can play as, each with different stats and their own advantages and disadvantages. These stats help a bit to make the RNG more in your favor when it comes to battles by increasing or decreasing your rolls. The stats can be augmented before battle with cards as well, adding some strategy to it all.\n\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth it. You will probably get angry and lose friends if you play with them, but that's just a part of life. You'll get over it, eventually.","January 11, 2015","true","69.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

Usually when I buy random games, I don't read up on them too much, just to be surprised, so I was indeed surprised to find it was a cutesy board game with more RNG than *insert Hearthstone bash here*. It reminds me of the old Mario Party games - you can be winning by a mile all game, but someone might still steal all your stars at the last moment and you'll take last place. If you play with friends, it's nonstop laughter at each other's expense. My experiences with the online community have been fantastic as well, very friendly banter and responses all game long.

If not, you may not want to buy it... Maybe. Try it if you can.\n\n100% Orange Juice is the 5 year anniversary game of Japanese Indie game developer Orange_Juice, starring some of their hit characters from Suguri, Sora, QP Shooting, and Flying Red Barrel - Diary of a Little Aviator. Now, you might be asking "WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE GAMES!?" and to that I answer that they're Indie and Japanese, and you need to know nothing about the characters to enjoy this game. If anything, this game is the gateway game to try out the rest of Orage_Juice's catalogue here on Steam!\n\nGeneral Overview\nBefore each game, you can choose a character and what cards you want in the deck each game. At the start of each game, everyone starts at their own home, with a single star and card. You play by completing Norma, which are objectives. Each game starts with every player needing to collect 10 stars, but you can choose to change it after you get 10 stars. You can choose to collect stars or battle for wins to achieve the set Norma. Once you collect the number of stars or wins, you must land on a home, which you can stop at whenever you pass it, or land on someone else's home in order to achieve the Norma. The first player to complete 5 Norma wins. In addition, the cards you choose can be randomly drawn out the deck at certain times, such as landing on a green space. There are many different types of cards, though for the sake of time, I'll say that you need a certain level to use each, and some cost a certain amount of stars, and the types are Trap, Boost, Event, Combat and Hyper, Hyper being the card exclusive to the character you are currently playing as. Though it sounds like there is a huge learning curve, it's quick and easy to learn it all.\n\nPros\n- A very pleasing artstyle\n- Great music, ranging from soft, windy music to techno dance beats\n- A very alive and well multiplayer community in which almost everyone is a nice person\n- A board, card, and turn based combat hybrid game that somehow blends perfectly\n- Never the same gameplay. There will be constants, but the RNG makes it so that anything can happen at any moment.\n- A singleplayer campaign that's pretty fun\n- Tons of unlockables and achievements for those who love to chase that 100% completion.\n- Difficulty rivaling that of Dark Souls, Touhou, and Super Meat Boy\n- Gameplay customization with what cards appear in every game\n- Continually being updated with balances and bug fixes\n- Tons of characters in vanilla, and even more being added with DLC\n- You can make your own (temporary) server and customize it to play with friends or strangers\n- There's a demo available, though I have no idea if it accurately reflects the full game\n- There is no broken card or broken character (though if the RNG is 100% on your side, you can invoke that)\n- An in-game chat system\n\nCons\n- Most of the game is RNG based, which means that you can add strategy, but it's mostly up to luck.\n- The difficulty is more the cause of RNG than actually skill\n- Some DLC characters are locked behind purchasing other games\n- Getting new cards is also dictated by RNG, meaning that you'll most likely get every common card before you can get some of the rarer cards\n- Most achievements are only gotten by luck, and some unlockables need considerable online point grinding\n- The servers can range from stable to broken\n- There are no official servers, so you'll have to rely on someone joining your game or you finding a public game\n\nNitpicks (That May Detract From Your Overall Enjoyment)\n- The music can get repetitive, and some songs suffer from this badly, especially in a long game\n- Some games last a long time and others are way too short\n- The AI in campaign mode can be extra cheap sometimes, especially Poppo\n- Nonexistant controller support unless you use a Steam Controller, and even then it kinda sucks\n\nConclusion\nIt's like a Mario Party and Monopoly hybrid, except 100% more luck based. The RNG might sit bad in some mouths, but it's an enjoyable game overall and definetly worth taking a look at. Just make sure to take yoga classes so that you don't smash a monitor when player 3 plays Poppo and somehow manages to never get hit or touch a trap because of RNG. I also recommend getting some buddies to suffer with you, but make sure they're the type of people who'd stay your friend even if you began taking a rusty spoon and used it to stab their back repeatedly. Also, the community artwork is 100% memes and good art, and it is beautiful. Overall, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10.","June 1","true","66.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The characters and sounds and the colors are all sugary sweet and adorable. The gameplay, on the other hand, will take a bite out of you! It's hard! Not hard in a bad way, just hard in that the computer characters will do everything they can to beat the living tar out of you AND everything is pretty much based on a roll of the dice. You can use cards to help you out, and buy upgrades from an in-game shop with the stars you earn while playing Campaign mode or Free mode.\n\nAnd then, there is the Lobby online mode thing!!

It's like Mario Party (a dice board game) but without the mini-games, and instead added the element of Cards (like items but with multiple uses) and the element of constant battles. The battles are simple and a double-edged sword. When you pass someone you get to choose whether to just pass by them and continue along, or fight them and regardless of win or lose, you stay on the space they were on.\n\nIn a battle, the attacker/approacher rolls 1st to determine his bonus attack added to his base attack. The person being attack is put in defense mode and chooses either to roll for bonus DEFENCE or bonus EVADE points. Defense just reduces the damage based on the roll but always guarantee you take one damage. Evade is a hit-or-miss. If you have MORE points than the attacker, you dodge all the damage. If you have less, you receive ALL the damage.\n\nNow here's the double-edged part.\nIf they failed to kill you (or even damage you), it becomes YOUR turn to ATTACK. You have the possibility to damage them or even KO them for attacking you. If you win/lose a battle, you gain a lot of the opponents stars (I think you take half) which are used for leveling up (reaching Lv.6 is the objective for winning the game) and are also used for the cost of playing cards.\n\nTo level up and reach Lv.6 to win the game, you must reach the "Norma" (better known as "The Objective".)\nThere are 2 ways:\nThe 1st level up is the same for everyone, gain 10 stars. After that you have the option of doing "Collect X star" OR "Defeat X enemies." Once you achieved the "Norma", you must LAND on a "Check Panel." If you reached the Norma, you will level up and then get to decide which Norma objective you would like to do next to level up (Collect Stars or Defeat Enemies). Everyone has a "Home Check Panel" on the board. YOUR home check panel gives you the option of stopping on it regardless of your dice roll. It heals you 1 HP if you decide to stay on it.\n\nOverall, this game gets 9/10 for me.\n\nReally fun game, amazing with friends, and games can be short or long depending on whether or not the dice decides to be an asshat or not.","May 17, 2014","true","61.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This game packed with vitamin C goodness is definitely worth every penny.\n\nThe game is heavily RNG-based, yet fairly balanced (unless you're playing against "extreme" difficulty AIs, in which you are gonna get rekt no matter how).\nThough that's not to say there is completely no skill involved, there's plenty of difficult decision-making, as well as cards and characters to familiarise yourself with. Reading your opponent as well as calculating probability are both important too.\nThe best way to learn the game is to just play it and ask others questions along the way, so far IMO the community is pretty nice and given the way this game works, it doesn't really make much sense to rage at others most of the time (you'd just feel defeated when you realize your luck just sucks balls).\n\nBut once you've learned the ropes, the game gets addicting real quick, and before you know it - you'd be drinking orange juice everyday!","January 4","true","66.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

This insane mixture of a game is simple,  yet one of the best games on Steam I have spent money on.  The art style took some getting used to, and probably deters many a would-be buyer, but as a board sim, it shines in the department of sometimes giving outgunned players a chance to turn things around unlike most popular games.

This game packed with vitamin C goodness is definitely worth every penny.\n\nThe game is heavily RNG-based, yet fairly balanced (unless you're playing against "extreme" difficulty AIs, in which you are gonna get rekt no matter how).\nThough that's not to say there is completely no skill involved, there's plenty of difficult decision-making, as well as cards and characters to familiarise yourself with. Reading your opponent as well as calculating probability are both important too.\nThe best way to learn the game is to just play it and ask others questions along the way, so far IMO the community is pretty nice and given the way this game works, it doesn't really make much sense to rage at others most of the time (you'd just feel defeated when you realize your luck just sucks balls).\n\nBut once you've learned the ropes, the game gets addicting real quick, and before you know it - you'd be drinking orange juice everyday!","January 4","true","66.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/282800/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1158 products in account","This game already has tons of positive reviews and hardly needs mine to be shown as a success. But I've sunk over 400 hours into it and I'm sure many, many more will come in the future. As such, I feel obligated to give another thumbs up here. Plus, I just want to talk about how much I enjoy it.\n\n100% Orange Juice is a mash-up of several Orange Juice game characters in a board game setting, along with a couple of made-for-this-game ones. Before playing this, I only knew of Sora, and only because I had heard the soundtrack from her game. So this is coming from someone who was totally exposed to Orange Juice games because of this one.\n\nYou can get this for single player use. Campaign modes exist, five in all, and if I were to get the game just to play those, I would consider it a worthwhile purchase. That being said, campaign mode severely suffers for one major reason: the AI cheats. I don't mean that in an "I get so unlucky that it feels like they're always doing well" way. The game's code has shown that difficulty levels going up causes it to be more likely that the AI will get the rolls they need. This is artificial difficulty at its finest, and if that was not a part of this game, I would have nothing else to complain about.\n\nHowever, multiplayer is where 100% Orange Juice shines. There the luck is truly random (no matter how you might feel otherwise), both for players and any AI you have filling in the slots. Lag is almost nonexistant from my experiences, and it is very easy to link up with friends to play. There is a lot of hilarity to be had, and I have gotten so many hours put into this game simply because it is so much fun with other players.\n\nThere are a variety of boards, almost all of which are fun for different reasons (I loathe Farm, but that's the only exception for me). The cards used in the game are of a good variety, and since each player contributes ten cards, it makes for a good mix. Most impressive is the character balance. Yes, there are tier debates, and yes, some characters are simply better in some ways than others. But overall, it is a game where you can win with any character, with all of them having their own strengths, weaknesses, and powers.\n\nDLCs usually give more characters, with one giving more cards. DLCs tend to be a pain in the rear end for most games. Here, I like them. They are not expensive at all, the characters given are great, and it shows how the developers are still helping the game evolve. They are released at wonderful intervals, waiting just long enough so players can go, "Okay, I've had a lot of fun with these characters. Are there any more coming? I'm ready to try someone else." Falling back on old favorites is enjoyable too. I personally use Saki, Krila, and Alte as my top three, and while I love playing with new characters, it feels great to go back to them as well.\n\nSpeaking of the developers, they are constantly working to improve this game. When balance issues are brought up, they work to make small changes that keep the characters closer in varying strengths to one another. They release new maps as free content. They give out holiday specials that you can earn simply through playing. Their other games have bonus characters that are not necessary for here, but really nice for those who support said games. And perhaps most importantly, the developers are constantly asking how to improve 100% Orange Juice, and watching the discussions to weigh in when needed. This type of devotion is something a lot more games could use, and it really shines here.\n\nAs this is a Steam game, I feel obligated to remark on achievements and trading cards. The achievements are, for the most part, reasonable and fun to collect. The ones that were frustrating have been toned down by the developers, which I think is a wise move. The trading cards are quite cute. I cashed them in for a badge and have enjoyed the wallpaper and emoticon I got as a result.\n\nTo wrap up, here are some various comments. The art is adorable and the sprites are great. The music is fantastic (for the most part; I still am a bit meh on three or so character themes, but out of the vast number of characters, that is a very small amount). The methods of winning make for a fun mix. The learning curve is very nice; I played one game and then knew enough to go through the rest of the game. I have never experienced any glitches with it. The price is ridiculously cheap for how good it is, and getting it on sale makes it an absolute steal. It does come in bundles, but I wouldn't bother waiting for those if you want it, unless you are particularly stingy or uncertain if it is your type of game.\n\nSo yes. I highly recommend 100% Orange Juice. If anyone wants to have a game, I'll be around and ready to play!","January 31","true","450.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game can be a bit confusing at first, and while there are guides you can read, I highly recommend just jumping into a game and talking to people.  The community is awesome, so don't be afraid to ask questions!  When I first started playing, I had no idea what was going on, but then I met some amazing people that really helped me out big time, explaining some strategies and how different cards work.  There are a couple bad apples here and there, but by and large, the community in 100% Orange Juice is very friendly, likes to joke around, have fun, and commiserate when we roll a 1 at the worst possible time or teleport away from home right when we thought we were going to win the game.\n\nBasically, the goal is to accumulate as many stars or wins as you can during the game.  Each time you step on a home with enough stars or wins, you will gain another "norma," which lets you use more powerful cards.  There is definitely some strategy involved depending on the character you choose.  Try to pick cards that suit your character's strengths and avoid cards that don't.  A little basic knowledge of probability helps but isn't required.  Also,  pray to the Orange Juice gods and goddesses.  Luck is a huge element of this game, so you will want divine intervention on your side!\n\nCampaign mode can be a little frustrating if you don't know what you're doing, which is why I recommend getting some tips from other players first, but it's also required to unlock most of the non-DLC characters.  This is one of my only real complaints about the game.  It can be kind of unclear how to unlock the characters you want.  When I was starting out, it felt like it took forever to get my favorite characters that I saw my friends using in multiplayer.  If you stick with it through campaign mode, they'll all eventually become available in the store though.\n\nThat said, the nice thing about campaign mode is that the story is *incredibly adorable.*  The dialogue in all of the campaigns puts a smile on my face every time, and the characters have very expressive animations.  Personally, I recommend Marc and QP's campaigns for maximum cuteness, but all 4 have nice stories.  Red Barrel all the way!\n\nMost importantly, don't sweat the small stuff.  For every bad roll you get, eventually you'll get an amazing roll to put the smile back on your face.  Meet new people, relax, and have fun.","July 22, 2015","true","292.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Engaging gameplay, and a campaign mode. Plenty of unlockables. Most people on my friend list have it back from when it had a wildly-popular stint, meaning there is no shortage of players I know. There also appears to be plenty of online matches whenever I get on.\n\nCONS: The sounds are repeated ad nauseum, and the graphics are infuriating. I'd offer my own graphics for free if it meant seeing tokens that are a little more lively. I get that they're supposed to be board pieces, but the way they've gone about it looks really bad. There are also plenty of people playing it, but they all appear to be hardcore players of this game, making their play-style much faster and impatient for yours.\n\nOVERALL:  I don't know why people keep calling this a steam "Mario Party," it has virtually nothing in common with that series. However, it IS one of the only online multiplayer board games available right now, so it's filling a niche and it's doing it well.\n\nSCORE: 7/10","March 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It does not have minigames (like in Mario Party), so it is pretty much based on luck (which I don't have, hehe) and strategy.

This board game however? Very nice.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to grasp and if you actually read the guide (which I didn't do at first) you pick up on the remaining details that you may have missed. The graphics are cute, and the tunes are very nice too. At it's core is the luck based dice rolling, though you can better influence the board with cards. There's an in-game card collection feature, which lets you get more cards to more consistantly rig your luck/ruin other people's days. But even when you're rolling 2 dice to move, dodge, attack... etc you can still roll just right to ruin/delay your win. And then again next turn.\n\nThere's a wide variety of characters to play with, you wont be limited to just playing the one you pick at the beginning in mutliplayer (not sure how the difficulty described with those four actually relates though). You can unlock more cute (and fun characters) just by playing the campaign AND/OR you can buy through DLC. I'm fond of the fact that DLC characters aren't automatically far better than any standard characters. Regardless of DLC or not, sometimes map events will make winning with a character maybe a little harder than you'd expect (Aru and a map with Charity for example).","June 20, 2015","true","44.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","1"

This game is brilliant.  It combines dice rolling and battles in a neat little package that delivers hours of fun for you and friends or random strangers playing this game.\n\npros\n- Marie Poppo\n- nice cast of characters to choose from\n- worth the money for DLC content and great pricing (it also goes on sale from time to time)\n- Poppopopopopopopopo!\n- currency system to buy in-game cards and other character custom colors, bosses and regular NPC enemies as playable characters (so release the inner chicken in you and fight the others!)\n- unique character attributes and specials\n- Did I mention Marie Poppo?\n- story mode available to get used to the game and unlock other characters\n- map variety\n- build a deck of 10 cards to throw into the mix of other player's cards\n- cards from the mixed pack DLC can be used by people who don't own the DLC as long as the cards are put in by a person who owns the DLC\n- Seriously, Marie Poppo!\n\ncons\n- not all characters are given to you out the box\n- the only way to earn levels is to play online games\n- maps also must be purchased and unlocked based on level\n- character colors also need to be purchased or earned while playing the game (not entirely bad though)\n- you MUST buy card packs to get new cards\n- some of the items can get expensive\n- playing AGAINST Marie Poppo\n- DLC for new characters and a new card pack set (however, the price per DLC is pretty inexpensive, so this is a minor con)\n\nGameplay is pretty straight forward and easy to understand.\nThe graphics are colorful, especially for a board game, and do their job.\nThe music is extrodinary, as every character has a set theme song associated with themselves.  Each player who completes a norma (objective) gets their music played for everyone to hear.\nAs I said before, the replay value is pretty high, as you can play against people online and every game is different with the differnt customizable decks you can make and use.  I will say this: the single-player storymode might seem a little unfair with the AI and RNG, but nonetheless, it's beatable.  Sometimes, the RNG can be extremely evil (rolling nothing but 1s or using a certain card that has an effect that ends on a KO and rolling nothing but low numbers (or in the case of one of my games I've played online, 3s).\n\nIn conclusion, those of you who love a good multiplayer game without being too serious should definitely check this one out.  It's fun for just about everyone, and the hilarity of screwing over your opponents with just the right card is most satisfying.\n\noverall rating: 9.5/10 would Poppo all day","December 31, 2014","true","87.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can also have a max of 3 cards in your hand that you can use. Each card has a different cost and effect and you'll see by playing how they work. You compete against 3 other people or CPU and the quests are either to win battles or have a certain amount of stars. Either way, you need to get 5 completed before your opponents do to win.\n\nI'm still not exactly sure what orange juice has to do with this game but that aside the game is actually pretty fun. I started the campaign without knowing the rules or how to play at all, and it took me 1.5 games to pretty much learn everything just by playing. With that being said, the game's rules are simple enough to get used to quickly and there are more multiplayer lobbies than you'd expect. By winning games you can also get points which you can spend in the games store to buy custimizations, card packs, characters, etc.\n\nOverall, 100% Orange Juice is a casual little game that I would recommend to anyone if the price drops under $5.\n\nRating: 7.7/10\nRecommend Price: Under $5","March 20","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The game offers 18 unlockable characters and 6 dlc characters along with quite a few playable bosses. Each character has different stats and plays differently, so mastering each character or only a few will last the player a long while in singleplayer or multiplayer. The story missions are quite hard, but the fast forward feature makes it faster and easier than is expected. The player can unlock characters, skins, and cards to play in the shop. There are many cards to unlock as well, so building a deck and choosing cards is a big part of winning games. My only complaint is that all characters must be unlocked via story mode, making the multiplayer less playable until the story is completed. One of my favorite indie games and I plan to play it for a long while.","June 9, 2015","true","74.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And I use the term strategy loosely, you will depend on luck... ALOT. Seriously, I mean, ALOT. You could be right about to win and just constantly keep getting the worst rolls until someone else catches up and wins ahead of you. You could get stunned for turns on end because every 'Random KO' card that keeps getting played lands right on you for no particular reason. It wouldn't be such a big deal if games didn't take forever to complete, around 20-60 minutes a game. I mean, the RNG is a problem in almost any board game but this game appears to be atleast 70-80% luck, 15% strategy, and the rest just relying on the other players not having a vendetta against you.\n\nEven through it's flaws though I still can't stop playing it. The characters are all engaging and you can sort of build your strategy by placing your own cards in the global deck. You can choose to focus on turn-locking players, design your cards for pure combat, or design your cards to gain more stars. All excellent ways to win as you can level up either by having stars or having combat wins.\n\nThis game truly shines in it's PvP area, which really seems like the only truly enjoyable part about this game. Playing in PvE is one of the most annoying things as it seems like everything is set up just to make the player lose and the AI win, even on normal. In PvP you'll still see players that seem to win every single roll, I've been beaten by players 15 times in a row even when I've had +5 stats and they had no buffs. Almost any game I've played I'll be right about to win and the entire cosmos will seem to turn against me to make sure there is no hope for me to win.  Just somehow it seems much more enjoyable when you atleast have other players having just as bad luck as you are.\n\n3/5\nI'm about to win and the boss comes over and one-shots me. As soon as I revive a random player uses a KO card, then when I revive I get hit by two damage cards and the boss comes back and finishes me off then proceeds to win the game. You either love or hate the random number generator...","June 1, 2015","true","38.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

How do you play? What do you do?\n100% orange juice is a bored game with trading card elements. You move around the board trying to complete one of two task, killing others or gathering stars. You gather/lose stars by landing on spaces and rolling a die. You kill people by rolling a die to attack, and defend. You collect a portion of their stars if you kill them. Cards play a role by allowing you to build decks. You will draw a card from yor deck every time you land on a specific space. Cards can deal damage, give stat buffs, of be hidden traps on spaces.\n\nControls\nThis game is controlled entirely by the mouse; it works just fine. 10/10\n\nSound\nThe game sounds fine and the voice acting is pretty good, with options to change the voice, or turn it off. 10/10\n\nGraphics\nThe game is not graphically intensive, and will run fine on almost any machine. The game has no 3D sprites, but looks great anyway. 10/10\n\nDifficulty The difficulty is not regulated too well. It has options, but when it comes down to it, it’s an RNG determining your fate half the time. 6/10\n\nStory\nThe story doesn’t matter at all. The game has several story lines for each character. None of them are fantastic, but they don’t need to be. 7/10\n\nMultiplayer\nThe game works well in online multiplayer, it is the ideal way to play. 10/10\n\nOverall this game is a great multiplayer experience, but you can play single player to grind for new cards and got some practice. (Learning how to play cards and where you should go next in your play style.) This game gets an 8/10. Strongly Recommended, especially with friends.","March 13","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This board game however? Very nice.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to grasp and if you actually read the guide (which I didn't do at first) you pick up on the remaining details that you may have missed. The graphics are cute, and the tunes are very nice too. At it's core is the luck based dice rolling, though you can better influence the board with cards. There's an in-game card collection feature, which lets you get more cards to more consistantly rig your luck/ruin other people's days. But even when you're rolling 2 dice to move, dodge, attack... etc you can still roll just right to ruin/delay your win. And then again next turn.\n\nThere's a wide variety of characters to play with, you wont be limited to just playing the one you pick at the beginning in mutliplayer (not sure how the difficulty described with those four actually relates though). You can unlock more cute (and fun characters) just by playing the campaign AND/OR you can buy through DLC. I'm fond of the fact that DLC characters aren't automatically far better than any standard characters. Regardless of DLC or not, sometimes map events will make winning with a character maybe a little harder than you'd expect (Aru and a map with Charity for example).","June 20, 2015","true","44.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","1"

And I am not saying that as a fan boy or anything, I mean it. There's something just awesome about this game that keeps the competitive negativity low while still allowing the player some control over the game so it's not just "autoplayed" like how shoots and ladders is. That bit of extra strategy combined with the random factor just keeps the rage moments to a vast minimum, as you can no longer get frustrated for the same reasons as most other multiplayer games. It's not about the competition, just the fun.\n\nAnd it's ironic that a game like this with it's random nature could lead to some pretty awesome rememberable moments from time to time, and the characters are just well enough designed with their personalities some how coming through despite the extremely limited resources to do so.\n\nAs for trying to edge your win, while everyone can use the cards you set in your deck by the luck of the draw, you have to keep in mind it's all about putting the odds in your favor and also when to use them. It's far more in depth than it might appear on the surface. Although, some characters benefit more from clever deck creation than others.\n\nAnd unlike the developer's(Orange_Juice) RPG, this is definitely meant for everyone, not just fans.\n\nSo, pick it up, play it to relax, keep yourself busy while you handle things here and there.\n\nPS: Being Alte is suffering.","October 24, 2015","true","101.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With Online it is even more fun when other users chat back and just relax.\nMultiplayer is where this game shines and I love the community!\n\nHowever you are thrown into the game without any tutorial other than you looking up a guide yourself but it is not hard to get the hang of things such as learn what does what. This makes it easy for you to decide which character is best for what map and also plan a strategy to help you win easier.\n\nBewarned however this game is not easy, on campaign mode even on casual you can easily get beaten either by lack of rolls or an NPC using their hyper card to steal/kill you and snag the win. This game wants you to think and be on your toes so no easy ride here. This is no Mario Party. One wrong mistake and it can cost you the win.\nCampaign is there to unlock characters, each campaign can unlock all characters but one so check the shop after every campaign or so to see if the character is buyable. Even if you lose the character can still be buyable.\n\nA lot of this relays on your luck of the draw with some skill which a party game like this should do. After the first campaign it does get easier due to your knowledge of the game but if you get easily angry I suggest online mode with others, it is less stressfull.\n\nOverall I give this 8/10\nIt is a party game where you have to actually be lucky with some strategy which a board game like this should be. Unlike Mario Party which is mostly down to skills in mini-games and rarely any luck.\nMultiplayer is where it shines and even the starting characters can beat the unlockable characters.\n\nI am happy I bought the 4-pack to gift to my friends and they already adore this game.","June 21, 2015","true","419.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Usually..\n\nThe combat... As long you can roll dice more than your enemies did, you're safe, but that doesn't happen so often\nFor example.. Poppo roll 6+2 (Kinda impossible), so you just have to roll 4-8 at least (most of chara's HP are 4 or 5).. You pray as you roll, 1-3 confirmed.. Because RNGesus don't like you pray\n\n\n....\n\nWell at a certain degree, you can still taste the salt from other players..

Throughout an entire game session, dice-battles and star-collecting (stars are the currency of the game) occur on every turn, but the game is only won once five goals (or "normas", as the game calls it) are achieved, which is determined by the number of stars or the number of enemies beaten. What's very nice about the norma system is that you can chose between either of the two goals, although it should be warned that a norma can only be advanced once the player returns to a home square.\n\nWith lots of things that affect the progress of the game, it's not a kind that you sit down and relax to as you play it: one wrong move or half-baked thought can be detrimental. However, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who wants to have a solid strategy-focused game either, because at times, outcome can be as random and undefined as a game of poker. But for the patient, this is quite a cup of tea, and a great one, in fact. It's fun to experiment with the different elements of the game, seeing which might bring about a more likely (though still uncertain) victory.\n\nOh yeah, and there's apparently a plot to this game. Haven't wasted my time enough to know all about it, but the other aspects alone should provide more than enough to satisfy.\n\nMuch like a cup of actual orange juice, 100% Orange Juice is a sour kick if you're not ready, but tastes very good once you let the sweetness make its way in, even making the tartness feel like it truly has a purpose.","December 30, 2014","true","48.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The method of unlocking characters is to beat the campaign mode, which is a little time-consuming even if you do hold down ctrl + shift to skip most of it. Once you have them unlocked you don't ever need to do that again, though, so it's about 1-2 hours of your life lost to have more fun in multiplayer.\n\nAnd boy, is multiplayer fun. This is a Mario Party or Dokapon Kingdom-esque game that takes elements from both - You 'level up' via stars or wins and the first to reach 14 wins or 200 stars is the winner... Provided they can make it back to a 'home space' before they're killed or worse. There is combat, both against the environment and other players, and there's a decent cast of characters that fit several roles - PvP oriented, star collection oriented, and a mix of both.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/recommended/282800/","Megasan","Megasan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/","543 products in account","100% orange juice is a casual card/board game. That has a cute anime chibi theme to it, from the characters you play, to the cards you use.\n\nGameplay: 8\n\nThe game play here is pretty solid. You start off with a character, then you build a deck of cards that is used in the main game. Once everyone has made there decks the game will start. Once in the main game everyone's decks are placed into one pile in the middle of the current board. Which will be used to draw cards from. So that mean you can draw other players cards while they can draw your own. You'll find your self playing on different boards that can have a different setup each time you play. Each board has there own "board event" from doubling up on Star, cards, or losing stars, to being randomly teleported to a different square and much more.\n\nYou have 6 different square types. Home, Card draw, star bonus, star lost, monsters, and teleports. most of these are self explanatory. Home is where your character starts the game off at. Home also is used to accept and complete missions also While it can heal you or anyone else for one hp if landed on it.  However one of the benefits about your own home is no matter what you roll if you end up going to it or passing it they game will allow you to stop at your own home and if you do so, you won't be able to use the rest of your movement. Monster squares are two fold. Monster Squares are events where you end up fighting a basic monster to gain more stars. But be careful they will fight back and knock you out resulting in you losing half your own stars. After so many turns every monster square will turn into a monster boss square which spawns harder monsters to take down but gives a greater star bonus when defeated. After a boss has been defeated all monster squares goes back to normal monster squares.\n\nYou start a new game off with one card that is drawn from the deck in the middle. You are able to get more by landing on the green squares. Some card require you to pay and/or have the right level to use it. While many different card types to be used like Traps, Hypers, battle, events, and boost. Each can effect the game differently while adding more strategy to your game plan.\n\nCharacters have there own character cards that shows there stats to attack, Defend, Evade and HP while some have card Ability’s. Every character has there own hyper card that is unique to them, However it is possible for other players to take this card from you and use it.\n\nThe goal of the game is two fold. Either win by having 200 or more stars, or winning fights between monsters and other players. At the start of the game each player starts off at level one. To be able to level up you must complete missions either by collection enough stars or winning enough fights. The high level you can become is level five.\n\nCombat in this game is determine by a dice roll on a d6( a six sided die). When entering combat with a player or a monster your allowed to choose one card from your hand that can altar the fight, Keep in mind that only certain cards can be played during combat. The attacking player will always go first. While in combat your base stats will effect your rolls. When someone attacks the defending player or monster they have a chance of rolling either a Defend or an Evade roll. Each one plays out differently. While choosing a defend roll you Subtract your roll to the damage that is being inflicted on your character to a minimum of one damage. While Evading you MUST roll at least one number higher than the current attack number to avoid taking all damage, If you roll equal or less than the attack you will take the full on coming damage to your character. Both sides will be given a chance to attack and defend. However there can only be one attack and one defend roll for each side. There are cards that can effect this however. When fighting a fellow player, if you successfully knock them out you will gain half of there stars into your own pool. After a player is knocked out, every turn that comes they will need to roll to be brought back up, if they fail to get back up the rest of there turn is skipped.\n\nNow the bad part about the game play is the RNG (Random number generator) factor. However do not let this discourage. There will be times you feel like the game is cheating you while other time you feel like things are playing out in your favor. If you get easily upset or take game seriously then this game is NOT for you. This game is a fun casual game that almost anyone can pick up and play. And If you don't mind the RNG factor then you might find this game to your liking.\n\nWhen finishing your current game, every star you have collected will be added to your game profile to be used in the store. The store is where you buy booster packs, More characters, Color pallets for characters, and boards. However the bad part about the store is that you must level up your profile to unlock more stuff from with in the store. To do this you have to play online with either friends or random players. It's not much of a big deal really but it still would of been nice to have a leveling up system in single player for the people who are just wanting a fun quick game and not have to play with others. However this is still a minor thing.\n\nGraphics: 7\n\nThe graphics in the game are very colourful with an anime style look and feel to them. All the characters are chibi form. The game has very playful and inviting graphics that is simple but yet nice to look at.\n\nThe only real problem i can see with the graphics is when you are playing on a board the background has the same repeating design over and over. It's nothing major. Some people may find it distracting or annoying.\n\nMusic: 8\n\nThe soundtrack is great mix of easy listening music, to upbeat techno, to anime style music. One thing that can be a problem is while playing the music can repeat it's self over and over again.\n\n\nStory: 3\n\nThe story is all over the place. There is no real “story” being told here. Every character you can play as has a some what of mini-story to it. The story’s are mostly a random reason to play the game with other NPC's you end up meeting. Some of the reason can be cute and funny.\n\nOnline: -\n\nI normally don't review online play for games. However with how the game is setup it forces you play online to unlock more stuff as I stated above. Over all it doesn't bother me that I have to play online. However I believe a game shouldn't force you into playing online to unlock everything. There are much worse examples out there that does this than this game does.\n\n\nFinal though. I give this game a 8 out of 10.\n\nWhile this game is very casual and fun, with no real story going on. It's play value is really high. It may be annoying with the RNG factor however this can be the most fun part of the game of just not knowing the out come of whats ahead. I can not stress this enough that this is a casual game and should NOT be taken seriously. It's a very light hearted game. I can see this being a fun game that the whole family can enjoy(if you have mutable computers, steam accounts and willing to buy this game for each account). For the price it is well worth it. I have spent hours playing this game and  I can say that I have not been disappointed. It's a very simple game but can have enough complexity to satisfied most gamers.\n\nI HIGHLY re command this game to pretty much anymore. Just don't let the RNG factor stop you from enjoying this game.","December 28, 2014","true","32.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first glance 100% Orange Juice would seem realatively due to your outcomes being determined by Dice however once you continue to play you will discover this game has alot of complexity behind it.\n\nThis game has high replayability due to it's many maps and cards aswell as many characters to select from, this results in the possibility of alot of interesting matches to occur. The art style is very chibi/anime like, the devs used past characters from other titles as alot of their base characters. This game offers solid progress through a satisfying leveling system which allows you to continue buying items from the shop to alter you experience such as booster packs which will potientally give you a powerful card or additional maps and characters who can alter you experience significantly.\n\nEven though 100% Orange Juice is RNG based it is all up to how you take you approach to a situation that will influence your outcome, your main objective will be to take every advantage you can and utilize all the options that are avalible to you.\n\nI recommend this game if you can find a couple of friends willing to fight againest you, your enjoyment will be increased with friends, however the campaign is also decent and allows you to versus AI and many different maps and follow a nonsensical story containing alot of humour. If you enjoy board games in general perhaps you will enjoy this game.\n\nOverall 100% Orange Juice is an enjoyable experience if your willing to give it a chance to see what it has to offer and deserves a 7/10","January 1, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mameeshkamowsqwoz/recommended/282800/","mameeshkamowsqwoz","Sunnyside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mameeshkamowsqwoz/","223 products in account","There are three key factors that keep me coming back to this game. First off the gameplay itself is just fun, ESPECIALLY the multiplayer. I'd recommend either finding some people that frequent the game, or do what i did and badger your friends into buying copies. XD The price is cheap enough, and you get more than enough bang for the buck.\n\nSecondly, the length of each match is PERFECT. Other games in the genre like mario party or dokapon kingdom were fun but had the tendency to destroy everything you worked for at the drop of a hat. Nothing is quite as rage inducing as watching an hour of your progress flushed away in a matter of seconds. 100% Orange Juice will still give you these moments, but the matches tend to last 10-15 minutes at the most. This alone makes getting screwed over at the last minute much more bearable. Even better, most of the unlockables are able to be obtained via multiplayer. I enjoyed campaign mode, but some of my friends would rather play multiplayer. It's nice to have that option.\n\nThird, the developer's support for this game is outstanding. They've added so much free content to the game and continue to do so. Take a look at the update logs for the major patches if you've got the time. It's just about everything you could think of for an online board game. The original game looks ancient compared to the version out now! The game certainly has enough to keep you playing; I haven't come close to unlocking all the extras they've added.\n\nOut of all my steam games, I'd say this game held my attention longer than the vast majority of them.

Throughout an entire game session, dice-battles and star-collecting (stars are the currency of the game) occur on every turn, but the game is only won once five goals (or "normas", as the game calls it) are achieved, which is determined by the number of stars or the number of enemies beaten. What's very nice about the norma system is that you can chose between either of the two goals, although it should be warned that a norma can only be advanced once the player returns to a home square.\n\nWith lots of things that affect the progress of the game, it's not a kind that you sit down and relax to as you play it: one wrong move or half-baked thought can be detrimental. However, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who wants to have a solid strategy-focused game either, because at times, outcome can be as random and undefined as a game of poker. But for the patient, this is quite a cup of tea, and a great one, in fact. It's fun to experiment with the different elements of the game, seeing which might bring about a more likely (though still uncertain) victory.\n\nOh yeah, and there's apparently a plot to this game. Haven't wasted my time enough to know all about it, but the other aspects alone should provide more than enough to satisfy.\n\nMuch like a cup of actual orange juice, 100% Orange Juice is a sour kick if you're not ready, but tastes very good once you let the sweetness make its way in, even making the tartness feel like it truly has a purpose.","December 30, 2014","true","48.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A 2D digital board game made solely for the anime-girl enthusiast, you and three other players collect cards, gold, and experience from traveling around a flat map and killing monsters and each other. Unfortuantely, the game isn't really self explanatory and it helps to play with friends when figuring out how things work. Each player has a set of cards that they put into the game deck, which are then shuffled and dealt out to players randomly. These cards can either hurt a player by dealing damage, heal damage, lay traps, give coins, etc... The players take turns moving around the board and landing on spaces, which give coins, cards, or spawn monsters where the player must fight with dice rolls. You can also fight other players to make them lose their next turn, or lose gold and slowing down their progression in levels. The objective is to level up to level 5 first, by either killing enough people/monsters to get experience or by collecting coins from spaces and other players. There's definitely a difficulty curve, but the online multiplayer is surprisingly very stable.\n\nThe art might turn people off at first, but at the end of the day this makes for a very fun game to play online with your friends.","January 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

As such, they've added support for higher resolutions and as far as I can see (can't confirm this 100% yet, but it seems to be the case) the problems I faced below appear to be fixed. I can only recommend this game now. I'm starting to play it again and they've even added chat support in multiplayer. It has a nice community and it's fun to play online. I'd recommend using the casual mode for the single player campaign though. Any higher setting and the dice rolls are pre-determined I believe.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a dual-screen setup, reconsider. If you don't, this is a fun game and you should buy it. However, it has serious crash problems for dual-screen (or more) players. Most of the problems lie in the fact that if you click a pixel off the game's full screen, it starts flickering like crazy and after about ten seconds, closes. This is because it doesn't have any kind of mouse cursor locking; in other words, the mouse cursor does not stay in the game window.\n\nThis problem can mostly (I've had crashes unrelated to this) be averted by using the smaller windowed mode. This is not an option for me, though. I use my computer for non-gaming purposes in my lounge, but when gaming I play in my cinema room on the sofa. The card descriptions are very low resolution, and since I don't have the option of bringing my head close to the screen, I can't read the text unless using full-screen mode. On that note, I use a 2.4GHz mouse to play the game since it doesn't support gamepads.\n\nIf you have a single monitor or you're happy with windowed mode, go for it. This is just a warning. It's a fun game (a bit masochistic when the AI cheats) and the reviews speak truth. The developers are also friendly and responsive. However, until they fix these problems, I don't think I can play this game. It ends up as a waste of time with crashes near the end of long games, etc.","June 11, 2014","true","249.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/recommended/282800/","genestarwind","Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/","2116 products in account","UPDATE: The developers of this game are great and are always releasing new versions with bug fixes or even free additional content. As such, they've added support for higher resolutions and as far as I can see (can't confirm this 100% yet, but it seems to be the case) the problems I faced below appear to be fixed. I can only recommend this game now. I'm starting to play it again and they've even added chat support in multiplayer. It has a nice community and it's fun to play online. I'd recommend using the casual mode for the single player campaign though. Any higher setting and the dice rolls are pre-determined I believe.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a dual-screen setup, reconsider. If you don't, this is a fun game and you should buy it. However, it has serious crash problems for dual-screen (or more) players. Most of the problems lie in the fact that if you click a pixel off the game's full screen, it starts flickering like crazy and after about ten seconds, closes. This is because it doesn't have any kind of mouse cursor locking; in other words, the mouse cursor does not stay in the game window.\n\nThis problem can mostly (I've had crashes unrelated to this) be averted by using the smaller windowed mode. This is not an option for me, though. I use my computer for non-gaming purposes in my lounge, but when gaming I play in my cinema room on the sofa. The card descriptions are very low resolution, and since I don't have the option of bringing my head close to the screen, I can't read the text unless using full-screen mode. On that note, I use a 2.4GHz mouse to play the game since it doesn't support gamepads.\n\nIf you have a single monitor or you're happy with windowed mode, go for it. This is just a warning. It's a fun game (a bit masochistic when the AI cheats) and the reviews speak truth. The developers are also friendly and responsive. However, until they fix these problems, I don't think I can play this game. It ends up as a waste of time with crashes near the end of long games, etc.","June 11, 2014","true","249.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But in the best way possible.\n\nIf you've ever had the baffling thrill of grabbing a random, Japanese tabletop style video game from an import shop or online (particularly in the heyday of the Dreamcast), then 100% Orange Juice is like a visit from a long lost friend.\n\nThe rules are, without the instructions, indecipherable for the first 5 minutes. Then slowly you start to understand... and then realize you didn't understand, but you're winning... you think... and then the computer does something nuts and they win.\n\nAnd it seems like the game is aware of it! Play the demo. You'll take the role of a character who has had his wallet stolen by a girl who only says 'Popopo'. Amidst this nonsense, your character is able to deduce she stole your wallet and you have to challenge her to a battle. After winning the game, your character actually asks "What happened? Who won?".\n\nVisually the game has a nice, colorful style. Not a ton of animation, nor overly impressive effects, but totally acceptable. 100% Orange Juice has a crazy, MIDI sax and bass soundtrack that was very commonplace in most early 2000's import games. The far-east-space-jazz is punctuated with high pitched anime screams, and seiyu voice overs, exactly like you need it to be.\n\nThe publisher is a genius for localizing this game, and not bothering with localized audio.\n\nFor the gameplay, most of the reviews I've seen I agree with; It's unfair, capricous, rage inducing, awesome, and so much fun to play. It's like a guy who plays too much Chutes and Ladders, met a guy who is obsessed with Risk. They went to CoCo Ichiban in Akihabara, ate experimental curry, and decided to make a video game combining their passions.\n\nAnd instead of the light-RPG elements that you might expect, there are instead light-CCG elements, and it's fun to unlock booster packs!\n\nStay wierd, Japan.

But in the best way possible.\n\nIf you've ever had the baffling thrill of grabbing a random, Japanese tabletop style video game from an import shop or online (particularly in the heyday of the Dreamcast), then 100% Orange Juice is like a visit from a long lost friend.\n\nThe rules are, without the instructions, indecipherable for the first 5 minutes. Then slowly you start to understand... and then realize you didn't understand, but you're winning... you think... and then the computer does something nuts and they win.\n\nAnd it seems like the game is aware of it! Play the demo. You'll take the role of a character who has had his wallet stolen by a girl who only says 'Popopo'. Amidst this nonsense, your character is able to deduce she stole your wallet and you have to challenge her to a battle. After winning the game, your character actually asks "What happened? Who won?".\n\nVisually the game has a nice, colorful style. Not a ton of animation, nor overly impressive effects, but totally acceptable. 100% Orange Juice has a crazy, MIDI sax and bass soundtrack that was very commonplace in most early 2000's import games. The far-east-space-jazz is punctuated with high pitched anime screams, and seiyu voice overs, exactly like you need it to be.\n\nThe publisher is a genius for localizing this game, and not bothering with localized audio.\n\nFor the gameplay, most of the reviews I've seen I agree with; It's unfair, capricous, rage inducing, awesome, and so much fun to play. It's like a guy who plays too much Chutes and Ladders, met a guy who is obsessed with Risk. They went to CoCo Ichiban in Akihabara, ate experimental curry, and decided to make a video game combining their passions.\n\nAnd instead of the light-RPG elements that you might expect, there are instead light-CCG elements, and it's fun to unlock booster packs!\n\nStay wierd, Japan. The world needs you more than ever.","June 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The goal in each game is to get 200 stars or 14 kills, Or both if RNG-sama loves you. The first to do so and land on their home wins, Pretty strait forward and simple. But lets be honest here, Nobody actually plays for some hardcore epic mlg gameplay. Everybody who plays this game really just play it for the good comunity. The orange_juice comunity is one of the more friendly and good comunitys out there, But when it comes to this game some people can get salty if RNG is a ♥♥♥♥♥. This is more of a nice pass time to spend with your friends with a nice game in the backround than a grab your icecream, ditch your family and wast your life away kinda game. This game is one of my favorite games due to many of the reasons i just listed. You will meet many good friends in this game too, I mean look at my 40+ friends that came from just this game. Of course you get bad people to (AHEM *cough* sci) that infect everybody and its a war to stay alive near them. But that isnt as frequent as making friends with this game.

Once your goals are met you need to stop on your home tile or land on someone elses, and once you complete five "norma" (which are your self proclaimed missiosn such as get 100 stars or beat 9 enemies) you win. Conflict is solved by the attacker rolling a die, and the defender rolling a die after picking defend and evade with certain cards offering powerups.\n\nAll in all this is a good game to play with friends to end your friendship, or to play with random people in the many different online servers to create new enemies.","October 14, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Players each have a home tile and roll dice to move which can have several different outcomes such as fight a monster, earn free stars, lose stars, draw a card, teleport, and nothing. Once your goals are met you need to stop on your home tile or land on someone elses, and once you complete five "norma" (which are your self proclaimed missiosn such as get 100 stars or beat 9 enemies) you win. Conflict is solved by the attacker rolling a die, and the defender rolling a die after picking defend and evade with certain cards offering powerups.\n\nAll in all this is a good game to play with friends to end your friendship, or to play with random people in the many different online servers to create new enemies.","October 14, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get to see characters and cards you haven't unlocked yet. Not nearly as much as multplayer from what I have seen so far. For me it kinda lacked a competitive aspect being against CPUs and all.\nPlayed some campaign. Not enough to really draw a conclusion.\nMultiplayer\nJust recently started to get into the multiplayer of this game. My experience so far has been better and more fun for me than singleplayer. It has a good balance of competition. Whether I win or lose each game doesnt feel like a slug fest and I find myself wanting to play more. I have learned more playing with other people and seeing what they do with the characters. It's also nice because you get to see characters and cards you haven't unlocked and try them out. Games are easy to host and join which is a plus.\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. I love all the songs. Although my two favorites are Hime's theme and Suguri's theme.\nVisuals\nThe game is great looking. I enjoy it's art style.\nOverall\nI would definitly recommend this game to others. So far I am getting more fun out of this game than I expected I would. The game is a nice break from the casual games I usually use to get over losing streaks in Dota 2. Losing doesn't feel as bad in this game. I shall expand this review as I play more. Also this is my first review. I know I am missing some important aspects of the game. I just felt the need to post a review for it.","July 27, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is basically summed as a board game meets card game. It has a few scenarios for a story mode with some extra/challenge scenarios after the scenarios to round out a decent pure singleplayer phase. The game is prefered for it's multiplay, it's multiplayer is for up to 4 people with cpu players filling in the blank spots and with some fun rewards you can unlock from multiplayer instead of playing the scenarios. There is also a free play mode to just jump in and play some against some cpu players instead of playing scenarios again and again or going into multiplayer.\n\nGood: It's a fun game with tons of replay to it. It's great for casual time wasting as well as just something for you and your friends to get together and play for a fun game night. The music for the game is fantastic as well ranging from simple little beats in the menus to jazz and techno/dance for character themes. The visuals are pleasing (if you apreciate cutesy animu). The cards all have fantastic art on them from comical to stunning. Flavor text on each card is a fun read some with refrences to the games they are orignally from to just fun little things. Fantastic thing is for a board game, there is a speed setting in which you can set how fast the animations flow in order to speed up each action in order to not have the game drag on from just waiting on the animations to stop (lots of animations from dice rolls, to card use, movement, and so on).\n\nBad: The game is extremely RNG (like all board games) I am putting it into the bad becasue alot of people tend to rage at RNG and their horrible luck (basically here is your fair warning). Like Mario Party and Mario Kart back in the day, this game can destroy friendships if you are way to competetive. The anouncer can get alittle annoying constantly hearing the cutesy voice call out what panel you are landing on and which players turn it is (mainly because it steps on the music man, so good!).\n\nTL;DR: Great little animu board game to get together with friends and play just for the funzies. Great music, fun interesting art and visuals, can be very competetive if you are that kind of player, and VERY RNG!\n\nI give it from my own personal tastes as well as the factors stated above,\n\n9.5/10 Game as a whole\n10 waifus out of 10 For Animu goodness\n12 out of 10 For great music","August 27, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Apparently they keep stealing some guy's wallet so then he challenges them to play a board game.

Also, a lackluster TCG and fast-paced RPG.\nDo not be fooled by the cutesy graphics. This is a very well-developed game.\n\nStarting with the trading card game elements, there aren't very many cards and there's no trading. Still, this game uses a rather clever solution for balance: each player picks a handful of cards from their own collection and those get put into a communal deck to be used by any player. When selecting cards, you have to weigh the value of how much it can help you if you get it against the impact of it being used by another player. Card types include "boost," "trap," "battle," and "unit" cards.\n\nOn the RPG side of things, there are a few selectable characters who each have their own short, comedic story, but these stories aren't really focused on enough to be factored into the decision to purchase the game. Each character has different stats; one has +0 to all stats while another has +2 attack and -1 defense and evasion while yet another has +1 to all while having reduced HP. These stats can only be changed temporarily by using cards; there are no stat level ups, which helps keep things from getting too imbalanced. Having low values for all these stats helps make combat go faster. The stats are added to the value of die rolls to determine damage, and when you only have ~5 max HP, every point matters. Each character also has their own unique "hyper" ability that is activated by cards in the communal deck.\nDuring combat, the attacker rolls first. The defender then chooses whether to defend or attempt to evade. After the aggressor's attack, the victim then counterattacks with the same mechanics if they were not slain.\nWhile the characters do not gain experience, stats, or abilities, you (the player) do. Each match played online gives experience based on how well you ended up doing and level ups unlock more stuff to purchase in the shop including more characters.\n\nThe boardgame mixes strategy with luck. There's enough luck involved that a player who is down is not truly out until the game's finished, and a player with a large lead is not safe until landing on the finish. I've seen many examples of come-from-behind victories and large leads falling to pieces, and these ups and downs help keep the game fun and interesting when playing with other players. As far as strategy goes, you can pick routes when the path branches (altering the distance to home), you pick when to play cards, and when passing another player you can choose to stop on their square and battle them with victory awarding you half their stars and +2 win points. The goal of the game is to meet an ever increasing goal of either stars or combat wins (player's choice) and reach a home point to turn in that goal (and thus reach the next goal tier, with 5 being the final tier, earning victory when cleared). Wins always go up but can be difficult to get while stars are easier to earn yet just as easy to lose. There are also plenty of boards with very different layouts which helps the game stay fun after multiple play sessions.\n\nThe game is mostly suited for online play (though it does have a single player campaign and free mode), and it has a few things of note in that area. The game uses Steam servers to form lobbies and you can have a match with random players. During a normal turn, you get 60 seconds before the AI takes over for you, so it's not too much of a problem if players leave their keyboard for a bit. When attacked, you are given 40 seconds to decide what to do, but the other player's clock freezes after they make a choice, so you can't outwait them for the sake of taking advantage of enemy AI. When doing a revival roll, you are given less time.\nAddtionally, Fruitbat Factory has been quite active in the community as well as busy adding content and rebalancing things.\n\nVerdict:\nThe game looks quirky enough that I wouldn't normally recommend it, but it makes for one heck of a cheap party game. If you and up to 3 friends are looking for a casual game to play online in which all players remain on equal ground and can get this cheap, it comes highly recommended. If you do not have 3 friends, bots or random players will fill in the missing spots.","May 18, 2014","true","162.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Players choose cards to enter into the pool of powerups. Choosing a card does not guarantee that the cards a player enters will return to them, essentially making the different collection of card between players fair. Instead of minigames 100% OJ has a simple battle system that initiates when a player lands on an enemy encounter space or passes another player while moving on the game board. The battle system is simple, roll more than the other player while attacking to kill and roll more on the defense to take reduced damage or evade damage altogether. Fighting becomes tiresome whoever when the game tosses the character "Tomomo" into the game during the campaign mode. Tomomo makes the game a perfect allegory for life. All the 1s rolled to move or during combat let the player experience bad luck. After playing 100% OJ players will be able to empathize with the ugly ♥♥♥♥ers who lost the genetic roullette and hate the beatiful people who lucked out due to their supreme genes.

Which of course means: 100% Random Generator. And you will definatly feel that as you play. This little boardgame /cardgame is about rolling dice, moving around a board, fight the other players, collect stars and play cards from your hand with different effects. And of course you can gain levels and buy new cards within the game in booster packs. All to create a tiny but … a surprisingly fun game.\n\nBut this is one of those games that you should definatly play with your friends. All the randomnes of the different situations that occur throughout a round of play will definatly bring a smile to your faces. And as your tiny chibi-like characters run across the board you will want to continue hunting down those other players and points and cards and scores and... so on.\n\nEven tho the game is random and alot of players will state that it is ALL random, you do actually have a few desicsions that still makes the game somewhat strategic. You can often decide to walk in a certain direction on the board, you build a deck of cards that goes in to the pool of cards that players can draw from, you decide on which goal you want to go for during the game and you decide which cards to play and when to play them. So there are desicions to be made! A lot mor than you would originally think anyway...\n\nIf you already love tiny random games with cute art and very positive music. Go ahead and get this game! If you don't... well you're probably not reading this anyway!\n\nRecommended!\n\n/ Nurgleprobe","January 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplays starts off like most board games where it's 4 players pitted against each other. You start off by picking your character and after you have chosen you go to a deck buildig screen, yes I said it a deck building screen. This is what I think really sets this game apart and makes it wonderful. As you play you gather stars and using those stars you can buy boster packs and unlock more cards to play with. Each card has it's own properties and categories ranging from Traps to Battle cards to Event cards and each one can save you.\n\nAfter you have chosen the deck you want to play with the game finally begins. The main purpose is to complete all the objectives before your opponents. You start off by having to deliver 10 stars to one of the home bases and from there you pick your next objective which is either defeat 2 enemies or collect 20 stars. From there the objectives are the same, defeat enemies or collect stars, but grow more difficult with each level.  About halfway through the game a boss will show up and depending on what level you are playing on determines which boss you fight. The boss is three times as strong as any of the other enemies you fight on the enemy tiles and twice as strong as any of the players so defeating it is gonna take a while and you will probably die.\n\nThere is a lot to do in this game if you get bored of playing others online you can play campaign mode. There are also tons of stuff to unlock which will keep you playing for many many hours. Oh! did I mention that the games RNG in the dice rolls is outrageous and will probably frustrate the hell out of you, but in a good way (if there is one). Overall this is a really good board game despite the Anime-ness of it and if you can get past that you will definitely get your moneys worth.","October 26, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I really do like it! The characters are cute, the story is humorous and tongue in cheek, the gameplay is simple but fun, it's basically a standard tabletop board game with adorable anime characters. Even with the collectible card aspect I can definitely imagine this game being easily recreated in real life. I will admit that the final boss is likely cheating on her rolls, and the RNG will likely mess you up when you need it to help the most, but I've had a bizzare amount of luck with this game.\n\nWhat amounts to "strategy" in this game is only choosing which cards to put in the deck, what directions to take, when to use cards, whether to fight the other players or not, and whether to defend or evade. Regardless, it works, it's pretty fun.\n\nThe characters are also quite cute and endearing. As far as I know they're all from games of the Bullet Hell genre. So far, the only character whose game has a Steam release is Suguri, but it appears that QP will be getting a game soon as well.\n\nMultiplayer has a "drop in drop out" system which works well for the game type, but it works rather well. Even if a player wants to use the overpowered final boss character, she is toned down for the multiplayer mode.\n\n...I feel like there's more I should say, but I really can't think of much else. If you like basic board games where you move via dice, you'll likely have fun with this.","October 27, 2014","true","65.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You roll a dice and move around the board and land on a space that has various effects ranging from you to collecting stars or cards, to losing stars and fighting enemies. Now, that's where the similarities end really. 100% OJ is by far more rutheless than Mario Party. Maybe it's just my luck, but even on normal the cpus are brutal and out for blood. If you make one wrong move, or if the game decides it hates you then you can very well go from a blazing lead to being in dead last within the span of a few turns. Now, despite that, the game itself is a lot of fun. Sure, it's a board game with goals that range from collecting a certain amount of stars, knocking out a certain amount of people or a combination of the both.\n\nThe game has only 3 modes really, campaign, single matches and multiplayer. Now with any board game, playing with friends is what makes it really shine a bit more. You can play with up to three other friends, using whatever characters you unlocked, making a deck of x amount of cards and then you're put into a board, fighting or running for your life (depending on your play style and character as all characters have different stats.) in order to gain first prize. Now, with all three game modes you ear stars (which are this games currency to buy items from the store.) But only in multiplayer can you gain exp to level up and unlock new items to purchase and the sort, which the game has a decent amount of. Honestly, I suggest giving the demo a try to get a feel for the game, then convince some friends to get the game as well or find some people that would want to play. All in all, it's a fun game but can be frustrating.","September 26, 2014","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don't like the RNG bias, then play the campaigns on casual. You'll have a great time, I promise.\n","September 30, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you end up spending most of your time thinking of what actions to take.\n\nRoll a 4, Land on a Bonus Tile, Attack the other player, or not. Use the cards wisely, but it is all for fun. End up wanting to play one game, then before you know it, you have played 5 hours worth in one afternoon.\n\nI highly recommend this game for those who want to just spend it having fun. c:","August 24, 2014","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like, body pillow of Homura Akemi, Naruto headband and box of Pocky level of weeaboo? Then you'll like this game despite everything following this. OMG SO KAWAII DESU NE XDD SUGOI\n-AI is rigged often and you need to trap card them if you want to win (This is a game where AI difficulty = AI's luck increased, so they will ALWAYS have their best card and will almost ALWAYS roll 5+ if they're not Mariepoppo)\n-Don't go into this game for BIOWARE KWALETEE STORYTELLING because there is none to be found. Every character could be summed up accurately in a -dere or just one other trope. They appear to be from other games, but I don't think anyone in the West (including myself) understands where they're from. It feels similar to having Opa-Opa in Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing, because essentially no one knows who the hell he is.\n-Some characters are legitimately just way better than others, stat-wise. For example, there's that chick that the game literally WANTS you to ban if you're making an online game. Speaking of online...\n-Online is glitchy and incomplete, but believe hard enough and the matches will show up. If you can't host and you're playing with a friend, you might have to make them do it.\n-Actually, the game is better with other people rather than AI in general.\n-Art style feels like every anime trope drawn like they're from my 6th grade sketchbook, but not necessarily ugly like A Valley Without Wind. Poorly drawn but not like you can't look at it, reminds me of keychains in a convention's artist alley.\n-While the text is translated, all the audio is voiced by a KAWAII DESU NE japanese girl in sort-of-english, so if that bugs you, don't go for this game.\n-PRO TIP: Holding shift speeds up the AI's turns. You will need this so you don't have to watch Mariepoppo get her ♥♥♥ kicked by chickens repeatedly.\n-If you want to buy this game because it has cards, I'm gonna need you to rethink your life choices.\n\nOverall, Waifu Party 8 is playable and mildly amusing, but you could just play Monopoly instead. Even if you want a digital board game, Mario Party is more skill-based than this (with most minigames requiring some kind of skill). It's not something you should pick up while it's not on sale, or if you don't like Yu-Gi-Oh with catgirls. Glad I got it as a gift.","August 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anything in this game can kill you. Other players? Yep. Robots? Yep. Birds? Well if you come into contact with a bird, it might be worthwhile to just alt+f4. You pick between 4 characters, Easy, Medium, Hard, Medium. They are just difficulty settings, but also they have different stats but only sometimes? On the game board it has 4 square types. Red=Random battle, Blue=Drop an ammount of stars, Green= Draw a card, And Purple=Random teleport. But if you land on the same square as another player, you battle. Imagine fire emblems battling, but without any skill. You roll a dice and hope to get higher than the enemy. Pray to RNGesus that just for once he will be on your side. How to win the game? I dunno the specific requirements, but from what I can tell, you get stars. Now sometimes these stars make your "win" counter go up, but only sometimes I guess? This game is a whole jumble of nonsense wrapped up in a kwaii-desu bow. Coming off of the dark souls 2 DLC, I expected something lighthearted. Oh boy was I wrong. This has some of the most hardcore music I have ever heard. There is no reason not to buy this game. 10/10","July 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a really fun game to pick up for half an hour every now and then (this quickly becomes one hour, then two and so on) and it is really addictive, too addictive perhaps. It's flaw however is that the game, at least in single player mode, cheats. It cheats like a motherclucker. Like a four year old playing monopoly. If you're planning on playing the campaign of this game, be ready to exhaust your vocabulary of swears. That aside, it's definitely the best board game simulator on Steam.","August 4, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
