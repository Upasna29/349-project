The circular movement is a confusing and unique mechanic for the genre allowing for some real challenge to spring out of simple enemies. When you first pick up the game, it's hard to even kill a simple enemy that stands still and throws daggers. Once you get the hang of the very powerful dodge mechnic, things get smoother. The art style and music give the game a retro feel while maintaing a level of polish that is expected these days.\n\nI definately recommend this game.","September 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The physics are smooth, the collectibles are fun and meaningful, combat takes skill, and exploring is just straight up fun. I have yet to complete a run because I keep getting killed by the same boss (some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ninja alien thing) but learning how to beat different enemies is legitimately fun. One of my biggest gripes with most roguelites is enemy AI homogeneity, but there is none of that to be found here. If you are ok with early access, I think this game is absolutely worth supporting.","October 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The randomly generated universe gives this game great replayability, even though the mechanics and gameplay never changes. It's easy to play, and the decision to create a game where you only use the keyboard (no mouse) is refreshing and has a hint of nostalgia to it (for us old folks that played in DOS all those years ago...)\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like shooting aliens, flying around in space and collecting loot! If you find the realistic alternatives too scary, don't worry, this game may startle you at times, but you probably won't wet your pants.\n\nThe music is also great and spurs you on in your quest to return to Earth!

But with this, even though it took me a really long time to get past the first level, I got used to the controls (which are really smooth like the other reviews claim) and had a blast.  Each time there are plenty of new planets to explore and enemies you might not have encountered previously.  The sheer diversity of planet types is astounding, each with their own quirks, like sandstorms on the desert planets, sliding about a bit on the ice planets, and a floaty feeling to moving about on the gas planets.  Each time you learn more and it seems like, so far, there's still more that I haven't found and I feel the desire to keep playing till I've found it all!  Looking forward to seeing what else makes it into the game as time goes on.","October 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Or give you more fuel to travel to new planets and gems (which is this games currency) to keep your adventure going. New characters mix up the gameplay and add some challenge. Bosses can be difficult at first, but once their pattern is figured out, they're not so bad. Overall a solid game and I can't wait to see what the developers do with this.","December 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't want to share the controller with anyone else there, but then I found out it was available to purchase on Steam! I got it and have been recommending it to my friends, too.\n\nThis game is an old school style of pixel art, which is well designed, colorful, and fun. The sound design is also fun, with appropriate space noises, creatures, music, everything. The entire art aspects alone should be a reason to invest time in the game.\nThe flow of the game and controls are a bit confusing at first, but then you get into it and the controls become second nature. The way the game forces you to choose how to manage resources and to strategize is clever and has you constantly thinking about what decision you'll make. And the difficulty of a roguelike is definitely present in this. You are certain to die a few times (or several times in my case) before you begin to figure out how things work. For example, learning enemy patterns through each playthrough helps you to make it further and further in the game. And the further you progress, you notice different environmental hazards, such as flytraps and acid pits, and then more extreme, galaxy spanning hazards, like solar flares and ion bursts. Equipment gathered is helpful for different situations, and the more gathered, the better. They can be used in conjunction to increase survivability and effectiveness against enemies. I get excited each time I find a different piece I can add to make my character more deadly.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes space themed shooters, pixelated artwork, and arcade style action with roguelike difficulty.","November 6, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
