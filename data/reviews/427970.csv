The interface of the main menu where you can design your ship and change settings, this keeps on moving all the time, you move to mouse it moves in opposite direction, I can see what they are trying to do here, but maybe, simply do it for some of the menus, and cerrtainly not for ship creation or settings.\nSettings are fiddly as you need to either be right on the line or use the very small pin, this on a menu that doesn't move with you may be ok, but this menu is a nightmare as it moves when you do.\nShip creation, seems to be powerful, if everything wasnt so hard to click on. As you guessed it, it moves with you. Trying to delete a piece is a nightmare, as you need to select it by scrolling, which doesnt work all the time, and to me it seems you need to select the actual text of the item in the list then click the delete X button, all while the interface is moving with your mouse.\nFlight, not much better I am afraid, uses pitch with WASD and strafe with QE. But as default the ships direction also moves with the mouse. This can be disabled with V. If anyone played Microsoft Freelancer, then the weapons in one of the view modes, can befired like turret mode in Freelancer.\nI would like to build a huge destroyer and sit there in turretmode, this for me is fun.\n\nCompared to most Early Access games from indie developers this does have allot of content, but they need to rethink the interface interaction before they go anyfurther in development.\nThey do say VR is supported, maybe that is better I don't know but the keyboard and mouse interface does need work.\n\nDo I recommend it? No, Not yet.\nDo I recommend supporting the devs? Yes if you can, I think this could be a really good game.","March 23","false","0.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","4"

Early access which was given tu us right now seems to just a small scent of what to come. I am personally quite happy to wait and also to grow with the gam,e to see the whole process behind the success of Heathen Engineer.\n\nBecause I have no doubts this is going to be success!\n\nWhat I particularly like right now? The concept of designing ships exactly how I want them to be designed. What I would expect is actually more modules and options to work with and provide more variety to shapes and purposes of my builds.\n\nThis will be there I am pretty sure. And I know that this will bring more sense in connection with economy, production and whole political fiction part of the game.\n\nSomehow this is rather exciting that I can see this game before it will become full commercial product on the shelf.","March 28","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
