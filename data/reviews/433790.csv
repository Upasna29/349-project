Unfortunately, my experience with THIS game makes me less than excited about playing the FIRST instalment...\n\nSimply put, this is one of the least "user-friendly" games that I have ever played.\n\nFirst of all, there's the nutty controls.  Navigate the menu by pressing SPACE, then hit Enter to select an option?  WHY?!  Then there's the fact that I don't think I've ever endured a game where it's so darn hard to INTERACT with anything.  I mean, the game tells you to "press E", but neglects to mention to "be especially pedantic about where you point the cursor", even when trying to open a DOOR for ♥♥♥♥'s sake (hint: you have to hit the handle as PRECISELY as humanly possible)!!  Then there's the fact that the "sprint" button, for reasons unknown, only works outdoors, making interiors sometimes tiresome to traverse.  Oh, and whatever you do, DON'T ACCIDENTALLY PRESS THE ESCAPE BUTTON, or you'll be quitting the game...which is especially bad, since...\n\nTHERE ARE NO SAVE POINTS.  There are Chapter headings, so you can jump to one of four Chapters...but I only found this out by reading a thread in the Community Hub, and even then you have to scroll down the Chapters to work out which one you want, as they're rather unhelpfully identified with screen-shot images rather than titles such as, say, "The House, Part 1".  Again, not exactly "user-friendly".\n\nSome more bad points (yeah, sorry, not quite finished yet)!  Despite the fact of the sound being otherwise admirably atmospheric, your footsteps make NO SOUND AT ALL on the wooden floors of the title (or on any other surface, for that matter).  Furthermore, there are moments where spectacularly dramatic and almost UNBEARABLY LOUD music kicks in...even though nothing in particular is happening at that very moment in the game.  As a matter of fact, the SOUND, on the whole, is a lot more startling than anything that actually happens visually or event-wise:  Many is the time that an intended "jump-scare" passed me by, in an "Oh, did something just happen?" kind of way.  Definitely not a good thing in a horror game.\n\nThat's the bad.  Now for the downright UGLY.\n\nNot only is this game borderline unplayable, for me personally it was UNCOMPLETABLE.  Twice I verified the game cache, and even went back and re-completed the Chapter in front of it - thankfully all of two to three minutes in length - and STILL the final Chapter failed to finish for me.  Try these phrases on for size:  "Lighting needs to be rebuilt", and better yet, "Paths need to be rebuilt".  Meaning I went through a door to find nothing but a huge black void, mercifully insta-killing me when I dared step into it.  It's alright, though...a quick peek at someone else's walkthrough tells me I missed all of two minutes' gameplay, during which - surprise, surprise - absolutely ♥♥♥♥-ALL HAPPENS.\n\nNow, there ARE a few good things.  The graphics are, for the most part, rather nice, and the puzzles and/or miscellaneous mind-♥♥♥♥ery that some of the bits get up to are upon occasion a tad interesting (e.g. architecture which changes while you've got your back turned, that kind of thing).  But there's not nearly enough inspired ideas here to justify a purchase, especially when I'm surely not the only person on the face of the planet whose computer will stubbornly refuse to even allow me to reach the end (just look in my games list and/or reviews to see how many games I HAVE completed, so I'm sure it's safe to say it's not my rather expensive laptop that's at fault).\n\nI probably would have given this a bare-bones pass if it wasn't for the aforementioned problems, and for a better game I may have gone so far as to report the technical faults to the developer...but for THIS game, I honestly couldn't give two ♥♥♥♥s.  Actually, not even one.  Mediocre at best, even if the darned thing DID function as intended.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","January 14","false","2.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

This game was very nice to look at, the controls were simple and effective, the ambiance was amazingly creepy, but when I finished it, I was really expecting more. Backstory-wise, you get more from the Steam description than you do in the actual game, and the game just felt extremely short. I was expecting the game to really build me up for a scare, but it never delivered. When "The End" rolled up on the screen, I thought the game was messing with me.\n\nOverall, I can respect the eerie ambiance and creepy twists in the games surroundings, and think this is a VERY good job for a one man team. However, at this price, I wouldn't recommend it.","January 11","false","2.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

You take control of a man named Andrew Winter, who is an alcoholic that resides in a quaint cabin in the woods near Blackdust Field. Your goal is to reveal all of the secrets that are housed in the large mansion atop the field by solving riddles and puzzles.\n\nUnfortunately, this installment in the Wooden Floor series does not stack up to its predecessor by any means. The game starts you off in an open field, where you grab a lantern and enter a church. From there, you ring the bell, grab a key, and make your way to the mansion. From here on out, it's easy problem solving through the remaining chapters (four in total), all of which last for about 10 minutes each. Grab a gear then insert it into the floor, take a key and open a door with it, find a door handle to open another door... it's all very straight forward.\n\nSure, the corridors and rooms are dimly lit and sometimes have fog in them, but there's no real "horror" or "mystery" here; not even a jumpscare or something to keep one mystified about. The music cuts out far too often, leaving you with silence and your own in-game footsteps to keep you company. There's also not much in the way of storyline either, even though the store page insists that the story telling has improved from the first game. There are red books marked with a W on the front that you can read (the game say that you can "ridden" them, whatever that means) to gather the incoherent ramblings of the alcoholic main character, and that's about it.\n\nSadly, Wooden Floor 2 - Resurrection isn't even as optimized as its counterpart, with some areas of the game dipping into the lower 40s in terms of FPS. The prior release ran at a stable 60 from beginning to end. It's overall a lackluster sequel, and the end boss this time around isn't nearly as difficult or interesting. The game is also shorter, clocking in between 30-50 minutes. However, the developer has implemented multiple endings, and a randomized second chapter. Still, I cannot give this title a recommendation, especially for its price point of $7.79 CAD. There are far better titles that you can grab for around the same amount. Preserve the memories of the original Wooden Floor, and move on.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 15","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not seem like much, but in my opinion, it does a good job of setting the mood and is able to surprise you when you let your guard down. I enjoyed thinking about what the story could be like while looking at well modelled sets. This game was most certainly not half ♥♥♥♥♥ and deserves a thumbs up considering the small crew!
