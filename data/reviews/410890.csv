As expected from the stellar work done on CH1, MangaGamer have not disappointed in making Watanagashi a worthwhile purchase:\n\nUnlike the previous (non-Steam) MG localization of Higurashi, no licensing issues hinder this release. The original music is fully intact as it was in the original release nearly 13 years ago.\nLike CH1, the translation quality of this release far surpasses the 2009 MG localization or the various fanslation projects, owing to MangaGamer's decision to retranslate this behemoth from scratch. Wordplay, idioms, descriptions, characterizations, all are delicately handled in a way that immerses the reader without straying from the original transcript; in many situations, comparing this new translation to the old is like night and day.\nDetailed new character art has been provided for the user's convenience, replacing the original low-res Ryukishi art if so desired. Alternatively, those who prefer the original art have the option to switch between the two on the fly by pressing 'P'. Going even further beyond these options, MangaGamer's intentional decision to allow modding of Higurashi's graphic assets means that discerning fans can even go as far as using the PS2 character sprites, or the PS3 backgrounds, or even custom fanmade sprites. Even voice mods using the VO of the older console releases of Higurashi are popping up, thanks to the flexibility provided by this rerelease's engine.\nI can only assume if you're reading this review for CH2 you were (rightfully) in love with CH1 and wanted to see if MangaGamer's handling of CH2 is up to snuff. The answer is a resounding 'yes', and you should go out of your way to support such an excellent release.","November 16, 2015","true","14.1"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","94","99","2","2"

Such a great series. Basically, this is the second chapter for the Higurashi VN series, if you couldn't tell. It continues with where Onikakushi left off in the story. This series is honestly very great, it gives you mixed emotions depending on the situation you're in. One minute, you could be laughing due to everyone having fun and playfully hitting each other, next minute, everyone could be dead.\nThis whole series is much worth it for the smallish price Steam charges for the games that have come out/coming out.","November 14, 2015","true","3.5"," 51 of 60 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","51","60","4","1"

DO I RECOMMEND?! 1000% yes I do. Even at the slight price jump, this chapter is worth it.\n\nThis VN was an emotional roller coaster for me. The writing got better here then in Onikakushi. The story starts out as a fun humorous experience in the vein of Gintama I'd say with some of the ridiculousness. It then subtly lays the ground the plot ahead, but while it does this, at the midway point it kind of drags. After this midway point, you move onto the mystery part of the story. After this I cried. A lot. I've seen the anime and know the series plot already and all its secrets so maybe it made me cry because I knew what was to come. But the writing for the emotions of Keichi could not be captured like how an anime could try. His personal struggle with each event was heart wrenching. While it was limited to a single perspective unlike the anime (which showed more of the truth), it did a better job of conveying a story and the emotion behind it. The reused bgms still feel a little out of place and cheap imo, but the new ones that play late in the VN fit the mood perfectly and make it all the more emotional. This VN is simply wonderful and probably the best to come onto Steam.\n\n11/10 - Would cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ again","November 16, 2015","true","14.8"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

That should be enough for you to buy the game :^)...\nOn a more serious note,\nthe game costs more than the first part but I guess Watanagashi is a little longer than Onikakushi. It is worth at its full price.\nThe "graphics" didn't change, the characters are still as cute as they were. (Rikaaaaaaaa Meoww)\nNew ost themes appeared which is quite good, I was getting irritated by the citadas haha.\nAnd when it comes to the story, well, the game can make you laugh but also make you feel very uneasy. If you liked the first part you would surely enjoy this one as well, the chapter 2 is more focused on the Sonozaki family as you can guess and you get to know more about the plot!\nProbably the best visual novel you could ever buy.\nNow I'm just sitting there waiting for chapter 3.\nHnnnnhghh.","November 29, 2015","true","16.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","21","24","4","0"

So unlike before I knew exactly what I was in for when I started playing the second arc of the series, Watanagashi. That foreknowledge still didn't ruin the experience though. If anything, it only heightened the sense of dread because I knew exactly how messed up this would turn out.\n\nWatanagashi introduces a new character, but also heavily involves the cast that you met before, with Mion in particular standing out. While much is similar to Onikakushi, much is different as well - particularly how things turn out in the end. Even so, if you have played the first chapter (and you should), then you have some idea where this is headed. Except... you don't.\n\nAnnnd... I think that's all I will say because spoilers. But the gist of it is... I liked Watanagashi quite alot. More than Onikakushi, though that might just be because of my bias towards the "answer arc" for this, Meakashi, which is probably my favorite part of the entire series. Can't wait for that, or really the rest of the series to be honest. I hope they can release them faster. :o\n\nAnyway, if you have played Onikakushi... play this too. Right now. Then, when you are done, prepare yourself for what follows: Tatarigoroshi... and much more. o_o\n\nMy fingers hurt. :(","January 11","true","16.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","16","16","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wilko1/recommended/410890/","Wilko1","Wilko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wilko1/","368 products in account","Watanagashi was a complete and utter mind f**k. There were many moments where I was absolutely stunned and could do nothing but sit in disbelief with my mouth agape.\n\nHigurashi when they cry - Watanagashi Is the second chapter in the Higurashi series. The basic premise is that: protagonist Keiichi Maebara recently moved to a small village named Hinamizawa in the countryside. The story starts about a month after he moved to the village and he had just gotten settled in.\nSince this is the 2nd chapter, less time is spent introducing the reader to the world and characters.\nThe mood start off happy and light hearted to get the reader invested in the characters, then gradually become sinister.\n\nStory & Characters: Though the story is faster paced compared to Onikakushi, it still unfolds quite slow. It wasn't so slow to bore me. In fact, I think it's better for it. Because the story develops slowly and has a lot of Slice of Life moments during the opening chapters, It forces you to become closely attached to the characters. This make the later half of the story all the more brutal. Because the characters are so relatable. Their interactions were enjoyable to read about, and often hilarious. I got so invested in the characters that bad things happening to the characters were pretty upsetting.\n\nThe writing is great. Almost everything written about has a deeper meaning, if you were to re-read the story, you would see lots of clues hiding in plain sight. This is the kind of story where you aren't given a concise answer to the mystery, and the reader is supposed to look at the clues and come up with their own theory as to what the answer to the mystery is. (However, there is a "correct" answer). There are also many red herrings, so you are sometimes getting thrown off.\n\nStory: 9/10\n\nArt & Graphics: The art style of the sprites looks good. The characters all have interesting designs. However my complaint is that often, the sprite doesn't match the descriptions of the characters facial expressions. This[i.imgur.com] Is apparently Rena with an intense stare XD. This is common with most of the characters. However it isn't a huge deal.\nAnother complaint, is the background images are just photographs put through a filter to appear more... cartoonish/cell shaded? Anyway, when Onikakushi released on steam, it didn't take a month before someone released a mod which used the PS3 Sprites and Backgrounds. They will likely release a similar mod for Watanagashi.\n\nOne of the major issues, is the way the text is displayed. In most visual novels, the text appears in a text box at the bottom of the screen, and is usually titled with the speakers name. However, in Higurashi, The text takes up large portions of the screen, often covers the sprites and doesn't show the speakers name. Sometimes you don't know who is saying what. It becomes less of a problem later on. Because each character has a unique ways of speaking. But still, it can be really confusing. I hope to see a UI mod in the future.\n\nArt: 7/10\n\nMusic & Sound: The music is well made. The music does it's job, and can be atmospheric. During some of the creepy moments, you almost don't notice the music. The visual novel is so immersive, it all blends together. The music is pretty catchy, and I never found the music to get boring. Most of the tracks loop seamlessly.\nThe sound effects are used really well. They added a lot to the atmosphere along with the music. On more than one occasion I even jumped. I also was legitimately creeped out and glanced behind me a couple of times. It's great to read after midnight.\n\nMusic & Sound: 7.5\nOverall, this chapter is slightly better than the last. The last chapter had more Slice of Life content, and this one had more disturbing, s**t hitting the fan moments. As stated earlier, the pacing is faster. So if the pacing of the first one bored you, this one should be a more interesting read. Though, it still takes quite a while to get started. So if you are an impatient reader, and don't want to invest a few hours into a story before it kicks into full gear, then this visual novel may not be for you. Most people agree that the Higurashi Visual Novels are better than the anime (I share this opinion). However, if you are the impatient type, I would recommend buying the anime instead. As the Anime is still quite good. You can usually get the DVD from Ebay, or Amazon at a fair price.\n\nVisual Novel Length: 15-20 hours\n\nOverall: 8/10 Would write a review longer than that which I am reviewing again XD.","November 16, 2015","true","51.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

If you loved Onikakushi (I know I did), then you're sure to love this one as well. If you haven't read through Onikakushi, go pick it up for a few dollars. Trust me, it's money well spent. Watanagashi gets into the mystery a little faster than Onikakushi did, since it doesn't have to establish characters as much as the first chapter did. However, there is a new character in this one, so still expect plenty of set-up before the madness begins. Also, the story this time around is a bit less mysterious. Onikakushi ended on a really weird note (trust me, this one does too), but having the knowledge from the first chapter really seems to make puzzle pieces fit a bit better. Overall, though, still plenty of mystery to go over, and you get a MUCH more detailed look into the past of Hinamiza. Trust me, it isn't pretty.\n\nThe only negatives I can give this game are a few typos here and there, but with work this dense, that's always going to happen. It's not something a patch can't fix either!\n\nOh, and in case you are new to this series and are on this page, Higurashi has no interaction when it comes to gameplay. I see so many people getting upset that it doesn't have branches, but honestly, there's so much mystery here that you're sure to play it through more than once! I know I am! Trust me, it's still worth it even without the choices.\n\n10/10\nJust fantastic.

Regardless, it's still an interesting, attention-grabbing and suspenseful story that's highly recommended to anyone who read the first chapter, has seen the anime or is a general horror fan (starting with Onikakushi is pretty much essential due to the way the story is structured)\n\nThe story kept my attention throughout and has been practically marathoned as I wasn't able to stop until it was over.\nHowever, it did have a few flaws that impacted its enjoyment.\nI found a number of character actions, mainly of the narrating protagonist, to be unrealistic and highly irrational. I understand that emotion and impulse heavily affected his choices and motives, but some of the decisions he makes near the vn's end as well as ways in which he reacts to what's going on seemed highly unbelievable and far from what any human being would do, no matter the situation or their feelings towards others involved. Who in their right mind would show so much sympathy towards a recently revealed mass murderer and follow her into the secluded crime scene alone? Or go outside at night to meet her after she tried to torture them to death? If I was Keiichi, I would feel nothing but disgust and resentment towards Mion. The vague "demon" explanation for her actions didn't feel like enough to change my view of her as a character in this arc, and the concept of heartbreak caused by Rena being given the doll in no way justified her development as a character/sadistic murderer\nAnother issue I felt was present in this game, which was more apparent than in the first, was the repetitiveness of music at certain points, especially during longer scenes when the same track would loop many times despite my reasonably fast reading.\n\nThose points asside, I still highly recommend the game and appreciate the good translation as well as vastly improved character art.","January 18","true","10.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Pick it up as a series though: don't start with Chapter 2, start with Chapter 1, which can be found [here on Steam], if anybodies interested.\n\nIn a bit more detail:\nWhilst keep in mind that I'm only as familiar with Higurashi as far as the remade chapters are, as I never played the original VN, read the manga, and have only watched 2 arcs of the show too long ago for me to remember, at this stage I'm willing to call Higurashi a marvel of storytelling - and I like to think I'm pretty picky, as a few people I've probably annoyed could attest.\n\nAs a series so far, the 'progressive mystery storytelling' I want to say, as dumb and questionable-english-teacher as it probably sounds, is nothing short of sensational. Onikakushi provided something of a more narrow context to what's going on in Higurashi, with the author having known full well that it was the first installment and written as such, whilst Watanagashi has offered something much broader with even a little bit of closure this time. Much like how I mentioned Onikakushi was written like the first installment, Watanagashi was written as a sequel, and it does an amazing job at that: the first half of the chapter, whilst being cheerful and bright much like Onikakushi's first half, this time is littered with ambiguous little statements which are easily understood with knowledge of the events of Onikakushi that are difficult to tell apart as genuine hints or red herrings; additionaly, the first half of the story took a, series considered, interesting approach to keeping it interested and tossing about your feelings, all of which then had very serious and useful implications in the later half which I wont even begin to go into. The second half of the story was bloody sensational: whilst Onikakushi was all about having you feel genuine terror and really driving the mystery and reality of it all home, Watanagashi expanded on what was going on and felt more like a murder mystery than the raw psychological horror Onikakushi was - although it's still defiantly something of a psychological horror, so don't chill out just yet - it was done in such a way that really nicely expanded on what was revealed in Onikakushi; I'd probably just ramble if I went into detail like i probably am already, but a good summary is 'progressive mystery storytelling' done really well.\n\nThe overall conclusion of the chapter is another topic alltogether. With what I have information-wise on the story so far, it was executed incredibly well. Whilst I don't want to say anything that might ruin it for you, here's what I sent to a friend of mine on Snapchat:\n"at least [spoilers]"\n"i guess"\nA little bit later\n"OH [Steam Community Guidelines] WHAT"\n"OH [Steam Community Guidelines] MO"\n"[Steam Community Guidelines] BACK UP"\n"REVERSE"\n"SPIN THE [Steam Community Guidelines] BACK"\n[3 messages of spoilers]\n"[Steam Community Guidelines] I HAD CLOSURE"\n"NU UH"\n"I [Steam Community Guidelines] K N E W"\n\nAs far as the additions with the remakes go, whilst restricted primarily to the translation and new sprites, they're both amazing. I spot all of 1 typo when when I was playing through which is probably already patched anyway, and the new spirtes can be... quite frankly, terrifying. If you played Onikakushi, I'm fairly sure you know what I mean. ;-;\n\nMy only real gripes with Watanagashi and Higurashi so far really is that a few of the pieces from the soundtrack - specifically, 'Fascism' and sort of 'Dawn''s harmony line - and the UI.\n\nThe pieces I mentioned had 2005 .midi-tier horns shamelessly blaring that put Touhou's to shame. Even with Higurashi turned kinda down like I do with most games, it was loud enough to mess with my earbuds - albiet, cheap earburds - a bit, and generally weren't that great a choice and even a bit cringe-inducing as far as texture and, overall choice, really. That being said though, Higurashi does also feature 'Gear' which is an excellent piece in itself which I'd be almost willing to say makes up for that.\n\nAs far as the UI goes, I found it a little bit jarring when I came into Onikakushi, but was pretty chill with it by the time I got to Watanagashi. It's for this reason alone I said to have played 2 VN's earlier in the review: I came in off 98% on Katawa Shoujo and 100% on Fate/stay night and the UI was initially a bit of a turn off, to be a bit blunt. Playing through the VN's, though, the major quality of the content is defiantly worth the minor subjective turn off that's the UI, so it's entirely made up for and more, and Dawn featured an excellent piano melody line that sort of makes the .midi horn harmony line partly worth it.\n\nSo yeah, that's really all from me. The short version is really my summary that'd I'd normally put here. If you've read this far though, you've probably watched the anime, haven't you?\nI'll get there one day... when I get masculine enough to endure that one 'manicure' scene... ;A;\nA bit of an observation from me on the next chapter's release, I guess: Onikakushi was released on the 16th of May 2015, and Watanagashi was released on the 14th of November 2015, which might suggest an approximate 6-8 month wait for the next chapter?

I was expecting either a prequel or a sequel to the first game but this is neither.  Each chapter in the Higurashi series tells the same story, with a number of subtle things changed around to yield different events and outcomes.  Apparently there are four such chapters, with those that come after explaining the mystery behind the previous stories.  So far, it seems like you could play the chapters in either order, but I suspect they will have more impact if you play them in the numbered order and that was probably the intention of the developer.\n\nGiven how the series is set up, if you're reading this review and have played the first chapter already, you may be iffy about wanting to go through the same story again.  But although the characters and setting are the same, most of the minor events and major plot points are different, and it gives you more insight into what might be going on in the town.  In fact, it's different enough that it almost feels like someone wrote two different novels with the same premise, setting, and characters.  Only a few things stay the same, and I had no idea what was going to happen until it was all over, even though I had read the first chapter.\n\nIf you've played the first chapter, buy this too.  If you haven't and are interested in the Higurashi series, start with the first one.\n\nIn terms of the writing, I still think too much time is being spent on the cringe-worthy anime slice of life stuff.  I understand that it is needed to help us get invested in the characters and to contrast with the actual seriousness of the plot, but it is still very badly written.  I watch a lot of anime, and I've never seen slice of life writing that made me cringe as much as the stuff in Higurashi.  But maybe that is because of the story's main character?  His behavior at the end of the story is so unbelievable that it actually broke my immersion.  So maybe the school life stuff seems everything we see is from the point of view of the main character?\n\nOverall, it is a good visual novel and I recommend it highly.  If only the school life portions weren't so childish and ridiculous...","January 17","true","11.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

It's not bad but it's nowhere near the spook level of the first chapter, Onikakushi, which builds up to the bad scenes very well. This review's for the second chapter though so let me get to that..\n\nI feel like it's really difficult to read through much of this without having to take a long break before wanting to read it again. Some days it's nice to sit in silence and just read with some background music, but I felt like it was missing voices and the build up to the horrifying secrets of Hinamizawa. It leaves you desiring something more, and it doesn't have the same chilling effect. Highly recommend reading Ch.1 Onikakushi first, regardless.\n\nI would have liked if there was an option for alternative endings or at least SOME sort of thing that allowed you to choose between answers of what to do, as I feel that would have made it a fair bit more interesting as well. It just seems odd having one ending and nothing to play upon.\n\nAlso, be sure to download the voice (and graphics, if you so choose) patch if you want the story to be a little more interesting to follow. Since that unfortunately didn't come with the games, I'd probably give this a 7/10. Still an excellent story, and the spooky parts are definitely the most interesting read.","May 5","true","17.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

There was a lot of....drama within online communities regarding MG's release. I must say, though, that I was plesantly surprised.\n\n-Being someone who has read all of Higurashi, I can say that, YES, this translation/version does make it 100% possible for you to speculate what is happening.\n-The translation is not bad. I had more issues with lines in Watanagashi than I did in Onikakushi, however, overall, MG did a good job.\n-Music!! !! ! It only gets better from here on out.\n-Honestly? There was a lot of hate being spread around the internet regarding the new sprites. While I do dislike some (which is only natural), I think MOST look great; I am particularly fond of Rena's, Shion's, and Takano's. If you dislike the new sprites, the game contains an option to use the original Sprites (which are hilarious yet endearing in their own way).\n\nI'm not sure at what speed MG intends to release Higurashi, but I hope they do so at a decent speed so we aren't waiting years to finish reading the Steam release. I also hope that other 07th Expansion titles get the same treatment as Higurashi; without spoiling too much, I feel comfortable saying that Higurashi is part of a larger meta world that is explored in other VNs by the same author/artists/musicians. I'll be buying each chapter of Higurashi as it is released.","March 24","true","9.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The story feels larger this time. Also we get to know more aspects about the characters and the village Hinamizawa. As a fan of the anime adaptation, I enjoyed this chapter a lot, discovering all the minute but interesting details that were omitted in the anime.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros:\n+The twins theme of Mion/Shion is brilliantly explored. Depending on the context, the writing is funny, entertatining, or horrifying. Also, the twins theme echos well with the duality theme of village Hinamizawa (the bright and dark sides of the village).\n+The pacing has been improved. The last chapter has a very slow and sometimes boring start, featuring numerous club activities that have little contribution to the main plot. Not this time. The main story starts rather early on. Also, the story progresses smoothly, compared to the last chapter.\n+New background music an better BGM switching.\n+Sound effects are utilized better.\n+Rena still rocks!\n\nCons:\n-The reader will be introduced to the curse of Oyashiro-sama in a boring exposition... for the second time ... as if we hadn't got enough in the last chapter.\n-The thoughts of the protagonist are written in a really repetitive fashion.\n-Although this is chapter dedicated to the character Mion, I cannot find any new portraits for Mion (aside from Shion of course), which is really disappointed.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend buying it at full price.

In this VN, you're basically reading a novel with pictures, backdrops, music and sound effects thrown in for good measure. I think it makes good use of those elements to help sell the story by setting the mood for the reader, but your results may vary.\n\nI enjoyed the anime series a while ago, and I continue to enjoy these VNs as they come out. They flesh out the anime's story which came out at a breakneck speed. On this 'replay', I also have to credit the writers on how far ahead they thought about certain story elements while using misdirection. I don't want to spoil the storybecause that's part of the fun of murder mystery stories.\n\nLast time, I wrote down a list of Things I Learned in Hinamizawa. My list was considerably longer, but I narrowed it down to the ten I thought would best fit the events of the game and my impressions.\n\n- Learn to see things from other people's point of view, or risk exploitation when they use this ability against you.\n- Keep fighting until the last minute. "As soon as you give up, it's all over."\n- It is just as important to talk about your feelings as it is hard to do so.\n- When you are trying to patch things up with someone, don't assume everything is alright just because you are on speaking terms again.\n- Ghost stories will never go out of fashion, for better or worse.\n- Do not underestimate mankind's capacity for cruelty to what he deems less than himself.\n- Lying is much harder than telling the truth. You can't keep the fake facts straight forever\n- Someone else might have to pay the price for your mistake, even when you really want to take responsibility for it.\n- You might not like what you find, but you must always persue the truth\n- Sometimes a person really is too far gone to help.

The story does a really great job of luring you into a false sense of security with a calm and serene life in a small village playing with your friends only to blindside you when everything gets dark and terrifying quick. This series features a deep story with addictive characters all while keeping you unnerved and questioning everyone around you.\n\nAs someone who watched the anime first, being able to see what the main character is thinking that leads to his actions and choices through this game really expands on the overall story I loved.\n\nWhether you're new to the series or not this is very much worth picking up, and I love seeing it on steam.

Although I didnt find it to be at all as scary as Onikakushi, Watanagashi had a much better balance of tence, terrifying story telling, and normal slice of life. In Onikakushi, the first half of the game is straight up, through and though slice of life comedy, and the second half was pure teror and nightmare fule. Watanagashi on the other hand was a lot more of a mix straight from the begining, giving the game a more consistant feel over all.\n\nAnyways, great game, cant wait to read the next one.","December 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I've already seen a few people in the Steam community who are nearing the answer. If you've already read Onikakushi-hen, buying this next installment and continuing to support the new translation is definitely worth your time.","December 5, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I had set my sights on a character as the vilian behind it all and as i said i thought i knew what was gonna happen so i wasn't scared, till i came to a certain point and everything came crashing down, i didn't know what was happening anymore, i just stared at the screen trying to make sense of what has been told to me........\n\nAfter awhile i thought i made sense of everything but till the last second of the playthrough the game kept suprising me AND ruining my calm thoughts of being in control/knewing what was gonna happen and that was truly terrifieng.\n\nI really enjoyed higurashi Ch.2 Watanagashi with the SUPERB writing and can't wait for the third chapter and i think everyone should read this masterwork, i don't think my review is good enough to influence anyone to buy the game but if u enjoy mystery (and reading ofcourse) this is a must buy!","February 29","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a fan of the anime series and want the embellishment of the visual novel, this will provide. But if you're expecting the masterful storytelling in the first chapter, you'll be disappointed.\nI'd still reccomend it, if only to lavish more praise upon the series.

This chapter felt like the pacing was perfect and when I watched the anime I never realised how much they truly missed in the games but trust me if you're playing the games first time round there's a lot the anime didn't touch including really important parts. This is really a character-defining arc and it's really horrorific and tragic. You really feel for the characters and it's truly sad what happened. This arc is full of a bit of both worlds. Horror and comedy, not really two genres that mix but somehow higurashi does this to perfection. The only thing that could really make the game better is voice acting but even without you still get enough sounds through cicadas and well-placed music. (Would take this game home if it had physical releases). 9/10, recommend any avid higurashi fans of the anime or manga to give this a try (given you've played the first chapter).","June 3","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
