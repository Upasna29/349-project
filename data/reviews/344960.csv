Difficulty reaches from very easy to really tough. Graphics and sound  emphasize the "indiana jones" setting and lead to a unique playing experience. Definitely a recommendation!\n","April 4, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Most important thing to note- The main focus of the game is the puzzles, not action or adventure or the storyline.\n\nIt is definitely repetitive and some of the puzzles are very easy, but sometimes collecting everything can be quite challenging. The blocks that can only be moved once add to the difficulty levels, sometimes you need to restart the level several times in order to move just those blocks into the right places.\n\nEach individual level is very short. I play a couple when I have some time, while drinking coffee or waiting for something to cook. It is not a game that should be played every day or for hours on end.  Playing a couple levels a couple times a week also stretches out the gameplay. Steam says I've played 4.2 hours over 2 months or so, and I've only just completed the first world.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple- I use both the keyboard and the mouse depending on which blocks I need to move.  Because I often have long time periods away from the game, the simplicity helps when I return to playing.  I spelling errors don't really bother me because there's very few messages during gameplay,\n\nIf you like puzzles, this is a cute, quick game to fill some free time.","December 19, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The puzzles aren't hard enough or clever enough to really stand out on their own, and the games lacking aesthic doesn't help the fact that you think you're playing a game that was really designed for the IOS. Several of the puzzles lack real good design which is critical for a puzzle game, and I was bored to sleep by the time I made it to the second set of levels. I'd pass on it.\n\n+:\n-Multiple levels of success is available so those who are OCD about collecting everything will have to think a bit more.\n-Won't frustrate to the point of keyboard smashing, controller throwing.\n-Every now again, a puzzle does something interesting and unique with the elements it has.\n\n-:\n-Doesn't introduce new mechanics in a timely manner: gets boring rather quickly.\n-Some puzzle elements serve no purpose, as in, there's only one thing you can do with them and that's it, you can't use them to fail, and the only move it to succeed. Gives a false feeling of doing something important, when it fact, you made no real choice.\n-Lack of useful controls such as a button to restart are present.\n-Visuals don't help the experience, stand out like a sore thumb and certain points. Controls and options make the game seem like it was a mobile game (really only relies on the mouse). But no mobile game to be found from what I can see.\n-Not unique in any way, and given the tons of puzzle games out there that are, it's hard to justify to get this game over a series of cheap ones on sale.\n-Obvious Misspellings that stand out. Seems like it might have been translated.\n-Generic Music\n\nFor more first Impressions and Gameplay Footage: http://youtu.be/1K_N_samACs","April 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

I would hold off of buying this until a sale.\n\nYou can watch me playing it here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geF03Vy9ErU","April 6, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
