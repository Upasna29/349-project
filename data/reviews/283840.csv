Very balanced difficulty and mechanics while having much tighter pacing and level design. Stages tended to drag on in Kamui and RefleX but you never get that feeling here. Scoring system feels very natural and the sword attack (reminiscent of Radiant Silvergun) + special weapons are incredibly satisfying to use. The fully 3D graphics are understated but the game features excellent art direction and impressive effects in certain places. Music is an unabashed tribute to the iconic rocking themes of Hyakutaro Tsukumo from Technosoft fame. Highly recommended to anyone, not just genre fans. (I recommend disabling the shot + sword for special attack command, and the annoying pause when killing enemies with the sword that is enabled by default.)","December 11, 2014","true","3.0"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","1"

This is an awesome 2.5D shooter with a kicka$$ soundtrack that really gets you into the action.\nThe graphics do seem a little dated, but what this game offers in gameplay and fun factor will be more than enough to keep you playing and enjoying it. :)\n\nJust like in similar shooters, you get your bullet spread and homing lasers but this time you have a freakin' awesome laser cannon that locks onto foes from all angles so you can knock them senseless if they try to be slick and sneak up behind you. :P But I have to say that the laser blade is what does it for me. :D It locks and attacks close range foes at all angles just like the laser cannon and its capable of slicing through most enemy fire. Its almost like a shield and weapon all in one. But it's strong point is when fighting tough foes and bosses and moving in with the laser blade and pounding them down to size! It's awesome!!! xD\n\nThis game plays smooth, looks great and is a lot of fun but don't be fooled. This game is not easy! You will find a very good challenge here even on Normal difficulty. Swarms of foes and enemy fire from all angles and crazy camera movements will sometimes make you dizzy trying to catch up to what is happening. LOL. xD\n\nIf you are a fan of shooter games, you should definitely try this one. You won't be disappointed. ^ ^","January 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

KAMUI asks you to dance between twin layers while RefleX has you constantly switch between offense and defence to reflect projectiles back at your enemy. ALLTYNEX’s catch is figuring out whether you’re going to play safe and shoot down things from the edge of the screen or charge in swinging. Be brave, be good or be lucky and boss fights can last seconds as you position yourself in a manufactured safe-spot right in front of their face and hack away. There’s something so satisfying about watching an enemy fighter craft quadruple in size by firing robotic tentacles that latch massive frigates to its sides only to then get effortlessly slashed into scrap regardless. In finding yourself trapped in a corner and realising you can just slice the smaller bullets out of the air and squeeze through the projectile wall unscathed.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12447/pc/alltynex-second/review.html","January 6, 2015","true","4.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I have played to many shoot em ups since then and I have found only a few worth playing. Of course Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga, Gradius V and Gaiden and so on. Alltynex second is clearly worthplaying. It has good graphics, good music and smart gameplay that includes a silvergun-style sword.\n\nAs hapens with Ikaruga, it is a bit too short, but I strongly recommend it. By the way, I am enjoying very much Reflex, so I should say that the tales of alltynex package is a good choice.","December 31, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Utilizing two different weapon systems (your standard bullet spray and a blade system used to destroy enemy bullets and mid-sized enemies with ease), two different special attacks, a unique scoring system, decent graphics and a nice soundtrack make this one of the best, if not THE best shmup you can find on Steam.

Much like the others it's an extremely difficult, well crafted shmup that will give you hours of challenge. If you're a fan of the genre I recommend it wholeheartedly. If not, you should probably pass.","May 24","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And with gems like Ikaruga, Dodonpachi, Batsugun and Radiant Silvergun around, that's a tall order.\n\nThis game gives the shmup formula a kick in the balls in the form of extremely polished action visual and gameplay feedback, with the music to match and a badass laser sword with which you can cut bullets or combo enemies into pieces. All with a healthy serving of anime flair, of course.\n\nTrust me, your jaw will be dropping in regular intervals during the course of the average playthrough.","May 5","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
