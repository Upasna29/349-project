The controls are tight, the camera system works well, the powerups are pretty fun, but there are only 9 holes right now (launch day; 3/25/16). I mean, what is here, is great. I am excited to play some local co-op this weekend. There is no online multiplayer.\n\nI played through the existing 9 holes twice in about half an hour, solo style. It is probably the best minigolf game I've played.\n\nI am going to give this a thumb's up for being fun for a mere three bucks, BUT you need to be aware that while the developers may add more holes, it very well could never happen.","March 25","true","3.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

It was fun to play through as a family (local) and I suspect we will play through quite a few times more before we're bored of it.\n\nThe only real downside is that there are only 9 holes, but the 9 holes are all very nice and for 2.99 (half of a trip to Starbucks) I can't really complain.  Hopefully there will be more holes added in the future.  Even if they're 1.99 per 9 hole DLC, I'd buy it.\n\nGood work.  Fun game.","March 25","true","4.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Solid control system and worth the $3.\n\nI look forward to more holes and a custom map editor that the developer has mentioned is on their to-do list.","March 25","true","1.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

All though I do recommend this game at a 3 dollar price tag. I could go through the only course in the game in about 20 minutes. It would of been nice to have a cpu player playing with me but it is only solo. And if there is cpu I can't figure it out. That I find dissapointing. The course is well designed. and it is fun for 20 minutes but unless you have friends that have the same game you might as well save your 3 bucks. 5/10\n\n","March 27","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"Golf with Friends" just came out also, it has 2 full courses, online multiplayer, and physics customization. This game read multiplayer on the right but is only local co-op. Get either "Golf with Friends" instead or the new "Tower Unite" game that comes out in April.

Please increase the price, so that you can afford to spend more time building levels.\n\nSolid, worth more than $3, and the only downside is the tiny course selection.\n\nThere are 3 things that 3D Ultra did better, though:\n- Your power meter is too precise. Take out the notches, because they make the courses too solvable.\n- Click-through ball-settling, please!\n- Deserves more content, and it'd be worth paying more money to get it.","April 23","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm constantly looking for local co-op/multiplayer games to play with friends and this game while casual also can get pretty competitive. It's a great game.","June 4","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
