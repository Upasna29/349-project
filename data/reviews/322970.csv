Not two. Game is not overly difficult at all. Pixel hunting and  cursor control seem to be the most challenging part. Many of the puzzles are based upon ideas that have been used before. Mayan math and the dreaded minesweeper are two of the most prominent. Played most of it in previous games over the years. The graphics are just as old as most off the puzzles. Not a bad game but not a game where you say " WOW" .  Probably a good challenging game for newbies to the genre. Hardcore adventure gamer's will find it to be tolerable. The minesweeper at the end is just a bad way to waste time in the game.

Perhaps they would be passable by 2005 standards. I'd swear Secret Files: Tunguska looked better and that was nearly a decade ago.\n* False advertising ("stunning" graphics, "intuitive" interface)\n* Terribly short over all (can be finished in < 6h)\n* Overpriced given what you actually get for your money.\n\nIf I had to describe it in one sentence, it's a shoddy, low-budget cash grab riding on the name of a once notable game designer that overpromises and fails to deliver a worthwhile experience.","December 29, 2015","false","9.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

Unfortunately, the lack of a save system means that you will have to play through the entire game again to revisit those gems. (Achievement Hunters beware: one achievement is granted for completing a certain puzzle quickly, so take longer than the threshold and prepare for your full replay)\n\nThe game appears to auto-save whenever the voicework kicks in... Oh, yeah, that checkmark under "Full Audio" is overstating things. While there is "voice acting" (more on that in a moment), it only occurs alongside scene transitions or via a specific kind of item. The rest is unvoiced... which I failed to notice right away, missing some helpful tips in the bottom right corner as I was experimenting with the 3D perspective.\n\nThat said, the game might actually be improved by silence. The sound quality is perfectly fine, but the performances are flat, merely reading the lines aloud, so characters experiencing fear and stress come off as pleasantly calm... Bye-bye immersion... Also, I imagine that the script itself was translated into English, which would explain some of the stilted dialogue and odd syntax.\n\nI did experience some minor bugs... or, perhaps, amazing superpowers on the part of the protagonist, as he could occasionally see through solid objects or interact with items that were left two screens ago... but nothing gamebreaking.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend for puzzle adventure gamers, who have not already been turned off by any of the above. The puzzles were fun, the graphics were fine, and the story was occasionally intriguing, though it does end on a bit of sequel bait.

It's one of those games where you/the main character is alone and not aware of why he is in this very place.\n\nSo why no recommendation? Simple: The developers messed up he interface in the worst of ways. So (as usual in point-n-click games) you move the mouse around and see some icon that signifies how there might be something interesting or necessary. To make it short: You need to be most concentrated to actually interact with items: While the mouse pointer stays where it is supposed to be the interface wobbles around. Yes, indeed: You point to the "pick up" icon and without any regularity it switches on/off and almost every time even other icons suddenly are activated (e.g. "interact" which looks like "look at") without your mouse pointer hovering above it. To get rid of this you have to move the mouse around untill by accident the desired icon is highlightened. Absolutely annoying.\n\nI still remember "Syberia II", a really nice point-n-click game, though many disliked the not-funny not-classic-adventure style and wonder how they came up with such a buggy interface.","March 26","false","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's launcher has an option to customize controls, which is misleading because it's mouse-only. As a result, I spent the first several minutes mashing buttons on my keyboard and becoming frustrated because nothing seemed to be working. Further frustrating is that it's possible to accidentally click through the tooltip that tells you to how to navigate the controls. My first ten minutes in-game were completely wasted. I started over twice before understanding that holding down left-click over some items on-screen opens a wheel menu at the cursor.\n\nA lot of the information you'll need to complete the puzzles isn't visible in the default camera view, so you'll have to contort your view somewhat in order to find the key items you need. The camera controls are only unlocked sometimes, though, which leads to frustratingly inconsistent controls. Mousewheel down is a particularly frustrating example - sometimes it means "zoom out", sometimes it means "leave this area". Eventually you'll figure out how to work with the controls, but even after several hours in-game it doesn't feel familiar.\n\nProbably half of the key items you'll pick up present their own puzzles that you have to solve before you can use them. If you spend enough time examining each object (and checking the help/tips) you can probably figure out how to use it. Prepare to spend a lot of time figuring out what obscured detail is preventing you from taking an intuitive path to your goal, though. Have you ever had to use a socket wrench on a ladder before? I haven't. But your character will, and not for any good reason either. The game wants you to make twisting motions with your cursor to turn keys, unfasten bolts or open lids, but these motions feel out of place with the point-and-click style of the rest of the game, and they frequently don't work correctly on the first attempt.\n\nThe puzzles cover a pretty wide range of difficulties, from 4x4 sliding-tile-puzzle to Mayan kind-of algebra, but for the most part the game has a help/tips system that gives you a new clue every few minutes so that you don't get stuck. It'll also let you skip a puzzle once, so that if you get completely stuck the game's not ruined. You can only use it once, though. Unfortunately, some of the puzzles don't make any sense, and the only way I was able to get past those was either by brute force (combination locks) or by looking up the mechanics or solution, both of which really spoil the fun.\n\nSome of the mechanics are downright bad. There's more than one instance where you'll have to scour the screen for a nearly invisible button or item, and you won't be able to progress until you find it.\n\nAt some point in the game there's a large cylindrical minesweeper-type puzzle that I just can't get past. I've uncovered every non-trap square and marked every trap square, but I don't know what's missing to trigger the completion and after three attempts on just that puzzle I'm not sure that I care enough to try again.\n\nI don't know whether I'll ever finish this game. I feel like I gave it a good effort, and if I'd been able to finish it I think it might have been a good buy at $12.99. As-is, I just feel frustrated.\n","May 30, 2015","false","6.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

Sadly, I found this game quite boring to play.  The biggest issue for me was the severe limitation of movement.    It is basically a pixel-hunting point-and-click adventure, reminiscent of the "Escape"-style games.  Each chapter is basically a room you have to escape from.  The voice acting is terrible, and the journal entries you find along the way did little to make me care about the characters or the facility.  Compare that to Portal 2, where the humor and the post-apocalyptic story kept you going at a fast pace.  This game is glacial. If you miss a tiny little clue, you are basically stuck, and can't continue or do anything else until you find it.  This game might be worth $5, but I paid $13 and I felt robbed.  Poor story, boring puzzles, weak characters, and almost no freedom of movement.","May 30, 2015","false","8.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/322970/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Subject 13 is a quaint little game. I think it's a little pricey for its content, but otherwise a rare gem that is definitely worth consideration. I've broken my review for it down into positives and negatives so you can weigh if you think it is worth the money.\n\nPositives:\n- Really ingenuitive puzzles that will wrack your brain, while still having logical elements. A puzzle halfway through the game involving a compass really didn't make much sense to me, but the others were all well-designed.\n\n- A brilliant twist on your standard point-and-click adventure game with items; you actually have to examine the items in your inventory such as containers and revolve them in a three dimensional space in order to find secret compartments and such.\n\n- The dialogue has full voicing with believable actors.\n\n- The art style is rather unique, and a refreshing change from many other games released recently. This certainly helps with the immersion in the game.\n\n- There's both Steam trading cards and Steam achievements. The achievements are both reasonable and logical, and have a good balance between difficulty and obtainability.\n\nNegatives:\n- The game is too short. Puzzles are a key aspect to this game, and without using any in-game hints or resorting to any sort of walkthrough, I was able to complete the game in under 5 hours. For a game priced at NZ $24, that's not really good value for money.\n\n- There are a few game-breaking bugs. You have to 'zoom in' to see the majority of puzzles up close. For some reason, occasionally you will be unable to zoom out afterwards. This means you will be stuck looking at the puzzle, even if you have already solved it. You will be unable to progress through the game without saving and quitting, which will sometimes set you back a fair distance. In conjunction with this, there is a secondary bug in the third chapter where the testimonials will sometimes disappear or not spawn at all after reloading a checkpoint. This would be an annoying bug in itself, but coupled with occasionally being forced to restart a chapter, it can be devastating if going for the associated achievement!\n\n- The weak storyline. There was no general objective. Having completed the game, I still haven't discovered 'the real story', as advertised. While progressing through the puzzles, you run into distorted images of your dead wife. There's absolutely no explanation of why you keep seeing images of her or information regarding how she died. For the matter, there's not even a backstory to the protagonist or an explanation of how he ended up in the facility on the island in the first place.\n\n- Poor graphics for the release date. I personally am a fan of the classic art style, but the game should definitely not be advertised as having "stunning 3D rendering" as a "key feature". When you're using over 10 million polygons per scene whilst running Direct X 12 (like some other games released roughly the same time), *then* you can advertise "stunning 3D rendering".\n\nSummary:\nThis is a quaint game built by a small-time solo developer, rather than a large company. While the price is a bit high in relation to the length of the game, Subject 13 is definitely a game that you should give a chance if you can grab it on special. The puzzles are a step-above those in similar games that have been released by fully-fledged companies, and the high cost will hopefully go to cover the developer creating some more gems in the future.","January 22","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In chapter 3, I had many objects in my inventory, and I had a pretty good idea of what needed to happen to make them work with each other, but the sequence the game wants you to do it in is a bit maddening. Many times I would be clicking on the correct sequences, and because of poor visual queues and awkward ways you have to rotate or manipulate objects, I would have to find the solutions by clicking randomly to get the object to perform correctly. The "logic" of puzzles also wasn't always clear to follow. The game does have an interesting story, compelling mysteries and an interesting setting. I would recommend it, but does come with design flaws that take away from what could have been a great "point and click adventure" experience.","August 10, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last puzzle is an absolute doozy but even though it took me ages I still felt satisfied. The fact that you need to spin the camera to find hidden latches or buttons is great for a traditional adventure game but there are some rough patches in the game that would have benefited from some ironing out. The voice acting sometimes matches the written text but often not. The graphics are very beautiful but again could be refined somewhat.
