I will finally be able to complete it! I remember it wasn't easy because it's a long game and my ZX-Spectrum tape deteriorated before I found out all the clues!\nI highly recommend this game to any fan of mistery solving games.\nFor fans of retro games, it IS retro! the same gameplay we experienced in the Spectrum but with modern conveniences such as load and save.","May 19","true","0.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rubenio751/recommended/474030/","Rubenio751","Saint Rubenio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rubenio751/","53 products in account","The perfect remake for the old spanish classic. It takes the good things of the classic game from the 87 and improves them, and fixes the bad things (such as the horrible difficulty). it's also free, so I'd say it is a must have.\nIt still suffers from being an adventure game, and as such it features a lot of walking, but the clues are common enough that you don't need a guide that much, and the story and atmosphere are good enough to keep you hooked up until the end (it is much better than in the original game too, which didn't really go too deep into the story of the book and film because of the technical limitations of the spectrum computers).\nAlso props for the protagonist to be Sean Connery this time around. Even if it's less faithful to the book, he certainly looks less generic, and stands out a lot more in the crowd of holly (and not so holly) men that roam around the Abbey.","May 21","true","7.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It's pretty nice game over all, yet not without it's problems. There's a lot of walking. The main gameplay consists of walking to the right place at the right time to speak with the right character or get an item. And the character walks fairly slowly. On top of that, the monastery the game takes place in is rather non-euclidean as whenever you move from one screen to another the angel changes in a confusing way. This takes a lot of getting used to. Fortunately you can find a map to help you a bit.\n\nDespite these flaws, I recommend Abbey of Crime Extensum, as it is worth playing if you can get over these things. The story and the atmosphere are quite good. The graphics are excellent too. Plus, it's free. It is a slow-moving old school game.","May 22","true","7.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Game follows the plot from the Name of the Rose movie. Even the main character looks exactly like Sean Connery. Soundtrack is good, it is similar "bellringing" like in the movie. Moving is bit of clumsy. Sometimes AI was also clumsy and characters were blocking. This game has the best "monastery murder mystery" -athmosphere as possible.","May 19","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"
