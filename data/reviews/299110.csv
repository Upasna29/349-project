You get a picture and, underneath, a number of little spheres with tiny details of the picture. You have to find and click on those details in the picture. Hope you have a good eye. :)\n\n-  For HO lovers, there is a large amount of great hidden object scenes. Fun to look at and items are usually easily identifiable while being sneakily hidden. Sometimes I had to search around for a bit but I never had to use the hint button.\n\n-  Puzzles range from easy to manageable. There's nothing that should stump you.\n\n-  There's a bonus chapter. Though it's very brief, it leads to an artwork gallery.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-  The story is a bit creepy and disturbing. While this may be a pro for many, I'm placing it under cons because the plot is also confusing. I've played this game (and the bonus content) twice and I'm still not sure exactly what happened. :p  Maybe you're smarter than me though.\n\n-  Very very short game length.\n\n\n\nIf you find this on sale, I definitely recommend it to all you HO fans. Even though I couldn't wrap my head around the story - the voice acting, artwork, and hidden object scenes were a pure joy.","May 9, 2015","true","8.5"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","42","42","0","0"

That, I can say for a select few games in the HOG genre. I remember basically devouring the game within a couple of hours, due to its creepy and intriguing atmosphere, alongside the main character's otherworldly abilities. Theatre of the Absurd is an exceeding game for its genre.\n\nWe take a close look on Scarlett Frost - god, I wish there would be a series based on this character - , an occult expert who was invited to a remote castle to identify a dangerous occult object known as the Habsburg Cube, which is said to contain a powerful demon. Our employer/mysterious gentleman Dr. Corvus decides to throw a tantrum when Scarlett declares the item as a fake, and smashes the artifact to pieces at the opening scene. Then... yeah, you have guessed right: everything goes to hell, and yeah, the item WAS the real deal.\n\nNow Dr. Corvus is possessed by the said demon, and the whole castle has just became his playground. Following Dr. Corvus' last wish, Scarlett takes Bethany - his young and innocent daughter - to the bell tower, the only place that the demon's taint couldn't reach for unknown reasons. Now Bethany's soul is in grave danger, and above all things, Scarlett's right hand is infused with some uncanny, demonic energy which spells full sentences of advice out of nowhere, probably with an agenda of its own. Your immediate task is to wonder within the castle, and discover its many wonders and horrors in hopes of both finding means to protect Bethany and bring an end to this demonic infestation.\n\nAs I've stated at the beginning of my review, the atmosphere is grand. Every singular animation was a cross breed between Vertigo comics' eerie style with beautifully drawn gothic artwork. I was sold within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, both thanks to the story and the artwork. Voice acting is taken seriously, you can listen Scarlett making a comment on everything. Another charming factor is that the developers were fascinatingly attentive to detail. Considering Dr. Corvus himself was an occultist, all areas that you encounter are weaved with occult, mythological and historical references for your enjoyment. I know that I enjoyed it thoroughly. And the Theatre of the Absurd itself... No, I won't make a comment on that. Lets not spoil the experience for you, shall we?\n\nThe gameplay is fairly generic for a HOG. It is an adventure with hidden object scenes and puzzles. Nothing new in that department. What was both refreshing and intriguing is checking your arm for instructions and advices, and wonder whether it be in your best interest to follow it or not. Hidden object scenes are not the greatest, and puzzles are nothing extraordinary. It just takes some attention, is all. There is some backtracking, but the game itself is not that long anyhow so it won't bother you much.\n\nThere is a bonus content at the end to present us some more information about the mysteries within the Theatre of the Absurd, but as a fair warning: the ending is incredibly vague. There are scattered clues indicating Scarlett's relation with this odd family, but nearly nothing is explained. After completing the game, nearly half your questions shall remain unanswered. I'd love a sequel for this game. There is room for the story improvement and mysteries to be enlightened, if there would be future installments. I'll recommend the game based on the incredible setting, and original plot ideas. If you enjoy the HOG genre, or at least enjoy beautiful artwork, here is a sweet present for you.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 27, 2015","true","3.3"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

Even clicking descriptions, you have to wait for protagonist to finish saying "I have to put something in there"\nStory length is short. Finished game in less than 4 hours + 'bonus content' on Expert first time\nUI is not intuitive or consistent. Sometimes you drag an inventory item, sometimes you just click, sometimes you click lots for multiple items.. who knows until you have to try!\nThe Ugly:\nCollector's edition has extra content- they remind you on every screen in there and on your items (serious example: Ruby [Collectors Edition])\nStory didn't flesh out at all and don't really explain very much. Bonus content only serves to open more holes while badly plugging the ones you had finished with.\nNo extra features - no achievements, no cards, no side quests, no lore, no epilogue (I lie a little, you get to see... concept art after bonus is completed).\nFor people who know their HOG's:\n\nThis game is probably one of the lowest ranked HOG's I've seen in a long time. There are games in the Apple store for tablets that go for $2 that are better than this. The story is unengaging, short and unpolished; the puzzles either easy or annoying. This is the first time I've felt like skipping easy puzzles because I couldn't be bothered, as there was no motivation nor interest from story to encourage me, let alone some of them were very arduous.\n\nThe fact you can't skip most of the dialogue in the game, including 'monologues about what to do next' really kills your interest and since you're left with no epilogue or extra features makes you feel like the whole game was a chore with little to show for it. For $A5, you're not getting your money's worth. I would buy it at <$1 sale as it still had beautiful artwork and well, its still a HOG :)\n\nFor people who are new to HOG's (Hidden Object Games):\n\nThis is not one of the better ones on the market folks. There are much more fun HOG's on Steam that give you so many extra features that they're now generally accepted as standard including Steam Cards, side quests (e.g. extra hidden objects in different maps), achievements and more. It is especially important to note that this game did not have a very good tutorial nor really orientate you to what you're meant to do so it may not be the best one to start with or base your opinion of HOG's.","October 6, 2014","false","3.6"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","16"

I didn’t quite like the look of the hidden object scenes, the lighting and how things were blended. Admittedly a few things were blended in a little too well and despite me trying to never use hints in HOGs, in this one I had to a few times.\n\nI thought straight away as a snap judgement I wouldn’t enjoy it. But the above aside I quickly warmed up to this game and I actually enjoyed it.\n\nThe story is interesting. It was a lot more compelling than most of the HOGs I have been playing recently. At points I was actually trying to rush through the hidden object scenes just to progress further into the story. But with that said I wouldn’t say the conclusion was 100% satisfying. It may be me being a little picky but the ending didn’t make much sense to me and left me with a few questions. Although, given the general nature of HOG story lines, them being quite cheesy and half the time making little sense, I would say for HOG standards it was still decent.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy, there was nothing to challenging in there but it was still interesting to play. They were still fairly unique puzzles. In the puzzle and item combination/placing respect it’s a pretty straight forward game.\n\nThe art and the music is enjoyable and all in all I would say this is a decent HOG. If you are a fan of the genre this is definitely one I would recommend for the collection.\n\n\nTL;DR : Item blending is a bit questionable, interesting story, good music/art and fairly easy but unique puzzles. Would recommend for people who enjoy the genre.\n","March 8, 2015","true","4.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's especially worth it if you get it on sale. If you are looking for a hardcore challenge, though, this one is definitely not for you.\n\nNote: This is the Collector's Edition with bonus content. There's an extra mini-story to complete after the main story. However, it didn't offer much extra, and the last puzzle was just ridiculous. It was the only thing I used the strategy guide to get past.\n\nPros:\n- Detailed artwork. The concept art gets unlocked as bonus content when you complete the game.\n- Objects are not so hidden that they are impossible to find. Only a few of the objects might be confusing.\n- Decent variety of different types of puzzles along with the Hidden Object ones.\n- Puzzles can be solved by an average user. These don't require a savant or prodigy to solve.\n- Ambient effects and animation keep it from looking like still frames.\n- Hints and a complete "Strategy Guide" (walkthrough) are built-in if you do get stuck.\n- Sparkles to indicate when something in a location can be interacted with. This is especially helpful with all of the backtracking.\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat cheesy story and voice acting.\n- Lots of backtracking and re-use of previous scenes for Hidden Objects during the course of the story.\n- Use of shadows as objects.\n- The lighting effects in Hidden Object scenes can make it difficult to see certain objects. Sometimes I had to wait for the light to change in order to see something.\n- Fixed 4:3 aspect ratio. The in-game copyright says 2012, well past widescreen adoption, yet they didn't at least put in a decorative border.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

This was worth the $1.50 or whatever it was I paid for it. I got 3 nights' worth of entertainment out of it, which is about the perfect length for something like this.\n\nNone of the puzzles (including the last, bonus content ones) will stump anyone for a long time, but theres enough of a challenge that you don't always feel like it was SUPER easy. The story is good enough, and there's some variety in puzzles - though you can break all of them down into:\n\n1. Find hidden things in a picture\n2. Find where fragments belong in a picture\n3. Gather items and put them somewhere to unlock something\n4. Gather items and put them somewhere, then manipulate them to unlock something\n5. Manipulate something to unlock something\n\n\nIf you're a fan of the old point and click adventures, this is a reasonable game - best enjoyed when you just want to do some really casual puzzle solving, with your brain more or less turned off. The lack of complexity is countered by the lack of stupid mechanisms and minimal backtracking - I didn't feel like anything in the game was added to pad it out, either. Well, maybe a couple of the "find stuff in a picture" puzzles.\n\nThis game is like a jigsaw on a rainy day (if anyone remembers or still does stuff like that) - it's not life-changing, but it's entertaining enough.","May 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

Honestly I was expecting another average game as I have played some hidden object games before but wow it proved me wrong! This has to be one of my favorites. The art is great as with most in this genre, but the mood and feel surpasses most. It really draws you in. The soft music actually increases teh spooky part. Normally I don't mention the voice actors, but the woman's voice is well fitting. The story is intresting so far but thin (maybe it changes over the course of the game). Maybe I love this one so much because it is intense and in my favorite style: horror. Yup I love hidden object scenes with death things, weapons and severed limbs..\n\nA kewl extra is that at a certain point you come across a room that you can't open. Not untill you finish the main storyline as it holds the bonus contents. How kewl is that?\n\nOne lesser point on casual the puzzles are too easy.

The graphics are realistic, yet have a distinct gothic dread, amplified with some clever camera angles. Scarlett is fully voiced, and her doubts and fears also contribute a lot to the immersion. Not to mention that in the end the story is anything but a happy one.\n\nAs a game, it is, honestly, mediocre. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the puzzles or the hidden object scenes (unless you count the old-school item hiding mechanics “wrong”), but it just feels unpolished. If you played other games made by Silverback, you’ll probably know what I’m talking about as soon as you start this one.","November 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There is a decent lot to do, roughly three hours of content including bonus features for the Collector's Edition, which in my experience is pretty standard for this kind of game.\n\nThe puzzles are not horribly difficult overall, mostly involving collecting and assembling items, but there was enough variation through most of the game that I wasn't bored with it.  The hidden object scenes are detailed, well-drawn, and reasonably challenging; they weren't astronomically difficult, but were well above the difficulty level I normally see in this style of game.  I did not see any issues with click-precision that at least one other reviewer complained of; I had to click ON the objects to collect them and did not notice any severe misalignment.\n\nBoth the story and the voice acting were decent.  I didn't find myself constantly cringing, which is definitely a plus as I tend to be irrationally bothered by poor voicing.\n\nOverall, if you like this style of game, I would recommend giving it a go.  If five bucks is more than you want to pay, hold out for a sale and grab it then.  Either way, I personally thought it was worth it.","February 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As she says it is not, he break the item and a curse is released on him, Frost and the man's young daughter.\nMiss Frost now has to fix this, mostly to save the young girl. She collects items that help her on the way through hidden objects and and other minigames.\n\nThe game looks really good, and the music is fittingly atmospheric.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty good; varying between easy and not-too-frustratingly hard. This game uses the same HO scene more than once and does not remove the items found on the first go, other than the ones used to something before. There is a lot of backtracking and no option for teleporting.\nThere is a hint with fairly long cooldown, and there is a fitting 'punishment' for spamclicking the HO scenes.\n\nThe story is a bit confusing, though the bonus chapter that is unlocked after finishing the game partially explains some things, but much is implied rather than properly explained.\n\nThe voice acting is not the best, but not too annoying either. There are a few lines that get irritating as they are repeated a lot, either when location is opened or clicked on, that cannot be skipped.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and will probably play it again in the future.","May 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Requiesta de Silencia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncrownedPrince91/","242 products in account","I tentatively recommend this game to people who are open to point and click hidden objects games. It's fun and interesting with new mechanics introduced every so often to keep it lively but Theatre of the Absurd is really just one long fetch quest with a mostly unexplained plot and poor voice acting. Here's a bit of a breakdown:\n\nIt introduces new mechanics in the form of magic spells which you use to access other areas of the castles and solve puzzles that you couldn't otherwise. But the spells are limited in number and the puzzles you solve using spells are generally as involved as clicking on the spell and watching the puzzles solve themselves.\n\nEverything in this game is pushed by the drive to save a possessed girl named Bethany by collecting several bell fragments. But before that you have to collect sets of a bunch of other objects, some of which you find in hidden object puzzles and others you find just by clicking around randomly on the screen. There are a few non-hidden objects and non-fetch quest style puzzles, but those are limited in number.\n\nThe story is interesting enough to keep me entertained through it, but at the end of the day I'm left feeling starved. Hidden objects games generally have exceedingly beautiful artwork, soundtrack, and well developed storylines to compensate for their lack of real meaty gameplay. This game has 2 of those, and it isn't the story. The voice acting sure as hell isn't helping.\n\nI could forgive a lot if this were an indie game, but apparently it's not so there goes forgiveness out the window. I expect a lot better from a B class developer than this (it's not triple A developed but still). I can still recommend it for some of its intrigue and twists but only if you're able to put up with a lot of backtracking and have a lot of patience.\n\nYou can check out the first part of my let's play in the video below. I cover the core game but I don't cover any of the extra bits tacked on in the collectors edition on camera. I did, however, finish them off camera and that's what my Steam Review is based on.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6Dw2WUdcw","February 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I hesitated to buy the game when I read some of the reviews here but now I'm glad I did buy it.The game itself begins with a video. A demon has been released and you, as the hero, have to save the little girl in its grip. The player has the option to change from easy to moderate difficulty (more hints in this case), but if you want to solve all puzzles on your own, you don't have to ue the in-game hint option at all. There are a lot of "hidden object" puzzles. A list of objects is given and you have to find what is needed. The game is generally spooky, not scary, but demons jump at you and (maybe) you'll get surprised.\n\nI re-descovered my love for games like this some time ago when I played Syberia.  I tend to not watch videos or read too many comments before I buy a game because they influence my expectations. This game is a simple adventure, consisting of puzzles and clues. If you want to spend time solving riddles, go ahead. However, the story is not as intense as it could be, and thus buy this game if you have a love for puzzles, and not if you expect to play a visual novel.","September 19, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However, apart the fact that you're invited to identify an artefact that released a demon and that you're trying to save the daughter of the owner, that you've been infected by something and that you may be related to the mother's girl, I didn't find anything else interesting. I mean, how was I infected? Was the answer in the bonus chapter that I didn't finish because I've crashed? And seriously, the game is named after one part of the castle that comes out of the blue?\n\nAnyway, it's a standard hidden object game. Some objects are really hard to find. The puzzles are well-balanced. But I'm sorry. Playing someone without real expressions in the cutscenes, that seemed more a iceblock than anything else isn't something I like. I couldn't relate to the character, feeling out of the story.\n\nNothing is wrong with the soundtrack or the graphisms. I can even say that nothing is really wrong. The story isn't wrong per se. I understand the will to put some questions. But I expected to have them answered. And they weren't (unless they are in the bonus chapter).\n\nIf I have to recommend Theatre of The Absurd? Nope.

In practice, it is a good HOG game, it's mechanics work very well and every Hidden Object scene and mini game can be enjoyed thoroughly. Even though the art style is good looking, it could be better, due to the low resolution at which the game runs.\n\nI must say, for a HOG game, this title stands out from others, positively, due to it's atmosphere and creepyness. Basically, the main character, Scarlett Frost, is contacted by Doctor Corvus in order to confirm the existence of a mistical object, named Habsburg Cube, known to hold a demon. Due to a certain event, the demon is released and the doctor becomes possessed by the demon. Now it's up to you to save the doctor's daughter, Bethany, from the demon released by the cube.\n\nThe main character's voice acting is pleasant, but Bethany's voice not so much. The demon is an ugly figure with a withstandable voice.\n\nThe existence of a bonus chapter sheds some light about the Theatre of the Absurd's conundrums, but could well be just a part of the main game. Apart from the game being short, the story can be a bit confusing and, for the most part, just plain weird.\n\nOn the negative side, this title lacks achievements and trading cards. Almost no replayability, only if you really enjoy the game. And the ending is not really conclusive, leaving the player confused.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Theatre of the Absurd, not for it's story, nor for it's low resolution, but for the art style, Hidden Object sections, mini games, and for the game's atmosphere, which really can be original in this genre.","September 20, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonsbayne/recommended/299110/","dragonsbayne","DragonsBayne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonsbayne/","53 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this game. I don't scare easily for one so when I get horror games I don't scale it on the fear factor. I find this game more disturbing than anything, though... not scary or freaky. Shows you how desensitized I am. Also if you are spiritual in any way, you might find this game to be something that IS disturbing because it deals with a sort of demonic possession of a child who you are trying to prevent from being taken by a demon.\n\nStorywise it was okay. You arrive at this castle to discern whether an artifact the owner has in his possession is authentic. You say no but that only enrages the owner to which he decides to shatter it to pieces only to release the demon bound within. This demon then tries to possess a the child of the owner or take her away for it's nefarious deeds in which you now have to find a way to prevent her from being taken over and taken away. The girl can't be no more than maybe 7 years old. Your job now is to find 4 parts of a bell that will seal the demon away while protecting the girl from the demon in between you finding the parts. Because somehow the belltower is supposed to be the safest place for the girl. Also, you get powers to use which are spells "engraved" on your arm so that you can solve puzzles or use as guidance as to what to do next. These powers allowed you to also dispel areas with demonic fog or read glyphs from a tablet too.\n\nThe puzzles were your standard HOS's. You get a list of words and have to find them in the scene. After completing them you received items to use for other puzzles in the different rooms you encountered. For example, you might receive golden orbs which were to use for a lock that needed them so you could open the door to the next area. There were also a couple ring puzzles, where you rotated the rings to complete the picture.\n\nThere was no map that I was aware of. So no teleporting to where you had to go. You had a diary that recorded important things  you needed such as codes and clues. I believe there was two difficulty settings, basically easy and hard.\n\nThe sound wasn't bad for this game. The music was appropriate for the game but I could not stand the voice of the owner of the castle. For some reason he sounded soooo slow to me. I mean I know he was old but no one speaks THAT slow.\n\nThe graphics were okay. Mind you I'm running this game on Windows 8 with all the bells and whistles for a fast computer. I did have trouble with seeing some things as they were a bit blurry for me. For example, one puzzle wanted me to find a flower. Well there was yellow lit lantern that overtook the left side of my screen, eerily I might add, and the flower was yellow. So I had trouble discerning it in that instance. Also some items were shadow figures that were sometimes small and blended in a tad too well. Another puzzle wanted me to find a winged lady, but her wings were behind another object so all I saw was a sitting lady until I accidently clicked on her and it got marked off. I wouldn't have known if I didn't accidently click. But still you could tell what most of the objects were.\n\nI finished this game around 6 hours but you can easily finish is sooner. The puzzles weren't hard, I think it was just the fact I had trouble finding objects because of the shading and lighting in the HOS's.\n\nThe game kept you interested enough to keep going to find out what happened, but honestly I got bored towards the end. I bought this game on sale but wished I had bought a different one. As I said, this game was more disturbing for me than scary. If you are spiritual or religious, I would think this game would be a turn off for you as it deals with a kind of precarious situation of sorts. We are talking about demons, a little girl being possessed by one so to speak and finding out what this owner did to want to "experiment" around with type of matter. There are references to demonic rituals and such.\n\nOverall, not one of the best games I played but not the worst either.\n\n","March 28, 2015","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A hidden objects game which offers more than just a casual gameplay. Logic puzzle- not too easy, not too hard, answers are hidden in the notes. Artwork is really nicely done, animations are ordinary but I kinda like it! One thing I really enjoyed was exploring the mansion and uncovering the story from behind the dark walls. It has a pretty creepy atmosphere with nice sound effects.. unless you fast-click more than 5 times in hidden objects part.. Then good luck, first time I almost got a heart attack.\nSo, there is my opinion:\n\nGood:\n- Nice art\n- Great & creepy sound effects\n- Voice acting is good\n- Puzzles aren't so hard to solve\n- Story is interesting and catchy\n- Mysterious atmosphere\n\nBad:\n- There is no danger\n- Bonus content voice acting is worse, but still good\n- Hidden objects are sometimes hidden behind another object so you're unable to see it\n\nI got this game as a gift but I would absolutely buy it if I don't.\n10/10 would fast-click again","May 2, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Challenging HO segments, great atmosphere, puzzles ramp up gently from idiot-proof to reasonably challenging, and are never truly frustrating. The plot is thin to say the least, but the Dracula-inspired setting and supernatural story are engaging, and the twist, though not unpredictable, is still a nice touch - even if the lack of context drains its impact. The hint system is perhaps too forgiving - though its form is a great idea - and also perhaps too necessary when it comes to finding the next step, but too much is better than too little. Bonus content is sparse, but a bonus nonetheless.","April 28, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've no idea about the bonus stuff, I never got to play it.\n\nIf you're a fan of hidden item games where the items can be obscure or the equivilent of a colour differeciation test and an eye exam then be my guest.","May 1, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, once you get into the main story, you have strong narrative and voice acting, excellent art work, and much more animation than you would normally find in an average HOG.\nThe storyline was enjoyable if a little disjointed, and my only real criticism was that the HO scenes were so cluttered, that you could just randomly click on objects and find over half of them in the first few seconds of every scene.\nOverall, a very solid and enjoyable HOG, if HOGs are your sort of thing.","June 1","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
