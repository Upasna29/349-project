Because of that it does come with some limitations. I would imagine to get the ultimate experience out of Dead Secret, first prize would be to play the game with a virtual reality headset but developers Robot Invader have also ensured that those without a headset can also kick back and enjoy solving the mystery which centers around the murder of a recluse in Rural Kansas in the late 1950's. This review will center primarily around the non-virtual reality version because as of yet I have not jumped aboard the virtual reality hype train. However, having said that, Dead Secret does show a large degree of maturity I was not expecting from such early VR tailored experiences so I might be jumping aboard sooner rather than later if the games being released show as much promise as Dead Secret.\n\nBecause the game comes to us from the mobile space certain sacrifices have been made when it comes to in-game textures and animations. While they certainly don't detract they are not cutting edge in any shape or form and can often be very symmetrical with clear stark and boxey lines. Also textures appear to be very washed out. Dead Secret lets the player take on the role of a gossip columnist for the local rag, a columnist with big dreams about one day reporting in the big city. Convinced there was more than foul play at work regarding the local homicide of a recluse, could solving this murder end up being your big break and the ticket out of this one-horse town? It's your duty to dig deep into the mystery that surrounds the murder and uncover the clues that will ultimately either lead you to solving the mystery and uncovering the perpetrator or ending with your own grisly death as you get too close to the truth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVSgugMV9Ws\nDead Secret isn't a particularly long game as I managed to complete it in just over 3 hrs. There are 4 different endings though so depending on what choices you make throughout the game at certain pivotal points will determine who you unmask as the killer or whether you end up being the killers next victim. As with any good mystery there are a colourful cast of suspects from a jilted ex-lover, an ex-colleague who was possibly looking to leverage what the dead recluse was working on and take credit for the discovery himself to the seemingly simple farm hand with aspirations of becoming a writer. The recluse also employed a pretty blond assistant who it appears -  after some digging -  has some secrets of her own.\n\nYou will never get to personally meet and interview any of the suspects (unless they are personally hunting you through the house wearing a grisly looking mask ala Scream) as information is cobbled together from various dossiers and notes you uncover within the house. Dead Secret is very much an adventure title, like those from the late eighties and mid-nineties, where you will collect certain items throughout the house to either combine or use to further your progress. For any adventure game lover that holds a nostalgic burning candle for the games of yore from the now defunct LucasArts and old Sierra (not the new resurrection) will find lots to enjoy here. The central mystery is actually very well written and tightly paced and as you get closer and closer to unraveling who the killer a certain urgency is injected into the game. Dead Secret isn't about jump scares, thankfully,  which really surprised me since a majority of horror games using VR tech seems to think that this is the only way to creep and freak out an audience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656725705\nI really enjoyed Dead Secrets central mystery and I certainly will be returning back to it once I have finally gotten my hands on a VR kit. Purchasing the game does come with a VR unlock code for the Occulus Rift store. Dead Secret manages to be creepy without resorting to the lowest common denominator when it comes to thrilling its audience and is definitely a recommended purchase for any fan who enjoys playing armchair detective and solving murder mysteries.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 22","true","3.3"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","36","36","0","0"

This is a pure point-and-click game where you play as a journalist investigating a potential murder scene and unraveling the mystery behind the death of a professor.\n\nThere are puzzles to solve, a decent amount of exploring to do, and the storyline is intriguing to the point where I can't stop playing. My only complaint is, while the protagonist is voiced, none of the dozens of letters/documents you find are voiced. But that's just me being nit-picky really, this is a great little adventure game and I can't wait to finish solving this mystery!\n\n(I'll update this review once I've finished the game. I've yet to encounter any bugs/glitches, but will report any if they are found.)\n\nFor those who'd like to see more footage before deciding to buy, I've got a Let's Play series going on here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=654931631","March 28","true","6.4"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","0"

It's a classic whodunnit with some horror/sci-fi twists along the way, all leading up to five different potential endings.\n\nIt's worth noting that Dead Secret does not feature full 3D control. In its stead, you point and click your way through environments, a la "Scratches" and other similar games. The control scheme seems to be the main criticism of the game from what I have gathered, but I had no problem with it. Your character is able to get around just fine, and avoiding danger (Surprise! There are failure states!) is satisfactorily accomplished.\n\nThe environments are beautifully done, and the many clues/notes you can collect throughout the game are well-written and properly allow you to piece together what exactly has transpired, of your own accord. There are some "checkpoints" in the game where it will quiz you on your knowledge of the story and ability to piece together clues, but I'd hardly call it hand-holding. In a game like this, it's important not to get confused about the relationships between the characters and their backstories/motives, and Dead Secret does a fine job of making sure you're on top of things without force-feeding you information.\n\nThe game runs about 2 hours, so if I had one criticism of the game it would be that the price point is a little high for this amount of gameplay. Still, there are multiple endings and the game does have replay value if you want to unlock all of them.\n\nDead Secret's biggest strength is arguably the horrorlike ambiance and mysterious atmosphere that fills the locations you visit. Robot Invader, the developers, successfully crafted a fantastically paced, dynamic game that puts you on edge at the appropriate times and executes its scares almost to perfection. In fact, Dead Secret is filled with more dread than many games categorized strictly as horror, and it's pulled through by great storytelling.\n\nAll in all, a terrific surprise for 2016 and one I would be glad to experience again in VR once I get one of those fancy thingamadoos.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/402260/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","The year is 1965, and you are journalist Patricia Gable; a young woman who is seeking to make her big break from being a small time reporter. What better way than to investigate the suspicious, recent death of a reclusive professor named Harris Bullard? Although his death was classified as natural causes due to hypothermia, your intuition tells you that foul play was afoot; it's up to you to find out who murdered Bullard, what secrets he was hiding, and live to tell the tale.\n\nIn terms of genres, Dead Secret is almost set in its own due to its unique gameplay. The title is most certainly set up with virtual reality first and foremost in mind, as the game is nearly an on-rails, 3D point and click. You must find the footsteps icon to interact with when you wish to move somewhere, and your character will then automatically walk to the destination; there are a limited number of pre-determined destinations, so there is no free walking. Likewise, any time that you see a hand or magnifying glass icon, you can interact with objects in the environment. The game is very linear and limiting in this way, and Patricia walks exceptionally slow.\n\nWhat the title lacks in actual gameplay is made up for with a rich, immersive story that pays extra attention to detail. There are notes scattered about that, if you choose to collect and read them, will give a lot of background information to the four murder suspects at hand. There is also a lot of interesting information regarding the victim, and the many secrets that he kept. As well, there are newspapers with articles from the early 1960's that really keep you sucked in to the time period, as they point to the advancement of then-current events, entertainment, and lack of medical knowledge that we have now.\n\nThroughout Dead Secret, you will encounter a masked killer in a raincoat. Their presence isn't exactly intense or scary, since you will have ample time to run away before you are potentially killed; there is a possibility that the area that you choose to move to is the wrong one, and you may end up being murdered anyway. If this happens, the game is extremely forgiving and starts you back at the sequence that you died during. Even though the appearance of the killer isn't frightening, the game does have a number of jump scares that will catch you off guard. This being said, I feel that the term "psychological horror", or even "horror" in general, does not suit this title in the least. The game is a murder mystery at best, there is only one minor scene that will mess with your head, and it's very tame.\n\nThe graphics are just okay, although since this title is set up for VR it's understandable why they're so limited. Taking in to account that VR is in its very early stages, the graphics are actually quite decent; you even have a body, and mirrors that emit reflections. This is impressive given that if you're running it in VR, everything has to be rendered twice. As for a desktop game, it's somewhat lackluster and plain, especially outside of the confines of the house and corridors. The sound could also use a bit of tweaking, as the music is either too soft, too loud, or disappears completely. These are of course minor complaints, the game itself runs great at a stable 60 FPS and I personally did not experience any crashing or glitches.\n\nClocking in at around 3 hours of gameplay, if you take the time to read all of the documents/newspaper articles and experience all five endings, it's hard to recommend Dead Secret at the price of $16.99 CAD. There's little replayability once you've accomplished everything, and the game will most likely end up sitting in the recesses of your library afterwards. However, for the time that it lasts, Dead Secret is a very immersive murder mystery that has a unique flair to it. I went in expecting a "psychological horror" game, since that's what the store page set me up to expect, and I came out a little disappointed. Reflecting back on the title with the understanding of it being a murder mystery, I can say that I deeply enjoyed it for what it actually is. It's just the short play time that holds back Dead Secret. If you grab it for $10 or less, you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 28","true","4.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This psychological thiller-horror game has the soul of a murder mystery in the best ways possible. I felt quite immersed in the story, which felt authentic due to its subtly. The game keeps good pacing except for a few sections when you're searching for items and documents in a single room. I think the dream mask mechanic was a bit underused--honestly they could have better incorporated the mask into later parts of the game.\n\nA few jumpscares, which to some gamers may seem like cheap attempts to shock the player, but I found them well-placed and useful for driving the game along. The atmosphere was delightfully unerving and creepy. Overall, a well-designed and well-made indie game.","April 2","true","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I am doing a full play through of it and if you'd like to see my initial reactions to the game, I'll leave a link!\n\nDead Secret First Impressions\n\nSo the game starts off pretty timid, it looks like just an exploration game but quickly starts to become hair raisingly creepy. Like I said, I wish I had a VR headset to really experience this for myself, but it DEFINITELY isn't needed as the gameplay style keeps you feeling helpless while you move around the house. The game is a simple point and click detective/reporter game. You don't have weapons obviously, you can't fight as far as I know, but the story keeps pulling you in with interesting twists and turns. WHO is the murderer you ask? Well you'll have to find out!\n\nI personally love puzzle games and room escapes like the game, The Room. And although this game doesn't seem to be as intriquette as The Room, it shares a lot of similarities and has a narrative to go along with that is easily able to be followed. From creepy "you're being watched" moments to "oh crap, what do I do!?" moments, I've enjoyed almsot every second of this game so far.\n\nOne thing I'm not 100% sold on yet is after each section (or at least at one point so far) there is a quiz that makes sure you're paying attention to the clues you've found. I don't feel it's needed but maybe it changes the outcome of the game, as there are multiple endings which is always fun.\n\nI'd say pick it up if you have a VR headset, and pick it up if you don't and just want a simple game that will make you want to keep playing.","March 29","true","2.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Knowing the background of the developer, this was an interesting experiment as to what is an educated look at horror. Recursive unlocking, building tension, foreign horror and so much, makes this a personal favorite (even though some other people might think of this work as a very simple game and with a bland trama at times that then forces its way into unsuspected terrain.)\n\nSomehow this reminded me of The 7th Guest and as to how this one should have been done if this technology existed in those days.\n\nWhen I get the chance to get an Oculus or equivalent I'll replay it with that technology or will gladly rebuy this for PS4 when PS VR gets more accesible / cheaper (although I guess that maybe this title will get The Plus Treatment so it will be quite interesting when the time comes for the PS4 debut).\n\nCongratulations, Chris Pruet and team.

Otherwise the limited movement was actually a good thing, because I tend to get confused in games where you can go everywhere, not knowing what to do next. For example, I got stuck in one place where I had just two rooms available, so I knew the answer had to be in those rooms and just kept looking until I found it.\n\nThere were some creepy moments and a couple of moments of panic. Unfortunately, what happened after the panic moments never got explained in the story, or at least in the parts I found. I did miss a few documents, so I didn't get quite the entire story. I rarely go back to games like this, because it's not the same once you know the story, but I think I'll replay this one, just to find the missing documents and see what I was supposed to do with the couple of items that got left over.","March 30","true","7.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

So, I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nThe game itself is honestly not visually impressive, but the stylized art style of it helps offset that. What this game does have, however, is atmosphere is SPADES. Not too long before playing this game, I played Layers of Fear as well. And while I do believe the two games are not super similar, I believe this game did a better job of making me feel tense and threatened at all times. The soundscapes and the subtle music is all masterfully done.\n\nI also was impressed by the small amount of voice acting done by the main character.\n\nThe game itself is essentially a point and click adventure. When I first started playing it, I did not even imagine that I would be spooked by a game where I simply click to move. But on the contrary, I think this actually helped enforce the almost helpless feeling the game gives you at times. Many of the "scares" happen during times when the game is auto-moving you between clicks, the times when you are most vulnerable.\n\nThe mystery itself is interesting. The game literally never gets old. It has multiple endings!\n\nHonestly, I can say I loved this game. And I want more of it. Thanks SWERY for saying nice things about this game and thanks Robot Invader for making it. Can't wait for more!\n\n(Also, work on your word spacing on the newspaper clippings, it is a little bit painful to look at and read in-game. :P )\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0omBzicxvs","May 15","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want to follow the game watch my video here introduicing it, and and decide for yourself if you like it\n\nPet peeve 1. Doesnt give an option for full screen.\n\nBTW its a point and click walking game, not walk wherever you style, if that matters to you\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OS4DJMz5lNg","March 28","true","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The "jump scares" were few and relatively mild but still jarring, and there was no combat.\nThe graphics were decent, if simple, and didn't stall or glitch.  This is a point-and-click game, so there was no freedom of movement as far as the W/A/D/S method goes. Any movement was based on finding and clicking on "footsteps" with the mouse, which for some reason wasn't what I had expected. The story was not terribly exciting or innovative, nor was it really explored in depth. I found the ending(s) unsatisfying. There were a few really fun moments, though.  Also, a creepy monkey, which is never a bad thing.  It was an enjoyable, if fairly brief, way to spend an evening. However, I cannot reccomend it due to its price.  This would be an excelent game to buy on sale, or if the price were lowered to $10 or less.  I feel the gameplay is not complex enough, nor the story interesting or long enough, to warrant any more than that.","April 5","false","2.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The plot goes like this. You play as a Journolist  who wants to make it big. She ends up on a murder case. Inside a house in the middle of east bumble♥♥♥♥. Its a point and click 3D Horror Mystery game. I like the mix between horror and mystery. Every moment in the game felt like I was being watched.\n\nSecondly the fustrtarting part of the game is where SPOILERS. Some creppy mask wearing ♥♥♥♥♥ sarts chasing you. I find it a bit annoying where this is a point and click game and its hard to find a place to run where that ♥♥♥♥♥ is chasing you. In my opinion I find that a bit fustrating but you'll get used to it.\n\nIn conclusion I give the game a 7.5/10 it had some fustratings moments but I had a solid experience and I would recomend it.","April 18","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As one who dislikes point and click style games, I was delightfully surprised at how much I enjoyed the gameplay. As an avid horror genre player who has played through games such as: Amnesia 1 and 2, Outlast and Whistleblower, Alien Isolation, Doors, Hatman, and Kraven Manor; I can say that this is a must play for any horror game regulars. For an indie horror with a somewhat short playthrough, this game is great. Definitely a good game for a rainy day!","June 2","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was completely underwhelmed. It is predictable, unchallenging and well overpriced for what it actually gives you as a game.  I found the  graphics to be acceptable but not something  I would call exemplary. The gameplay mechanics were simple and uncomplicated which made for good movement through out the game and I found no bugs or game crashing events during the  gameplay. However, the game itself is not challenging and holds your hand through the finish. This is not a hardcore,  puzzle solving adventure game. It is a walk in the park with a tiny little bit of story to it. I was hoping for way more here than what I actually got .  In a way it felt like the game was supposed to be deeper but never got there because it was rushed. It just did not seem complete. Anyways, the game is not terrible but it is not really that good either from an adventure view point. Was it scary??? Uh..No it was not.","April 3","false","3.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Not as scary as I would have liked without VR, but if you are using VR it should meet your spooky expectations. Needs some tweaking for PC, W A S D controls would have made it A LOT more comfortable, they litteraly just exported it without doing anything to make it more suitable for PC. Also really short.\n\nSome tips : Don't look at the monkey, don't touch the monkey, don't speak to the monkey, don't listen to the monkey, don't even think about the monkey. If your stuck in an endless hallway, just go backwards one space, i figured this out the hard way.\n\nAfter thoughts : Nuclear Bombs and Spaceships where all the rage in the 1960's, should have been something to do with that. If this old geezer that was murdered was building a nuke in his basement this would have been a whole lot cooler.\n\nConclusion : Worth buying, you'll have fun, but don't set your expectations to high.","March 31","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
