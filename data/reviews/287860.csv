Ohh, it might be Spread, or lasers, or flame! 8-Bit Commando decided that it would have "upgrades" as well, only when you see a weapon upgrade, the four times I think it happens, you'll avoid it like the plauge. The laser is dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. The devs decided that once you pick up a weapon you should automatically fire it.... you know like in that one game..... eh, er.... it's freaking stupid and gets you killed.\n\nThe game play is so boring.\n\nRemember in Contra how you were fighting outlandish enemies? Aliens, tough bad guys, so on? Remember those cool levels, where did that game take you? Another world! It was amazing.\n\nThis game decided, "Nah". Let's just do like 4 terrorist guys, and on one level a dog..... um ok. Levels? uh, idk. whatever you want...\n\nTheres one level in the game on which you climb some rope..... oh boy, screw that level.\n\nThe game isn't "Hard", it's just difficult due to its own poor design.\n\nIt seems like it wants to target itself towards speed runners/hi-score enthusiast. But if that was the case then why would there be a randomized flame port on the train level? That removes the possibility of speed runs. Make it on a regular timer, so ridiculous.\n\nThe bosses are also a joke. One of them is a cylinder? That shoots.... lazer rockets? idk, but all you have to do is stand under it and spam fire..... boring.\n\nI do not recomend picking this up, save your money, download SNES, or NES emulator and a ROM of Contra I, II, and III. Loads more fun than what this game tries to be.\n\n(Maybe I seem salty, and to a point I am, but go ahead, try this game out. You'll come back to my comments and agree whole heartedly with what I said.)","December 19, 2015","false","1.7"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","41","56","8","1"

From the basic gameplay straight down to the ascetic and setting, it's close to overstepping the "inspired by" threshold into actual plagiarism, but considering Konami has better things to do than suing small indie developers I can let it slide. In any case, more Contra is rarely a bad thing, though with 2DEngine's attempt to ape to legendary series, there's a clear feeling that the developer is simply repeating the same game we've played before; either for being unsure how to inject their own flavor into the formula, or unwilling to branch out from what has already been proven to work.\n\nThrough seven levels (which should take you about 30-60 minutes to complete, depending on your skill), you run and gun your way through military grunts, occasionally partaking in some light platforming before eventually showing down a boss at the end. The levels themselves change quite a bit throughout, from running on top a moving train to chasing down enemies on a highway by way of motorcyle. It's some welcome variety, but despite this Commando's core gameplay is so rudimentary and dated that it quickly grows stale as you wrestle with the unwieldy controls, made worse by the almost obnoxious difficulty and strongly enforced time limit for each level.\n\nAs generic and frustrating as it may be, I enjoyed 8-Bit Commando well enough for what it was, but not enough that I'd recommend it to anyone but those dying to play more Contra. It's not a bad game, just a derivative and unremarkable one, existing in a spectrum of games designed to fill a role but never extend beyond the status of a basic clone. All things considered, you're almost certainly better off replaying the games that so strongly inspired it, which even years later are still entirely more worth your while.","June 8, 2014","false","3.1"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","49","76","0","4"

Run to the right, there is no left. I've owned this game for years and played it a few times on Desura. If you can't tell this game is a Contra clone that sadly never is itself. It tries to be Contra mini. They have the same look, levels and so on. It doesn't steal Contra's sprites, artwork, music or sounds, but mimics them with no originality. The levels aren't just inspired by Contra, but they have the same themes as Contra, Super C and even the GBA version of Contra 3.\n\nI want to like this game, and I think that I still like this game even with all its shortcomings. I just can't recommend it to other people for a lot more reasons than 'lolz Kontra klone.' There's just not enough of it. I've felt brief 2 - 3 hour games are fun and exciting enough to be worth $15 - $20, but this is too easy, and too short. There is no hard mode either for people that go through it on normal. I would have appreciated more of a challenge.\n\nThis is the start of a good game engine that they can make other games with. Those games need to feel like their own game and not just Contra mini. It feels so much like Contra that I'd rather play Contra, even if this is a mixture of Contra levels. At least with games like Ittle Due that take inspiration from Zelda, they offer fresh things. There are different twists, different characters and enemies, this offers nothing new.\n\nOn the good side, the art and especially animation are great. Plus, there is a lot of enemy variety. Enemies with drops will have them randomized so they can drop weapons or health. I appreciate the randomness of the few drops there are. Some might see it as a positive that this game is also much easier than Contra. How is it easier? A health bar at the top of the screen. As someone that beats Contra and Super Contra once a year without getting hit, I feel like I don't need easier. So its a good thing there is a difficulty setting. Wth only 6 levels in the game on top of a timer that ensures no level lasts more than 5 minutes, that makes for  a 30 minute play through.\n\nIt uses Contra's simple controls, which is a good thing especially when you're going for that 8-bit feel. Some of us don't like dual stick shooters. You have one button to jump, another to shoot with 8 directional shooting. It feels nice, it feels like Contra. It is missing some of the functionality of Contra suck as down + jump will make you drop through certain platforms. You can hang from ropes, but jumping just makes you fall. I would have preferred it to jump and down + jump would make you fall from the rope.\n\nNow for the number of downsides. The weapons just don't feel that different or fun. Your standard machine gun spits out a slow bullet if you hold the button down or quicker bullets for those that tap the button. The same for the laser, the beam is longer, but still pretty short. Fire offers just a puff of a projectile and homing missiles do the job, but they're still pretty meh. There is some sort of grenade launcher that just feels weak. I'd prefer my explosions larger than the projectile is. Is there a spreader? Not that I've found, but some of the enemies have a short range shotgun to use against you. Here's a hint, ducking won't save you. If you think oh I can just shoot them from far away. Yes.... you can, assuming the bullets don't fly through them as if they weren't there. I've found that issue a few times.\n\nEvery time I press escape to exit out of the game, it doesn't exit, but rather crashes. Changing resolution doesn't change resolution when you hit apply. It changes automatically every time I fiddle with the resolution. I found a resolution my monitor doesn't support so now I can't see the game. Can't see the game, can't change resolution. So I'm now stuck. The game is stuck on a black screen. I cannot alt + tab out or ctrl + alt + delete my way out either. I need to restart my computer. I have never had an issue like this with any other game. The fact that there are beta testers for this game and no one discovered this out is amazing. I have this error time and time again.\n\nAfter all that, in game, when I'm aiming up and left with a keyboard, I can't fire my gun. I would say its just me, but with 2 PCs and a laptop + Desura and Steam versions of the game, I assume its not just me. It still works on a 360 controller though. But if its a right scrolling shooter, why care about that? Boss fights. Especially the helicopter boss fight that comes from the left. Its okay though, you can jump and shoot to the left. The brief moments of precision platforming are well imperfect and you can fall through things. To top that off, you can die after you beat a boss.... meaning you'll have to beat the boss again.\n\nThe other downfalls include the fact that you don't get lives, but rather unlimited continues. Why is that bad? When you die it takes you to a continue screen instead of just putting you back in the action. There are checkpoints too. I'd rather have lives and checkpoints with continues that send you back to the start of the level. If you run out of time, then you're forced to restart the level from the beginning. So that's a nice twist I guess.\n\nAfter each level you get to see your stats and post a high score. The problem is after you post that score, you get sent back to a level select screen. All that breaks the flow of the game. There aren't any memorable boss battles either. While I know a game should get graded for what it is, not what it isn't, but if Contra has memorable things. Then you need to get to that level or better.\n\nOn the bike stage, you have the ability to move into the far, near and medium lanes. The game will mercilessly throw cars at you to dodge, not just dodge, but they'll aim for you. Which is fine, you can jump over them like in Contra right? Nope, who ever heard of jumping, you gotta blow that stuff up even when its taking up all 3 lanes forcing you to crash into the debris! On top of that, think the game knows what lane you're in and you're safe if you're in one lane over another? Nope, bullets and rockets don't care. A hit is a hit even if you're not in their lane. Just seems like poor programming that could have been better. I could also talk about how easy and quick the final level is... but it just seems like beating a dead horse.\n\nGet this in a bundle like I did. Maybe its worth $1, but I've bought a few $1 bundles with this in it.","June 23, 2014","false","2.1"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","0"

Unfortunately, you did not deliver.\n\nLet us start with the good stuff, graphics and soundtrack are the high point of the title and quite nice overall. The game has a late 80ies arcade-vibe going on (could be a PC-Engine game as well), which I very much approve. It shows some effort.\nThen there is this "feature" (seems more like an engine-problem of lacking proper upscaling) of seeing a whole lot of a level if you pick the wrong resolution, which almost reminds me of the few Taito-games with multiscreen setups. Seriously though, If you are just in it for the aesthetics and the whole throwback-thing, 8-Bit Commando might work out for you.\n\nIt all goes downhill from here. The game itself is just not very well designed or planned out. Stages are incredibly short, I am not really exaggerating when I say that you make about 3-4 leaps and you are at the bossfight. The platforming is incredibly simplistic and dull. Same goes for enemy placement and attack-patterns. Obstacles almost feel like an afterthought, and if it weren't for the shoddy jump-controls that are more floaty than they should be I would have hardly died at all. Power-ups are scarce and don't feel powerful at all - a spreadshot laser that needs to charge up and only spreads after being about 1 second on the screen? Who thought that was a good idea? Also, drops are random - meaning nobody really cared to craft a good challenge to overcome in the first place.\n\nBosses have tiny hitzones, and are rather unspectacular both in size and attack-power  (becoming MORE boring as the game goes on) and I just don't see any point in going back to this title after finishing it once (which took about 40 minutes, would have taken even less if I had realized earlier that mashing buttons helps in getting more shots on the screen).\n\nGameplay and design simply don't back up the nice visuals and music, which is a real shame. But considering that for just a few bucks more you can get either Oniken or Metal Slug 3 here on Steam, the offering of 8-Bit Commando feels all the more pitiful. Lacking the tight controls, creativity and leveldesign that were standard about 30 years ago - I am pretty disappointed.","June 8, 2014","false","1.0"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","33","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/recommended/287860/","FirstUtterance","FirstUtterance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/","571 products in account","Yeah I'm just repeating what everyone else is saying, it's Contra, but lame. Unlike the majority of people I really disliked Contra 4 but I might just have to reassess that game after playing this. Hell you'll probably have a better time playing Contra Force than this (even though to this game's credit it ran smoothly whereas CF is notorious for its slowdown). Contra Force is the game where it seems to take most of its inspiration actually, with its more "down-to-earth" military theme instead of aliens, mutants and robots you'd normally fight. Here, it's mainly tanks, airplanes, trucks, with only a couple of robot-ish things to battle. It's probably better than Legacy of War and C: The Contra Adventure... maybe, so there's that.\n\nLet me talk about the options menu first. You have two difficulties, easy and normal. No hard available at all, which I'm not complaining about, as the game is irritating enough on its default difficulty, but it just looks odd, especially for a game like this. Also, resolution settings - rather than select from a list like a normal game, when you select it it'll immediately switch to the next resolution up and automatically adjust your screen accordingly. This didn't cause me any problems but it did for others apparently, as in crashes and such. Well I flicked through the resolution options until I came across one that didn't look like everything was stretched across the screen like latex before moving on.\n\nSo, as said, the game is Contra. Except the levels look more widely spaced as afforded by the higher resolutions not available on the older consoles. And the one-hit deaths/continue system has been replaced by a health bar and checkpoints. It does make the game seem easier than most Contras, theoretically but because of certain design decisions it feels much more frustrating to play. You have a health bar but it can drop down very easily when getting hit by various things around you, taking anywhere from 2 to 4 hits off your life bar. Levels are short, and you have at least one checkpoint in between, but that's where things get interesting (actually the only interesting thing about this game). The levels are set on a five-minute timer, and if you die after a checkpoint, the timer doesn't stop, so die often enough, you may come back with only 16 worthless seconds left and then it's time to redo the whole level again.\n\nOtherwise it sticks to Contra very closely, sometimes almost blatantly ripping off levels from the series wholesale (such as the first level in the first Contra stuck somewhere in the middle of the game). Sprites are similar, and are competently drawn, but lack color and the art design in general is dull. There is some nice-looking parallax scrolling, most noticeable in the biker stage, and it runs smoothly, but it is totally uninspired. It's a game that copies the dull tones and browns of your average modern military shooter but "retro" style. Same with the music. Yeah they sound "8-bit" but none of it is catchy, memorable, well-composed or does anything - whether to pump you up, ratchet up tension, no, none of that - except sound "8-bit." It's as faceless as the protagonist and the tacked-on story about playing a game of nuclear missile hot potato with whoever the villains are. You'll probably find a more fleshed-out story in any of the other Contra games ever made than here, and better endings too.\n\nNow the experience of playing the game itself... it feels slow and dull, with mediocre level design, broadly spaced-out enemies and traps, and really, really crappy weapons. Your default gun is probably what you'll be using most of the game as power-ups are few and far between, and what power-ups you get you'll lose pretty quickly from dying (that you carry over what health you had from the last level to the next doesn't help). Don't worry, because most of those are boring too, except for the homing missiles, and they managed to find a way to bork those as well, as I found many instances of the missiles just circling around enemies or bypassing them and not even hitting their appropriate target unless you're like, standing right next to them.\n\nThere's been talk of the controls being poor and indeed there are issues I have with them. You have eight-directional shooting, and shooting diagonally means having to run in that direction. This might have been how a bunch of Contra games also were designed but I don't recall them being as irritating as they are here. Because of how widely open/empty the levels are, the puniness of your pea shooter (which would be an apt description for any weapon you get), the tiny enemies on screen with equally tiny bullets coming from different directions you can't see, how slow your character feels and responds compared to any character in any Contra game, and some questionable hit box detection (I've fired right through a dude's head and it did nothing - there also were missiles firing straight at a platform below me and at one point I just arbitrarily took damage, standing there), makes for an unpleasant concoction of annoyances that as the game goes on and gets harder become more visible and make you want to throw the keyboard across the table.\n\nAnd I've saved the worst for last - the bike-riding stage, the penultimate level of the game. I thought at first "oh nice a bit of variety for once" but nope these frustrations manifest even more horribly here. I still don't know what sense to make of this level. First one of the biggest dangers of the level, isn't the bullets, isn't missiles, but barrels. Yes, a truck appears at the beginning and end and throws barrels at you that take away three hit points as opposed to two from bullets. They appear to be empty barrels too. It throws three of them at you at a time and there's no logical perception as to where these things actually bounce toward. Even if you move out of the way after they're thrown, they seem to hit you anyway. Homing barrels? Oh and the same rules apply here as they do with the regular stages but you're on a constantly moving bike, making diagonal firing, a necessity when the annoying helicopter/invincible barrel truck combo come along, more of a pain. Before that though you have to weave through traffic by... shooting down pedestrian vehicles? Some of who will just try to ram into you? What drunk idiot designed this level? Oh and the boss fight. Getting a hit in is almost impossible without getting hit yourself, he crams you in with his bullet fire so much, and moves back and forth in patterns that make no sense and will certainly kill you. By the time you get to the second stage of the fight, where it's "BULLETS BULLETS BULLETSSS!" you will be low enough on health that you'll die the moment it starts. Here is where I said "Screw this bull****" and just set it to easy, where the barrels destroy as normal empty wooden barrels would with a high-powered gun, and where I could proceed to the final level (where I switched back to normal) and be done with this stupid game for good. Oh, the last level isn't very good either and exemplifies "diagonal shooting" with its final boss at its worst but at least it's not the biker stage.\n\nThe low price and Contra-looking aesthetics and gameplay may be tempting but really, don't bother. It's a game made by Contra fans who grew bored of their project the moment they started it, yet somehow finished it. Maybe if this was 75% off (which would make it about $0.99 in my currency), OK. Plus there's local co-op, which I haven't tried as someone with no friends, let alone ones who would be willing enough to share the boredom with me, but if you do, I guess that might be an incentive to part ways with one of your Washingtons, but for everyone else, stick with your emulators or cartridges of the older Contra games, if you're lucky enough to have them (my rec: Contra: Hard Corps for the Genesis, an amazing game and the polar opposite of this sad little thing.","October 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Well, problem is, fullscreen is the default mode, so I had to go edit Settings.XML (which involved figuring out which of my AppData folders it was hidden in) to make the game run windowed. Going by the community forum, this bug has been known and documented since January of 2014. It is now July of 2015 and 2dengine have not bothered fixing it.\n\nAs soon as I fixed the config file, I spent some time altering the controls. Keyboard is the default configuration, though XBox 360 pads are supported by default as well, even though the button layout isn't really very logical. Buttons can be rebound, which is good, BUT I wasn't able to bind movement controls to the D-pad, as it only recognizes analog axes. I use a DualShock 3 with a custom driver that mimics the 360 controller's, and I would have much preferred the D-pad over the stick.\n\nGetting into the actual game: the Commando moves really slowly, jumping is quite floaty; there are not very many enemies early on, making me wonder if the devs had forgotten to populate the level. When enemies DO show up, they're damage sponges. Contra soldiers tend to go down in one shot. These guys take two or three. Hit boxes are not very forgiving either; I found I was missing many shots because of how slow the bullets travel, and I eventually started just running past enemies because neither of us were going to hit each other.\n\nThen I got to a point in the first level where there is a fighter jet dropping bombs everywhere. Despite being a big target, it's not easy to shoot because, again, bullets move way too slow. The bombs are hard to dodge, and do a lot of damage to you, resulting in frequent death. Even if you survive the bombs, there is a pair of missile turrets that fire homing missiles at you that do the same damage. To make matters far worse, even though you have infinite continues, you will always revert to a checkpoint when you die. The sluggish nature of the game makes this far more of a pain than it really needs to be.\n\nAesthetically, I don't mind the artwork (it's a bit more "authentic" than a lot of retro-mimic games), but the music and sounds are ill-fitting and unsatisfying, and dare I say, really boring.\n\nI just don't feel like this is worth paying money for. I got it out of a Groupees bundle; I sort of regret redeeming the Steam key out of it, now.","July 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

Gameplay itself is pleasant but unremarkable - level design is simplistic and platforming is undemanding. Contrary to Conta, the game offers an unlimited amount of continues and gives the main character HP which allows him to take several hits instead of just one, effectively removing any possible challenge. Weapon upgrades are largely useless, as they are actually a step down from the power and range of the main gun -with exception of the homing missiles, which in turn are overpowered. Enemies prove no real challenge, while the boss fights can be frustrating as the hit zones are simply too small.\n\nIn short: while it's not a completely terrible game, it's an entirely disposable one - certainly not worth the full price, and possibly not even the sale price. Like most players, I got it in a bundle with a few other games for a dollar - and I feel as if even that would be too much, as you can emulate and play the old Contra for free and have a much more fun and challenging experience, even after 27 years.","July 7, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also because the game doesn't see fit to lock your controls while firing, much less give you the option to do so, firing at an angle is more than likely to send you charging off into a pit to your death, especially during bosses, which nearly all have said instant death pits.\n\nThe weapon system makes no sense; given no actual choice, you randomly can go from your weak default weapon to a laser gun, a homing missile launcher or a machine gun, and all the while not a single one seems to be stronger than any other. The only one that seems to have any significant power behind it is what appears to be a grenade launcher, but even that is rare that it may as well not even exist in the game.\n\nThe music, of which you will be hearing over and over due to the cheap deaths slowly drills its way into your mind, grinding your will to live down until the sound of a tortured cat would be preferable. Or maybe the sound of a cat being tortured as rendered through a Sega SG-1000. Either would be better than this, which seems to be babies first attempt at making 8-bit sounding music.\n\nAn overall bland looking, incredibly irritating to the ears game with no redeeming value other than it was cheap.

If you think that's awesome, this game is for you.\n\nGood stuff:\n\nYes, it's fun.  You run around, shoot stuff, and dodge enemy firepower.  The jumping controls work well, so I don't have any problems in the platforming sections.\n\nPowerups are varied, and some weapons have different shot types depending if you tap the button or hold it down.  The basic starter machine gun is strong enough that I never feel underpowered.\n\nThere's an online leaderboard that grades your performance on a per-level basis, for those who enjoy improving their technique. Personally I love this sort of thing.\n\nThere's also a 2-player coop mode, however I haven't tried it.\n\nWeird stuff:\n\nIncreasing the screen resolution zooms out the game, which allows you see further and attack enemies from farther away.  For example, 1920x1080 looks like a dual-screen arcade game like Ninja Warriors or Darius.  It also makes everything really small and hard to see, so personally I'll stick with the default resolution.\n\nBad Stuff:\n\nUsing a turbo controller could be abusive, as the game doesn't seem to limit on your fire rate.  However it should be noted that accuracy is graded at the end of each stage, so using extreme fire rates may be a bad idea if you want to compete on the leaderboards.","June 2, 2014","true","2.8"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","0"

Then the sound randomly stopped working and I had just about had enough.\n\nFrom there it is kind of ok, but hitboxes seem to be somewhat optional and the controls feel off, being floaty and unresponsive (even from the start you'll have to jump through hoops for the d-pad). Since this is pretty much what the game is about, there isn't a whole lot more to say about it.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the graphics are nice for the style, at least once you get past the menu system which is a mess. The music is poor and doesn't fit the action and sounds effects, such as simple things like gunshots, don't seem to be implemented or are not working.\n\nNot the worst effort in the world, but it still seems to have a long way to go.","June 3, 2014","false","3.7"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","1"

Good soundtrack as well. Even though theres not enough levels (completed in 2 hours), the strong point of this game is the level design. Every level feels very different and nothing feels the same. Except the enemies which could be described as cannon fodder but with a title like this...its to be expected\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtDyh5RNgLI&feature=share&list=UU-uwEmhonl7C8jWqEbrFb7A","June 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","1"

Highly Recommended!\n\nHeres a little video of my first impressions\n\nhttp://youtu.be/PK-_R0WCErM\n\nIn all honesty, this game feels just like playing on NES, only with a little richer fidelity. For those of you who didn't try Contra on the Nes (poor child), this is a great chance to find out what all the rage was back then.\n\nTight Controls. Fair Difficulty. Varied boss-fights and Environments! And for the elderly crowd (me included), it has a health bar, as opposed to its former colleagues.\n\nI never had a chance to try Coop, but i imagine the game truly shines there aswell, atleast, it ought to. This is something i will try later if i find another 8-bit buddy, but so far i am truly glad i got to spend some time with this little gem today :) Please add me if you want to play Coop, i imagine we can play this over tunngle or something similar.\n\nAwesome things: It played great on my usb nes controller, and i almost forgot for a second this was on the pc.\n\nBad things: like pointed out in other reviews, the playing field gets incredibly large when playing in 1920X1080, so i recommend playing it at a lower res like it probably was intended.

It have few levels, which are very short, so you will probably spend less than 1 hours to beat it. It have nice co-op option, so if you have some real life buddy to play with together then it's another nice thing. 8-Bit Commando is rather easy - with checkpoits and health bar you don't have to worry about this game being too hard to beat. Graphics and music depend on taste but if you are into retro-wannabe stuff then you will enjoy it. That's probably all.

Boring world with single shot weapon. Jumping is imprecise and floaty. You don't grab onto ledges for some reason. Bad controls - aiming is same as movement, meaning if you are trying to aim diagnolly, which you will do all the time, half the time is makes you move, meaning aiming is annoying. You have some stupid made up time limit to beat level, that counts restarts, so if you run out you have to redo entire level. There are only like 5 levels total.

I never played it before the recent updates, but I had no major complaints with how it is in its current state. It does a good job of mimicking Contra, which is obviously what the devs were going for.\n\nI guess my only two gripes are with the timer and the length of the levels, and the game as a whole. First, the timer seems unnecessary to me, and it's frustrating to make it to the last checkpoint, die, and then respawn with 2 seconds left. I feel like the timer should reset to where it was when I passed it the first time. This does add a bit of difficulty, but also a bit of frustration.\n\nThe levels were also very short. I think the timer was set at 5 minutes, so there's no chance a level is going to last longer than that. It took me about a half hour to play the game through from start to finish. I wouldn't have minded having a couple hours worth of hours to play.\n\nBut for a few bucks it's still worth it, especially if you have a friend to play with.","March 16","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No achievements but there's a leaderboard to see how your score for each level ranks.  The graphics and style are good for what it's trying to do, which is a Contra knock off.  I used a "retrolink" NES controller and it worked perfectly.  There are 6 short stages with a boss battle at the end of each and once beat become unlocked so you can select any one of at your leisure.  There are unlimited continues from checkpoints in each stage but there's a time limit that if it runs out you have to start from the begining of the stage.  It captures of glimmer of what made a NES game, but doesn't deliver the entire package, it's just too short and too easy.","February 29","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
