If you master the X-BTF game and getting bored stuck in the X-Shuttle, try this! The only thing you have to keep in mind is the pirates and Xenon forces. Your X-Universe empire and reputation is EVERYTHING. Also the X-Shuttle is locked until you master the X-Universe, but when you get a special mission from the Paranid, I strongly advise you read the Egosoft forums on a secret guide on how to progress the mission fully. Because this mission is a one-way ticket, read more on the X-Tension fansites!","August 8, 2012","true","64.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","0"

I have played X2: The Threat, X3: Reunion and X3: Terran Conflict. While the later were pretty good in and of themselves, X: Tension goes back to the X universe roots. The cockpits were removed in the X3 series of games but X: Tension has them making the game more immersive. The trading system is more simplistic than the latest games due to the fact there is not as many items to trade. This can be a good thing. Complexity can sometimes ruin a game.","January 12, 2014","true","1.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Multiple starting points have been added as well as the ability to change ship at your leisure making this a much more smooth and enjoyable experience than Beyond The Frontier.\n\nThe graphics and interface have received a major overhaul not only making the game far more pleasant to look at but also much easier to figure out.\n\nThe addition of multiple starting points now allow you a bit of an advanced start if you have to restart as well as the ability to specialize before the game has even started. This all goes a long way towards making learning the game a much easier experience. Satellite control systems now means you have the ability to manage your interstellar trading empire from a distance without the need to dock with every station you own to check on it's progress and this automation feature also helps makes the gameplay feel much more smooth than it was in Beyond The Frontier.\n\nA heavy duty AI improvement makes every part of the game better and the new addition of random missions gives a little purpose to those players that aren't completely satisfied with the open and unstructured nature of the game.\n\nThis however is all just an appetizer when put against the biggest change of all. You are no longer confined to a single ship for the entire game. In X-Tension you are allowed to change ship at a whip and practically every ship you see in the game can flown, from the light scouts to the heavy fighters and the cumbersome traders you can now chose your ship to match your mission and this makes the game much easier to play in a huge way.\n\nAll in all X-Tension is the game that introduced many of the concepts we now associate with the X series and in many ways it really is the game that made the series the industry standard it has become today. It's not a game without faults but for it's time it was a huge deal and a great game that holds many fond memories.","January 15, 2013","true","140.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Must be even better when you're drunk!\n\nSeriously, if you're not used to these types of games or the X-Series itself, when you first boot the game, it's like a puzzle! It's like 2 games in one, a puzzler figuring out what the heck is going on, then the actual game itself, which i haven't managed to witness yet outside of "The End".\n\nOn the plus side, it seems as though (once your figure it out) there's a lot of depth and customization in the game, and is an apt reminder of the detail to gameplay content that was once put in games over a decade ago. There are so many options and things to control that its initially confusing, but at the same time impressive, and once you get past the bizarrely leftsided illegible text, genuinely intrigues you into finding out more not only about this game, but the future ones in the series that may perhaps a bit more suited to the non-veterans.\n\nCan I recommend this?
