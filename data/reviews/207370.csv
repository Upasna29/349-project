But now to the game itself:\n\nPROS:\n+ Really good few hour gaming experience\n+ If you are new to bullethell or you want to try it, add this to your cart when the next sales comes (Or download touhou), its so much fun.\n+ The trading cards are worth about 0,20€ each.\n\nCONS:\n- No proper instructions\n- Pretty expensive compared to the length of game (If on summer sales or winter sales, totally worth it)\n- Pressing ESC will shut down the game (Not pausing)\n- Needs English sub patch if you dont want to see random symbols\n\n\nAnd now my guide for the starters of this game:\n\n\nOkay, first thing I'd like to let you know about this game is that THERE IS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD THE PATCH FROM THE INTERNET. There is really simple Guide by hum79 that can help you get that thing done.\n\nNow to the game. In the beginning, you select options with arrow keys. To select, you need to press Z. Also you might want to try the PRACTISE MODE before you try the MISSION mode, just to try the characters. Also if you are new to bullethell games, my advice is to change the mode from NORMAL to EASY from options (Unless it already on EASY).\n\nNow lets move to the gameplay, which might feel a little weird at the start of the game. You shoot from Z, Slow by holding X and use your BOMB pressing C. You also have this bar on your left which will fill when killing enemies. When its full, release Z (Shoot) and press it again to do decent damage blast. At the start you have 3 lives and 3 BOMBS, but you can collect these blue crystal-like pieces from enemies. When you collect them you can gain extra life. The enmies also drop Purple crystals that are called "Reinforcement". When you collect the amount that the bar on your right side shows, you get the reinforcement and start shooting more bullets and much faster.\n\nWell thats pretty much it I hope this recommendation helped someone, if not, im terribly sorry. Have a nice time playing this game!","July 17, 2014","true","3.0"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","60","70","0","0"

It gets the fundamentals of a bullet hell game right but does nothing unique to distinguish itself, and with so many other similar, better games to choose from (including two superior sequels) I'm at a loss to come up with any reason to spend time with it. The overly compressed graphics and audio, and the inability to save or continue a previous game also cause it to feel particularly dated and archaic, presuming you actually manage to make it work.\n\nI can't exactly call it broken, but eXceed has major problems running on modern computers. For reasons I'm still unclear about it's virtually impossible to get the originally intended 60fps on anything but ancient hardware, and with the speed of the game directly tied to the frame rate less than that is functionally like playing in slow motion. With enemies and bullets moving at a snails pace the action changes from fun and challenging to downright boring. I'm not joking when I say I had more trouble keeping myself awake than completing the first three levels, at which point I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nOutside of for free I wouldn't recommend eXceed, and even then only to those with an old computer lying around to play it on. Everyone else can skip straight to the sequels and not miss anything, as the original is now little more than a placeholder.","October 29, 2013","false","1.6"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","48","62","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordArchantos/recommended/207370/","LordArchantos","LordArchantos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordArchantos/","492 products in account","The first eXceed is a decent danmaku (aka bullet hell, manic) shooter. Although it pales in comparison to its sequels, by itself it is enjoyable, and has challenging boss fights.\n\nScoring mechanics are pretty simple, with a bullet grazing system to charge up your special attack. The game has an automatic death bomb option, which triggers a bomb (as long as you have one) when you're hit instead of you losing a life. It's a good option for those inexperienced with the genre. Controls and gameplay in general are tight and work as they should. Boss battles are entertaining and challenging, but the levels feel a bit too easy in comparison.\n\nVisually, the game is a mixed bag. It runs only in fullscreen, at 640x480. The presentation is pretty basic, and the game way overuses the colour red (red is my favourite colour and I still feel this way). This overuse is also my main gripe with the game. As all the enemy bullets are the same shade of red, along with many other effects sometimes filling the screen, it sometimes feels like my eyes are twisting themselves in a knot and it's hard to distinguish the tons of bullets flying around for a moment, resulting in a lost life. The UI is also annoyingly hard to read for the same reason. The backgrounds vary from boring, to nice but the same smallish picture scrolling over and over. Certain effects, like explosions and boss phase switches, look good.\nThe soundtrack is awesome as is often the case with bullet hell shmups.\n\nFor replay value, the game has three difficulties, plus three characters with completely different weaponry/abilities requiring different tactics to clear the game. The game can be played in Story, Arcade (i.e. with or without dialogue/story), or Practice Mode, but sadly there's no high score or replay saving.\n\ntl;dr, eXceed - Gun Bullet Children is a solid, fun danmaku shooter covered with a flawed presentation. The original game is only in japanese, however there is a patch to get the official english script into the game ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/207370/discussions/0/792924412090333459 ). It's also more newcomer friendly than many other titles in the genre, thanks to the auto-bomb and relatively simple scoring mechanics. Recommended for both veterans and beginners of, and anyone interested in, bullet hell shmups.","December 29, 2013","true","6.4"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/207370/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Exceed is a brutal vertical shoot em up that will test your skills to the limit. You start off by picking one of the three anime girls, each one having different ways of firing. First one has scatter shots, second one has narrow shots and the last one has a giant beam. The first level starts off pretty difficultly and is definitely not a game that will ease new players of the genre into the experience. That's all well and good but controllers don't work for it. Which means leaves only the keyboard and that is not an ideal way to play these games. It is manageable don't get me wrong but they don't even bother to tell you what keys do what. When I have to Google what keys are used and what they do then that is simply bad game design.\n\nAs you can see on the Steam page, the English language is not supported so you will not understand the story unless you speak Japanese. There are no English subtitles either so you may as well play on Arcade mode which removes the in game cutscenes. It doesn't really effect the game negatively for those of us that don't really care about story in a bullet hell. What does effect it negatively is that the UI is broken. There seems to be a hud with info in the black borders but it quickly glitches out and disappears. No clue what info there is supposed to be there but one vital piece of information that you don't know is how many lives you have left. This is an extremely poor port that doesn't allow key rebinding, no controller support, alt tabbing breaks the game and the escape key exits the game.\n\nGraphics are nothing special and are pretty funky looking but they get the job done. I love the soundtrack to Exceed. It has a very upbeat techno vibe to it but it is a shame that the soundtrack costs twice the amount of the game. The amount of bullets on screen is pretty insane which really makes you wish for a proper way to control your character instead of a keyboard. Your hitbox is rather strange and you can get away with some shots that look like they should have hit you. Not necessarily a bad thing considering how difficult the game is but you will have to learn where exactly a bullet can actually hit your character model. One shot and you will lose a life.\n\nYou also have a button that makes your character slow down to be more precise when dodging and one that unleashes a special attack. Buttons are as follows: Z to fire, X to slow movements, C to pause game, V for special attack and ctrl to be forced back to the main menu. There are bosses and they are as brutal as you would expect from a game like this. The battles can go on far too long though as they have a lot of hit-points and shooting them doesn't really feel like it has any impact. After looking up some gameplay on Youtube, I noticed that the game is supposed to be far slower than what I was playing. It run far faster on my machine which explains why it is so brutal and I have been unable to resolve the issue. Not sure if it is a rare problem but considering how bad the port is I highly doubt it.\n\nThere is a decent game underneath it all but it is ruined by being ported poorly to the PC. Being out since 2012 it is highly unlikely they will patch it. From my small amount of research Exceed appears to be a PC exclusive game which I find shocking given it's state. Anyways, this is the type of game that would benefit greatly from a small demo to see how it will run on your PC. As it is I can't really recommend it to anyone. This is a safe pass, there are a lot of better made shoot em ups on Steam to keep you occupied.","June 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","17","25","3","3"

For starters, there isn't much in terms of enemy variety. Throughout the game's five stages, you'll be fighting off 4 or 5 different enemy types, then the boss. That's pretty much it. Also, the controls are fairly basic... but there's no official controller support. Even if you manage to get a controller to work on it, you'll find that there's NO DIAGONAL MOVEMENT, which means you're stuck moving up, down, left and right. Another thing that hurts this game is getting it to run on newer machines. Unless you download the Microsoft Application Compatibility Tool, the game is stuck at 30 FPS. One more thing that hurts it is that there's no English subtitles. So unless you're fluent in Japanese (which I am not, but wish I was), or have downloaded a patch, you won't understand what the characters are saying, let alone anything story-wise.\n\nHowever, I am told that the later games are far better, so I will definitely give those games a try. As for the first game, unless you're an absolute die-hard bullet-hell purist, avoid this game.","August 17, 2015","false","3.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

A lot of people complain about this one, but I had a decent experience. This game is a port of a game that seems quite older, so don't hold it to the standards of more recent titles (The Steam release date is for the port, not the initial release date). All graphics problems encountered are easily resolved by switching to Japanese locale.\n\n--GAMEPLAY (5/10)--\nThis game relies off of arrow-keys and Z X C for controls. If your keyboard lacks arrow-keys, you will not be able to play. The game is about 50 minutes long in all (Where more recent bullet hells last 30), and the only stage I felt was boring is stage 1, where the game takes forever to progress. I am a seasoned sh'mup player, so perhaps that is how I beat the game on my first try, regardless, it is a problem you are not able to change the difficulty. It is a game that would challenge those who don't frequently play these games, and not those who would more regularly play them like I do. Admittedly there were some difficult parts, but once you learn the patterns, they are much easier to beat. The later games in this series are a far better buy gameplay-wise. Also, the bullets are all red in this game, and don't glow as the screenshots suggest.\n\n--STORY (6.5/10)--\nFrom what I can tell, with the little Japanese knowledge I possess (As this game is not available in English), you are a member of a vampire extermination squad lead by three schoolgirls, hunting down malicious vampires and other evils to make the world safe once again. If you don't speak Japanese, you won't be able to read the dialogue. You need AppLocale to even read the text. The game, however, is still playable despite this. Most people don't play sh'mups for the story, so I have to give it a 6.5/10.\n\n--VERDICT (5.75/10)--\nThis series has much better games. The first one is a bit of a dud (This one), but I assure you the later games in this series are far more worth-while. There wasn't much I could score because my Japanese is rusty and I need to speak fluent Japanese to understand most of the goingons. Don't be afraid to explore this series just because the first game wasn't that great. I encourage you to explore the later titles or, if you're not interested, consider looking up a game series called "Touhou Project".\n\nWould I recommend this game? No\nWould I recommend this series?

It lays the exact blueprint for how to not make a bullet hell game. This game is as conventional a japanese bullet hell game as they come, but the devs took few a quite terrible misstep when it comes to the art design and several game mechanics.\n\nFirst and foremost this game is a very poor localization effort to bring it to the Western audience. The only thing in the entire game that is english is the menu screen, everything else is in Japanese including the voice acting. There are no translation subtitles. The music, while mediocre generic nonsense is nonetheless appropriate for this game because it too is generic nonsense.\n\nThe developers who appear to be creatively bankrupt also appears to have also completely lost their ability to properly use color on their art in GBC. The game bullets are a heavy shade of red and the hud text is also red. I can handle really big sky and beat hazard level of crazy colors, but GBC’s ridiculous color theme hurt my eyes after a while.\n\nTo further add to the ugliness, the games bullet looks like they were designed in MS paint, every single bullet looks extremely low quality. The fact that there are only two different shapes for bullets in a bullet hell games makes me wonder what on earth the developers were doing with their art asset.The bullet coloring and design problem is magnified further in the game’s bullet pattern sequences. There are many sequences where the bullets are just thrown on the screen with no rhyme or reason; the screen just becomes one huge blob of red. It also doesn’t help that the game has unresponsive controls. Side strafing is alright, but vertical movement is frustrating to control.\n\nFor a game that was made many years after many iterations of the epic touhou series, you’d think the developers would know how to make GBC as aesthetically pleasing and playable as possible.. This is the worse of the exceed series, and in my opinion the worse bullet hell game on steam.","October 3, 2013","false","15.3"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","34","67","0","3"

I understand it's essentially a Dojin, but there are a myriad of /free/ games that are far superior.\n\nThere's no resolution options, no way to make it windowed (that I know of), and always crashes if minimized.  Despite being made in 2005, the sprites and backgrounds are worse than a Newgrounds game.  The music may as well just be some free samples from Fruityloops Studio looped.\n\nOn top of all of this, they didn't even bother to translate the script, meaning the minimal story appears as Japanese characters only.  (It'll actually appear as gibberish if you aren't in JAP system mode)  Though I doubt we're really missing out on anything there since it's some nonsensical tale of battling Vampires in the future or something - granted, story doesn't matter in a game like this.\n\nUltimately gameplay matters most in a bullet hell game, and eXceed falls short there too.  Despite looking like awful, the FPS fluctuates down to 30 and back up to 60 mid boss fight even on a system with exponentially more power than the recommended amount.  This leads to a massive issue in that bullet patterns literally shift speed at an unpredictable pace, making the boss fights impossible to perfect.  On top of this, the bosses are also incredibly health spongey, taking far too many hits before becoming tedious, even at the easiest difficulty levels.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that you should only bother with if you bought it in the eXceed triple pack, or some bundle somewhere and want to collect your steam trading cards.

To me, this was much better than the sequels or on par with the 3rd one. What I disliked about it, was that everything was red. That's really it. It made the last two bosses challenging, but I still enjoyed it.\n\nThe music - Pretty good, I started to enjoy it more the closer I got to the end. 4/5\nDifficulty - If you don't go to the options menu when you open the game, it is going to be set on easy as default, so don't forget to change that if you want to play on harder difficulties. Even on normal, the game is still pretty easy and you could 1cc it after a few times. 3/5\nStory - I haven't downloaded the mod for it yet so I can't really say if it's any good or not completely, but from what I have read you are sent out to exterminate vampires. 3(?)/5\nControls - For those new to these games, Z is confirm/shoot, X is focus/cancel, C is bomb and V is pause in this one. You can change the controls in the options menu. It took me a little getting used to them since I couldn't use the shift key and the ESC key just quit the game instead of pausing. Other than that, they're fine. 4/5\nVisuals - The backgrounds just felt boring. 3/5\n\nOverall, it's an okay bullet hell game. Get it on sale if you can, either by itself or in the collection pack. I recommend it if you are just looking for something new for cheap.","June 27, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I think an option to semi translate and translate would be nice, the japanese has a nice look but I remember the menus being unorthadox, probably orthadox in eastern games though, who knows. Good game, I bought it on SBM for a little over $2. UPDATE: The main menu is now in English! For some reason it runs like quadraplegic at 12 FPS on my Intel HD 3000 chipset, Windows 8, with an i5 because it wants an Intel 915 on an older OS. What the hell is that? It must be the DX8 and how the game handles its pipelines but it worked fine on 7. Windows 8 is a no no without some level of optimization from the dev side, at least without desktop hardware.","July 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Graze bullets to get another powerful shot as much as possible as you will need it and will allow you to shred through boss HP in no time. Unless I'm hitting it too slow this game doesn't seem to allow death bombs so if you don't see your path bomb away.\n\nSowel - Homing, least bullet density. Slow\nChinatsu - Wide, medium density.

Anime is not just a land you buy tickets to with every game, animated series and manga, it is also a state of mind.\n\nAllow me to explain. Imagine you were given a train ticket for one dollar, but upon using it, you discovered that it will only take you to the darkest, grimiest, least kawaii neighborhood that you can only view through your spectacular 2460x21000 75 hertz computer monitor oculus face spectacle rift (or totem) modified for use with that one vocaloid make-out simulator in the decidedly un-moe blurry resolution of 640x480, and upon arriving your motor abilities suddenly cease to function under all the stress of this vile, dark, less than acceptably kawaii place.\n\nHowever, you will soon realize that the ticket, the location, the sudden loss of your ability to walk or see clearly, none of it truly matters. All that matters is that you are at one with the anime again. Upon this realization, the spirits of the anime dimension will reveal that this was merely a test of your faith, and as a reward, they will grace you with valuable digital trading cards to sell to people for ten cents so that you may build up more pocket change for your next trip. Additionally, this will increase your odds of some day acquiring a booster pack, which you may then digitally open with your digital fingers and pray to the digital gods that you did not get any digital duplicates.\n\nThe unfortunate part of all of this, though, is that the game is bad and you should not buy it.","February 11, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LickTheFart/recommended/207370/","LickTheFart","Krakatoa Magma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LickTheFart/","123 products in account","eXceed Gun Bullet Children is the first game in the eXceed series (duh) and is probably the most forgotten one due to the source of its game being lost long ago. Other than its issues, the game itself is enjoyable, but not quite as enjoyable as the 2nd or 3rd game. I'm going to state the issues now and get to the real review later:\n\nISSUES:\n-The game is always full screen at a very low resolution, which gets annoying for when I accidentally hit the Windows key and the game decides to crash at a white screen when I go back to it (this can be fixed by using the game with DxWnd, though).\n-Pause is more like "stop" to the game. I press it, and I can't unpause it, so I have to restart.\n-The whole game is at a very slow FPS rate before you apply a Compatility Tool (find it in the Steam forums or search Microsoft's site) fix. With the fix it went from 15 to 30 FPS, but with certain compatibility modes applied along with the fix, I got a full 60 FPS, though going faster during the story scenes (talking scenes, whatever). However, this worked for my computer, but didn't fix it for my laptop. It gets 20-28 FPS with the fix and modes, while 2nd and 3rd run perfect at 60 FPS with no fixes needed.\n\nREVIEW:\neXceed - Gun Bullet Children puts you in place of the three characters Tinatu Kagaya, Sowel Devosiana, and Miyabi Housen. Each character comes with a unique attack. Tinatu shoots three spears at once, Sowel fires a rapid blue thing, and Miyabi is basically a flame thrower (she shoots fire in a line at a high speed so why not?). The whole game's story is hard to read without the translation patch (find it in the Steam forums or do a web search). Pretty much, you're fighting against vampires. I haven't made it passed the first level though....because I keep hitting V, the Windows key, and sometimes my pinky will slip and hit Control. I honestly wouldn't have minded a remake of this game since the source is gone and they can't update it, but come on, Capcom really could have remade this game themselves instead of releasing a very old version of it that even they themselves can't update or fix.\n\nOverall I'll give this game 3/5. Most of the rating goes to the controls and how pressing Control can instantly take you out of the game and how pressing V ("pause") will set you in an infinite pause and you'll have to restart the game, needing a compatibility fix and translation patch doesn't effect this rating at all since they're so easy to find, so take off 2/5 for this, but keep the 3/5 for how fun the game is until you mess it up.\n\nAlso if I could make a suggestion, just skip this game and play 2nd and 3rd. Coming from my computers (my desktop and my laptop) they both have no issues, as far as I've seen, and don't need any fixes or translation patches, and as far as I know the only things you'll really miss are the three characters in this game and who they are and what they do, which all that is pretty obvious from the first level of this game, they're humans fighting against vampires.","August 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's the most basic of basic games, clearly meant for another age long gone. The later two games are fun enough shooters, but this one needs some serious updating work done on it if anyone wanted to buy it on its own.\n\nOnly get this if its in a package deal with the rest of the series.

It just isn't great. I got it when the bundle was on sale, because the bundle was cheaper than buying just the 2nd and 3rd eXceed games.\n\nPros: It has cards, if you are into the trading cards. And, honestly, the last boss looked kind of cool. Also, this is the only eXceed game that let's you choose your character\n\nCons: Japanese voices with unreadable text. Though you can get the story from the eXceed website, if that matters to you.\nThe controls aren't ever explained. Here are the controls in case you decide to play this:\n\n'Z' Shoots\n'X' Makes you move slower for precise dodging\n'C' Uses a bomb, though bombs fire automatically when you get hit\n'V' Pauses the game\nLeft Ctrl exits an active game and returns to the main menu\n\nTo activate your special when the Graze gauge is full, let go of shoot and then press it again.\n\nThe game is very short. There are five levels, and I was able to get through them all on my first try without using all my continues. You could probably try to beat the game on harder modes and try not to use any continues, if you want to extend the game's life, but it just isn't worth it when the next two games in the seires are much better.\n\nSo, just don't get this unless you really like bullet hell games, and you get a good deal on it.","December 5, 2013","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I want to like this game. It is a stright port of Japanese bullet hell game. The game play is kinda fun. And the music is pretty enjoyable. I would guess the voice acting is also ok, but since I don't speak Japanese, I can't understand it.\n\nAnd I think that is the major problem with this game. I just don't understand anything about it. The story is in Japanese. There is no english for anything outside of button commands and  I don't understand why I have died. Or why I did not get hit by something I clearly did get hit by. Or what charge means. Or why the level is over when I did not kill the boss. Wheres the pause button? Why does ESC make me quit the game?\n\nI am the kind of gamer that does not mind a little vagueness in a game. And I am not one for reading instruction manuals. But this game really REALLY needs some sort of instruction manual, translation, or some sort of localization. This game is weird and I don't understand it.\n\nIf this kinda of game is your thing, great.

From Touhou, DoDonPachi and Radiant Silvergun so I'm always looking for new Bullet Hells to try out. I wasn't dissapointed with this game at all; whilst it might not offer the fast paced, thousands of ships like DoDonPachi or the more intricate scoring methods as Ikaruga for example, it still offers a challenge in the regard of the amount of bullets being thrown at you.\n\nThe first few stages are simple enough, and at the end you face a boss, as per usual in Bullet Hell games, although I was quite...surprised at the amount of bullets being thrown my way by stage 3. Easily coming in the hundreds requiring careful movements and spying the right moment to move to avoid that one bullet heading straight for you. The end game boss is ridiculous in size and of course, bullet count so much that I ended up with a game-over because there was little room to move and often got clipped by a bullet.\n\nIf you want a Bullet Hell that's enjoyable, short yet challenging then grab this game for what it's worth.","February 21, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Idk.\nThe game isn't in English, the only thing English was the start menu which even then has so many abbreviations I barely knew what I was messing with. and the horrible resolution that you CAN NOT change made it hard to understand what was there.\nThen when you actually get into this Intense action, guess what? the bars/information listed on the screen is indecipherable, you have no clue what any of it means or what it's used for. And you know the enemy attacks? of of the core elements of the game? Not even properly programmed. I was taking no damage from anything. I tried to die but didn't know where to start.\nHell I didn't even know what the controls were for the game. there's no way to see the default controls, you can change them in a certain order but chances are the game will freeze or bug out while you attempt to do so like it did for me. also there's a specific hotkey to go back through the menu. Don't press ESC because that will close the game no matter what.\n\nI'm honestly in shock that I was excited to get this game. It's like someone had an idea for a game, poorly put it together with  no effort, didn't test it at all, then threw it on Steam. Honestly, can I sue this company for ♥♥♥♥. I think this gave me cancer. My dog probably heard the sound effects from this game with his mlg hearing and became depressed.\n\nDo not buy this game, save yourself. I don't know if the sequels are any better or not but I'm not going to bother to find out. Which brings me to another topic: How the hell did this get a sequel? really?\n\nI'm so done.

Apparently there's a background story to it that's completely lost to me so if anyone with Japanese understanding would like to elaborate feel free to do so.\n\nThe shooting patterns become increasingly difficult to dodge and the entire game is accompanies by some techno beats that jell pretty well with the game in my opinion.\n\nSo if you're after anything story related this is a clear pass.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaredthegreat13/recommended/207370/","Jaredthegreat13","Patroclus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaredthegreat13/","140 products in account","I wrote a review of this game previously, however, I hadn't played very much of it at the time and deleted it later. Coming back to this game, my opinion has not changed. Understanding that this is a cheap game, you have to very much look into the motto "You get what you pay for". For 3 dollars, Gun Bullet Children feels like it was put together for a similar price. The graphics are quite ugly - I'm not entirely sure if the somewhat pixel-like graphics are actually intentional, or the result of the default resolution being very low, which to my knowledge, is unchangeable. What I am sure of is that the bullets themselves are quite jarring - they all appear in an oversaturated, almost neon red. It honestly reminds me of something out of MS paint.\n\nIn terms of story, it's a bullet hell game. Story really shouldn't be the main focus, but what I can understand from a playthrough with an english patch is that vampires have started terrorizing humanity, and the church is trying to fight back. Thus, you can choose from one of three of the pope's elite waifus. None of the characters, to me, really play well. There are different types of attacks per each character - one having a narrow attack, one having a wide attack, but I can't really feel like there's much of a difference between them; they all feel like the same mess. It doesn't help much when there isn't any allowance for diagonal movement, so using a controller is very anoying and it feels nearly impossible to control; thus your best shot is using a keyboard.\n\nAll in all, the saying "You get what you pay for" really applies here. The enemies are repetitive and the conveyance is pretty bad - it actually took me a while to figure out how to deploy my charged attack; to do so, you have to hold the pause button while holding the fire button. Why it couldn't have it's own key, I don't know. The gameplay is generally unfavorable, as bullets can feel pretty hard to dodge and it's not entirely clear where your hitbox is at times. All in all, you get a messy bullet shooter with pretty repugnant graphics, a forgettable soundtrack, very frustrating controls, and the one flaw that makes me want to set this game on fire: pressing the escape key, the one that MANY games use to pause, will close the game without warning. No pop up "are you sure?", no warning. It can close in the middle of gameplay and it has done this several times when I was intending to pause. You can only imagine how exremely frustrating this would be.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this game to either people looking to try out the bullet hell genre, or people who are experienced in it.","October 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you do this during gameplay, the game crashes. The game lags for me (admittedly not in demos I see online). I am using a modern gaming computer, so I see no excuse. I assume it is an OS issue (Windows 8), but I cannot verify that, nor is that acceptable. My game runs at less than half the FPS and framerate seen online. The in-game text is random gibberish symbols. The in-game voice is Japanese and unchangeable. The controls are locked at Z, X, C, and V. No other keys register (except Control, mentioned later, and Escape to quit the game), even for the Edit Controls option. Changing the volume settings do absolutely nothing whatsoever. Pausing the game is a permanent mistake, making it impossible to unpause without quitting the game entirely. The game is left literally unplayable. The furthest I've gotten is the spawn of the first enemy, where I accidentally pressed the Control key (right next to the arrow key), which I learned immediately is the key to restart the game at the title screen without warning.

The game has no resolution settings and you are only able to play it fullscreen and a very low resolution. You are able to change controls in the menu but it doesn't work well. A 360 controller didn't work and you are not able to change the movement buttons on the keyboard. Also changing the other buttons didn't work well. If you learn to deal with the controls the game plays fine. There is no level design. Only dogging bullets. The bullets are clearly distinct able from the background.

Hell, I don't mind if it's 'Nomal' difficulty, but at least give normal difficulty and no autobomb for default settings. Players can make it easier, but I'm not too fond of setting the game harder.\n\nSecond, the girls have ridiculously small hitboxes. Seriously. Even the girl with biggest boobs (I played with her first because her name is Miyabi lol) can fit through a .1cm gap. I know the difficulty is easy as default, but don't make the game easier just because of the non-danmaku players trying to play danmaku.\n\nThird, 16 FPS? I don't want to play slideshow simulator. It is a doujin game, but at least make it run well.\n\nFourth, the game pace is very slow. It feels like it took me an hour just for moving into game level 2. And when you change the game level, there are no transition. I don't care if you have a sliding transition or star transition, just try not to make a new game level like loading chunks of missing information in front of your eyes.\n\nOn the plus side is I get to play other danmaku besides Touhou Project. And the soundtrack is great, love it.\n\nI won't recommend this game for people who want to try danmaku,  your best bet is Touhou Project's Perfect Cherry Blossom, which have similar features from this game (also an earlier one, PCB was released in 2003), or you can try the newer eXceed, which I haven't played yet. But if you can understand Japanese, you can try playing this game for the story.","August 14, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It's not a remake of their completely amateur indie game from 2005, it IS that game.  Complete with low resolution, ESC quits instantly without prompt, and no English translation.  I played with each character on each difficulty.  On easy, it was boring during most of the stage sections, with nearly 10 seconds between enemies who just sit there until you kill them point blank before they fire a shot.  Many of the shots they DO manage were underwhelming.  The boss battles were generally simple, except for 4 or 5 completely BS attacks that don't belong with the rest.  On the other difficulties, IT'S THE EXACT SAME ENEMIES AND SHOT PATTERNS, except now normal enemies release a few extremely slow random shots when they die (which actually makes those parts easier, because flying close to bullets recharges your special attack), and the bosses literally just fire a handful of slow randomly aimed round bullets along with the existing pattern.

None of that matters if you don’t understand Japanese.  The subtitles are gibberish (somewhere I read that you need Japanese fonts installed for the subtitles to show up right, which still doesn’t help me.)  Perhaps you’re thinking, “Game developers aren’t obligated to make their games in English just for you stupid Americans.”  Well, if they want to sell their games to us, they kinda are, at least the menus and sub-titles (in English and Spanish.)  But this is the least of the game’s issues.\n\nThe graphics are bad; there is little detail in the characters and the bullets and bad guys are bland.  The controls are worse than the graphics.  Analog sticks work, just not diagonally.  Why don’t I just use the keyboard?  Because it’s not still 1984 and I traded my Apple IIe in a long time ago (it was actually a TRS80, but you get the point.)  Only the sound track feels like it has profession polish, otherwise it looks like something you might find the Gamemaker Workshop.\n\nIn conclusion, while you can get the game on sale for 74 cents, you have to ask yourself, what is your time worth?  If you’re looking for a scrolling shooter, get eXceede 2nd.

There is an options menu but the user is not allowed to make any graphical changes to a game that already looks extremely ugly and unfinished. Screenshots taken with Steam don't work properly. They capture part of the screen and most game assets are missing from them. The sound effects are repetitive and terrible. There are games from the Atari 2600 with more appropriate and more enjoyable sound effects than in eXceed - Gun Bullet Children. The artwork is in very low resolution in all areas. The three ships (girls) available to play as lack detail and personality, the enemies can hardly be described as anything that makes any sense at all, and the bullets are large red balls and triangles. Everything is so ugly and badly drawn. There is absolutely nothing in this game that is nice to look at or listen to. The gameplay itself is far too simplistic and limited to be enjoyable in any way. There is barely any challenge even in the more difficult levels. The controls are slow, unresponsive, and feel overall bugged and badly programmed. Everything about this game is low quality.\n\nFor veterans and fans of the shoot 'em up genre, this game can easily be skipped and never looked at. For the curious, there is nothing positive you will gain from the experience of playing a game that barely works.\n\neXceed - Gun Bullet Children is awful.","December 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

All in bullet hell however...\n\nGameplay - It's bullet hell!  Bullets are flying at you from where ever and fast paced, the boss battles are intense as hell however some moments are unfair as hell where I swear just drop a bomb because you know it's coming.  The game is, however, satisfying and has nice replay value\n\nSpecs/controls - Oh man is it busted.  Low resolution by default, escape EXITS the whole game *wtf*, and Japanese only (never really minded myself, but you can tell not alot of work was put into it*.  On a side note, it's only three bucks so mmk.  Some people rant about the graphics, however I actually really like it; old-school cool!\n\nMusic - Ok prepare thy ears, the music is fu**ing awesome!  Shibayan composed all of the music that made my ears tingle with delight and made stages and boss battles intense as hell, I even downloaded most to Mp3 (pressure is my favorite).  Sadly the music is the only reason why i'd give this game such a good review, but man is the music amazing.  The genre is like psychadelic trance without the snares, more techno vibed, and way more badass.\n\nOverall score - 6.5/10\nOverall opinion - Not for everyone by far, i'll just say you should think about it.  It's not bad!  Compared to the rest of the series in terms of gameplay. this scores the lowest.  I'd reccomend the 3rd, the 2nd's polarity machanic is straight from Ikaruga yet I didn't really like it...","November 28, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stibnitive/recommended/207370/","Stibnitive","Stibnitive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stibnitive/","449 products in account","Unlike eXceed 2nd, which I recommend, or eXceed 3rd, which is one of my favorite games of all, I think this first game is absolutely terrible. Allow me to explain why:\n\n1. The menue and options are terrible. Instead of picking a difficulty, you're automatically set to 'easy' unless you change it in options. The game is forced full screen in an extremely low resolution, making it look like absolute ♥♥♥♥ on my 1080p monitor and making it hard to see what exactly the hitbox is since the screen is so 'fuzzy'.\n\n2. The difficulty is all over the place. While, on easy, some things don't fire at all, there are some bigger enemies that fire a huge stream of bullets at you as if it's a later level in medium difficulty, or the first level on hard. Same goes for medium. Even more so: the patterns that are way too hard for the difficulty almost seem identical to that pattern on a lower level. I think this is because of the exceptionally small (and hard to see because of the glare) hitbox.\nThe first boss had this exceptionally high difficulty in every 'spell card' or 'pattern'\n\n3. It lacks variation. Just look up the first boss fight and you'll see that this fight, which takes 4 minutes, only has 3 patterns. The pattern on their own are very short so having them for such a long time only makes it more boring. The game goes for the levels. Especially the second level, which basically has two patterns: the one on the 2nd picture and the one on the 3rd picture (which is by the way easy difficulty, to strenghten point 2). All bullets being red doesn't help against the feeling that you lack variation.\n\n4. Audio quality is horrible. The music is mediocre compared to the other two games, but the big offenders are the voice actors. The voices sound forced and they sound like a sub-128 kbps MP3, distracting you from the game and throw off your groove (if you had any. see point 3). The voice actors didn't seem to know how a microphone works either. You hear the voices wave around as if the voice actor is still looking for the sweet spot distance from the microphone.\n\n5. The burst that you also have in the 3rd game is absolutely out of place. Pressing the shooting button after releasing it? Really? There are more than enough keys on the keyboard, why assign them to the same? I wasted basically all my bursts after I wanted to start shooting after a small time of nothing happening (which makes the game look elongated and see point 3)\n\n6. It's wasted potential. The controls are tight, which only makes matters worse: 'the core is there, but the producers did jack all to turn an engine into a game'.\n\n7. All of the points I've given strenghten eachother. If point 1, 2 or 3 was fixed, the game was a lot better since that would also fix many issues in the two remaining points.\n\nThis is honestly the least enjoyable bullet hell that wasn't a browser flash game that I ever played. If you want a steam bullet hell, go for either of the successors, preferably 3.\n\n","February 20, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, from a bullet hell standpoint, some things may be a turnoff.\n\nFirst off, there is more than 1 difficulty level, unlike some reviews say. However, in order to change the difficulty, you have to go into the options menu.\nIn addition, this game is only in Japanese. However, there are Patches of it available.\n\nNote that this is an older game. Therefore, if you run it on newer systems (without knowing how to get it to compatability mode) It will run slowly. What I did to solve this however, was go to the files for the game, right click on the game in the folder, then clicked Troubleshoot Compatability. Chose suggested settings, and it works like a charm. (For windows 10...)\n\n-This bullet hell, unlike others has no focus mode. Therefore, when the bullets are coming at you fast with small gaps, you can't easily move slowly to get inbetween those gaps.\n*EDIT!!!!*:Apperently it does... I was thinking Touhou, so the focus mode would have been on shift, instead of x like it is on this game. (X is bomb in touhou)\n-? There is no punishment for loosing a life. In other bullet hells, you loose a level of shot strength. Not in this game however. So it feels like death in this game is inconsiquenstial.\n\n+More friendly to people who have not played this type of game before in the way of Autobomb (automatically use a bomb when hit) and hitbox shown. These are toggleable to be off if you so choose so, for those who are more experienced. (under the options menu).\n\nThat being said, I got this on sale, so my perception of it is with it at a lower price than it normally is. Also, this game is the company's first. For a first game, this is pretty good I'd say.","January 29","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
