"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjo2e/recommended/265380/","banjo2e","Yooka-Laylee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banjo2e/","1941 products in account","Grimind is a game that tries to do too many things and ends up doing none of them well.\n\nIt starts out simple enough, with simple clear platforming and goals, with a creepy vibe to the environment. Then mechanics start getting complicated; the puzzles start to hide the fact that they're puzzles, enemies begin to swarm you, deathtraps pop up that you couldn't possibly have forseen. This would be excusable, but then the game's core components start tripping over themselves.\n\nThe platforming ends up taking a backseat to once-a-level gimmicks, none of which ever come up again once you've finished them. At one point, your character pulls the ability to create an astral projection to take over an enemy's mind out of his ♥♥♥ (and never uses it after this one time, mind you) but needs to be guided to the enemy first, with the most godawful controls I have ever seen. The rest of the game is playable with the controller, this section cannot be done on a controller because you have to do too much twitch aiming for the controller to handle.\n\nThe horror dies quickly once you realize all that's happening is that you're dying over and over again not because of a lack of skill but because your light source decided to arbitrarily change direction or shut off for no reason, or you had to spend a bit too much time underwater because that's the only place you could get a necessary item which slows you down when you carry it, or the enemies' movement patterns are all but completely unpredictable and cannot be reliably dodged. The final boss is especially guilty of this; he spawns hordes of enemies completely at random from the center of his only weakness, which you have to come into direct contact with in order to damage. Have fun instantly dying because the boss decided to spawn five enemies right as you were jumping up to hit him.\n\nThe last few levels are an exercise in frustration, forcing you to fight large numbers of enemies simultaneously with a control scheme that wasn't designed for any sort of fighting, in areas devoid of reliable ways of killing them (and only containing one or two unreliable ways to do so), without taking any damage whatsoever. Sure, you can take more than one hit, but without mercy invincibility it doesn't matter as the enemies cling to you like you're made of flypaper. These levels also have sections that don't have enemies, but I don't feel they're worth mentioning and neither does the game because you will not be given a single indication as to what you're supposed to do to progress. Meanwhile, have fun dying dozens of times in a row because the checkpoint system decided to spawn you right next to an enemy, and then not give you another checkpoint until you've successfully competed 5 minutes of needlessly obtuse puzzles.\n\nThe story...the story's a mess. You never find out what's going on, your character pulls new abilities out of nowhere just so the developers can shove in another single-level gimmick, the grammar is horrible, and to top it all off once you finally finish the game it turns out everything was pointless because you end up back where you started and then die, never having figured out a single thing about yourself, your opponents, the setting, or anything else.\n\nIf you want a horror game, a puzzle platformer, or a trial-and-death game, there are much better games out there than this.","June 14, 2014","false","4.7"," 92 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","92","104","2","0"

You will die. A lot.\n\nBut nonetheless, this is a really good game for some reasons : The story is simple. There is little dialogue and when there is some, it is always useful to the story. The soundtrack makes you feel like you are in an outworldly place, deep into the rock. The contrasts of light and shadow is well done, making you feel sometimes that creepy feeling that you are being watched. Some puzzles will make you sit for a while and think what is the next step to do, so don't be afraid to take your time.\n\nAn overall good game that I warmly recommend.","April 24, 2014","true","4.8"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenofthedead/recommended/265380/","kenofthedead","KenOD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenofthedead/","1076 products in account","I say yes, but only to a point.\n\nYou play as an amnesiac dinosaur like creature who is terrified and alone in a temple or city in a state of decrepitude.\n\nA simple platformer that never asks for very much in the way of challenging jumps, always lead you on where to go with how the stage is laid out to lean into or highlights with colour, and whose puzzles are never quite as complex as you might originally think they are. It falters a bit in the fact one should always have the "grab/hug" button pressed down so that when running or jumping you will get where you need to go more often than not, even if you fail to see what you are grabbing onto.\n\nTo try and stand out gameplay wise it uses a physics engine. This comes into play as you swing across vines, rocks crumble, water flows, creatures bounce off each other, and you the player picks up and throws balls. While okay, it's competent only and perhaps frustrating in the first few tries to figure it out at different points (a ball that explodes needs to be grabbed carefully). Never does much or asks for much.\n\nYet, it is still a game I took quite a bit from and enjoyed my team with up to a specific point.\n\nThe atmosphere and theme of the game is that of horror. The fear of being alone, of not really understanding what is out there in the darkness, and being dropped down into locations with rarely a reason why or what to do until you get close to the end. For this the creators of the game ask you to play in a dark room and with a good set of headphones and I dare say it accomplishes this task of making the game stand out far more than it would if played brightly and in silence.\nTo bring this into game play often you can be in the dark, shivering or moaning in fear, where that ball of light is precious for survival. Where if there is no light and you make a mad dash to freedom or follow a chance of survival, you look for the smallest of colours beyond the pitch black in near blind hope.\n\nI however never completed this game despite my thoughts above. For while it does stand out and I recommend at least early on for those seeking good sound and atmosphere examples, I never felt satisfied with the platforming and a change in game play in the second half of the game resulted in great frustration where I had to move a floating ball between obstacles and the mouse controls were simply not helpful and just plain annoying in how simple it was to fail due to the layout, floaty physics used, and "one touch to anything is a restart of the puzzle". I completed it mind you, but I simply stopped caring at that point.\nLater I saw it would often default to limited time of light available and follow the leader trial and error which without challenging platformer I've never cared for.\n\nI did enjoy it's use of achievements. Rather than "complete this chapter" or " jump 10 times in a row" they used a set-up of secrets in the game with the Achievement picture being a small close up picture of where to go to find said secret. I went to locate them simply because I enjoy this type of challenge and a few were clever in their hidden paths.\n\nSimple in most regards, worth trying out for what it attempts to do more than what it accomplishes, and perhaps you will not be as annoyed as I was in Chapter 8 to discover what this game is about and the amusing secrets it has for achievements which I found rather clever.\nAs part of a bundle, that is to get cheap or as a gift, it's worth trying out. If seeking out a platformer or horror game to really get into or at full price, I say nay.","July 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

It's so fundamentally mediocre that I don't feel anything towards it either way. It's entirely lacking in fun but there's not really much frustration to be had either. The enemies are a bit unfair since any hit is basically instant death. The puzzles are often anti-puzzles or otherwise pointlessly obscure. The game's not too terribly long (~4 hours the first time through for me) and it does a lot of different things, I guess. The art style's alright, kind of reminds me of Knytt Underground to some extent. The game wants to be LIMBO, also, with the atmosphere. The problem is that the narration... uhh... is unnecessary, and on top of that badly translated. Kind of ruins the plot, it's supposed to be dark and depressing but I'm giggling too much at the bad grammar. Also the ending is pretty stupid, you die, the end, you can't not die, so yay. Hope you had fun. But you probably didn't. I'm mostly rambling because I don't have many organized thoughts on this game. It's a game that exists but has no reason to.","September 8, 2014","false","7.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/265380/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Grimind is an atmospheric horror platformer puzzle game.  While an interesting concept, it is not executed very well with frustrating physics-based puzzles, boring writing with possibly the least satisfying ending to any game I have ever played, and a not terribly interesting art style.  If you play this game, expect to restart certain puzzles and sections many times due to their physics-based nature.  Games that use physics as a gameplay mechanic yet don't bother testing to make sure that moving platforms that are required to continue don't randomly throw you to your death make for very frustrating experiences that are not at all fun.  It is rather unfortunate because some of the other physics puzzles are quite creative and interesting.\n\nAs another note, if a game has a player escort section where you have to stick close to an NPC or you die, don't have the NPC take random detours from the path just to make it more difficult.  It turns the section into more of a trial-and-error frustration than adding any real difficulty.\n\nWhile some people might enjoy this game, it's too boring and has too many frustrations for me to recommend.","July 24, 2014","false","4.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews, I quickly glanced at, appear to be players who struggled with the difficulty; this is not an easy game, you have been warned.\nThe puzzles are varied and nicely separated by good old fashioned platformer fun.\nAlong the way the story is narrated, by short text, I found no fault with it. The ending made me chuckle darkly. There are some funny moments and the secrets are worth finding.\nGraphics are simple but well drawn. The game warns you to play with sound on, this is necessary as it helps with some of the puzzles and also it really adds to the atmosphere. I love the noise the little baddies make.\n\nRecommended for those that can hack a bit of frustration whilst figuring things out.

And that's not true at all! This game is not scary, only if you're afraid of pixels and wet, squishy sounds. On the other side, the physics work really well and the puzzles are relatively well done. The story might get you interested in playing the game, but the ending is a backstab, even if you get all the secrets to get something else.\n\nGameplay: Moderate (2/4)\nYou'll be playing with mouse and keyboard, and using well done physics to solve puzzles and advance. Controls are really simple, WASD to move, left click to grab, right click to throw. The puzzles are easy, but I struggled with one or another. Nothing too outstanding. There are secrets, fun ones, and you get something else in the end if you get all of them. Sounds enticing? Don't expect much!\n\nGame Visuals and Music: Moderate (2/4)\nThe game visuals aren't that much outstanding, too. The platforms are black rectangles with some overlaying leafs (also black) to cover them. The background is low quality but not bad. Grimind looks alright. The monsters aren't scary at all! This game uses colorful lighting very well, and when it does, it's really pretty.\nThere's no music, only ambient sound effects that fit really well. The monsters make wet, squishy sounds and a dry guttural. Not scary at all, also.\n\nGame Storyline: Bad (1/4)\nThe story got me interested, but the ending felt like a backstab.\nGrimind wakes up in... wherever he is. A cave-like place. He tries to escape, but he also feels too lonely, and needs to find a friend, or else he'll lose hope! And he finds a friend! ...Some blue sparkles. Do they find the exit? Is there an unexpected twist? You'll have to play to see, but I got really disappointed with the ending, I'll warn you.\n\nGame Entertainment: Moderate (2/4)\nNot a scary game at all, and I don't even know why it was labeled so. It's a nice platformer with some nice puzzles, though! But it's short. You can see I have 7.7 hours in this game, which 2 I spent hunting secrets. I struggled in some bits, but even so, 8 hours aren't worth it for that price. If you get the game in a cheap bundle, like I did, it's really nice!\n\nOverall: Moderate (4/10)\n\nI don't think it's an "Excellent" game for anybody.\nGood game if you get this in a cheap bundle, likes platformers, puzzles, looking for something alternative or short, and something that screams "INDIE!".\nModerate game if you are looking for a scary game, but likes how the game uses physics and the puzzles.\nBad game if you'll buy this for the full price, expecting something scary, gives a try and gets backstabbed with the ending!","December 11, 2014","false","7.7"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042438962/recommended/265380/","76561198042438962","Roy Rogers McFreely","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042438962/","27 products in account","Bought this game for a mere 2.99 on sale.\nFor that price, it offered 5-6 hours gameplay and some replayability. It is an Indie game, and I will treat it as such.\nThe developer markets Grimind as a horror/physics puzzle game, and that is about as descriptive as it gets. The gameplay is centered around completing the puzzles without any instruction or hand-holding. Not to say the puzzles are unsolvably difficult, but there are a few moments in which I scratched my  head in frustration and uttered a soft "what the hell do I do?" to my computer monitor. Once you get the feel of how the game operates, the puzzles start to become clear. The physics are also quite well done. I understand the developer reworked the inertia of objects and some other parameters for the game's Steam release, and the attention to detail shows. It seems more polished compared to early alpha footage (as one would expect). Objects can be picked up and thrown, liquids respond to disturbances, and soft-bodied pieces like vines move as they should.\nThe strong point of the game is the lighting. Beautifully done point lights and both "baked" and active shadow casting as well as ambient gloom in certain points lends to a strong setting for a horror scenario. Many levels throw the character into the darkness with nothing but a lit torch, and as everything in the environment is opaque black, one understands that death may be around every turn.\nAs for the "scare factor?" Some reviewers have thought the game is as frightening as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is not necessarily true. The scariest part of the game is the environment itself. The player is pursued by malevolent little--welll--boxes (with no animation) that may only be vanquished with bright light. The enemy design is unbecomingly bland for a game that seems so well-put-together in every other regard. The chase sequences get one's heart pounding, but it is not fear. The character animation is perhaps a little poor as well.\nThe sound work in the game is mixed. The background music/ambient noise are very impressive, and those elements are quite unsettling for the game. They chant at the player like spectral moans from an unknown source and never failed to cause my hair to stand on end. All other noises sound as though they were recorded by a desk mic in Audacity, like the growls of the monsters, drowning noises when underwater, and thunder of fallign boulders or objects. Their lack of quality just doesn't seem to fit, and they certainly didn't scare me.\nLastly, the game's story and dialogue were originally written in Polish. (I believe?) The English translation is rough around the edges, but I could understand what was being conveyed with a little bit of pidgin translation. The story begins with no scenario, and ends with little more. It was more depressing of an end than a satisfying resolution. Perhaps there is a metaphorical message to it all? Nonetheless, I would have preferred to see a more complete story. Maybe in the sequel we can see more character development.\nI give this game 7.5/10. For what it was, I enjoyed every bit of it, but I also see room for polishing all around.","July 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Great atmosphere, great visuals, sound, etc.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simple, but with the added aspect of terror. The game slowly builds on this as you progress and, I can admit, it was a bit scary to play at times (especially when you got little creatures running after you making horrid noises). They certainly got that aspect of the game down.\n\nOn top of the already fantastic gameplay, the game also presents fluid controls, aside from a design flaw that forces a controller user to use the second analog stick as a cursor, which can be a tad annoying at times (rather, all the time). The lack of real controller support was very disappointing.\n\nOverall, Grimind is an excellent game. Definitely recommended, but do remember to play with headphones (and in a dark room, preferably).","April 7, 2014","true","0.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/recommended/265380/","Nitman99","Nitman99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/","2197 products in account","As a curious gamer, watching the trailer left me very enticed; there are lots of interesting questions, about who you are and who your enemy is. But more than anything I was curious about the horror billing this title has; the majority of horror games take place in a first-person perspective so what kind of scares could be generated from a side scroller? The answer? Mostly jump scares.\n\nTo start let me mention that while this game has controller support, I would still recommend playing with m+kb. The gamepad just remaps the mouse and keyboard controls (which means no analog movement), with the right stick taking the place of the mouse, which is actually always on-screen. This isn't so bad for controlling the camera, but later in the game when you need more percise mouse movements (by the way precision mouse gameplay has never been fun) the analog stick won't be able to keep up. The Steam controller should be perfect for it, though.\n\nI guess the game could be described as a mix of LIttleBigPlanet's game feel and grab mechanic, Yoshi's Island's secrets, and a touch of Limbo's atmosphere, puzzle solving, and trial-and-error.\n\nAt its core this is a physics-based puzzle platformer. Like LBP, the movement and jumping feels floaty and unresponsive; this doesn't have Super Meat Boy controls but then again it doesn't necessarily demand them. Also like LBP it has a grab mechanic, but it actually does a bit more with it from a puzzle standpoint, as you can only grab one item at a time. It's especially interesting when you learn how to fight your enemy as that ultimately requires the grab too. The puzzles are good enough but definitely have the problems that come with physics; it's a little hard to see where the line is drawn as far as what they demand you to do with the physics, especially since nothing is easy. The puzzles can be a little obtuse at times so don't be afraid to think outside the box.\n\nIt has Yoshi's Island style hidden passages, which I've never been big on but they make a little more sense here with the darkness and shadows. Most of the secrets are pretty uninspired but they're structured pretty well, with one per level. This game works well as a level a day game.\n\nVisible checkpoints are cool.\n\nThe sound design is pretty good: sounds fade in and out as you move closer or further from their source, and heart throbbing won't abruptly stop at death, but linger onto the next life.\n\nBut the game's main selling point is horror, so how's that? Well like I said it's mostly jump scares, and even those only last for the first few levels. The game actually shifts from a corridor game to a multi-room puzzle game, which is kind of cool that they didn't feel married to their structure, but at the same time it evaporates a lot of their horror potentials. I wouldn't call this game scary.\n\nOne problem that lingers throughout this game is it works outside of its established rules often: I don't mean stuff like platforms that should be stable but aren't, but more like how jump scares will generate a noise that comes seemingly from nowhere, or how you're taught through tutorial text that you never see anywhere else in the game, or how sometimes the game just doesn't let you move even though you should be able to, for cinematic effect. It's just a lack of creativity, or laziness.\n\nThe main reason to play this game though oddly enough is its story: while it never answers some of your more pressing questions it does tell a nice story about overcoming your fears, friends, and all that. It's a little juvenille but it's cool, and it all leads to a twist that changes the fundamental gameplay of the game. That section is the best part of the game, and while I was impressed by it I ultimately can't recommend the game just for that twist. It's just really average, nothing offensive or frustrating except sometimes the physics but nothing too inspiring either. It would be good as a kid's first horror game.","May 31, 2014","false","11.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

It purports to be a physics platformer/puzzler, a genre which I enjoy; unfortunately, the poorly-made engine and Do It Again Stupid gameplay completely torpedo any chance I might have had to see any redeeming values.  The majority of my deaths felt like they were due to engine inconsistencies rather than player error, as my character let go of the vine he was hanging on for the twentieth time for no apparent reason or went one pixel too close to spikes.    Contrary to the game's marketing claim that I "wouldn't get bored", I got bored very quickly as I found myself replaying each (relatively long) segment between checkpoints over and over due to frustratingly loose controls.\n\nAlso, the game doesn't appear to have any sort of volume control whatsoever, which is annoying when you've given up on it and are just farming it for Steam cards.","December 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/265380/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","Before I start the review proper I just want to mention that it's rich that the people part of this community that gave Goat Simulator overwhelming positive reviews and got Grass Simulator on Steam because they're stupid enough to be bribed with keys think they have any right to judge a game with barely a plot harshly. Really amusing.\n\nAnyway, yes the plot is thin. Annoyingly so. I didn't get to see just what kind of creature the protagonist was nor why he was there and the ending was basically a downer of epic proportions similar to Hellraiser but from the start it was quite obvious this would be one of those "The journey is the story" games. I'm pretty sure that the ending is intentional since the game has "Grim" in its name though.\n\nOtherwise as far as gameplay goes I'm in love with it for similar reasons I was in love with Amnesia and Penumbra. The physics and world interactivity is awesome. So is the lighting (Those warm and cool color combinations look so damn pleasing to the eye).  I'm not really one that cares much for puzzles but in this case I just like seeing physics objects bounce around and there's plenty of that here. Kind of makes one wonder where the complaints are coming from since if I can manage to negotiate a puzzle in a game I'm pretty sure anyone else can.\n\nThe game is also technically interesting because of the engine the author wrote. It's a really simple one that just uses SDL, Bullet for the physics and TGA based sprites. I love it when people do stuff like this. So easy to just squeeze out a turd with Unity these days so it's extremely refreshing to see someone take a design and make it their own from the bottom up. This sort of thing is exactly what makes me remember the good times I had in my gamedev stints and makes me want to get back to it.\n\nI did a series on it here. Beware though, there's a whole lot of complaining from me about the morons that infest this community in it.","December 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Who has the nerve to release a game in such a despicable state?\nThis game is abominable. As soon as you start the game, the first problem you will notice is the awkward broken English and laughable monologue. Everything about this game is painfully amateurish, the art style is hideous, and the sound effects are repulsive, for example: when you spend too long underwater you start hearing a man gulping water, it's absolutely ludicrous. The art style is not consistent, the backgrounds are stretched and blurry but the most pathetic of all is the grabbing animation which consists of 2 single frames.\nThis guy failed miserably at everything but the level design which is decent for the most part. Avoid at all costs, even if you can get it for free.","June 17, 2014","false","3.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
