"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheStranger3/recommended/391660/","TheStranger3","The Stranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheStranger3/","176 products in account","Incitement 3 is a linear RPG with turn based combat, a heavy focus on plot development and narrative  and a damn fine game. It is the third in a series of games - I highly recommend playing the first two games before getting stuck into this one. Though each game is stand alone, many sub-plots and characters exist throughout the entire series. In order to understand the characters and gain deeper knowledge on the setting, it is important to experience the series as a whole.\n\nIt's a relatively short RPG, but is very well paced - unlike other games, the developer has not needlessly padded this game out with tedious grinding and fetch quests. Personally, I would love a much more involved and complex game set in the Incitement universe, but hey, I'm not one to complain. It's a good sci-fi RPG - such things are hard to come by. Don't expect choice and consequence, or a plot filled with twists and turns. Just sit back and enjoy a short story about politics within an alien galactic civilisation and humanities place in the grand scheme of things.","September 11, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","28","29","3","0"

Each part of the series (there are three games, all of which are included with the download and the first two of which are also available free elsewhere on the web) took about 6 hours, giving you a little under 20 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like about the game is that enemy health is not displayed, but I suppose that makes it more realistic.\n\nThe characters were good, the writing was decent, the storyline is both unique and interesting. Overall a good game, and well worth the $0.89 I got it for on sale.","November 20, 2015","true","6.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Since all 3 are part of the same purchase I can safely say that these are amongst the best of RPG Maker games. The space-themed plot is well worked and interesting, grind is fairly minimal for this type of thing, and the fact you are getting three for one makes this a worthy purchase at its full price and a must-buy when discounted for all but the most staunch RPGM haters in terms of hours of enjoyment for your money.\n\n(NB. Incitement and Incitement 2 can be found by right clicking your Incitement 3 install>properties>browse files and either activating them from there or just pulling the shortcuts)","April 11","true","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The plot is there, the characters are well thought out, and the gameplay is pretty good. Even the music is pretty good (I loved the Subway scene's music). I only wish it didn't have to end so quickly honestly. Your characters basically max out at level 20, which is a little disappointing but I get it.\n\nMy only real qualm was the missions near the end. Once you complete the mission you're not allowed to go back into the area. I don't really see why this is, but it's kind of aggravating if you missed any chests. Overall I'd still give it an 8/10. Play on!","February 26","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Im actually kind of digging this game. Fun rpg aspect, nice story line and hidden quests. Also the shop on your space ship is called THC, thats a big win in my books. :D\n\nI will say this though, $9 is a hefty price to pay for a 2d game, i could buy a AAA title that is a few years old with $9.\nWait untill they drop the price or untill its on special if you plan on buying this game.\n\nOther then that, not a bad little 2d game to kill time.","January 9","true","3.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Challenge mode is where you want to be to get the most out the game but normal is still enjoyable and don't miss out on Incitement 1 and 2 which are included in the purchase so be sure to look them up in the Incitement 3 folder.

Since I've played quite a bunch of RPG Maker titles my expectations are mostly pretty low, however this time I felt pretty invested and I was pretty happy about those 6 hours of cool ideas. Unfortunatelly there is almost no guide through the game's basics and some of the main characters are a wasted opportunity. Neverthless I am so glad I could play this game - even though it's main 9$ bucks are pointless and ons should probably just wait for some sail or a bundle.","March 11","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
