(areas feel the same, score is similar; few note changes; puzzles feel the same; you can tell which ones aren't ripped from Professor Layton because they're the ones that are boring/easy)\nIf you have played the Professor Layton games and you enjoy them, then I would advise that you don't buy this.\nThe puzzles are easy, and the game shows little innovation or changes to the game that it tries to immitate.\nNot only that but some of the puzzles are incompletable without the use of hints, purely because they were poorly thought out. For example, a few puzzles in the game require that you look at the puzzle description for the answer (i.e. the answer is  a sequence of letters in the puzzle description). This makes little sense to me; as all the information that you require to solve the puzzle should be given through clues (i.e a riddle provides you with all the clues to deduce the answer) or hidden in the puzzle area.\n\nFor £3.49 I still feel that I purchased a game that could've been better, had the developer taken some more time to improve on Professor Layton instead of attempting to copy Professor Layton.\n\n3/10","October 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

The music they've decided to use quickly becomes stale, which is easily corrected by using music players (ergo Spotify) with ambient tunes that help you think. I don't mind doing this but some people might.\n\nThere's not much going for the story other than finding Tery, and the plot quickly becomes more odd as the game progresses. However there were enough twists to keep me occupied, and it was only after I finished the game that I realised the the main character, 'May Stery', sounds like 'Mystery'. I'm that thick.\n\nThe main story has 100-somewhere main puzzles to completed, which excludes the 100 additional bonus puzzles, which I will probably never do. I am slow so most people will take half the time I did to finish the game. Many of the puzzles are similar to puzzles you already know, eg 'How do I move everyone across the river but I can't leave these people together because they don't like each other?' So you may know the answers to some puzzles off the bat.\n\nI haven't played many puzzle games before so I don't really know what to base this off.\n\nAlso, May's voice is adorable.\n\nAlso, ♥♥♥♥ THOSE RHYTHM PUZZLES, THEY ARE SO DIFFICULT","October 19, 2014","true","15.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/recommended/327650/","undox","undox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undox/","4208 products in account","With the popularity of Nintendo's Professor Layton series, it is expected that other will try to copy the formula.  Wanting to get into it, software maker V5 decided to make their first game in the same style.  While their software programs are great products, their first video game leaves something to be desired.\n\nWhile the game tries to make the game seem logical through a story, it is a weak one at best.  The art style clearly point towards a kid's appeal with simple design and button eyes.  However, as various point, the story feels like it is really for adults.  One part asks the player to give medication to make someone fall unconscious.  Such questionable material should not be in a game that would be appealing for kids.  Even when it the game is squarely in the children area, walking fishwomen and birdmen just keeps the story from getting even slightly believable.  With the game's bipolar story, it makes you wonder if the story was written by one person or by committee.\n\nAt the heart of the game, the puzzles also feel as juvenile as the story.  Most of the puzzles have such a dated feel, they seem like something that came from an old puzzle book.  Such a dated feeling make it that only kids will not have heard at least a variation to the puzzle.  Even if the player cannot figure out the puzzle, the hints make it so easy, they all but say "This is the answer."  It is one thing to make an easy game, but to make it that thinking is not required for a puzzle game defeats the purpose of a puzzle game.  When making a puzzle game, being able to solve it using your own brain and logic makes it a rewarding experience.  Without it, it is not worth playing at all.\n\nOne thing that they try to do to mix things up is adding music levels into the mix.  Just like the puzzles, the music is also lacking in appeal or personality.  Every song has a simple pattern, many of which sound like they could be from a single-tone like a foghorn or whistle.  As for playing the songs, the player simply has to repeat the pattern of the music.  Once again, unlike other games like Rock Band or Dance Dance Revolution, it does not take much skill to do enough to clear a song.  Additionally, if the player does enough to reach the quota, then they can just let the song run without doing anything else to finish.  Since they put seemingly no sought towards the music, it hardly worth having them in there in the first place.\n\nDespite their efforts to be original, the game ends up being a poor man’s Professor Layton.  Even for those areas that are different, they just feel like bad versions of other, better games.  Even with the questionable story, the game has a childlike feel, and children are the ones that will clearly like this game.  For everybody whose age is in double digits, they are better places to look.","March 26, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edderiofer/recommended/327650/","edderiofer","edderiofer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edderiofer/","308 products in account","As many of the other commenters have said, this is a game that aspires to be a Professor Layton game. Except, of course, there are a number of giant flaws that make the game completely unpalatable, unlike Professor Layton.\n\n1. Puzzles are rather easy for the first three chapters ("Find the gigantic name scrawled on the wall and input it into the answer box.") and suddenly spike up to "lots of brute force required"-difficulty ("Which of these four hands of cards has the best chance of winning a game of Variant Poker?") during the last chapter. It's as if the developers had no idea who their target audience would be, so they just mashed up a bunch of random puzzles and riddles and called it a game.\n\n2. Puzzles are ambiguously worded in many cases (The bug spray can't be "next to" the bugs? Is that "orthogonally" or "orthogonally and diagonally"?), thus making it impossible to determine which solution was intended. In some cases, multiple solutions are accepted, but in others, they are not.\n\n3. The rhythm "puzzles". The game asks you to repeat the rhythm of a certain tune it plays. That's it. No puzzle elements in it whatsoever, so I'm really not sure what it's doing here. If I wanted a rhythm game, I would have bought a rhythm game, not a puzzle game. On this note [pun not intended], the tune always plays twice, save for one exception right in the middle of the game, which only plays once. This is unnecessarily annoying and time-consuming in the first instance, and disorienting in the second.\n\n4. Completely unbalanced hint system. Either the hint system is useless (in that the information it gives you is information you already know), or that it gives you information you yourself couldn't work out (which defeats the whole purpose of a puzzle). In one particular case; namely, a puzzle asking you to count the number of mate-in-ones on a chessboard; the hint itself gives completely false information (a king moving out the path of a rook can only give discovered check in six ways, not seven).\n\n5. No explanations for your answer's truth value. It only tells you whether your answer is right or wrong. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. However, given the problems noted above, this just makes the game ridiculously unplayable, and turns the game into one of "Guess what the person who made this puzzle was thinking when he came up with an incorrect answer which we won't hint at!"\n\n6. The puzzle resets itself if you get it incorrect (which, during the last few chapters, is practically inevitable). You got it incorrect due to a slightly misplaced piece? Have fun placing them back in.\n\n7. Sliding puzzles. There are at least 40 of them in the game. However, as far as I dare to check, they are all of the same size (3x3), and there is a trivial method for solving sliding puzzles, making these pure timewasters.\n\n8. Plot holes everywhere. What happened to the balloonist? Did Lukatello make it out alive? Is Doyle really completely incompetent at this whole "keeping one's intentions secret", and is May TRULY so stupid that she doesn't suspect a thing until Doyle meets Uter (yet is apparently intelligent enough to be able to solve brute-force 4-piece dissection puzzles in her head)?! How do we even know that that person IS Uter (and not one of Uter's lackeys), and that Doyle isn't merely Uter in disguise?!\n\nThe key difference between this "puzzle game" and any game from the Professor Layton series is that this game seems to want to be at odds with puzzle-solving immersion, as if the creators of the game hated puzzles with all their fortunes and wanted to intentionally ruin peoples' puzzle-solving experiences while raking in money for a garbage product.\n\nAll in all, it is an absolutely horrible game with no respect whatsoever for the player's time. Your £6.99 would be far better spent on, say, Braid, QUBE, or Sokobond; where the creator has actually test-solved all the puzzles and verified that they aren't completely outrageously impossible or broken. Don't even bother getting this game unless it's to verify my observations, in fact; I wouldn't even take it for free.","May 16, 2015","false","10.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sadly it’s not as good at balancing puzzle difficulty or at distributing said puzzles in a storyline.

I am disappointed that it fails to get close.  (Layton fan who has puzzle 100% completion on all the games)\n\nOne of the great elements of the Layton games is the personality of the characters.  They are approachable, friendly and are great catalysts for adventure.   The support characters are introduced at times which are relevent to the story and not in waves of people.  Although the story in the Layton games is key to it's success, it manages to play on a level field with the puzzles.  The puzzles themselves don't just reflect the story, but with frequency, they tell and enhance it.\n\nThis game fails to unite these three elements.  The characters are fairly hollow, the story is convoluted and the puzzles (all too frequently) are driven not by difficult design, but instead by difficult phrasing.  Couple this with a hint system which generally fails to explain what the puzzle is actually asking this game creates frustration not stimulation.\n\nHaving said that, there are puzzles which are suitibly challenging as a consequence of good design.  It is a pity that they are so few and far between.\n\nCombining the poor story and poor puzzle design with the poor options (including limited sound and video options) I cannot recommend this game very strongly.\n\nThe grain of salt that must come with this review is that I am a Layton fan and those games are the very best the genre has to offer.  For all my criticism, this is not a bad game.  It is just that compared to the leading game in the genre it is not as good.\n\nI would love to see this game simplified.  Limit the story and focus on the puzzles.  It needs to find something that makes it different to the competition, and at the moment it is nothing more than a Layton clone.\n\nDo I recommend it?  I think that people who like Layton may find it ok.  It is no replacement though.  If this had a demo which I had been able to play, I would not have purchased it.","January 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a puzzle solving game that is EXTREMELY similar to the Professor Layton series.  Don't be deceived by the game's childish art style, the puzzles can be quite challenging for adults.\n\nI believe there are over 250 puzzles in this game, including optional ones.  Only about 80 of them are required to beat the game.  Most of the puzzles can be solved with critical thinking, but there were a few that I admit I had to use a walkthrough to solve.  I really liked the hidden objects and written answer puzzles, just because I could usually solve them myself.  The rhythm puzzles were a bit tedious, and the sliding and the hidden picture puzzles were just really boring and difficult for me.  Luckily there is only 1 required hidden picture puzzle, and only 2-3 sliding puzzles that weren't that bad.  The rhythm puzzles are commonly used, with 3-4 in each chapter, all of them required.  If you find them difficult or, like me, too tedious, you can always use hints that you gain from solving bonus puzzles.  I'm really glad they put this in, as the hints saved me so much time and effort, and got me out of many tight spots.\n\nThe story is quite simple.  You are May, a girl who got into a balloon accident and has landed in a strange town.  To top it off, your brother is missing.  Sucks to be you.  You must go out into Dragonville and try to find your brother and what is up with the citizens of Dragonville.  One of the main problems I have with this game is its use of characters.  Most of the characters in the game only serve to be used for 1 or 2 puzzle, and then they are never seen again.  In fact, only about 5 characters are in more than one of the four acts.  The ending contained a plot twist that I pretty much saw coming from a mile away.  I'm really just glad they bothered with a coherent story.\n\nOverall, I would suggest this game if you are interested in a puzzle solving game, or if you just want to think a little.  While it is worth the full price of $10, I would suggest waiting until it is on sale, mainly since the steam summer sale is just around the corner.","June 2, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The heck and i thought this was a kid's game.\n\nNeeds improvement on difficulty. Hint system alwso a few times show hints that are COMMON SENSE. Some are even already built in the puzzle themselves. Story can also be improved but i dont know exactly how. The rythmic games are also hard when trying to "hold". Puzzles where the instructions are sometimes too complicated. A puzzle where even i had to look at a walkthough and input the correct answer several times and it wont accept. I had to retry and rerun the puzzle for it to accept the correct answer\n\nI recommend this game if you want a casual puzzle game up until the middle. Once you reach the final chapter. Puzzles became HARDER.","January 19, 2015","true","16.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

The puzzles are generally not too tough, but can still stretch you a bit. The hint system is forgiving, but without taking away your incentive to solve puzzles without it. The bonus puzzles provide a flexible alternative way to progress.

Unfortunately it pales in comparison to the Professor Layton games, namely in feel, story and puzzle design, but for a cheap imitator it does the job good enough.","February 7, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(They might also have more patience to sit through the pointless delays before and after the puzzles.)\n\nThe story is definitely for children (but interesting enough that I wanted to see the end, and not just solve all puzzles). The puzzles seem aimed at kids too.\n\nI don't know how bright children are these days, and of course they don't all have the same grasp of puzzles, so my vague guess would be somewhere between age 8 and 12.\n\nIf you're relatively old and fuzzyheaded like me, always liked varied puzzles but just aren't up to the tough stuff anymore, this might entertain you too. There's plenty to do, and you can return to all the puzzles (skipped, solved, as well as unlocked bonus) at any time, including after the end.\n\nI turned off sound (and thus skipped all rythmic puzzles), so I can't say anything on either.\n\nThe interface is easy.\n\nOnly thing I don't like (beside the sound) is the pointless delay before and after the puzzles, as mentioned.\n\n","February 2, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It attempts to emulate Professor Layton series and its style of gameplay, but falls up short in almost every aspect. Story is bland, puzzles go from slight thought to "I need to have graduated from high school to answer this math problem" hard. A few of them are just hard math, no "puzzle" aspect at all. The voice acting in the few cutscenes feels bland and forced. The character's "animations" are barely animations at all. Disappointed. At least they had a good variety.\n\nRATING: 4/10.\nPick up the Professor Layton series for a good puzzle game.","April 1, 2015","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
