(I've read some complaints about this before I bought it, which is pretty shocking to say the least)\n\n- If you are looking for a well-rounded, misteryous and fullfilling experience, go for it.\n\nI certainly enjoyed the whole game, and did not get tired of it at all, which is something that uses to happen to me lately. Played it in 2 sessions, 3-4h total, and found many carefully placed secrets (most of them were not even needed to complete the game, which is something I personally love) and interesting details.\n\nAs an indie game fan, I would say this game highlights the difference between a studio who loves their job and COD-like titles.\n\nTL;DR: If you want a 3-4h well-rounded indie narrative, go for it!

Massachussets? Massachusetts - that one is right, no red squiggles.\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nThis is a tough one to review because... well, it's hard to talk about a game with an enigmatic story and puzzles without inevitably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in someone's bowl of cornflakes. Suffice it to say you are a heavily medicated doctor trapped in his hotel room in Boston.\n\nAnd it's a pretty darn nice room if I do say so myself. Spacious, plenty of chairs and couches for guests, a record player and television set... the bathroom has a nasty leak but otherwise if this were a hotel review, I'd give it a 4/5 - just short of perfect since I'm being held there against my will. I have to dock points for that.\n\nIt's your standard point n' click adventure game: pick up random things, combine them, smash them together, etc. What's cool about it is you can walk around all first person-like, and that freedom of movement, coupled with the creepy atmosphere, definitely kept me on my toes. There's nothing outright frightening so far... just the overwhelming sensation that I'm being watched, judged.\n\nAnalyzed.\n\nPuzzles are good and varied, and the game provides clever hints assuming you're paying attention. And the graphics are nice. Not great, not dated, just nice... there's no physics to speak of, or other characters that I've encountered - just the hotel room, so it's hard to screw that kind of thing up. The sound design is great though, definitely worth mentioning! Heavy footsteps, rainfall, creaks and leaks, all adds to the sense of dread and loneliness. Finally the story... hasn't really captured me just yet. Yes it's mysterious, but it's too mysterious and, thus far, entirely reliant on note fragments and newspaper articles.\n\nBut I have to finish it! I'm currently stuck on this particularly perplexing puzzle. Think I'm about done though, and short of the ending coming out of left field (Zionist dinosaurs have conspired to lock me away in a hotel room to keep me from completing Chicken Soup for the Soul), I think this is a worthwhile purchase for puzzle/tense, atmospheric adventure game fans.","March 10","true","2.3"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","81","70","86","31","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/recommended/402040/","PyroTyger","PyroTyger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/","458 products in account","It pains me to give this a negative review, but I was left feeling so underwhelmed.\n\nI LOVE Room Escape games. From The Room to Submachine and every free Flash game in between - if it has intriguing, logical puzzles then I'll be glad to play. A room escape with an intriguing story line and detailed graphics? Hell yes, I'm sold.\n\nThe puzzles were... fine. None of them really challenging for a seasoned puzzle addict, more a case of hunting around for the bits you need and putting two & two together. Solid, but not spectacular. Mechanically, they were extremely well implemented, and integrated into the world, and for that I do congratulate the developers - the influence of The Room is clear. One in particular - involving aligning markings to form a pattern - was elegant and truly innovative.\n\nBut the game falls down hard in the extras that it promises. Without wishing to spoil anything, I found the writing to be clumsy, tired and directionless. It starts as a mystery and smudges seamlessly into the worst of tired tropes, without really making any sense in between. The puzzles and the story don't mesh together in any way - you're told what the arbitrary challenges were for, in-world, but at the same time they're presented as far deeper and more insidious than they are. (Using blunt sinister thematic keywords as passwords is sitll arbitrary - change the theme to Lovecraftian horror and replace the puzzle answers with "DAGON" and "RLYEH" and nothing is lost, see?)\n\nThe writing, in short, was a thin thematic skin and nothing more. Which would've been easy to brush off if it hadn't been such a clumsy cultural throwback too. It was like a Mcarthyite fever dream. 1984 for kids. Given the rich detail of the assets and lighting, the theming was all the more jarring.\n\nThe other big problem was the mechanical immersion. Having the game be first-person is such an interesting and unusual tool for puzzle makers (cf The Witness, Portal, Perspective, FRACT) that, sadly, only ever served to get in the way of this game. Stumbling around furniture in the dark isn't tense or fun, it's just annoying. Not being able to see properly into drawers & cupboards makes the object hunting a chore. Both these problems are nonexistent in room-escape Flash games, but are introduced by using first person perspective. It was a bold move that didn't pay off.\n\nAnd the labyrinth, my god, the labyrinth.\n\nThe labyrinth really exemplified the problem I had with this game. It wasn't fun. It wasn't challenging. It wasn't tense. It didn't communicate anything about the character, the world, the game mechanics, it wasn't a puzzle or a significant storytelling device, it was nothing. Nothing but a tedious 5m+ trial-and-error walk through a blocky corridor, rendered in quite pretty atmospheric lighting. I just don't see what the developers were trying to achieve or communicate through that device. I don't see why they thought it was a good idea. It was an incongruous, boring intermission.\n\nIt was a gimmick, not a new or clever one, and it made no sense, didn't tie in thematically or mechanically to anything else, did nothing but frustrate and distract. What was the point?\n\nI played the game through in a couple of hours, and enjoyed the puzzles well enough in spite of the problems I've stated. But while I could've played the puzzles quite happily for another two hours, the theme, the 1st-person mechanics, the writing, all would've annoyed me more and more. It ended when it had to, and left no impact in the process.\n\nThe developers clearly have real talent with regards to building a solid, pretty, functional game, and I hate to imagine that this review might discourage them from pursuing that. They have good ideas, solid mechanical competence, and I want to see more. I just feel like they never had anyone sit down with a critical eye and ask them, "What is this bit for? What are you trying to accomplish there? What are you hoping to make the player think or feel? Do any of these elements support each other, or are they just thrown in to fill the gaps?" Some good writing and creative direction could've turned this game into a little gem, but it's not a gem. It's coal. Solid, functional, unexciting - burn it up and it's gone, leaving nothing behind.\n\nI'm not angry, just disappointed.","March 14","false","2.4"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","53","67","2","3"

So you have to figure it out by discovering the surrounding and look for clues. To proceed and unfold the story / secret, it is necessary to solve puzzles.\n\nThe puzzle spectrum (level of difficulty) can be described from simple / easy up to hard and challenging, but always logical. One particular puzzle is based on audio, so you should have good acoustical capabilities. Up to a certain extent, the puzzles are procedurally generated.\n\nThe decent graphics and sound build up an amazing atmosphere.\nIf you are an achievement hunter and not rushing thru the game, it keeps you busy for a couple of hours.\n\nGreat game; clear recommendation!\n\nUpdate: Let us be thankful to the benefactor; work hard, increase production…! ;-)","March 14","true","8.3"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","38","44","0","2"

The graphics were superb and the sound design created instant mood and tension. This was truly the rolls royce of room escape games and a first-person experience that really drew you in. Again, I have ONLY one criticism; that it was short.\n\nIn other words, I want MORE.\n\nBravo to these devs for giving us an intelligent game for human beings. I hope you make a dozen like it or one a dozen times longer. Either way, you earned a loyal customer today. This game was absolutely EXCELLENT.

The way the music is played and how cryptic the messages are makes you feel like you're constantly being watched with every move you make, which in its own, is very creepy.\n\nThe puzzles can be a little difficult at times, one of them was so easy but I just needed to take a break from the game for a minute to refresh my mind. They can be easily solved with just a little more thinking, plus it's always helpful to keep a small notebook beside you for notes, just in case. I haven't fully completed the game yet but it's amazing to see how many different puzzles can be created in just one portion of the room.\n\nI highly recommend this game to someone who like to have a little chill run down their back but one who loves a mystery as well. I'm not one who can handle scary games that well so this is the perfect type of creepy for me. I'm also looking forward to completing this game and hopefully adding more to this review after. :)","March 12","true","3.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","2"

Evertyhing is so well thought and polished that you can feel the love put by devs behind it. Most of the games of this genre usually have a huge problem in my opinion: sometimes you get major feedback about your progression so you know exactly where to go next and sometimes nothing is said to you so you feel completly lost. However this game alternates perfectly those pauses and feedback moments, so you don't feel too much lost and at the same time they don't tell you "monkey, IT'S THERE".\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice too, the lights and shaders make it even better and the music and sound keep you uncalm all the game along. There are two moments where the music changes: the first one is an amazing song which I really enjoyed (I searched it later on the internet to download it) and the other one is a classic one.\nThere is also a scene so beautiful that I would like to print a screenshot and put it on the walls of my bedroom.\n\nGlobally an amazing game.

A thumbs-up feels too enthusiastic, and a thumbs-down feels a bit unfair.\n\nThe Guest is a mixture of escape-the-room, point-and-click, walking simulator, puzzle, and mystery. There are also elements of suspense and sci-fi, and the combination of all these works pretty well overall. The controls weren’t too clunky, but they could stand some refining. I will note that I experienced two technical problems, one of which could have been game-breaking. Also worth noting is that I was unable to save the game once I reached the latter half. Since I finished it that evening, it didn’t really matter to me. But if you plan on spreading this game out, beware. The Guest only takes about 3-4 hours to complete, though, so finishing it in a sitting is feasible.\n\nI absolutely love when games are atmospheric, and The Guest is just that. From the sound effects to the lighting to the graphics, The Guest captures a certain atmosphere and doesn’t let go of it. Having said that, atmosphere is this game’s strongest point; on other fronts, it felt a bit lackluster. I enjoy a good puzzler, but I felt that these puzzles were at once too difficult and too mindless. I solved a couple of puzzles by more or less clicking randomly, and that’s just not satisfying. There’s one puzzle in particular (under the bathroom sink) that just did not make sense to me, even with the in-game “guide” to it. Maybe that’s just me being a dummy, but I would have never solved it without checking a walkthrough. The puzzles worked pretty well mechanically, but from a player’s viewpoint they were not very intuitive. They were mostly tedious, and I had a few moments of: "Am I supposed to know what to do here?". I find it hard to say that a puzzle game is objectively good when the puzzles just aren’t what they should be. With a little work, though, Team Gotham could make some really lovely puzzles.\n\nStory-wise, I felt a bit cheated. There's a fine line between mysteriousness and vagueness, and The Guest unfortunately crosses over to the wrong side of that line. There are questions about the world and characters and plot that we just don’t get answers to. The material is undoubtedly there, it just isn't brought to its full potential. The premise is gripping, but it's not fleshed out as much as it should be, leaving players with more of a skeleton than a meaty game. Truth be told, I really do want to see a sequel to this game, where the puzzles and controls are more refined and the story is more prevalent and better developed. If Team Gotham makes a sequel, I’ll be playing it. And if I’m not mistaken, The Guest is their first project; for a first project, this is a solid and respectable effort. (And if you’re into achievements, there are some easy ones and some hard ones. I enjoyed the achievements a lot, even though I couldn’t get some of them.)\n\nIn the end, The Guest left me wanting more. Sometimes for the wrong reasons, sometimes (maybe mostly?) for the right ones. I’ve chosen to give this game a thumbs-up because I did overall enjoy my experience, and I appreciate this game for what it is. I feel a bit disappointed in it, and I can absolutely see its fault, but it’s not bad. If you’re willing to take a $10 risk, buy The Guest. You might be disappointed, but you’ll probably be appreciative. It’s worth it for the beautifully crafted atmosphere if nothing else.","March 16","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes finding a required hint or item was tricky since the environment is very dark at times. The last puzzle can be solved by  randomly moving the sliders and testing the combination in 2-3 minutes , which should maybe be corrected or redesigned.\n\nAll in all, a nicely made game with puzzles that anyone can solve, without having to look up a guide :) The story is a nice element that ties the game together, but nothing crazy overall.","March 13","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you just want 'some fun' or it is on sale then by all means, let the game entertain you.\n\nThe title etc is a bit misleading from my point of view. You go in thinking you  will solve the mystery of how you got into the room and eventually will come out again which sort of makes you want to play  this.\nThis won't be happening though. The ending is really abstract and makes no 'proper' sense.\n\n+the graphics are stunning\n+the atmosphere is amazing at times\n+the puzzles are creative, with various levels\n+the story line is okay\n\n-no guidance on what you have to do so you sort of just figure it out, the puzzles aren't super easy or sort of numbered out\n-the ending leaves me going 'oookay' in an abstract way(has nothing really to do with the 'real world' anymore)\n-you get to know the history of why you're there and what you ought to do if you weren't stuck in a room but it's not really..impacting anything or giving you information as to why this is happening?\n\nIf you buy this game, don't go in thinking it's a horror game, the end will ruin it for you. If you just want to spend some time on puzzles for 3 hours roughly then go for it. It's atmospheric but it's also abstract.\n\nHope this helps?","March 19","false","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There was a distinct feeling of unease for me as I tried to figure out what was actually going on. Early puzzled do a good job of slowly ramping up.\n\nThe game is lovely (although I did need to play with the brightness due to bloom - but that's a personal issue), and I found generally played well as far as being able to manipulate objects.\n\nCons:\n\nTowards the end, some of the puzzles felt obtuse to me. I eventually had to go to a guide to find the answer to one that was required for game completion. While I finished the game, part of that was diminished a little to me since I KNEW that there were two puzzles that were left unsolved. This does mean I'll play it again, but not for the reasons that I would normally like (branching paths/morality choices).\n\nA note to any players who have a hearing imparement: There is a single puzzle that is tone based and is randomized. This has been mentioned as an accessibility issue for hearing impared players (or those who are just tone deaf) in the community, but as of that time I'm writing this I don't believe that it's been addressed.","April 3","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The puzzles are fairly easy, or can be brute forced without much difficulty, and there are lot of loose ends with no real lead up or resolution, and the twist is unexpected but akin to finding out at the end of Myst that the main character was a Lizardman, out of nowhere and lacking any real connection to any of the previous elements.\n\nI never actually knew or cared about why I was Leonard, why a game set in 1986, of all times, has some futuristic trappings, and while you get to see a glimpse behind the curtain of the room trap, it goes no further than that and you're railroaded all the way, barring some obscure hidden puzzle.\n\nPuzzle solving at it's core is hunting for random stuff in the dark, and most of them are red herrings, so much so there's a cheevo for grabbing all the crap, which makes inventory management a little hard. I wish I wasn't being so dead honest about the nature of this game, it is nothing but finding junk in the dark, and finding ways to turn on the light so you can find said junk, and then using it to solve a puzzle.\n\nI guess a good way to put how the ending makes me feel, is that I didn't really feel indoctrinated- Bioshock and White Night made you realize that you'd been playing to someone else's rules all along and hadn't noticed it, whereas this game's antagonists have a very low bar for conversion. I guess if you can solve random puzzles that have no interconnection or deeper meaning, you're okay enough for them, I guess?\n\nWorst part is that if there's room for multiple endings, and I just got a bad one, two puzzles are so full of tedium, the lazy maze I could have coded in my sleep, and the one involving rotating 3D objects to form a 2D puzzle, which are slow, and imprecise, I'm not even interested in going back to the beginning to try something new, which I doubt exists, as the game is very linear. Even found a bug when I hit "continue" after beating the game that had me back in the locked room, with buggy access to my inventory, and forced to sit through the unskippable credits again.\n\nSave up your money and maybe try something a bit more groundbreaking, like Layers of Fear or something.","March 20","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The puzzles could sometimes be a bit obtuse which was frustrating, but it was also kind of refreshing when I was finally able to crack a few of them.

The visual ambiance is sufficiently gloomy and mysterious to capture players.\n\nThe sound effects are great. The music score sets the mood perfectly. No complaints at all in that department. Good job team!\n\nMost players reviewing this game got about 3 hours of gameplay. I usually play much slower than my contemporaries, and I managed to squeeze about 4 hours of play. My ghettomath prefers less than a dollar per hour. And that $7 is the sale price. Retail will be around $10. I can't say I would pay that much for this game. It's just too short. Very good quality. But short.\n\nFor my full review, visit my blog at http://ghettogamerblog.wordpress.com","March 13","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are some of the best I’ve played in recent years, and did provide me with a bit of a challenge, but never to the point where I needed to seek out clues or answers. The visuals and audio mixing are very impressive for a small production team and helps add to the creepy nature of the game. The game’s amateurist voice over and the storyline does nothing to improve the experience and ends up harming the game in the long run. I would recommend this to any fan of noodle-scratchers, but you may want to wait for a sale.","March 14","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/recommended/402040/","left4dinner2","Law Abiding Engineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/","144 products in account","Frustrating yet satisfying puzzle game.   I usually write lengthy reviews but I think a shorter one will suffice.\n\n\nThe Guest is a puzzle game in which you are stuck in this room and in escence have to find a way out.   Along the way, there are plenty of puzzles that will require you to either use outside items or use logical thinking.   The range of difficulty is from fairly easy, to fairly difficult.  Nothing is impossible, and there are plenty of red herrings, but as long as you remember the very basic clues that are given, then you should do well.  There are plenty of things to grab that you will NOT use, so that can be tricky, and some of the challenges in the later part of the game, can take quite a bit of thinking.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that I should bring up, is whether this is a horror game or walking simulator.   In short, it is neither.   It is not a horror game becauase outside of the early on 'bathroom scene', there are no scary parts to it.  Creepy?  yes very much, but once you restore power to the room and turn on the lights, then things seem less scary.   As for walking simulator, there is not that much walking outisde of one section in which you might find yourself walking a LOT more than you would like. Outside of that, there just isn't much walking needed.\n\n\n\nVisually the game is a stanard Unity type of game so its nice pretty 3d visuals that run very smoothly.   Voice acting is minimal and even then its not that bad I suppose.   Music is minimal.   There are a few odd bugs though.  I got trapped on one puzzle and couldn't exit out of the puzzle, and another time, I had the control key display, stick to my screen and would not remove itself until I reloaded the game.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is a good 3 hour or so puzzle game that is well worth it IF you do NOT cheat or use outside sources.  As it stands, there is only one person I think who has finished it but he takes quite a while to do.  Everything in the game, is possible to do if you read the clues, use simple logic, and semi-complex logic.    My only gripe aside from the few bugs, is that the ending is, nice but cliche although maybe it could lead into a sequel (although doubtful).   Still, its a good game for a good price and there should be more games like this.","March 12","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fair graphics, good atmosphere and sound. I'd recommend it in the first place...\n\nCONs\n...then there come the bugs.\nI purchased the game in March but had to put on hold due to the many problems I got at the first two runs. My only hope was a patch. And it arrived in late April. But despite the patch the bugs are still there.\n\nMajor issues:\n- The game starts with a blank screen and a solid cursor. (Not moving.) ALT+TAB and other tricks aren't helping. The only thing I can do is CTRL+ALT+DEL then select e.g. Task manager from this Windows menu. So I get back to the desktop. Now if I switch back to the game, turns out that it is running. I can play.\n- Same for exit. Blank screen with a cursor. CTRL+ALT+DEL, Task manager and I have to end the process.\n- The game is unresolvable for me. I had to look up a complete walktrough gameplay video and turns out there are things missing on my machine: the "congratulations" sound recording. (It is silent for me.) The red lights on the ceiling.\n\nMinor issues:\n- For example: I can reach the "This dosen't seem to be..." note without opening the drawer.\n- The game freezes for long seconds sometimes, which kills the mood.\n- No save game slots. Combining one game slot (progress) with achievements that require advance in-game knowledge is a bad thing. Do you think I will re-play the whole game just to achieve a badge? No way. (Sorry if there are multiple save slots. It is not working for me as it falls under the first major issue.)\n\nAltogether, by my heart I'd recommend this game to the adventure/puzzle/exploration lover community, but there are many similar out there with much better game experience. This sack of bugs is too expensive for 8 EUR (2,5 would be a fair price).\n","May 28","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
