The AI is pretty terrible.  On the Bull Run scenario the entire Union army tried to cross a single bridge and one regiment killed 20,000 men, I lost 400. The battle ended in a draw because I did not have a unit sititng on the victoy point that was way behind my lines.  The over emphasis on victory point over casualties inflicted make it a game of chase the flag rather than fighting the enemy.  The artillery mechanics need a lot of work.  The game had potential but falls flat on its face.  The campaign is less a campaign and more a string of skirmish scenarios that have no correlation to each other.  Nothing is carried on as far as I can tell from battle to battle.  They simply progress linearly.","July 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 201 of 261 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","201","261","0","5"

That game was strategic and used rectangular counters, similar to the ones in this game, to depict forces.  The game that I played almost 35 or so years ago may have, in fact,  been made by Avalon Hill.\n\nI purchased the Battleplan ACW game after playing the demo.  I was glad that the developer had released a demo as I always like to try before I buy.  The demo proved a couple of things to me: first, to see if it ran under Windows 7-64bit, and second, to see if I like the way the game played since I read a lot of goods & bads on the forums.  So far, I like the game.  I also saw that the developer had released a patch today so players could slow the game down if you wanted to.\n\nIt is a strategic wargame so you should be commanding large units (battalion/regiment & above) and not a tactical game where you command squads, platoons, and companies.  I went through the tutorials and found them to be sufficient to learn the mechanics of the game. Overall, you can't beat the price.","July 11, 2014","true","1.1"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

The graphics are kind of bare bones, which is fine with me, and the interface is very simple and easy to use. But it is damn near impossible to consistantly get units to do what you want them to do. (This is as of 1.3).\n\nThe major problem with this game is getting units to move is an uncertain affair. There is a kind of cool mechanic where sometimes your orders don't get through, simulating the communication difficulties of the second world war. I can go with that. What I can't go with is when you give an order, it get's accepted, and the unit doesn't move. Even after you repeat the order. Again. And again. And again. And again. Units will just randomly "stick" in spots and will be essentially worthless for the rest of the battle.\n\nWorse are river crossings. I played Chancellorsville as the Union. Most of my force started across the river. There are several bridges. I must have re-issued my orders three dozen times before I got them across. Meanwhile, the few who stragged over the bridge got savaged one by one, because no one followed them. Most of the game can be more or less played and even enjoyed if you really try, but on a battle like that where you have to cross a river... forget about it. Don’t bother.\n\nBeyond that, the game really doesn’t do a good job at communicating what is going on. The units are represented with boxy little symbols, which is fine with me, but half the time, I can’t even tell who’s firing. Sometimes, my units just suddenly die. No warning, just poof. Sometimes it’s because there is a hidden enemy, but sometimes, they will just randomly panic and flee, even if not under fire.\nThe sad part is there is a really fun game hiding under here. This is one of those games that I want badly to recommend, but cant. I love the design idea, love the genre, love supporting indies, but the game just doesn’t play right. Unless you are willing to put up with some major frustration and love Civil War RTS, I’d pass.","December 11, 2014","false","6.7"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","1"

Battleplan keeps its promise adding depth and realism while keeping a managable fast paced tempo. The formations in Battleplan have their own character, something I see sorely missing in Ultimate General. For example, Leaders are sorted as either agressive, steady, or cautious folk. An agressive subordinate will be instrumental in conducting an assualt where as a cautious one might delay or flat out refuse the order. In addition, it also features a decent take on command and control amongst other features here and there.  For example, choosing where you move your HQ isn't only about the bonuses it applies to troops. The effects of longer or shorter distances from HQ to ordered unit affects the uptake of said orders. All in all Battleplan ACW is a meaty pocket sized wargame that trades graphics for depth of gameplay. I think it's a fine game for strategy game fans but may be too easy for hardened wargamers.    Check out this Let's Play for gameplay and more information.","July 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 49 of 81 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","49","81","0","0"

Bradley","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030849172/","285 products in account","Battleplan: American Civil War could get by with its minimalistic graphics if, upon closer inspection, it had some real depth in the gameplay by the way of ultra historically correct maps and commander and unit details. It doesn't have any of these elements, and so I'll go ahead with the only two positives I can think of:\n\n1) One interesting function that this game has, that I wish others did, is that all commands issued by the General must be received by a messenger. If the messenger dies, the message is not received and the unit you're attempting to move stays where it is. Sometimes unit commanders will refuse a command -- no reason is ever given, but both of these elements add some character and unpredictability.\n\n2) The Steam wallpapers are pretty cool. Yep.\n\nThe flaws are manifold, but I will go for the chief hang ups that I have with this game: it rarely works, and it has zero support. I have an ASUS G73jh that cannot run this game, and yet a low-end Dell at work, that barely runs Minesweeper, can somehow get the game running. Take a few minutes in the forum and you'll see that it is a crapshoot if this game will run for you -- and the only pseudo-representative of the company can do nothing but forward e-mails after asking you to jump through diagnostic hoops. As Steam customers, I believe we deserve a little more.\n\nStay away from this title.\n\n","June 20, 2015","false","8.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

It is a time in the political history of our country, not unlike the ideological gridlock of our society today. This game attempts to be a top-down, strategic gameboard-type game where you can select and direct individual units to capture objectives, outflank the enemy and win the war. It uses historical information to show you the win/lost statistics compared to your own actions, but doesn't offer much in the way of substance. I would not recommend this game if you are interested in a great strategic battle, as it is very simplistic.","May 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

Playing out the great battles of the civil is kind of fun when you stick to the tactics that were actually used. The AI has a number of battleplans that they use against you in any given battle, and while that is where the depth ends, it is still enough for replayability. It is a very easy game to learn without taking much time to figure out the controls and it has a great tutorial. I really like the messenger system to give out orders, so it make you have to move around your commanding general in order for the messengers to not be intercepted by the enemy's formations.\n\nThere are some problems:\n\n-AI pathing, units walking into the rivers and drowning, or just getting stuck on the riverback, unable to move, when selecting multiple units, they take the route of the unit being dragged around, not taking into account obstacles.\n\n-the aforementioned lack of the AI's ability to adjust to your strategy (which as the battle unfoldes, you adjust your men to theirs, but they seem to lack the ability to adjust to yours). this make the computer very easy to beat after only a few playthroughs of each battle. Once you recognize the AI's battleplan you can adjust your men accordingly, because they won't stray from their strategy\n\n-Artillery is still a bit clunky and unresponsive and needs a bit of work still\n\n-lack of multiplayer. While this game is fun to play, how much more fun would it be to play with a friend? I don't really see how hard it could be to implement something like that.\n\n-This game is centered on three capture zones rather than defeated and routing the enemy. So all you really have to do is to hold two zones no matter what and wait for the time to run out. Makes the game kind of dull and fairly easy to beat.\n\nOverall, i would recommend this game as it is fun and not too hard to learn. But it does require an update for two to make it a real gem. Right now it's a diamond in the rough, just needs a bit of polishing.\n\n===if you've made it this far, thanks for reading, and I hope this has helped you make your decision===","July 12, 2014","true","3.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

But then I lost the 1st Battle of Bullrun because i pulled a unit off a victory point at the last second to chase another unit away. The game has a lot of potential but in it's current state is pretty terrible. I attacked one unit of union militia with four units of confederate veterans and they were all routed after they lost literally ten guys. Instead of militia retreating, they literally fight to the death. But the biggest problem is probably units completely dying without getting shot. I attacked some artillery with 800 veterans and the entire unit died instantly. Nothing shot at them. They just died. So yeah this game is pretty crappy.

(militia and regular)\n- nice ui\n- nice movement system. You just draw a line mith a mouse and  units follow it\n- fast battles (win or lose in 5-10 mins for each battle). It can also be a cons.\n- civil var flavour  with historical units\n- terrain bonuses\n- some small things like adjutants who carry general's orders (they may become lost/intercepted and the orders get lost with them), hidden personalities of unit commanders - cautious may ignore some of your orders, agressive may charge needlessly into action, etc.\n- basic logistics (artillery runs of ammo and must be resupplied by a wagon train)\n- decent AI.\nCons:\n- absolutely no graphics to speak of. Units are represented by rectangles composed of little squares. If such squares are in disarray you unit ir broken/routed/not in good order. See screens above and that's the battle  in its entirety. Environment consists of a few copipasted houses/trees\n- battle can run on one speed only or be paused. Maybe you can change it but I didn't find out how\n- no tactical formations. Column or two rows. Fullstop\n- engagements between units are affected by terrain, morale (milita, regular, vets), number of men and flanking mostly. Units have other stats. like fatigue but since battles are so short it's usually on maximum. Weather/wind direction are also there but mostly irrelevant. Night affects visibility for engaging, however, and you can see campfires where units are postioned (including enemy units)\n- dumb building ui. Bridges/covers are hard to place and cannot be cancelled. I once lost a battle because I misclicked, all nearby units started building something and noone was left in control of my victory points\n- about 20 battles for each campaign (I found it really short at the pace the game was running)\n- units have no independent thinking beyond personalities of their cammanders. If a neighbour is attacked  a few meters away most prefer to stay where they are and enjoy the show.\n- some simple but annoying bugs. The ones I encountered during almost 6 hours:\nunits get stuck. Usually in rivers. I had to fight without artillery entirely because my wagon train got stuck\nunits have trouble crossing bridges. Some can cross only after second/third attempt.\nif you want to get some regular/vet achivements (regular Bull Run, etc.) set to zero your campaign of a previous difficulty level. I.e. I beat the Confederate campaign on regular + vet. for some battles, but because I also had Confederate militia campaign started earlier I got only militia achievements.\n\nVerdict: worth playing if costs less than 3 $ and you really like US civil war. Want something more complicated and/or with graphics try Civil war Mod for Medieval TW.","September 14, 2014","true","6.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

First off, the holding of points to decided victory is irritating, but manageable. What makes it annoying is that the bot can control 2 points and it will win, while when you do it calls it a draw. This also becomes even more annoying when units that have never been in battle and sometimes actually starting on the point suddenly run off.  Units also get stuck especially on peninsulas, I had a whole army get trapped on one in one mission, keep in mind there were no enemies nearby.\nIn a list format the issues are:\nUnits get stuck\nUnits break for no reason, i.e. not in battle nor any enemies nearby.\nFor you to win you have to have all 3 victory points, for the enemy to win, they only have to have 2\n","May 3, 2015","false","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Overall the game could improve small things. The biggest problem with the game is the user interface during battles. All the units are boxes. Which would be fine if there would be a clearer difference between different kind of units. There is a lack of feedback from units what they are doing and why. There also some annoying bugs like one that makes it hard to deselect artillery units. The game lacks in execution, but has a lot of potential.","February 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But Battleplan is a very casual version compared to Ultimate General: Gettysburg. I think both are fun, but I personally enjoy Ultimate General: Gettysburg(got this on copy/paste) more since it's more realistic.\n\nBasically, you can play as either Union or Confederates. You have Infantry, Artillery, a General, Supply Wagons for Artillery, and Calvary that are represented by various sized squares. You order a unit by dragging a path for them to follow, and they automatically engage. When you issue an order, a messenger runs from your General to the unit you ordered. When the messenger arrives, then the unit begins it. But depending on the Unit Leaders personality(Cautious, Steady, Aggressive), they may either delay doing the order, or even ignore it altogether.\n\nThere are 11 battles altogether.\n\nI recommend the game if it's on sale.","April 15","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
