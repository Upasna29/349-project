"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erincl/recommended/730/","Erincl",".Erin.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erincl/","55 products in account","Counter Strike: Global Offensive\n\nCounterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it.\n\nEveryone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO:\n\n1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'\n2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game.\n3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'\n\nWithin a month -\nWithin a week -\n\n1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because "Oh, It's only 30p" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back.\n2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity.\n3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.\n\nThe community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself.\n\nBut of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.\nEDIT: HA.

It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.\n\nYou will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.\n\nWhenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.\n\nYou will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.\n\nYou now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO.

Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review.\n\n> spends 1 hour writing this\n> nobody reads\n> :c\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFirst things first, the basic rules.\n\nIn CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:\n\n-Arms Race\n-Deathmatch\n-Demolition\n-Casual\n-Competitive\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSummary of gamemodes:\n\nIn Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nDeathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a "warm-up" or "practice" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSo next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded.\n\nBut this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:\n\n2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade\n3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades\n\nGet the pattern? Yeah.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nWhat next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual.\n\nCasual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.\n\nThe terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer.\nWhen defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.\n\nCounter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.\nFor the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.\n\nSo in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFinally, competitive.\n\nThe competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:\n\n- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.\n- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.\n- It's a 5v5.\n- Competitive has 30 rounds.\n- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.\n- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.\n- People are much more serious.\n- ♥♥♥♥ blyat\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSo, here is my thoughts.\n\nCS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.\n\nGO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game.\nIt's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nI've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters.\n\nI hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console.\n\nThe competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to ♥♥♥♥. Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.\n\nThere are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.\n\nThe most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, "no game is perfect", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.\n\nNot permanent bans, though.\n\nThe VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nSo that's my review. Hoped you like it!\n\nEDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO\n\nAbout the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, "omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?\n\nIn Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the "left shoulder advantage".\n| http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective:\n| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.\n\nAs I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.\n\nFinal conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!\n\nBTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.\nThanks valve!\n\nTL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10 ♥♥♥♥ blyat\n-================================================-","April 1, 2015","true","921.6"," 3,518 of 4,015 people (88%) found this review helpful 1,016 people found this review funny","88","518","4","016","78"

After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.\n\nThe next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done.\nWith my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.\n\nI regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teflon1/recommended/730/","teflon1","DUNCAN DONUTS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teflon1/","495 products in account","In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.\n\nWhen your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.\n\nThe Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.\n\nMaps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.\n\nIn some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.\n\nOverall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.","June 6, 2014","true","19.7"," 3,256 of 3,759 people (87%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","87","256","3","56","66"

Damn.\nAnother night of Insomnia.\n\nI sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.\n\nI press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind.\n\nMy desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.\n\nI click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.\n\nSteam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.\n\nMy list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.\n\nAh, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.\n\nThe game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.\n\n_\n\n\nAh, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.\n\nWell, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.\n\nWell, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.\n\nI get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.\n\nI lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.\n\nThe last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.\n\nMy quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.\n\nI move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.\n\nI pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.\n\nAnother Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.\n\nA third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.\n\nSecond round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.\n\n_\n\n\nTurns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥" in all chat.\n\nChildish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite"\n\nUsing the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.\n\nFrom far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.\n\nThe scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.\n\nFinal round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.\n\nSurprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.\n\nHalftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.\n\nPistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.\n\nI pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.\n\nI slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.\nAnother night of Insomnia.","December 31, 2013","true","817.4"," 2,361 of 2,723 people (87%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","87","361","2","38","144"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/recommended/730/","3kliksphilip","3kliksphilip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/","182 products in account","CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.\n\nIn short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.\n\nThe game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.\n\nIs it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.\n\nThere are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.","November 25, 2013","true","333.2"," 4,367 of 5,231 people (83%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","83","367","5","27","103"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bananagaming/recommended/730/","bananagaming","MAXIM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bananagaming/","104 products in account","Counter-Strike is one of the most popular franchises of our gaming culture and is probably the most famous team-based multiplayer shooter of all-time. The first version came out 1999 which means it's been out for quite some time and it's still growing t'ill this day. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the game series and also the most successful one so far. I believe that there are three reasons for it's main success. The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the gameplay even more. The third reason is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. The game gets regularly updates which usually feature new items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. You will have lots of fun and tense moments both casually and competitively and I highly recommend playing this game.","February 22","true","835.1"," 404 of 467 people (87%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","87","404","467","66","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathdisturbance/recommended/730/","deathdisturbance","DeatHD#2932","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathdisturbance/","202 products in account","Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.\n\n\nSadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.\n\nThe CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game.\nhttp://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg\nMany people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.\n\nRecently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.\n\nI would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0\nAnyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!\n\nHope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.\n\nI would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it?","November 25, 2013","true","763.0"," 1,645 of 2,137 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","645","2","0","37"

"I must get to my family!" said the father chicken.  Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge.  As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right.  He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next.  There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow.  He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace.  "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond."  AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there.  As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana.  "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken.  He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family.  They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov.  "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-."  A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nnzh/recommended/730/","nnzh","Voodoolala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nnzh/","84 products in account","I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.\n\nSecondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?\n\nCS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.\n\nIf you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.\n\nUntil Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)\n\nEDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.\n\nThough I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.\n\nAt first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches.\n\n@Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.\n\nCheers fellow comrades.","January 14, 2015","false","438.3"," 1,642 of 2,139 people (77%) found this review helpful 114 people found this review funny","77","642","2","114","109"

Set aside.\nPrepare the pans: Rub the bottoms and sides of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Flour the sides and bottoms of the pan by scooping a bit of flour into the pan, then shaking and tapping to coat the bottom and sides of the pan with flour; dump out the excess. Alternatively, cut out a parchment round and use this to line the bottom.\nBeat the butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Cream together for about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread (see above notes for more information).\nAdd the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth and creamy-looking. Adding the eggs one at a time gives them a better chance at incorporating into a smooth batter. Be sure they are room temperature so the batter does not appear curdled.\nBeat in half the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sifted dry ingredients with the mixer running at low speed. Continue to mix until incorporated.\nBeat in the milk and vanilla. Alternate adding in the liquids with the dry ingredients so the milk has a chance to be absorbed without needing to overmix the batter. Stream in the milk with the mixer on low until combined.\nBeat in the remaining flour mixture until just combined and no more visible flour remains. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.\nDivide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean.\nCool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan.\nFlip the rounds out of the pan, remove the parchment lining, and flip right-side up to cool completely.\nOnce cool, frost and assemble the cake with the buttercream.\n\noh, the game is fine.","May 3","true","263.5"," 919 of 1,200 people (77%) found this review helpful 811 people found this review funny","77","919","1","811","57"

I'm perfectly fine with this, jezz guys, I've spent more then 900 hours in game.","August 12, 2015","false","296.1"," 327 of 411 people (80%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","80","327","411","50","30"

I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'\n2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game.\n3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'\n\nWithin a week -\n\n1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because "Oh, It's only 30p" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back.\n2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting. Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity.\n3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.\n\nThe community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself.\n\nBut of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.","January 2","false","744.3"," 1,057 of 1,406 people (75%) found this review helpful 686 people found this review funny","75","057","1","686","85"

But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor.\n128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.\n\n-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game.\n\n-Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?\n\n-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)\n\n-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around.\n\nIf you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.\n\nI manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.\n\nThe first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly.\n\nAll in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.\n\nBut you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned.","October 10, 2015","false","430.0"," 386 of 496 people (78%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","78","386","496","39","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crudermax/recommended/730/","crudermax","Peppy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crudermax/","118 products in account","In Cancer Strike: Global Duty, you play as the sunflower from Plants vs Zombies. Your goal is simple, defend your team's nexus from the opposing forces known as "anonymous".\n\nThere are three different weapons in this game, two of which are useless. The first is a gravity gun, stolen from the Half Life series (looks like these guys are going to get sued.) The second is a bag of pretzels, which restores health, but can damge enemies if thrown, and if the salt gets in their eyes. The third, and only useful weapon, is the PP-Bizon. This gun is overpowered in my opinion, and needs to get nerfed quickly, as it has 64 shots per clip, and more bullets means more damage.\n\nI'm currently Challenger in the ranking system, which was far too easy to get, seeing as I previously played skilled shooters such as Putt Putt Saves the Zoo. However, this being said, if you choose to embark on your journey to Master Chief rank, be warned. You will face countless cheaters who will spawn infinite money so that the enemy team can buy all of the different hats available. In my opinion, Volvo should remove the hats, and replace them with weapon skins. But who am I kidding, who would be stupid enough to buy those?\n\nIf you're coming here from other shooters such as call of men, you're going to have a bad time. The closest game to this, in my opinion, would have to be Everquest. If you've ever played this, you should be alright coming into an environment such as this one, except with worse hit registering.\n\nOverall, I'd rate Counter Salt: League Legend, an 8.1/10. No matter how bad this game actually is, people will still spend way too much money on stupid ♥♥♥ skins, and yell at their teamates for not checking connector.\n\nVideo version of this review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIkwl9f9X58\n(Please watch to support me! ^^)","April 22","true","548.3"," 251 of 317 people (79%) found this review helpful 338 people found this review funny","79","251","317","338","15"

In deathmatch you are          able to learn how to use the weapons and how to improve your aim. That is why there is a possibility to turn of random weapons to you can choose only 1. PLEASE if you have 100- hours play deathmatch. (Dont use SCAR-20 to mutch.. people will hate you!)\n\nDemolition\nIn this game you have to kill people to get new weapons. Here you will learn how to plant a bomb. and how to use maps. you will learn you have to look back and look everywhere so you wont be killed. Also it is a good way to use multiple weapons. Not like deathmatch 1 weapon youre good with.\n\nArms Race\nThis game is hard. You need to kill as mutch people as you can. There are 16 levels. every level is a new weapon. kill 2 people to go level up. the first one who is at level 16 gets a knife. If he kills someone with the knife he wins. the maps are small and there are a lot of people. here you learn how to use every weapon (every weapon shoots different) (this will help you in Casual and more important  Competitive.)\n\nCasual\nThis looks like  Competitive. You have team mates and you have to win. sometimes its 5 vs 5 6 vs 6 8 vs 8 10 vs 10.  They maked Casual easier. Them damage is turned of. and you wont get a Cooldown. If you want to play this: in the beginning this will be hard. and you wont get mutch kills. if you play more it will get better.\nYou choose 1 side and you will stay the whole game that side\n\nCompetitive\nThis mode is for players with atleast 300+ hours ( I Thinks.. and a lot of players think that 2). Everybody plays this serious. Cause here you play for ranks. team damage is turned on. Its the same as casual. Kill enemy and plant the bomb. 15 round as Counter-Strike and 15 rounds As terrorist. the team who wins 16 rounds wins the game.\n\nWhat I also like about this game is the face that everyday over 100000 people are playing. Every mode are people. you meet every day new people and sometimes new friends.\n\nevery week you get 3 drops. ( most of the time 2 cases and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon worth 3 cents. sometimes a weapon with is worth more).  if you recieved the 3 drops you have to wait till monday then they will reset it. ( drops are random)\nAlso there are cases you can open. this is addicted like hell. In a case there are weapons skins. some are worth nothing others are worth 50+ euro.. if you are very lucky 100 euro/dollar or MORE!\n\nEVERY ONE WANTS A KNIFE skin.\n\nweapon skins are useable in game. you can buy them are you can open cases. ( if you dont have mutch money buy the weapons.. not the cases ;) ).\n\nlast thing. Operations and championsships.\n\never couple months there will be an operation. that means. you have to pay 5 euro/dollar. and you get:\n5 New maps. Lots of Missions. New weapon skins. That is cool cause this will make sure the game will stay fun.\n\nAlso every couple months there are contest between the best players of csgo. you can watch them live! thats cool!\n\nI give this game a 10 out of 10.","December 20, 2014","true","611.4"," 91 of 96 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","91","96","10","3"

(12+ yrs)\nIt's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update\nand break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)\n\nAdding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)\nI know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.\n\nThey will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !\n\nDM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.\nAfter one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.\nRandom lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.\nCould it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone\nother then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).\nLegit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people\nhence people having so many accounts.\n\nI have 1 account and proud of it.\n\nI know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......\n\nBy the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    " I'll just save it".\n\nIf your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.\nIf you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....\n\n\nIf you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.\nIf you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.\n\n\n(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!\n\n\nFor all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.\nI've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.\nIf it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.\nAnd yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......\nAs soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!\n\n"I never leave a friend or a man behind" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)\n\n\nAfter reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.\n\nIf this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system "Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money"  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !\nThis game would be great........\nThere is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old.\nBut 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman.

It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.\n\nThe game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.\n\nGlobal offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created\n\nYou will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.\n\nThis game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.","November 25, 2013","true","283.0"," 1,075 of 1,470 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","075","1","2","6"

The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.\n\nBoosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience.\n\nSkin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME "GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...\n\nBOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.\n\nCommon idiots. Actually press f1.\n\nI WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.\n\nTryhards. Goes without any words :>\n\nTeam players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.\n\nThe community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say "go away" instead.\n\nUltimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words "omg what an aim noob" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.\n\nSmurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.\n\nRussians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question "Русские есть?". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it.\n\nThank you for your attention.\nNow you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is.","September 16, 2015","false","535.9"," 506 of 688 people (74%) found this review helpful 118 people found this review funny","74","506","688","118","138"

If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova.\n3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players)\n4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.\n\nCons\n1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters.\n2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience.\n3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull.\n4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face.\n5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points.\n6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing.\n\nIn conclusion this Game is Fantastic with its revolutionary graphics, sweet jumpers for some terrorist and a real look into counter terrorism operations.","February 29","true","621.9"," 93 of 103 people (90%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","90","93","103","88","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ack4orge/recommended/730/","Ack4orge","Ack4orge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ack4orge/","180 products in account","Date of Review: 9/27/2014\nCSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics\n\nThe Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.\n(+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.\n(+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.\n(+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.\n(+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that       are fun and interesting.\n(+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.\n\nThe Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.\n(-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.)\n(-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit.

This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.","March 15, 2014","true","339.0"," 146 of 180 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","146","180","0","7"

Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? "Oh im just smurfing.." You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being "smurfing" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us.

The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.\n\nThe next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory.

Cheating:\nThere are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!\n\n2. DDOS-ing:\nI think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!\n\n3. Smurfing:\nThrough all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!\n\n4. Patches:\nPatch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!\n\n5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):\nSteam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!\n\n6. Community:\nThe community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.\n\n\nOver all:\nCounter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!\n\n\nPS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!","April 7, 2015","false","179.9"," 717 of 1,020 people (70%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","70","717","1","77","72"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/730/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.\n\nJust like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.\n\nWith every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.\n\nI also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.\n\nThe original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.\n\nI've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.\n\nAnd yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.\n\nBut my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.\n\nAll in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.","October 16, 2014","true","401.1"," 106 of 129 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","106","129","4","0"

Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:\n\n- It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. "Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake."\n- It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores.\n- It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. "Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle."\n- It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong.\n- It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.\n\nOf course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.","February 3","true","604.4"," 78 of 89 people (88%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","88","78","89","22","8"

How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch.\n6. How to be disappointed in human beings.\n7.

It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.","January 15, 2015","true","702.6"," 75 of 87 people (86%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","86","75","87","74","7"

The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n\nCompetetive:\n\nI used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.\n\n\nElo system:\n\nDon't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global!\n\n\nSkins:\n\nA unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game.\n\n\nNow if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?\n\nOh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.","December 18, 2015","false","610.3"," 143 of 189 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","143","189","19","43"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/730/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account","The "third" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.\n\nI was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.\n\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.\n\nBeside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic "Gun Game" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic "plant the bomb"-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.\n\nJust like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.\n\nPick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first.","August 24, 2013","true","393.8"," 281 of 396 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","281","396","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/730/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any fun out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.\n\nSimply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and "balanced matchmaking" so that you always get a "fair game regardless of your skills", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.\n\n9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility.\n\nAnother annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't hormonal teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and or homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be hard if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire, I guarantee you'll be using the "Block Communication" feature a lot.\nI know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time, remember that.\n\nSo until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a "Mixed" option cause it really does pain me to click "No". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor.\nIf one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.\n\nBy the way, to be genuinely good at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you must own at least one  expensive weapon skin, or better yet, a $300 virtual knife. They seem to be the major factor in judging ones skills these days(!).\n\nThe short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community.","January 17, 2015","false","286.1"," 355 of 507 people (70%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","70","355","507","29","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IffyTohsaka/recommended/730/","IffyTohsaka","IF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IffyTohsaka/","149 products in account","An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another "casual" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?\n\nUnfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called "smurfs". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.\n\nOf course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.\n\nThe soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.\n\nThe graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.\n\nThe loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.\n\nOverall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.\n\n69/420","April 11, 2015","false","162.2"," 102 of 134 people (76%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","76","102","134","62","3"

Also, every single game I join I get called ♥♥♥♥ for how I sound, and god forbid that you actually want to have fun.

Unless you find a server with a well-adjusted group of admin, be ready to be critiqued regularly, insulted for every kill, and harassed if you even think about just playing to have fun instead of to win. Don't use the weapon of someone else's choice? Then you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. If you're as lucky as I've been, and find comrades who just want to play without trash talk and accusations of cheating at the slightest hint of success, you can actually eke out some enjoyment from the game. Most public servers are pure-grade garbage though. Sadly, trying to complete one of the new missions they've implemented means sometimes having to tolerate listening to non-stop tantrums by some twelve year old whose voice hasn't even cracked yet.\n\nAnd every time you decide you've had enough, Valve releases another patch with new gun skins because that's what draws people back in, and you realize that you can actually make money by just playing the game and selling the ♥♥♥♥ you receive for free just for playing.

The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains. As I said we thought back when the game was new that all this would be polished out, it was not.\n\nDid I say horribly broken hitboxes?\n\nhttp://youtu.be/TQmrajx7Xrs\n\nhttp://youtu.be/H1lblTOV1mg\n\nhttp://youtu.be/cAxaaGXtmcE\n\n\nThey haven't even had a real bug patch in over a year, you'd think you were playing a 10 year old game by the support it gets, not a 2 year old game that gets 5 million unique players a month and valve's "don't call us, we'll call you" policy only makes it feel worse.\n\n\n\n\nDid I mention the game is full of cheaters even up to the highest level of play?\n\nKill me.","January 23, 2015","false","559.0"," 112 of 151 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","112","151","9","6"

Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.\n\nCompetitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.\n\nAlways be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!\n\nTrading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD.\n\nCS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new "definitive multiplayer FPS"!\n\n9/10","November 23, 2014","true","000.3"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","75","94","3","8"

I shall divide it up in those categories and leave any other subjects to the end.\nAlso fair wanring; english is not my first language, spelling errors are expected.\n\nSmurfs:\nEnjoy sitting trough a 30-40 minutes of getting pwnd'ed. Theese guys just figured that its getting to tough and serious playing their own rank and want a relaxing game. the end result is that you will have a not so fun game where a smurf, or even a team of smurf is gonna basically show your head down the toilet. You can expect the same acompaniying trashtalk.\n\nHackers:\nWell, more or less the same as the smurfs, but any element of fun is gone from the game. depending on what level of hacking its all the more infureating. Spinbotters are ok, they will at least make the game very quick.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s:\nTheese come in many forms, but usually its the one teamate on your team who thinks he is kennyS and will not shut up so you can try to listen to footsteps, but totally knows without info that they are somewhere else and that you suck. also in this category ate the  two subjects mentioned above and dj's, trolls and the one russian souting GIVE ME AWP and stalks/blocks/shoots you untill he has the desired weapon, and then dies because he hasnt paid any attention.\n\nKids To Young to Legally Own the Game:\nTheese are just cute to listen to, but share many of the traits of the A-hole subject. They will not shut up, altho they will try their hardest to actually play the game. Tho they have a tendency to scream off your eardrums, ragequit and start to ♥♥♥♥♥alk you, your teammates and the others, but its very entertaining concidering how old they are. Bring popcorn.\n\nOther subjects, well, if you are superlucky you might get a fun challening game with people of equal skill. these games will test your reaction and teamwork. what can I say, theese games are just awesome and if you are playing with friends its sooo satesfying. All the different ways to take a bombsite or to get to a hostage, or defend it as the case may be will always be changing. Best to play with a full team of friends.\n\nCsgo takes alot of practise, its not a pickupandshoot game. You WILL need to warmup, you will need to learn callouts and the maps and you definitely need to keep a positive attitude.\n\nHowever as csgo is right now, 9/10 games will have a smurf or hacker theese days, and its made csgo horrible to play.To play any rank below LEM is horrible and will hell.\n\nOwerall, dont buy the game unless you enjoy being frustrated; its to late for me but save yourself!!! :O\n\n\nEdit 22/04-16\nA helpful commenter reminded me of Russians. Now I do realize that not all the people we call russians are actual russians, but nowadays its more of a term of "that" kind of players... The ones that do not speak a word of english, and then rages as you for not listening to their helpful callouts... that you dont understand... or hear between their nonstop chatter.\nAt any point between the middle and end of the game, they might try to kick you for some reason.\n\nAlso, to anyone who says "In order to beat the smurf you have to get better" or "its good training" Yeah, ok sure, but its still not fun to loose constantly. Its not training, its demoralizing.","April 19","false","619.5"," 210 of 307 people (68%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","68","210","307","64","46"

For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.\n\nAmong the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.\n\nFinally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.\n\nI've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.","December 13, 2014","true","184.0"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","50","58","10","6"

Using different mechanics to scare your chickens and herd them to different points on the map (Point A and Point B) is the objective of the game, you'll find that it's both fun and challenging to get your chickens there safely. Unfortunately, the multiplayer aspect of this game is full of people who find it fun to disrupt your game. It's almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players, they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens. The game itself is unmoderated and this behavior seems to go unpunished, the makers of the game seem to think this behavior is funny and have indulged the joke by coding the bots to grief in much the same way. Until this very serious problem is addressed I will have to give this a thumbs down.

Most of them lack communication skills as well.\nCompetitive mode is supposed to be a 5v5 team-oriented game but it just feels like a Onemanarmy:walkinglikeaheadlesschicken mode because most of the time people refuse to cooperate as a team.\n\nFor the other modes; I'm not going to cover them, either because they're not relevant for this review (This review is primarily focused on the competitive mode) or because the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mentioned above applies there too.\n\nI only recommend playing competitive mode with friends. You won't get any fun out of it otherwise, unless you get lucky and get grouped with 0,01% of the community that are actually nice and show some respect.\n\nA great game in the shadow of an absolutely horrible community.\nPathetic.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.\n","June 4, 2015","true","269.0"," 80 of 108 people (74%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","74","80","108","83","14"

It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)\n\nSo anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.\n\nBut what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-knife-/recommended/730/","-knife-","knife lft silv+","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-knife-/","72 products in account","So I've been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review. After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below:\n\nThe actual game:\nCS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the "entry-level" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services.\n\nAlso, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing.\n\nTrading/skins:\nTrading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience.\n\nThat's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time.","April 12, 2015","true","489.6"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","49","59","8","11"

You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them.\nWill i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at "master guardian elite" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.\nYou can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for "suka krisa" gameplay.\nWeapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill ♥♥♥♥, because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.\nAnti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to "distinguished master guardian" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!\nAs for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.","May 10, 2014","true","148.5"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","45","53","0","2"

The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their "cool skins" (I guess skin > skill matters more).\n\nI feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the "your mom" 12yr old squeakers, to the maturest people.

Counterstrike is a fun fast strategic shooter that has been around for years. But slowly as the cod and console community moves over to pc they bring there negative and ♥♥♥♥♥y attitudes. I myself is an offender of this. But I have time on my hand to write this review because i was just in a competative match and got a 24 hour ban... We were kicking the other teams ♥♥♥ and the good o'l sqeuakers that were on my team decided to throw the game away at 6-12 us, so for the next 9 rounds my team took an ♥♥♥ pounding. This would've been my rank up game and i would be one step closer to be the best, that no one ever was. "but wait...Two Girls One Awp...you can still rank up if you loose." Well thats the funny thing. These little quickscoping killstreak wanting peices of ♥♥♥♥ wanted to prolong my climb to the top and thought it would be funny to ♥♥♥♥ing kick me. So now im sitting here writing this ♥♥♥♥ing review that no one but my friends will ♥♥♥♥ing see. But, I digress if you like learning to play a game dont buy this game because i swear to you the moment you get in the game some we call you a ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ cunt who is legit ♥♥♥♥ing trash and should kill yourself while butt ♥♥♥♥ing your dad...that is what you experience. If you somehow can get good at this game then maybe you will find a nice group of lads that can work well with you. But you will most likley be called a ♥♥♥♥ sniffing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who should go back to cod because you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game will ruin friendships turn you into a monster. will i still play? ya but not in the next 24 ♥♥♥♥ing hours because the ban system is the most broken thing on the ♥♥♥♥ing planet.  But now you know what the core gameplay is like lets talk about the skins. Oh the skins. Beautiful skins. Marble fade karambit, dragon lore, vulcan, and all the cool knifes. wait. $1000 DOLLARS. are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me i could buy a new graphics card and a prossecer ♥♥♥♥ a new ♥♥♥♥ing car. Yes every good looking skin in this game is made for two types of people youtubers that are so rich they can start a bank and the little kid that steals his mommys purse. Oh and dont even think about trading your skins outside of steam because everyone and their mothers is a scammer. And i have one more thing to say about this game. about 30% of the community is female and thats a lot because 6 million plus people play cs go on a regular bases. But how much of that 30% are not egirls looking to use there body to use you about 10% most girls you will meet on cs go are the ♥♥♥♥♥iest chicks on the planet who join the game and are like "hey guys Im a guuurl" ♥♥♥♥ they may asswell come in and say, "Give me skins because i have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will never see"\n\nSo to some it up better invest in a therepist after this game becasue you will need one\n\n10 outa 10","July 4, 2015","false","243.3"," 99 of 141 people (70%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","70","99","141","26","34"

While its beginnings were bumpy, the developers have listened to the community and are still listening, regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginner/spectator-friendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game. I have high hopes that Counter Strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity.\n\nIf you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents, you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game. It took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that I feel content with (I am currently the second-highest matchmaking rank). Thanks to Global Offensive's ranking system, even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own. Yes, the occasional blips happen where you're put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents, but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds.\n\nWhen you do decide to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself. Research what you can do to train your aim, what you can do to train your recoil control, and watch pro players to learn about game sense. For a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints, it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in.\n\nTL;DR: THE SKILL CAP TO THIS GAME IS RIDICULOUS, IF YOU LIKE COMPETITION YOU SHOULD PICK IT UP!","November 28, 2013","true","922.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","47","57","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KushGaming/recommended/730/","KushGaming","Luna Haruna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KushGaming/","422 products in account","It has been nearly 6 months since my review so I felt it was time to update my review with my current thoughts.\n\nCS:GO is a very good game for its simplicity. The game is your standard FPS, no I'm not saying it’s the same as a free to play first person shooter but I'm talking about its base platform. It's a first person shooter that is strongly built around search and destroy. Though by entering the casual scene you can join servers for zombie, zombie escape and many other custom types of game modes.\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is not your average fps like call of duty, you will have a hard time if you think you can join the game and have accuracy when moving. (FFS P90). Once change you will need to make when switching to CS:GO is to stop when shooting.\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive has a skin system that if you are a gambler then I feel sorry for your wallet. Skins can be earned by playing matches and once the game ends you have a chance at skins (skins from cases will not drop at the end of games, these can only be received via market or cases) cases also drop sometimes after games. If you receive a case you can spend a few dollars to open to it, the case spins as it shows the guns and the line will eventually stop on a gun skin. That is the gun skin you will receive, if you are lucky you will get a knife that can be valued at a very high price depending on the knife. An alternative to cases and free drops is the market which can be access via steam, search Counter-Strike: Global Offensive section to via all gun skins. Gun skins are purely cosmetics and provide no advantages at all.\n\nCounter Strike: Global Offensive has three play styles. Casual, Match Making, eSports. Players looking for fun with friends without dedication to 60-90 minute games or players who like fun modes likes zombie are considered casual players. Match Making is where are "new" player should start if Counter-Strike is a new game to the player. This allows the users to get a general feel of the game, get put into a skill group after 10 games and eventually learn the maps and calls. Match making is the place to start even if you plan to get into eSports eventually. Match making is considered the 64 tick servers which you will hear people cry about a lot but don't worry about it too much. Once you get the basics down you can make your way over to FaceIt, Cevo or ESEA for competitive 124 tick servers and if your good enough jumping into the eSports scene. I don't suggest ESEA for players without experience because ESEA is where a lot of pros and very skilled players go. Once you think you are ready for eSports then form a team with friends or make your way over to cevo forums, reddit ect to form a team and start practicing. This will take time and dedication to prefect but if you have what it takes you'll get there.\n\nLet’s get to the final review shall we? (My numbers are actually very high as posted, I never give 10/10 unless the game is near perfect)\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nCustomizable: 7/10\nCommunity: 6/10\n\nPros:\n- Can customize guns with skins.\n- Offers enough gameplay for any type of fps gamer.\n- In-Game voice chat\n- Has a fairly large eSports scene\n- 64 tick for lower end computers/internet users.\n- 124 tick server for eSports and some casual servers.\n- Large pro scene followers.\n\nCons:\n- Toxic players (This isn't all the time but is often enough to say there are a bunch)\n- Smurfs (Users who are at a higher skill level and buy a second account to play with lower levels) only reason this is a con is because it may be the reason for your deranking in MM (If that matters to you)\n- Hackers (Now this isn't a game with a million hackers but the game goes on sale so often that hacker accounts are bought at cheap in mass bulks)","February 9, 2015","true","605.7"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","40","48","8","10"

The hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place, you need to be rank 3 to play Competitive even if you're a Global Elite or Legendary Eagle Master, meaning you have to play with Silvers for 6 hours if you want to play Competitive, it's especially bad considering you have to buy an Operation Bloodhound pass to get XP faster. They should've just kept it the same as it was in January of 2013 without the flash boosting, the C4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game. I refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes, which has no "ETA" currently but "Valve has acknowledged it" so basically they said "screw you, we're not fixing the hitboxes, thanks for the money."\n\nWhat a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company, I can't believe that they have let the game get to this state, and Valve's support is a joke in general, enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply.\n\nEDIT: I know all the dumb and blinded fanboys are going to dislike this review, but believe me, you will feel this way when you actually look at the technical aspects of this game, and believe it or not, there IS a game beyond betting and skins!

If you are very sensetive person and testy like choleric[en.wikipedia.org] i really don't reccomend this game for you. In this moment yes this game become really worst game in the world. First of all rank system if you care about your rank -> you will care about lose or win( of cource you want to win) -> you will start to rage, insult, rude. Ask yourself please does this game cost your nerves? Does this rank cost your nerves? Just imagine libra in your mind and on one side put all bad things which happend in this game to you all bad days, games, etcetera and all good things which happend to you in this game and you will see the truth. But if you are actually not a raging person and really dont care about your rank or will you win or lose like me :) Grab your friends in there and play for FUN! There are alot of funny stuff...ehm..runboost, bhop, some tricks, lucky shots, knife/zeus trolling, etcetera... you can even just laugh with friends and play! Or if you alone just play on yourself try to make some good kills but remember no rage...\nAnyway i can talk here really alot of time about smurfing, cheaters, guys who  calls everybody a cheater xD, etcetera.\nBut do we need this? I think we dont :P So actually i can't say that i recommend this game for someone this is a good game for someone the worst game ever so this is not me to decide this for you. Everybody already maked his/her choice.\nP.S.: I reached what i wanted and i stop to play this game. Playing really rare only for fun and only with friends.\n\nSome challenges for me:\nReach a Supreme Master First Class rank - done","March 9","false","720.2"," 66 of 93 people (71%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","71","66","93","21","42"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Systride/recommended/730/","Systride","VloCro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Systride/","72 products in account","A Sophisticated CS:GO Review.\nAlright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism.\nI've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better.\nIt went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins).\n\nAnd then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis.\nNow i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the fun out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match.\n\nAnd then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it.\n\nOverwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking.\nMatchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this.\n\nAs this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game anymore.\nIt used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.)\n\nThank you for reading.","January 4","false","951.7"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","35","42","5","5"

If you are a veteran of the old days – CS:GO might disappoint you. It sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made CS 1.6 so damn good. It´s still a very good Counter-Strike, though.It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.Brilliant old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgotten.At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.","April 13, 2014","true","011.9"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","1"

If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!!

Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit "don't know what they are doing" againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a "cooldown time" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called "smurfs." They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smufrs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)\n\n-----Update 1------\nYes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is.\n\nOne part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5.\n\nAs in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?)\nFace it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D\n\nGood luck and (try to) have fun!\n\n----Update 2-----\n\nThanks for all the responses everyone!\n\nThe rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D\n\nI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.\n\nOne other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.\n\nFor instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range.\n\nI keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.\nI just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.\n\nGLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!","January 20, 2015","true","006.2"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","35","43","20","23"

It's a good game but at a terrible cost.\nNo, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games.\nBut truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside.\nMatchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team.\nWhen it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying.\nIf it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank.\nYou are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often).\nIf you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you.\nMaybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust.\nThe better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater.\nWhere is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from losing.","March 7, 2015","false","142.5"," 192 of 308 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","192","308","24","10"

I guess, its time for a very short review.\n\nHeads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.\n\nBut if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level.\n\nIn the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure.\n\nNonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.","December 31, 2015","false","547.5"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","44","59","3","6"

Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.","January 24, 2015","false","532.7"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","46","63","0","2"

Developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game.\nthey still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting.\n\n✓ From the point of technical aspects they succed so far ( at least in my opinion ) , because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there aren't many weapons which are superior to others, in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions. Yes this game is not only about skill, it's more relying on teamwork , which is also an interesting fact about this game, because high skill doesn't mean anything to this game.\n\nCOMPETETIVE OR NOT? :\n✓ For me there are only two sides of this game : Competetive and non competetive\n\n✓ For the non competetive part i can give a recommendation, because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players.\n\n✓ In contrast for the competetive part, unfortunatly  i can't give a recommendation. You sure ask why.\nThe reason is the community itself, it's poisoned with pathetic low self-esteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game, and as if it's not enough they also insult for no reason . they probably do it to strenghten their self-esteem or maybe they need mental help i don't know , somehow or other it's really bad.\nAlmost every match i only read on the chat " look on my main account im *insert here high rank*" . so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then? and making hacks appear so obvious?! i really don't know. And before people come to me and to label me as a low player, my highest rank so far was Supreme master First Class, but i don't care about such stuff, it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they don't have got any balls in real life. that's why it is so pathetic. In addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more. i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress. i wouldn't even care if i would lose all the time, when i could be sure that they aren't hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old  kids.

There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from.\n\n-I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it.\n\n-I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine.\n\n-CS:GO has a workshop with tons of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles. It goes without saying that this adds hours, maybe even days, to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game.\n\nOverall, it's an awesome game and I only wish I had picked it up sooner! If you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the perfect first-person shooter and I recommend it!","January 30, 2015","true","375.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","3"

Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.\n\nGraphics 8/10\nThe graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.\n\nSound and voice acting 10/10\nBeautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the "Terrorists Win" and "Counter-Terrorists Win" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming "♥♥♥♥ BLYET" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!\n\nGame physics 8/10\nComing from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)\n\nCommunity 6/10\nOkay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.\n\nOverall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)\nIt has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

Every skill jump from nuke has been removed. Perfomance has been getting worse and worse with every update, making the game to the point of unplayable on my below average computer, whereas in source i get a constant 180+. EU matchmaking is a hellhole with so many languages shouting at each other, and developers flat out refuse to add servers for language prefrences like in dota 2.\n\ndue to all these things , i have decided to go back to source as it still has a strong community.

Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later.\n\nCS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.\n\nIt's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been.\n\nPros:\n- Updated maps, visuals & sounds\n- Emphasis on team play\n- Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers\n- Extensive customisability & player drops\n- More realistic player and game behaviour\n- CS:GO workshop\n- Pro players\n- Active development and regular updates\n- Listens to community\n- Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution\n\nCons:\n- Gungame isn't the same as CS:S\n- Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater.\n- Sound still seems like an afterthought\n- You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good\n\nRatings:\nGraphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement\nSound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough\nGameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability\nOverall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.\n\nFootnote:\nI lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.\n\nIn the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.","January 21, 2014","true","302.3"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","0"

I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff.

Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good.\nSince the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high.

I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.\n\nI will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialSwaM/recommended/730/","OfficialSwaM","Swammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialSwaM/","35 products in account","Hey. I am going to make a review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive\n\nMy experice - I have played cs for 2k hours + watched/followed the scene for a long time and now some history as well. I hope you learn something and maybe even buy csgo after you've read my review. :)\n\nCounter Strike is an fps game, where the only thing that matters is skill (aim + gamesense + communication). It's the opposite of a "Pay to win" Game. It is true that u can spend how ever much money you want on Skins, but that will not make you as a player better in game.\n\nMM - The matchmaking in csgo is good. You will get matched up with close to equaly skilled player. It is 64 Tick servers something that alot of people complain about, but most other FPS Shooters have 16 or 32 Tick Servers (ex. COD). The biggest problem with MM IMO is Cheaters. As you rank up you will face more and more cheaters. Valve is working on (VAC), as it has been 4 ban waves (A cheat is being detected by VAC making everybody using the cheat VAC Banned) very close together.\n\nSkins - Skins don't add any value to your character (and there is no way to make your character better in any way) so it really doesn't matter if you buy them. It is going to stick out a big more which makes it easier for enemies to spot but that probably won't make that much of a difference in game.\nSo know you think that everything is bad with skins. No. Skins help fund Major CS:GO Tournaments (250:000 dollar tournaments that are Supported by Valve). They are also very fun to play around with, trading and betting with. You can make huge profits and huge losses, but as I said. You don't have to buy them.\n\nThe Pro Scene - The Pro Scene is very entertaining to watch and has IMO the best layout. There are 3 Majors Every year(Most likely going to be more as time progresses). There are also the Normal tournaments every once in a while (1-4 weeks apart usually). The pro scene is growing very fast an we will see a 1 Million Dollar leugue hosted by ESL and ESEA this year.\n\nMISC - There is more to cs than what meets the eye. All the strats, Smokes/flashes/molos etc. But there is also the surfing/bhoping (etc.) side to the game. There are servers where you can do lots of other game modes if you get bored playing the normal game (which you probably won't as it is very addicting).\n\nFinal Thoughts - CS is a great game for a low price which will run on your PC, it's very addicting and fun. There is also frequent sales in the steam store. I hope you Join The CS Community, gl and hf.\n","April 30, 2015","true","212.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","27","33","7","4"

It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.                Graphics and Optimisation        Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!                Additional Content        The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.                Value        This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.\nAspect        Score (/10)                Gameplay        10                Graphics & Optimisation        6                Additional Content        10                Value        10                Pay to win?        No                OVERALL        10\nNotes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!! I don't rate any other game on Steam I have higher, I recommend this for literally anyone!","November 2, 2015","true","107.1"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","27","33","8","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/730/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I'm probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my "low" playtime, but I felt like CS:GO deserved a proper review. Let's hop right into it, shall we?\nOriginally designed as a Half-Life mod more than a decade ago, Counter-Strike has endured because of its well-balanced, competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a revamped version of the classic first-person shooter, offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series. Those unfamiliar with Counter-Strike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run ‘n gun, arcade-style action popularized by recent iterations of Call of Duty.\n\nIn Global Offensive, there is no regenerating health, no cinematic storyline, no experience points to level up your soldier, and no unlockable kits or perks. The deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds. While this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters, Global Offensive' comparatively pared-down experience is no less thrilling. The game's focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counter-terrorist faction.\n\nClassic Casual and Classic Competitive are team-based modes played in multiple rounds. The goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a map-related objective. Depending on the map and your faction, you'll either rescue or defend four hostages, or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites. While the goals in both Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are the same, the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope. A Classic Competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10, enables friendly fire, and has you earning money for kills, planting bombs, and so forth that's used to purchase armor and defuse kits. The casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically.\n\nThe other two modes consist of Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race, which has been adopted by both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Battlefield 3's Close Quarters expansion, consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon. Each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife. The first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round. This is the only mode where respawns are possible, offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes. Demolition is a mash-up of Arms Race and Classic, taking the fixed weapon progression from Arms Race and including two multi-round matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank, safe house, and other locales.\n\nWhat makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition. Tired of jumping assassins in other games? Jumping here will penalize your accuracy. Sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony? Then you'll appreciate that those who use short, controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful. If there is one knock on the game, it's that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series, giving veterans a huge advantage over new players. To offset this, the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map. This will give you a fighting chance against "real" players, but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts.\n\nOr course, the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends. This is where Global Offensive excels, possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a long-term success story. Shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 26, 2014","true","76.8"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","46","66","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volka/recommended/730/","volka","volka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volka/","166 products in account","Basic Gameplay\nYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.\nYou can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.\n\nOn the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.\nAnyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.\n\nAs a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.\nBeing a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.\n\nI'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.\n\nPositive attributes :\n\n- Matchmaking\n- Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)\n- Ranks\n- Cool looking skins\n- Fast growing population of players\n- Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often\n- Chickens\n- High replay value\n- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)\n\nNegative attributes :\n\nAlthough I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work.\nI REALLY wish it were longer..\nAnd that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his "7 year old could beat you, blindfolded."\n\n- The game mode "Infernal" played on the map "de_inferno"\nSome people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.\nIt seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.\n\n- Demolition, Also known as "jokemode" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that "4_chan" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)\nDemolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!\n\n\nThe volka Strategy\n\nYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR\nyou could play the game correctly like me.\n\nHere is my strategy :\n-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.\n\n-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.\n\n- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.\n\n- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].\n\n- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.\n\n- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.\n\n\nIn a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.","September 10, 2014","true","233.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","7"

All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge.

Most people, not even gamers, only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game. It was the obnoxious "Arms Deal" update that struck down CS:GO into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it. Don't believe me? Since micro-transactions were introduced, floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks, I had to reject and block them. Yes, it stopped but the damage was done. Lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to Steam support that they implemented those Steam Market policies that punished everyone who uses the market.\n\nFor the other side that do care about the game to some degree, they're just as bad too. Just about any action you do just leads to an immediate reprimand from other players to the point, why bother even playing online? Then comes to the badly handled competitive system. When I did join, I keep on having idiots on my team or a player who would not stop mic-spamming and was kicked. I had to put up with this for around one hour and nearly all the time, the incompetence from my teammates cost me of a victory. Never again.\n\nAnd now, that "Co-op mode" has bordered CS:GO to a game like Call of Duty and Battlefield. The "Operation Missions" were one of the earliest examples of that. They have failed to regain my interest and trust in the game.\n\nAlso, the community is toxic, more toxic that an irradiated area of Chernobyl. The community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a VAC ban, trade scam, or competitive ban around 90%. The other 10% is usually a giveaway. The community is also hostile to any sort of criticism, calling out anyone who dares to criticize their "holy" game as "silvers", "noobs", etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right. Guess what? I played the game long before the "Arms Deal" update and the community was not like this. It was a decent game and it was much, much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item. As such, you guys most likely make Minh Lee and Jess Cliffe embarassed by forgoing the true spirit of Counter-Strike. Want to prove me wrong? Then don't leave those cliche'd insults in the comments page.\n\nCS:GO should be put out of its misery one day and I suppose until that day comes, I play the older Counter-Strike games that actually gives more respect to gamers (and the modding community, regarding weapon skins and models that had more work put into them).\n\nCan't comprehend with this review? Deal with it. I have lost faith in the Steam forums anyway due to the immature nature of people here.","May 2","false","832.6"," 78 of 123 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","78","123","8","41"

Counter-Strike's unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters. CS:GO carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven. Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay. Additionally, to show appreciation to the community, Valve packages community content into DLC and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene. This game is a must have for the FPS fans.","November 14, 2014","true","550.1"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","28","36","2","5"

I love this game, it's really good, but I'm giving it a thumbs down. Not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is full of russians and 10 year olds, there are countless cheater and smurfers. Oh, you wanted to play a game without constant unbalance, and wallhacking jackasses? Well, you're in the wrong place. The community is toxic, wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake. When you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot, nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥, and you're doomed with your ban. Make ONE small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom, kicked. The smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game, everytime I play with one I'm just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if I'm lucky I get to kill one player per second round or so. When there's a hacker on my team and I insist to kick him, my teammates give two ♥♥♥♥♥ and won't kick him for the sake of winning. When he's on the other team, they trash talk us blabbering about how he's just a good smurf. My ♥♥♥. Also, VAC and overwatch ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I see hackers everyday, and VAC takes it sweet ♥♥♥ time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned, on which they create a new account to continue cheating. Oh, and the game costs absolutely nothing. Don't even let me begin with knives, ♥♥♥♥ing $300 for a knife? I do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously, why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality? And the case unboxing is ridiculous, I cannot count how many Negevs I have gotten from spending $50 on cases. On top of that, the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds. I'm sick of kids saying "fokk yau bish" in the worst accent possible. The workshop is also horrible, there's nothing but ugly AWPs, AKs and M4s. Most skins doesn't even have a purple variant, and I honestly don't see why there are 6 covert AWPs and 0 covert famases.\n\nOverall?\n+Great gameplay\n+Splendid performace and optimization\n+Interesting game modes\n+Competetive can both be fun and tense\n-Toxic community\n-Constant smurfers & hackers\n-Unstable matchmaking\n-Unfair cooldown system\n-Ridiculous anticheat system\n\n4/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/recommended/730/","loopuleasa","loopuleasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/","252 products in account","Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter.\n\nThe Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source.\n\nI just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which "Get rekt" is the only game mode new players can play.\n\nWhat surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to "Classic" and you're set.\n\nAs I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here.\n\nSpeaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections.\n\nCS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine.\n\nI haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new "Competitive" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure.\n\nThe game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast.\n\nI am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too.\n\nAll in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there:\n\n"In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot.\n\nFor starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots.\n\nIn 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit.\n\nDon't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot.\n\nPlay deathmatch at first to train.\n\nWhat matters, in order:\n1) Aim\nAll weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees.\n\n2) Reflexes\nYou have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first.\n\n3) Map awareness and predictive thinking\nThis is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades."\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run.\n\nMaybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide.\n\nBuy it.\n\nEspecially if:\n-it's on sale\n-you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such\n-you have good aim\n-you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n~~~ 9/10 ~~~\nA sacred beast of a game.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game. All you have to do is click on their heads" ~ Anonymous","December 1, 2013","true","29.5"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","35","49","0","3"

You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that ♥♥♥♥ can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.\n\nThen there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.\n\nThis game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.\n\nAgain, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to you.\n\nAnd let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you.\n\nAnd if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and ♥♥♥♥ you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.\n\nValve clearly doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).\n\nSeriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?\n\nI literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the "supply and demand" card as if this were a real economy and like this ♥♥♥♥ actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.\n\nThis is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.\n\nI was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.\n\nThis game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.\n\nHell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8\n\nAnd that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.\n\nDO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated dogshit. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.\n\nIt's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.\n\nAgain, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.\n\nAnd I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.\n\nHonestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.\n\nUPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devonshiremasterrace/recommended/730/","devonshiremasterrace","Devon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devonshiremasterrace/","266 products in account","I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice.\n\nHaving played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame.\n\nAlso, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.","December 19, 2014","false","092.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","2"

The developers at Valve don't pay attention or care about the effect of the changes they make. The skill ceiling is getting lower with each passing update, and the most recent one is just plain insulting. An obviously broken revolver that anyone with over 10 hours could see is overpowered still managed to make it through QC, along with an unnecessary nerf to spraying. There's no transparency or communication with the community from Valve. If you care about competition at all, this game isn't for you until the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together.","December 10, 2015","false","189.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Too many people play this game just to rank up and are incapable of having fun.\n- Lots of hackers which Valve does a poor job fighting. The worst part is, the prevalance of hackers in this game gives everyone "hacker-paranoia" so if you get a few lucky shots you probably end up getting reported.\n- The competitive ranking system sucks as it doesn't take personal performance (only team performance) into account. A person's rank is a poor indicator of their skill level because many bad players get "boosted" and many good players get stuck at lower ranks by repeatedly getting matched with idiots. It feels like most competitive matches pit you against either terrible players or ridiculously good players (smurfs/hackers), and whether you win or lose is luck of the draw rather than skill.\n- Knowing the map layout is too crucial to winning. If you don't memorize all the bizarre callouts, and know the map layout like the back of your hand, people will think you are an idiot. The result of this is that many people end up only playing Dust 2 to avoid having to spend hundreds of hours learning map layouts.\n- It's made in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Source engine, which is 12 years old, which also happens to be the average age of people who play this game.\n\nIt's not a bad game but it doesn't deserve it's massive popularity. Valve has become totally complacent because they make more money off virtual skins in this game in a month than they ever made off actually making good games.","April 7","false","237.5"," 133 of 222 people (60%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","60","133","222","16","59"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/recommended/730/","WitteCS","'Witte - Ice Cream Time","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/","1286 products in account","Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.\n\nWeapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.\n\nWhat makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.\n\nGlobal Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.\n\nAs a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.\n\nThe actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.\n\nIt's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.\n\nIf one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.\n\nThere's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.\n\nAt times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.\n\nWhen you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as "same old" to us.\n\nThis is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.\n\nAnd yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.","August 12, 2014","true","117.2"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","26","34","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blutank24/recommended/730/","blutank24","T R :o Y","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blutank24/","350 products in account","I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...\n\nCSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.\n\nIt's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.\n\nMatchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.\n\nGame play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them!\n\nAbout the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you're such a hacker, it's so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems.\n\nIt's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game!\n\nCounter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.","December 3, 2014","true","529.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulletproof121/recommended/730/","bulletproof121","SWAG.Brownie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulletproof121/","117 products in account","I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.\nThere are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.\nAs the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.\nHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping\nHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching\nHitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb\nAimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated\nIf you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:\nYou see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.\nYou see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill\nYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.\nYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)\nYou see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.\nYou are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.\nAll of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, "Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, "good" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.\nAn example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.\nPeople standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?\n3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.\nThis game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.\nIt'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.","June 26, 2014","false","518.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more. The insults at this stage of the game become so heavy, that you won't be able to sleep for weeks. After a few months of playing, asking yourself WHY you play this game, you're gonna get out of LEM and become SMFC and then GE. Now you're the one whos stomping. HA! JOKE!

On my old account I bought this game when I first got steam along with CS:S and Garrys mod.\n\nThis game was very fun yet frustrating to play. I learned and got better and at the same time kept learning new things like controlling recoil and how to aim better.\n\nOver time tho this game hasent been doing good (to me at least) In my personal experiances from the 600+ hours ive played this game (300+ on this account and 300+ on my other account) this game has gone through a lot of crap.\n\nLet me get started about what I see people complain about, and myself included. First the 64 tick servers, valve generates millions of dollars, probably even more I dont really know, but I dont know why they dont upgrade VAC servers to 128 tick, it will really make people happy and possibly even attract more players.\n\nAnother thing that people complain about is the infamous hitboxes, everyone has had their fair share of hitbox "mess ups" as i like to call it, basically to valve shooting someone in the chest 5 times with P250 is actually shooting him once or twice.\n\nThis game is fun, it requiers practice and skill, and I like that in a game, but what I dont like is how they dont really fix the hitboxes and bullet regestration and the whole 64 to 128 tick server.\n\nAnother problem is Smurfs/Hackers. Everyone knows that hackers are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who like to ruin the game for others and make you get real toxic, mean while smurfs are the same thing but they are legit and have worked to rank up and gain skill, then just ranking down or getting a new account to face lower level skilled people to ruin there day and making everyone look like fools.\n\nWhat I dont like is that the updates that were supposed to help the smurf problem didnt do much because almost every game I join I see 1 person getting headshots from long killin a guy thats all the way at A site. Its possible but I dont think a silver can do it that easily....over.....and over......almost every round.\n\nI dont get salty or toxic to often as I always remind myself it is just a game at the end, but I see an increase with cheaters and smurfs and I dont see them getting rid of.\n\nIn the end, this game is fun, its challenging, I like it. But I dont think valve is doing to great with this game.\n\nHackers/Smurfs are still about, some guns have been nerfed to the point where its useless, Nuke had the worst map change in my opinion. And to top it all off, 64 tick servers and ♥♥♥♥ hitboxes are the worst.","March 17","false","504.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/recommended/730/","killerfrosti","Pepsiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/","606 products in account","Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little "back to the basics" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf.\n\nCSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them.\n\nThere's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played.\n\nSo that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round.\n\nSo now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you.\n\nThere's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this.\n\nIn my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players.\n\nThe only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful.\n\nOver the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.","January 30, 2014","true","740.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:\n1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)\n2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.\n3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.\n4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)\nBottom line is that the community is dogshit and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.\nThe rest of the game is ♥♥♥♥, only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of ♥♥♥♥ community as you possibly can.\n6/10year olds.","August 15, 2015","false","065.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers!

My biggest gripe with this game and the reason why I downvote it. I lost count on how many times I got matched against low-life smurfers in higher ranks (who all have 30-40h of playtime or private profile or "lvl 1 and only csgo in games list") playing like e-Sports players, beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and my friends (Master Guardian/Gold Nova, so we are not that pro) and even bragging in the chat. THANKS FOR NOT WORKING, MATCHMAKING!\nAlso, a few times, as gold novas, I got matched against some... high-rank ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Thanks Valve.\n\nThe AWP sniper rifle (it's a wall of text because I need to explain). Many players disagree with this one, but in my eyes that sniper rifle is OP. I thought it was ok at first, but I've come to the conclusion that the AWP is just way too powerful. It is 100% accurate, even in the same moment you release the movement button. It kills you in 1-shot even to the body, even if you have kevlar (so what's the point of purchasing kevlar+helmet if most of the enemy team has ♥♥♥♥ing AWPs?!). You don't even have a chance to shoot, since the AWP enemy always shoots first because of the weapon's perfect accuracy.\nI have NO problems against assault riflers, but everytime I encounter an AWP, within a second everything turns pitch black! DEAD! When I have AWP, I literally frag most of the opponent team, even when I go run 'n' gun, literally.\nMany say "flank them. smoke them, use flashbangs". Wish those methods actually worked, but it's a 100% accurate, 1-shot kill, close/long range weapon that is useful in ANY situation. As a terrorists, you don't have much time time to plant the bomb. Flanking makes you lose time, and the maps are a bit small, so escaping is difficult.\n"But it's a sniper rifle, it is supposed to kill you in 1 shot because it's realistic you ♥♥♥♥♥♥". If the game was supposed to be realistic, then all other weapons should kill people in 1-3 shots, right? This is not a realistic game, it's a competitive game, and things need to be adjusted for balance purposes.\nJesus christ most shooters share the same "op" snipers, especially in Loadout (a free-to-play game) where you can roll around and still be accurate and kill anyone in 1 shot while assault riflers have to waste an entire magazine AND manage recoil at the same time to kill someone.\nEvery "pro" I see in CSGO only use that weapon. Ohohoh, guess why.\n\nCompetitive in this game is ♥♥♥♥ed, and full of nerds who are willing to play 24/7 for the rest of their life just to annoy less-experienced players. Valve, do something for this ♥♥♥♥ system.","December 5, 2015","false","472.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","11"

How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing  CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the  servers  where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't  recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS.

Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.\n\nGrowth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.\n\nPieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.\n\nEven in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire\n\nConsequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.\n\nIf you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.\n\nFire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.","December 11, 2013","true","412.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","21","27","4","8"

The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends.\n\nSince you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system.\n\nIt is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't.\n\nThere is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult.\n\nThe game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate.\n\nIt's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.","May 18, 2013","true","0.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.\nBut thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.\nOf course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.\n\nWhen it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.\n\nI mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.\n\nCompetetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.\nAre there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.\nBut wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.\nOverwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.\n\nLast thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy ♥♥♥♥ this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted.\nWell... what can I say\n10/10\nLooking forward to playing more.","December 1, 2015","true","072.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","6"

It makes the game that more challenging.\n\nWhat I personally really like about this game is the strong relationship with the developer and the average player, with enough trust you can really help the community to get rid of cheaters using the overwatch system which lets you oversee a match from the eyes of the suspect and do your good deed.\n\nYou can also give your feedback about flaws in thr map design and if your word gets out loud enough, Valve will make the change. Over the course of this game's lifespan there has been countless map changes.\n\nThe general community consists out of not very bright people, I don't know if this is just me playing on European servers, but it's impossible to get matched with decent people at the high-mid ranks (DMG-ish) therefore I always perfer to play with friends.\n\nA quite huge part of the game are the weapon skins which in my opinion are a really great addition, because they're purely cosmetic but also are very valuable, personally I made over $400 just by buying and selling various weapon skins. I still keep a few to myself because there is no shame in investing money into something you love. I still kinda hate the taxing when selling your items on the community market, but there's nothing you can do.\n\nI really don't know what else to say, I guess you can't aim down the sights?\nOh yeah workshop, and the game itself is very very customizable with a developer console and whatnot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/einfachnurhardc0re/recommended/730/","einfachnurhardc0re","fury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/einfachnurhardc0re/","235 products in account","CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay.\nThe recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source.\nIn CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions.\nIn this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic.\n\nArmor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random.\n\nThe sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible.\n\nSome maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes).\nIt's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts.\nIt's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time.\n\nThe ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look  very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace).\n\nConclusion:\nCS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things.\nThere is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have.\nIf you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week.\nAll in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.","November 30, 2013","true","132.6"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazebeak/recommended/730/","Blazebeak","Blazebeak🍗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazebeak/","260 products in account","I ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasn't. It shockingly got even worse.\n\nBefore I start lets get into the history of Counter Strike. The Original CS was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to it's sequel, CS:source. CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter.\n\nThen CS:GO came.  This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam.\n\nAnd lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. So I was on a server, everyone was dead. It was me vs. the entire other team and as you would guess, I died. Then some squeaker yells over the mic "what the f#ck you idiot!" and starts a vote kick on me that passed. The other way around happened where I hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and I get "You f#cking hacker!" and get kicked.\n\nThis stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all.\n\n30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon.\n\nThis game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is shít and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games.

This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank.\n\nIf you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.\n\nI give it a 8/10.

You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones.\nIn Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins.\nDemolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions.\nCompetitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win.\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing.\nYou will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called "Operations". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal.\nThe graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better.\nGlobal Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers.\nThe mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it.\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99€.\nA must have for every Steam user!\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 22, 2014","true","909.6"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spitora/recommended/730/","spitora","M<4tt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spitora/","40 products in account","Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.\n\nAlso many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be "like" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add "bots mode" back.\n\nCounter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10","April 26, 2014","true","695.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","3"

You need patience to be an AWPer, You need extra time to train for weapon sprays, reaction time, aim, and just plain pratice to get better.\n\nCasual:\n10 on 10 Bomb Mission, great for getting to know the maps because if you are new and bad/and or do not kow what your doing nobody will care. Very Fun, and can meet some interesting "Characters".\n\nDemolition:\nOne of the mini type of gamemode in Counter Strike: GO.\nThis is a 5 on 5 Bomb Mission with only 1 bomb site. Once you get a kill the next round you upgrade to a better or worst weapon. I use this for pratice or if a friend needs help.\n\nArms Race (Gun Game):\nThis is a pretty old game mode with a new name. Your on a Team Death Match, but every 2 kills you upgrade your weapon.\n\nDeathmatch:\nThe best way to pratice, all guns are free you get infinite ammo (sv_infiniteammo 2(Reloads after 1 Magazine)) YOU WILL NEED TO PRATICE ON HERE (NOT WITH BOTS)\n\n\nCompetitive:\nThe most played and most stressed game mode in CSGO. ITs a 5 v 5 with skill groups S1 to GE\nAs your skill gets better you get a better rank, and harder enemies. Do not solo que because, you will get ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates who dont know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are doing, best to find friends that you can agree on strats, and buy.\n\nOverall a great game.","March 17, 2015","true","759.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","1"

CS 1.6 and CS:S were better!\n________________________________________________________________\n\nNew: Okay, after people asking me: "Hey Axel, why does cs go suck?", I gotta explain it.\nMy dear friend, prepare for a long review, full of bad english and hate and ♥♥♥♥ and stuff and... yea, you got it. Let's start with the most annoying thing,\n\nPhysics:\n\nDear Volvo!\nExplain me, how to ruin source engine that hard? Corrupting bunny hopping, surfing, sliding (if someone actually remembers this game mod), football, minigames, jail (i dislike jail, but feel free to get angry if you liked it) and worst of all, trikz and kreedz.\nWhy don't you Volvo release 2 versions of CS:GO? One for fun mods, one for competitive (which is ♥♥♥♥, but i'll come later to it) and feel free to even sell it as 2 different games. I would still buy both and be happy.\nwhy the hell don't weapons have 100% precision now while standing still and doing nothing? Why does every 4th-5th shot with AK miss? Let's make every skill game to a luck game? Like minesweeper, "skill" - "skill" - "skill" - "now i need to guess".\n\nEngine:\n\nYes, here you'll see all the complaints about tickrate, hitreg and interpolation.\nWhat is interpolation?\nAs a player, you receive and send packets from/to server to "communicate" with the game. These packets contain the information you see later. Your ping is the "speed" of how fast you receive the packets. But no one's connection is perfect, so if we only used these packets, the game would lag and be unplayable.\nSo there is an old trick, interpolation:\nYou receive a packet, then you receive a second packet and the actual gameplay you see on screen is in between. This means, what you see, happens in the past and the server is a few milliseconds in the future. This is how you get shot with an awp "while the guy was running just before he shot me OMGOMGOMG TRIQQER HAX". In reality, the server has already calculated that he stopped and this is why his precision was nearly 100%.\n\nLet's calculate the nice and fun interpolation in MadMaking:\ncl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate = cl_interp\n1 sec / 64 updaterate = 15,625 ms every new packet.\ncl_interp_ratio 2 = 2/64 = 31,25 ms for 2 packets to you receive/send so the server reacts.\nIt may happen that a few packets get lost and hits won't be registered on server but you will see these on your screen.\n\nNow we have lag compensation.\nCommand Execution Time = Current Server Time - Packet Latency - Client View Interpolation\nThis means there are small mistakes regarding where the player is and where you saw him and you have to live with it.\n\nVolvo could reduce it to minimum by doubling the server tickrate, BUT higher tickrate means higher CPU load, means higher costs and poor Volvo earns only more than Apple or Google[www.forbes.com] and can't spend more money to get better servers.\n\nYou can read more about interpolation here.\nAnd more about lag compensation here.\n\nMicrotransactions:\n\nYes, I totally forgot to mention that in my review, first time i was writing it.\nMicrotransactions are just another way to make more money by offering unnecessary content. We've already seen enough in TF2.\nVolvo thought, let's recreate the same marketing strategy again. And skins came out. Of course, what else could you do?\nCreating new paid weapons? Community would tear you in pieces, dear GabeN, because CS:GO is meant to be competitive and there is nothing competitive in pay2win.\nBut money is not everything! There are even more reasons to add skins. There are people out there who love trading and collecting this ♥♥♥♥ (not to mention people who just buy em for e-♥♥♥♥♥).\nThen there are operations. If not to mention that maps are often unfinished, some are buggy, the idea is not that bad. You pay for the coin and that coin gives you stats. But again, there are missions to do and completing a mission gives you a drop - really? The marketing strategy strikes back, even more when you get a case drop as a "reward".\nEven DLCs are not that bad compared to skins. Why not making unfinished map DLCs like EA or Activision already do?\nMicrotransactions suck.\n\nCasuals:\n\nFirst of all, thank you for adding a new game mod called "Demolition". It's quite fun when you want to waste your time on fast paced maps. Thank you for adding "Deathmatch" as a game mod, to play on official servers.\nBut how did you ruin the gun game? "Arms Race" now puts better players in disadvantage by highlighting them red. Of course it's better for new players to find these. It's maybe fun untill you get matched versus non silvers who start wallbanging you. But to the hell with casuals, we have competitive nowdays built in CS:GO.\n\nCompetitive:\n\nFirst of all, I am global myself and have played CS for 15 years now. And I can tell, I expected more. Global, yes, global must be global. You do get matched with people, I can't say they deserved global. I barely see the difference between eagle and global. Yes, these people are slightly better, but still only people. I expected to play vs people from high tier and not someone who ends his game with 3/5/25. Yes, some people have bad days, are sick, whatever. But this happens way too often.\n\nCompetitive bans are a joke. I trolled 100 games and got reported 9999 times. Where is my ban for griefing? I never got one.\n\nOf course there are alternatives as ESL (which is dead in cs go, soon just dead) or ESEA. What do we have matchmaking for, then?\nAlso, it happened quite often that when Steam servers went down, I finished MM and couldn't start a new one, because "still in game". And you abandon it and get your 10 mins ban.\n\nSmurfs, I have no problem with these since I got 6 smurfs myself. Anyways, all the new protection systems are useless, since if I want to play with friends, I do so.\n\nCheaters, the only thing I am positive about Volvo are VAC waves. Honestly, I think this is where CS:GO made a positive progress. Of course there are cheaters out there, there will always be. But VAC bans are perma. I could wish for was that CS:GO would cost like 100€, so it'd be actually painful to buy it again and again for cheating.\n\nConclusion:\nYou ruined CS:S once in 2010. You still do ruin CS:GO. With horrible skins, with people who play competitive for fun (actually you people, ♥♥♥♥ off this game and play competitive for fun in Call of Duty), with engine "tweaks" and everything I called above + sending most people to the "new" CS.\n\nOh, one more point. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing easy. It's easy as hell, there is no easier version of CS out there and there will hopefully never be. It is made this way so Volvo can sell it to 6 year olds and profit for it. Because getting pwnd is not fun, but the easiness factor is just made by money.\n- This is why bhop is dead!\n- This is why trikz/bugs are dead!\n- This is why they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the engine!\n- This is why competitive went full casual!\n- This is why you play this game!\n\nYou, dear review reader, are the reason why good games die. Because you want to win and master a game in 10 hours.

For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!","November 3, 2014","true","911.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","5"

After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than .\n\nBefore continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game.\nThe gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO.\nValve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies .\nBut the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day .\nBut on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends.\n\nTotal we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion.\n\n- beardATTACK @ fren","May 21, 2014","true","015.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Once you are higher up in the ranks you will encounter at least 1 smurf per game and they will destroy you.\n\n2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken.\n\n3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it.\n\n4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid.\n\n5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team.\n\n6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad.\n\nAll in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you.\n\nEdit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work.","June 25, 2014","false","129.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

No this is the pure definition of great gameplay and great level design. I've spend hours upon hours getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by the better players and I usually don't mind. It's all about aim, weapon control and above all else, good teamwork. If I had to choose one online first person shooter, it would be Counter-Strike Global Offensive.","December 27, 2013","true","539.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

(Operations, duh)\n-Smurfs, cheaters, etc. that screw the game.\n-Learning how to deal with the nasty recoil with certain weapons.\n-PLAGUE PEOPLE (even your own teammates)\n\nI recommend the game of course!
