One thing led to another, and it turns out I was completely wrong about something: the "stuttering" the ghosts do sometimes in Super Pac-Man and Pac & Pal is apparently intentional behavior. I have no idea why, but that's that. Multiple sources seem to confirm this. Now don't I look like a jerk! That said though, I'm still preeetty sure Ms. Pac's sprite isn't supposed to jitter like it does in her game. Correct me if there's an explanation for this or if I'm crazy.\n\nAlso, something I neglected to mention, while it's true that shutting the arcade cabinet off for most of these games would delete the scores, most past collections of these games would save the scores when you quit anyway, as if it was left running until you came back. You can still see your top score in the leaderboards, this just bothers me for some reason.\n\nI still don't think this is an ideal compilation, but credit where it's due, my review wasn't entirely accurate and I apologize for that.\n\n\nOriginal Review Follows:\n\n\nHow do you mess this up?\n\nI love Pac-Man, I really do, but this is not a very high quality collection. Let's go game by game, shall we?\n\nPac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Attack, Pac-Land, Championship Edition, and Battle Royale work as intended, as far as I can tell. Pac-Mania looks really washed out and some of the music sounds like a garbage disposal is going off, but hey, it was always like that. And of course, Pac-Land is like, some kind of shoddy MS Paint platformer. It's alright. A smaller version of CE is included in the superior and faster paced CE DX (The Championship 1 stage), which is already on Steam, so if that's what you're after, you should probably check that out first. Battle Royale is best played with friends, having no proper scoring system (each player is assigned a title like "Most Pac-Man Eaten," or "Won Most Rounds"...etc etc.). There is no online component to speak of.\n\nSome of the games seem to have emulation problems. In Pac & Pal, sometimes the ghosts freeze and jitter in place. The same thing happens in Super Pac-Man. I somehow doubt this was intended behavior. In Ms. Pac-Man (which, by the way, costs $5 to download after March) the player's sprite seems to wiggle around when heading up or down.\n\nAnd I just want to take a minute to talk about Pac-Man Arrangement here. You may be thinking it's THIS game, but in fact it is some other, uglier, sort-of related but also not related at all type 3D game from the PSP Namco Museum, with some tedious bosses and slow freakin' ghosts. I have no idea who could have looked at both of these side by side and said "Yes, this is the better version." Why not include both Pac-Man Arrangements? Why are there two games called the same thing in the first place?\n\nThe menus are okay. You can unlock badges from getting achievements in the games, which themselves unlock character models and maybe other stuff, I don't know; I haven't played long enough. Each game has some options, but no option to turn off the really bright borders around the screen. Not a deal-breaker in itself, but odd.\n\nSo then comes the matter of price. Is $20 worth it for these games, and then $5 additionally for Ms. Pac? Considering Namco has released many much more fully featured, and properly emulated collections in the past[www.amazon.com] for typically similar prices, I'd have to say: unfortunately, no. Heck, if you can navigate the Japanese PSN store, you can find all the old PS1 Namco Museum collections, and those are still as awesome as ever, complete with actual "virtual museums" to walk around in filled witth all kinds of obscure pamphlets and magazines and such. The version on my phone is better! And as far as I'm concerned, nothing has topped Tengen's Ms. Pac-Man port on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive.\n\nSo if you get anything from this review, it's that classic Namco arcade games are awesome, but this is not the best, or even a "good" way to play them as it is right now. Find some other way to play these games, unless this gets a major patch and a price drop. Sad times.\n\nP.S. the cartoon sucks too.","February 25, 2014","false","5.2"," 296 of 352 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","296","352","2","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/236470/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","This was another case for me of buying a game regardless of the mostly negative reviews to judge it for myself, and it's times like this that makes me wish Steam had a "Mixed" option for writing reviews. While I like this collection it also has a load of issues that need addressing. First let me start by saying that I love retro games, arcade classics such as Pac-Man, Q*Bert, Galaga, Dig-Dug etc. so this looked like a must-have for me, it's enjoyable but let's just say that I'm very, very glad I bought it while it was on sale (£5 as opposed to the original £15).\n\nWhat you see is what you get, a collection of Pac-Man arcade classics varying from the original to some obscure games I've never heard of, a nice wide selection giving you some variety for your money. Each game plays as intended and great when you've got some time to kill just like in the old days, the collection is as follows:\n\n- Pac-Man (Original)\n- Pacmania\n- Super Pac-man\n- Pac-Attack\n- Pac & Pal\n- Pac-Land\n- Pac-Man Arrangement\n- Pac-Man Battle Royale\n- Pac-Man Championship Edition\n- Ms Pac-Man (Sold as DLC for some reason)\n\nNow, everything does indeed play as intended and for the most part works fine, but there are some annoying problems with this game that really grind on peoples nerves, aside from the fact that this "museum collection" is missing quite a few other Pac-Man titles such as Pac-Man Plus.\nThe main issue here is that the default keyboard controls for the most of the menus and title screens are absurd and the game does not give you any option to change them, which is both strange and really frustrating. On the note of options, the main game has no option menu at all, so you are stuck with the default resolution, while this doesn't bother me, I understand that a lot of you will find this annoying...\nWhile not necessarily a gameplay issue, the "museum" feature itself is rather pointless and tedious, it is merely aesthetic and serves no real purpose. In order to fill the museum, you must earn stamps by achieving some set goals, some of which are really hard to accomplish such as the 500,000 point stamps on some games. This ultimately feels really grindy and dull very quickly and makes life difficult if you care for getting the achievements provided, unfortunatley I do. :P\n\nSo the collection is not without it's flaws, some games such as Pac-Man Battle Royale could be played to their full potential by adding online multiplayer support, unfortunately it is limited to local multiplayer which is too bad. If you're a fan of arcade classics and this happens to be on sale, by all means, buy it. It delivers what it promises on the arcade calssics front, just be warned that the lack of options, key-binding and grinding features make this game much more tedious than it should be. I don't consider this to have been a bad purchase so I do recommend it, but not for it's full price, not at all! Make sure you get it when it's cheap, especially if you plan to buy the Ms Pac-Man DLC too.\nIf you are not interested in retro Pac-Man and would like something more modern and fast-paced, pick up Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ instead of this, it's better than the version provided with this game.\n\nCan't believe I wrote this much information about a Pac-Man game...

My issue is not with the games themselves, but the fact I played them several decades ago and they were basically better on all fronts compared to this version's collection.\n\nFirst, the good part. This 'museum' contains a lot of the really obscure Pacman titles that were hard to find in the arcades and laundromats back in the 80's. It's a trip down nostalgia lane in that sense. And for those who haven't played those games, you may find it interesting to see what strange variations the Pacman franchise took over the years.\n\nWith that out of the way, there's not much this title gets right, performance-wise. The resolution on most of the games is not full screen, but a squashed blurry window that you can't adjust. Why couldn't they update that for computers if they're going to sell these games on a new platform? The controls also kind of, well, suck. I wouldn't say this had I not actually played these games on a native arcade cabinet, but these things are not optimized well for keyboards. Pacman is a game of fast responses. If the game refuses to acknowledge inputs at random times, what's the point even? I noticed this kept happening, regardless of which Pacman title I played. That's flat out unacceptable. If I knew these problems existed and that they had no interest in fixing them, I never would have bought this; on sale or otherwise.\n\nThere are also achievements to be had- these translate into the museum section animations, which really are just there to promote Pacman's current cartoon with the characters from the show. That's fine, I guess, but these don't talk about the history of Pacman in any sense of the word and if you don't watch the show, they're largely meaningless repeating animations. The included texts from clicking on them doesn't even say much. So, how is this a museum or an effective advertising piece for the cartoon?\n\nThis is simply a lazy quick cash grab title with a small bit of appeal for the obscure games crudely transferred to the PC format. Worse off, Ms Pacman is NOT INCLUDED. You have to pay $5 more for that one title. Wtf?? This game will also remind you EVERY SINGLE TIME that the DLC is available for purchase when you log in to play. Watch how fast that gets old. There's not even steam cards or any visible sign they're paying attention to the forums. That's unacceptable for a large company like Namco. As a Pacman fan, I recommend you stay away unless you've got some change burning a hole in your pocket. And even then, get yourself a sandwich. You'll enjoy it more.","May 17, 2015","false","2.6"," 99 of 111 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","99","111","9","0"

Also noticed substantial input lag on the older arcade games when using a 360 stick.

It is a miraculous resurrection of an all-time classic that started the gaming revolution and subsequent dot-munching maze chase games persisted in several guises through the gaming evolution.  There is one notable missing title that would have made this collection complete (in my opinion) ,,, Pac-Man Jr.  However with that said my all time favourite is in the collection as an optional add-on purchase.  I did not mind shelling out the extra to get Ms Pac-Man.  The inclusion of the side scrolling platformer Pac World in the collection was a pleasant surprise.\n\nPlaying the games, it appears that the controls may take some time for players to master on  an x-box 360 controller.  The game pad does not respond quite as naturally as the leaf-switch arcade sticks.  This results in often (but not always) running straight instead of taking a turn when a player intends to turn.  The keyboard seems to respond better, but does not capture the feel of an arcade stick.\n\nOverall this is a great collection and worth the full price.

There are some glaring omissions to mention right off the back: lack of customizable controls, lack of graphical settings (including resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode).  At the same time, I got it on sale for $5, so I'm not bitter since I got more than my money's worth in gameplay time.\n\nThe games themselves are pretty fun for the most part!  There is a surprising amount of variety, despite the fact that the same structure pops up in almost all of the games.  I found Champsionship Edition to be particularly enjoyable, and I liked revisiting Pac-Man Arrangement (though I think the version on Game Boy Advance from years ago was more polished).\n\nSpeaking of polish, some games suffer from horrible control issues.  Delayed response from the keyboard or gamepad make navigating tight corners at high speeds deeply frustrating, let alone trying to time difficult jumps in Pac-Mania (another game I found more polished and response on the GBA).  Regular Pac-Man seems to play just fine, but Super Pac-Man and Pal & Pal are particularly unresponsive.\n\nFinally, some of the requirements to get stickers are outrageous.  If you're the kind of person who will go mental if you cannot 100% a game, I'd advise staying away.\n\nIn the end, Pac-Man Museum has some highs and some lows.  The games I was looking forward to playing happen to be the more polished of the bunch, so I'm content with leaving the rest unattended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/236470/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","You're mostly buying this for Battle Royale\n\nLet's not beat around the bush here -- with the new Pac-Man Museum compilation, you're getting a bunch of really old games you've most likely played before, a few you probably already own, and Pac-Man Battle Royale. Royale is a bit of a unique release, as it's only been playable outside of Japan at special events and arcades, and has been highly sought out by fans of the genre.\n\nTo be blunt, this is the perfect opportunity to wait for a sale just to pick up Royale.\n\nPac-Man Museum (PC, PS3, Xbox 360 [reviewed])\nDeveloper: Namco Bandai Games\nPublisher: Namco Bandai Games\nReleased:  February 25, 2014\nMSRP: $19.99\n\nReviewing a collection of old games can be tough, so let's start at the iconic, timeless classic: the original Pac-Man. It still holds up today, and although Museum doesn't pack a ton of nuanced options to fundamentally change the game, it does have few extras like the ability to select a starting level (once you earn it), and increase your life and bonus life thresholds.\n\nHaving said that, I know a lot of people who hated the original Pac-Man until they played the Championship Edition of the game which really helped them "get it" -- since it was pretty much better in every way. While CE is fully included in the Museum, sadly the DX upgrade that came later is not. Why Namco would opt to give you an inferior, outdated version of Championship Edition is beyond me, and counts as a strike against Museum's quality.\n\nNext up is Pac-Mania, which is similar to the original, just with an isometric view, expanded boards, and the ability to jump. Pac's leaping power is a lot more useful than you'd think, as he can change his trajectory mid-air and jump around corners, making for a more action-oriented feel.\n\nThe problem is since the view is at an angle, you can't actually see the whole board, and it's frustrating to have to track down that last pellet you can't even look at. Because of that, you'll have to change up your strategy fundamentally and go on specific routes, clearing pellets along the way. Pac-Man Arrangement is very similar in that it offers up jumping capabilities (with a classic view), but it goes a step further with other power-ups like speed boosts. Both are fun, but not nearly as engaging as Championship Edition.\n\nThen you have the decidedly dated Pac & Pal and Super Pac-Man, which don't hold up today, as they essentially operate like the original, but with convoluted additions such as "keys" and other weird concepts. With Pal you have a ghost that steals items and with Super, Pac-Man grows really big and can speed up to smash through walls -- that's about it.\n\nWhen it comes to Pac-Land and Pac-Attack, they're anything but familiar. Land is basically the black sheep of the franchise, taking the form of an odd 2D platformer in which Pac needs to escape from ghosts chasing him in vehicles like old-timey cars and UFOs.\n\nIt's got a perfect "so bad it's good vibe" going on, although you probably won't want to play it more than a few times. Pac-Attack is basically a clone of Dr. Mario, with Pac-Man pieces eating the ghosts (viruses) instead of the requirement to match up colors. It features a two-player versus mode, which is just about the only way you're going to get mileage out of this game.\n\nAgain, Battle Royale is the main reason you're probably interested in this pack. There's no surprise here -- the concept of putting four Pac-Man players in an arena and forcing them to eat each other is good fun. It uses the Championship concept of automatically arranging levels in real time around you, and it speeds up over time to increase the tension. Even if people aren't Pac-Man fans, they can still enjoy the fast-paced, simple gameplay of Royale. Thankfully, it also supports solo play against an NPC, but you'll definitely want to find three local friends for this one (mostly because Museum doesn't have an online component).\n\nMuseum as a whole supports full leaderboards for every game, an in-game Stamp Book achievement system, and a "Pac-Room" to mess around in that stores collectibles. Visually on consoles the game looks fine, but every game outside of CE and Royale will support a tiny native resolution while a border takes up the rest of the screen. As a side note, if you buy the game before the end of March, you'll net the wonderful Ms. Pac-Man for free, which sweetens the deal.\n\nPac-Man Museum has a bunch of middling pieces, but the addition of Battle Royale is the icing on the cake. If you've never played Championship Edition before and thus do not have DX to compare it to, it's a perfect way to re-acclimate yourself to the franchise, while you use Royale to spice up your next local gathering. Everyone else who lacks friends on-hand or has already played CE should wait for a sale, or pass this one up entirely.\n\n\nPac-Man Museum reviewed by Harley365\n7/10\nGOOD\n\nA solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.","May 14","true","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game uses the engine of Namco Museum for XBOX 360 for displaying the arcade games. Unfortunately there is no way to turn off the sometimes distracting borders that some of the games have. You'll have to play in a well lit room to not be affected by it. Could make some people dizzy or sick.\n\nArcade perfection wise, these games are the originals. but you can't see the games opening attraction because once you start a game, the software automatically inserts a credit for you to play so you can't see it. Also if you notice the copyright messages on the original arcade games have been modified to say NBGI on them so its not really an original game if you modify the original copyright on the screen.\n\nThe controls are good. I'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad in XInput mode so it's just like playing on the XBOX 360 except its for PC.\n\nFinally I read through some of the complaints about glitchy graphics . I don't have them here. Windows XP SP3, 4GB Ram , Nvidia Geforce 8400M GS , Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4ghz Processor. Runs pretty smooth.\n\nIf there is one complaint I had is that the initial demo offering really did not convince me to buy the full game initially but once I saw some gameplay videos of this game, I had to have it. I don't own an XBOX 360 so my gaming choices are limited but I'm happy that Namco Bandai Games decided to show some love for the PC audience and release this game. Despire some complaints about it.\n\nMaybe it does need patching, but for now I'll play it as is.","February 28, 2014","true","3.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I don't understand why a lot of people hate it.\nI bought it full price, but I wouldn't recommend that because to most it's probably valued, at max, half that.\n\nThe modern style of Pac-Man has been strongly imposed on the intro/menu, which I think that anyone older than 8 can agree sucks, but it's not hard to forget and enjoy Pac-Man for what it was.\nEach different Pac-Man game has a leaderboard and 8 in-game badges for passing milestones which can give further incentive to carry on playing.\nA border is around every game as it's played in a box in the center of the screen, this is a big argument starter for some reason but on 1600x900 it's fine. I don't really know the reason people moan about this.\n\nThere's many different forms of Pac-Man inside (Pac-Man, Pac-Land, Pac-Attack) but unless you know you like Pac-Man games, you should probably wait for some kind of sale.

In fact, Pac-Man CE DX + is one of my favorite games on Steam so far.  So when this came to Steam, I decided to get it.  The result is mostly good, but needs some more polishing before it can be considered a good buy.\n\nLike others have said, more customization options (controls and display) would be good, online multiplayer for Battle Royale would be welcomed in with open arms, and keeping Ms. Pac-Man free would also be good.  The Game selection is pretty good, but personally I would have replaced Pac-Land and Pac-Man Arrangement with Pac-Man Plus and Jr. Pac-Man.  In fact, how about having Pac-Man Plus and Jr. Pac-Man be the next two rounds of DLC? Or if we're thinking wishfully, how about a simulated version of Baby Pac-Man, the video and Pinball hybrid?\n\nBottom Line:  Add the aforementioned customization options, keep the DLC free, add more games, take Battle Royale online, and then it'll truly be worth $20 (or 80 quarters).

I was wrong. For those of you who're busy and just wanna know my opinions summed up, I basically feel that this this game is a mockery of the original Pac Man. I recommend that you spend your hard earned cash on Championship DX+. You'll have a much better experience.\n\nFor those that will actually read the entire review, know that I hated this. It felt like the worst console port ever. I'd have yet to encounter a game on Steam that didn't use WASD if it weren’t for this. That's right, you didn't read it wrong: this game doesn't support the WASD keys as controls. It makes you use the arrow keys. Luckily, I use an Xbox controller for these sorts of arcade titles, so that didn't affect me too much. Apart from that, the games weren’t in their original states. I've played Pac Man Championship (the older one) and I know for a fact it wasn't anywhere near as pixelated. Come to think of it, the entire game, hub and all, was pixelated. However, I'm fairly certain that was due to poor settings on my side. Speaking of “my side”, this game didn’t run on the first try, nor did it run on the second, or third, or fourth, for that matter. I had to go as far as to contact Bandai (Namco) and wait for a response in order to even start the game. Even after I had had (that’s not a type-o) days to build extra anticipation to play the game, I still disliked it from minute 1.\n\nAll-in-all, this game really disappointed me. It’s the first game that I’ve ever installed that I’m uninstalling solely because it was unentertaining. Going back and re-reading it, I realize that my review really doesn’t “review” anything about the game at all. Still folks, trust me when I say that you do NOT want to spend your hard earned cash on “Pac Man Museum”.\n\nSeriously though, people should start a petition to add multiplayer to Championship DX+, and to add Namco Museum, a title that I’ve loved since childhood, to Steam.\n","October 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you're a big Pac-Man fan, the bundle is a good deal. Some games will likely never be played by me, but some games ( the original game and Ms. Pac Man) will be played quite a bit. A big down side for me was that I can't figure out how to get 2 player on Ms. Pac Man...which is really frustrating.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't research as much as I should have. What really sold me on getting this was having Pac-Man Championship Edition and Battle Royale included. I got CE for free on my PS3 a few years ago and loved it, but I sold my PS3 and I was excited to play it again at a fair price. I didn't realize that what I had on PS3 was the DX+ version of the game, and the version included is nowhere near as fun. Even if an upgrade was offered as DLC, I would be okay with that, but it is not. Battle Royale is frstrating in a completely different way because they took a HD game and put a border around the entire screen. Just..why?\n\nBottom line, the package is alright, but it lacks the option to change resolution and the thick borders (particularly on BR) is unnecessary. If you can get it for $5 you probably will get your money's worth,  but supporting such a lazy port feels wrong to me. I wish I could get my money back.","May 22, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But they instead offer that as a DLC extra you have to pay for...this would be the equivilent of a natural history museum which is already offering limited access  to its exhibits making you pay to see anything about Birds...its simply not on...Add to this that the with a title like Pac-Man Museum you would think they would at least glance on the home console games if even briefly (No Pac-Man 2, Pac in time, Pac man world ect...) just makes for a rather over priced experience that delivers very little content...\n\nIf your really desperate to play the original Pac-Man there are hundreds of Flash based versions available online, failing that locating a copy of the original on any home console or even handheld mobile devices these days is almost guarenteed to be possible and for a lot cheaper than you can get it here...\n\nPersonally I would only pick this up if you had a nostalgia for one of the more obscure titles included in this package...otherwise I can highly reccommend picking up  Pac Man championship edition DX+  which is also available on Steam, which in my opinion is a vastly superior modernisation of this utter arcade classic.
