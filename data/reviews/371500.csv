It plays a bit like pinball with the 3D ball rolling around, and you use reflexes and hand-eye coordination to figure out how to direct the ball into slamming the blocks scattered on the screen.\n\nComplicating the shots are intricate and well-designed map layouts, exploding blocks, obstructions, moving obstacles, and even double-ended maps in which you have to stop the ball escaping through not only the bottom but also the top of the screen (It's harder than you'd think.)\n\nRandom powerups also fall as blocks are destroyed, and they can give you advantages like multi-ball, a larger paddle to direct the balls, or magnetic or electric charges on the balls. But watch out which drops you catch, because not all of the powers are helpful, and you can also pick up ones that make your paddle smaller or cause your ball to jolt and stagger rather than roll on a predictably smooth vector.\n\nDon't let the slow speed, neutral pallette, and hypnotic music lull you into thinking that Grey Cubes is too easy though. It's relaxing at first, but it does get pretty challenging.\n\nThere are 60 levels, but you can keep replaying levels to beat your score, giving the game substantial replayability. The only real negative I found was that some of the achievements seemed to reset every time I restarted the game, which makes them kind of frustrating if not impossible. (It does look like the devs are aware of this issue, so hopefully that will be fixed soon.)","May 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 61 of 63 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","61","63","2","1"

That's what it wants to be, and it does it pretty good. It's one of the best versions of breakout I've played, and worth taking a look at.\n\nThe Pros:Visually Appealing - The game is 3D, the bricks are cuboid shapes, and the best part is... physics! The whole game has a blueish theme with very reactive environments. Let's be honest, the game of breakout is pretty darn simple. While you play it, at least look at something pretty too. This game does that perfectly.\n\nWorld Interaction - To make things more interesting, the game has added gameplay mechanics, such as buttons that once pressed change something in the level, or bouncy surfaces that boost your projectile's speed and even vortexes that teleport your ball around.\n\nLengthy Levels - Some levels have difficult obstacles or are constantly spewing out new bricks to keep you busy. Some levels can take up to 5 minutes to beat, and there are 60 levels in total available.\n\nMagnet Mode - After some progress in the level has been achieved, an optional manually activated power-up is available to you, meaning magnet mode, which guides the ball to the nearest cubes. This is insanely useful when you are left with a few difficult to hit cubes left in the level, or not wasting other active power-ups on empty space by going in head first! If you view this as cheating, well, don't use it!\nThe Cons;Some Levels Repeat Themselves - If you think at some point you are experiencing deja-vu, you're not. You have seen that before. It's the exact level from 10 stages ago, but bigger and harder. Doesn't happen too often, but I would have rather seen 60 unique levels than having 40-ish unique and 20 iterative ones.\nConclusionThis game is a great time killer. A nice, new breath of air for the breakout genre, and well worth your time if you like this sort of game. And for the 0.99 Euro price tag, what more could you ask for? (Also, Achievement Hunters! 13 easy achievements on this one!)\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

It's an unassuming title isn't it? It tells you very little about the game. There are cubes in the game, yes. The cubes are indeed grey. There are also cuboids, flat surfaces, and panes, also varying shades of grey, bluish grey, and on occasion red or even other colours. But mostly grey. Let this game not be accused of false advertising. It is based on the perennial favourite Breakout. A game who's heritage is as old as the all time greats (and much like another game I've recently reviewed - Fine Sweeper), and has had various attempts to refresh it. Some have had a lot of success like Shatter, others, not so much. How does this one stack up?\n\nBreaking out of two dimensions...\nThe game flow, whilst obeying the two dimensional nature of Breakout in the usual manner, does play with the third dimension in clever ways, with blocks often stacked up using the depth plane in clever ways to mask the actual number of blocks you'll need to take out, as well as throwing the blocks in different directions (physics play a part, in more than a few ways). The playfield will on occasion be changed up as well, adjusting itself and forcing you to adapt and improvise as the level literally evolves as you clear the field, the game is full of clever touches that keep things fresh and interesting as you work through the levels.\n\nIn an interesting twist, you're also given a usable ability that will magnetise the blocks, sending the ball careening towards them once you've managed to clear more than half the board, a great way to help tidy up the last few stragglers, and to prevent frustration with that "one last block" that tends to pervade these Breakout types of games. It's a clever feature and bears merit on that point in specific.\n\nMinimalism done right.\nMuch like the clean, stylised presentation of recent games such as Invisible Inc. There's a clean, almost futuristic feel to Grey Cubes that has a specific design vision, helped by the minimalist music, that doesn't overawe the gameplay, but instead complements the action, with blocks being broken up to the accompaniment of various orchestral stings (louder ones based on some power ups as well). Giving the game an almost trancelike state when everything goes right.\n\nGrey in colour, but gold in standard\nGrey cubes, despite it's rather unassuming nature is a very tightly woven game, with enough surprises to make it stand out from most of the Breakout type games on the market (Shatter excepted, but then Shatter was really, REALLY good), it's most definitely recommended for anyone with a hankering for a block smashing.\n\nVerdict : Recommended","May 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","31","39","6","0"

After quickly introducing power-ups and intelligent multi-level designs it started to feel closer to something like pinball.. which isn't a bad thing! Starting the game with 5 lives you are able to obtain more by reaching score targets or collecting random drops that occur during play. Otherwise receiving the option of continuing with another 5 balls for the cost of 20000 points after death.\n\nWide range of power-ups all having positive effects or negative effects, some of these included power-balls, multi-balls, mirrored-balls and lightning balls. Though the star of the show was the level mentioned designs. Passing each sector opened up new areas on the table or caused objects to stack on top of each other further increasing the skill required. After several levels the game also includes switches for toggling gates.  Controls were responsive for mouse and gamepad though at times the ball did feel a little floaty, perhaps to do with using real-time physics.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa1fRQPD8FQ\nOverall it can be a quite the relaxing experience considering the genre. Think much of that had to do with the beautiful trance soundtrack and minimalist design. Don't hesitate on a sale, worth rrp for breakout/pinball fans. Thoroughly enjoyed my time spent playing and recommended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morlan/recommended/371500/","morlan","Morlan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morlan/","879 products in account","Preface\nThis game found itself into my inventory by accident. I chose it in a giveaway (there was that option, yes) but initially I thought it had another type of gameplay which is why I chose it. I think it may have been a completely different game I mixed it up in my head with.. But in the end I'm glad it found its way here!\n\n===Happy Pixels===\n-()- An Arkanoid clone in a semi 3D style -will elaborate on that later- is the gist of it. The production value of this game is quite high. The graphics, the sounds, the music, the smooth gameplay, the animations.. all done in a very professional way and blending together nicely.\n-()- The gameplay is sweet without a hint of saltiness, the graphics minimalistic, clean and well done, the animations/transitions smooth, the little silly details -like the uneven/irregular tiles- are fitting and well done, the controls are responsive.\n-()- Like all such clones it has a variety of power-ups that last for a certain period of time. You can monitor their duration on their individual icon that acts as an (semitransparent) hourglass. Most are helpful towards winning the level but there are a few that will hinder your efforts.\n\nThe basic gameplay is the same, hit the blocks, clear the level. Some blocks need more than one hit to break down into..thin air. The level is presented in birds' eye view from a fixed standpoint. The "semi" 3D comes in this sense: The blocks are arranged in true 3D space, they can even from vertical blocks some of which you cannot hit until they tumble down to your level. But the ball will always be on the same level with the bat. So even though it may jump up a bit, pushed by other blocks, it will still come straight to your bat.\nIn the end it works pretty nicely and it's a refreshing take on the subject.\nThe pinball effect on the walls is a nice retro/vintage touch\n\n..And moving on to the..\n\n===Thinking Pixels===\n-)(- Options..In effect there are no options. You're not a mobile game anymore, you're in the big league now. Act like it! There is only Music and Sound on/off options and that's it. No option for window and it only plays fullscreen in a fixed resolution. Bad bad cube.. Bar the resolution, (which should also be a given but I'll be very lenient) window/fullscreen should be one of the 1st things to have in mind in this day and age. -Can you make a game with window/fullscreen choice? -No, it wasn't in my intentions.. -It's alright, can you sing or dance then? Let's try another career..\n-)(- The left/right boundaries of the bat are somehow oddly defined. I was quite sure I was covering the ball path and it still slipped through from either of the sides. It may need some better tweaking regarding the collision around the edges as it's easy to miss the ball close to them.\n-)(- The "warp" elements become quite unfair and annoying at times. They are my least favorite elements of the game and more thought should have gone into their programming. There are some split levels where you can only reach the other part through these warps. Ball goes in, out it goes other side. But these levels can be quite wide so you cannot see all of it unless the ball warps. Only then does the camera move over to that part. If the ball is travelling towards the bat and warps at the last split second over to the other side, it can be very difficult to almost impossible to catch it because at the instance you see the bat, after the camera reaches it, it's already too late.\n-)(- The achievements pop-up gets a bit annoying because there are a bunch of them that you reach after a certain amount of *points* (ie no. of blocks, no. of hits etc) and after every level you get those *points* for a few of them, without finishing, and you get 2-3 achievement pop-ups after every..\n\n===Judgy Pixels===\nIt has some programming/interface/gameplay flaws that could be tweaked/fixed and make the experience even better.\nLeaving that aside, it's a fun game to relax a bit. Not sure there's much replay value though. Perhaps for better scores?..\nIt reminds me a bit the freshness that DX-Ball[en.wikipedia.org] brought to the genre..back then..","July 22, 2015","true","6.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It uses the throttle control to move the paddle left and right ( with 50% being don't move, 0 == left and 100 == right ). You can't disable joystick to use the mouse for the game if it is plugged in. If you unplug it while the game is open, the paddle hugs the side of the screen.\n\nYou can't change the volume for the music or sound effects, only mute them which is terrible.\n\nThe menu is non-existant; only icons.. no text. The only options are back, mute sound / music, from the main menu ( plus one other which doesn't do much ).\n\nYou can only access certain elements of the menu while in a level instead of from the main menu.\n\nThe paddle teleports at random intervals ( not the levels that teleport you from one box to another, this is a bug ) which causes you to lose a ball.\n\nThere is no depth-perception for levels with multiple levels / z... The ball stays the same size ( actually a very small change in size ), no shadow..\n\nThe ball frequently becomes hidden from view either by the power-up / down icons, the blocks floating above the level, etc... Poor design choice to hide the ball; this doesn't increase difficulty, it eliminates the player being able to play.\n\nPowerup "Magnet / Attract" goes after blocks that aren't accessible ( other side of a wall [ in the teleport levels where you don't have access to these blocks at all ] or above / below the ball ). It should only go after cubes that are available ie same level and not blocked by a wall whereby you can only get to via teleport.\n\n"More levels comming soon" output in the game.\n\nWormholes are annoying because blocks aren't affected by them, meaning a block can end up on a stationary wormhole and you can't hit it by entering the wormhole, only by leaving instead of allowing physics until the ball reaches the center ( it'd be better to have it act like a gravity source and if the ball reaches the center then it teleports instead of teleporting on the "event horizon [ which would be the related area for an ultra-dense-micro-planet otherwise referred to as a black-hole where the teleport activates ]"\n\nIt is possible for the ball to become stuck ( in the sense that it will hit one surface, return to another, and repeat ) which is why the developer probably added the magnetize "skill / option" instead of preventing it from happening.\n\nThis could be a good game if there weren't as many bugs as there currently are in the game, if we could control the volume and define what controller / controls we want to use, if our ball( s ) aren't blocked by powerup/down icons or blocks floating above the level ( which pop-out more blocks ), if after the blocks floating above the level are removed after they have finished producing all their blocks, if the menu actually served as a menu instead of a guessing game, if the menu contained all options from the main menu without needing to enter the game / level to adjust other options, if, if, if, if.......\n\nThere are too many annoyances to even consider this game a "good buy". With all that said, it could be enjoyable with the above fixed... 99 cents is too much to pay for a mobile game on PC, just like $60 is too much to pay for a several years old game ( such as GTA 5 ) which was ported to PC after being out on consoles for years despite being popularized by PC Gamers.","January 16","false","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's a set up that has been tapped up as many times as Tetris or, if you're looking for a more recent example, even Flappy Bird.\n\nYet, as is sadly not often the case with many clones, everyone who takes on Breakout tends to bring something new to the table. A technical advantage afforded to them by the era the game is released in.\n\nIn the case of Grey Cubes – which has to have one of the most uninspiring names on the App Store – its unique selling point is a refined take on physics. Whereas most Breakout style games take a 2D-based top-to-bottom view, Grey Cubes plays as if viewed from above, with the cubes that adorn its name being knocked over like boxes in a storeroom.\n\nIt's a take on physics that allows Grey Cubes to be somewhat fluid, almost playful with the way its levels are set out. The game's intentionally stripped back, Portal-like styling facilitates block-based levels that move, interact and generally play havoc with proceedings. It's here that developer BulkyPix has attempted to bring a 30 year old classic slap bang into 2014.\n\nThe basic concept behind the game, however, is largely unchanged. Your one point of contact is the paddle at the bottom of each stage, which you move by simply sliding your finger accordingly. A swipe up flings the first ball into play, and then it's simply a case of clearing the board of all blocks while keeping the ball in the arena for as long as you can.\n\nThere are two main elements that help keep things interesting during Grey Cubes' 60 stages. Firstly, the addition of power-ups – and 'power downs', if you like – into play. These fall from smashed up blocks supposedly randomly, offering up everything from multiple balls to a safety net below your paddle should you catch them. Said power downs, of course, are somewhat less inviting, making your paddle smaller and, essentially, making it harder to keep control of the action.\n\nThe other element is the levels themselves which, as you progress, start to make their presence known, pushing more blocks into play, acting as barriers and generally making a nuisance of themselves. It's here, however, where BulkyPix has brought its creativity into play; while other Breakout clones spend their time simply mixing the patterns of the blocks up, Grey Cubes is far more focused on making the environment they sit in is pulling the strings.\n\nAnd it's this that pulls you through. The beauty of any Breakout style game is that it can be pulled out and played in short bursts, and the variety of levels on offer in Grey Cubes – each one touching base with its predecessor, but still moving play forwards – ensures that it can serve as your go to game for your five minute on-the-way-to-work fix.\n\nBut, at the same time, while Grey Cubes makes every effort to merge a familiar concept with fresh forms of gameplay, it can't quite escape the fact that, when all is said and done, it's still Breakout. That's not to say developer BulkyPix should be criticised for not reinventing the wheel: ultimately, if you pull a game like Grey Cubes too far away from its origins it loses all structure and, in practice, what the studio has delivered here is a modern take on an undoubted classic.\n\nNevertheless, Grey Cubes is ultimately a game that'll serve as a better companion for those new to the block breaking genre rather than any Breakout stalwarts. It's delivery is impressive and its variety is to be admired, but – by choice or by accident – its structure will likely rekindle any retro players' affection for the original rather than spark an entirely new romance. For newcomers, however, Grey Cubes could well become a mobile classic in its own right.\n\nVerdict\n\nAn inventive spin on Breakout and its clones that brings physics into play to a greater degree than ever, Grey Cubes is the perfect first stop for those new to the block-breaking genre and will revive old passions for the game that inspired it for longterm players. Just don't expect it to reinvent the wheel.","May 16","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a neat modern take on brick breaker type games that feels more realistic phyiscs wise, and the gameplay feels smoother. The levels are three dimensional and the blocks(or cubes in this case) can be stacked, move when hit, and are not always just a simple pattern where you see exactly what there is from the very beginning. There have been multiple cool features on the levels like having a paddle on both sides, teleports, invisible blocks, walls that move when hit, and chute type things that drop in cubes from above. The items are fairly standard though there are some that might be csondered unique. Some of the items, for example, are: smaller or bigger paddle, smaller or bigger ball, wall behind your paddle, multiple balls, and a magnet that attracts the ball to cubes. I'm sure there are even more great features that I haven't ecountered yet since I still have 2/3 of the game left.\nThe music in this game is very relaxing and matches the looks. On that note, the graphics are very visually pleasing. Overall, the game creates a very relaxing feeling even though it can get somewhat hectic at times like if you have 4 balls that are all small and fast and there's a ton of cubes on the map.\nThis is a game that you could theoretically just play for a level or two in a session, though I have problems doing that because I keep just wanting to play "one more level".\nI highly recommend this game, especially considering it doesn't even cost a dollar.","September 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Grey Cubes has an interesting, minimalistic UI and little by way of explanation, but everything is easy to figure out the effects of. The levels had some unique mechanics I haven't personally encountered in these games before, but after a while many of the levels seemed to be just repeats of previous levels with a slight variation, and eventually got a bit stale as a result. I think the limited color palette lent itself to that feeling of sameness after some time, and while I was entertained enough to make it through one playthrough, getting 100% of the achievements will require a second playthrough, something I'm not sure I'm up for. Still, for fans of the genre, it's worth a play and I'd still recommend it.","April 16","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Welcome to Grey Cubes. Every. Single. Stage.\n\nDo you want the block that takes a hundred hits or the one that takes a thousand? Everytime you enter a stage, you know it's gonna be a chore. You know you'll spend minutes in it not because of the difficulty (it's super easy) but because nothing will break easily, and the ball won't even gain speed. Yep. That feeling of satisfaction when you clear a stage fast because you can handle the ball at high speed? That's not happening here. I'm pretty sure that the achievement you get for beating a stage under 30s is impossible on the large majority of stages. Wasn't even easy on stage 1.\n\nThey took a decent concept and they sucked the life out of it. There was colors? Now everything is white and blue. Your ball is a big white bright ball that is often hard to see when there's white bright explosions. Or when it's hidden by a big-♥♥♥ powerup that takes half of the screen. Or because it's hidden by one of the pillars in the stage that covers the entire height. You can't even see your platform because of those pillars sometimes.\n\nReal-time physics? As in real-time getting stuck in an endless loop until you can use the magnet?\n\nOh and at the start of a stage (or when you lose a ball) you shoot vertically by default. What the hell is wrong with you people? The default aim should be diagonally so you can reach any spot by bouncing on a wall if needed. Thanks to your vertical choice, it's a shot for nothing in tons of stages or situations.\n\n+ it's cheap\n\n- boring looking\n- every stage takes a billion hits to complete\n- no missiles (arkanoid) or anything that can really speed things up a bit or at least spice up the gameplay\n- ball doesn't gain speed, slow ♥♥♥ movement from beginning to end\n- broken physics\n- tedious, tedious, TEDIOUS\n- no sense of satisfaction as it's always about time and not skill\n- regularly can't see the ball, sometimes can't even see the platform\n- stages with horizontal scrolling are nausea inducing\n- "minimalistic" annoying menu\n- can't change the resolution of the game (seriously in 2015?)\n- can't change the volume, it's on or off (seriously in 2015?)\n- magnet aims at things behind walls\n- initial shot is vertical (this one actually pisses me off)\n- tons of mechanics that make the stages even more annoying\n- this game hates you\n\nIt's overkill to bash a game that cheap but god it drained my soul.

They can also get knocked quite close to the paddle which makes things more difficult. The pick-ups are very large and the negative ones are attracted to your paddle, which makes them all but impossible to avoid a lot of the time.\n\nThe worst problem is that the mouse speed is off the charts and there is no way to adjust it. You might be able to get used to it. If you are going to become a surgeon it's great fine motor control practice. I found it a bit easier to use my touchpad, but you're probably going to want to adjust your mouse speed to play this game which is a bit of a pain in the butt.\n\n5/10 Overall\n\nLooks good, sounds good, plays just okay, which isn't very good for a breakout clone. If you love the genre (if you can call it that) than it's worth playing this game, but there are better breakout games out there despite the interesting use of 3D.","June 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

It's beautiful, challenging, and a bit relaxing. The game itself is physics-based, where your ball does a certain amount of damage to the many different sized blocks while also causing them to slide around based in a very "conservation of momentum" kind of way. The bigger the  blocks, the less they'll move and the more hits they'll take. Along the way there are many power-ups to help, power-"downs" to hurt, and a ton of unique arenas with their own challenges and obstacles like warping portals, pinball-like bumpers, exploding blocks, and simple mechanisms. Very enjoyable.","December 21, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The power-ups are also nice. Unfortunately, this game suffers from some of the worst aspects of this genre. When the stage gets low on pieces, you play the game of trying to hit small targets in a large empty space, so most of the time you spend just watching the ball. Similarly, on some later stages, there are walls or colums that are used to segment the level, Some you can hit to move, but you can't destroy them nor do you get points for them. So often you're hitting obstacles and are rewarded with nothing but removing the obstacle temporarily. No score. No power up. No multiplier increase. Just hitting the most boring blocks. Over and over. And it seems the developer thought that this is a good foundation for a challenge as the later levels are often designed with these in mind. Then they throw in portals which serves in no way to contribute fun to the game. I understand it's for the sake of challenge, but were any of these mechanics play tested? Because they're boring to the point of putting the player to sleep.\n\nIt's really too bad because there's so much here to like. But by the time you get into the 40s, the levels feel more like a boring grind than the fun it was earlier. Combined with some lackluster graphics and ho hum music, the game falls just a little short of what I'd recommend. 5/10","December 2, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, one bucket contains the good ideas, and one, equally large bucket contains the bad ideas.\nSince good and bad ideas in a game like this are mostly subjective, it's probably not worth starting to list and weigh them in a short review, it's much better to see them for ourselves - the creators of the game make it very easy by setting the price to 1 USD / 1 EUR. It would be difficult to recommend the game at 10 EUR, and at odds at 5 EUR - for only 1, it's a no-brainer.

The only reason I am not recommending it because achievements stats keeps resetting. e.g. We have a achievement hit the ball 5000 times. After completing every level they show your achievements progress. I completed 14 levels, hitted the ball 496 times. I closed the game, after a while when I opened it again it started counting my achievement progress again from 0.

It's very chill.  A very gentle difficulty curve.  I like it's trance-synth soundtrack.  It's you're basic Breakout clone with a twist.  The ball uses the standard 2D physics the game has always had, but the bricks use 3D physics.  Larger bricks are heavier, smaller bricks are lighter.  The bricks can also be stacked vertically.  The game has falling Arkanoid-style power-ups and power-downs that you can catch.  The game also has a magnet feature that makes the ball draw towards the bricks for a few seconds.  Trigger this while you have the electrical power-up for effective brick-busting!\n\nPROS:\n+ Chill, enjoyable casual arcade gameplay\n+ Clean, visually-pleasing graphics aesthetic with ray-traced shadows\n+ Score multiplier rewards those who can clear levels with speed\n+ Arkanoid-style Upgrades / Downgrades to catch or avoid\n+ Excellent value!\n\nCONS:\n- No Arkanoid laser gun upgrade.  Darnit.\n- Mouse control doesn't work correctly when my flight stick is plugged in.\n- Shows you multiple achievement progress reports after every level.  Minor annoyance.\n- Only one graphics option\n- Ambient occlusion combined with the existing ray traced graphics would have looked really sweet.\n- No multiplayer\n\nAnyone who has enjoyed simpler arcade games of the past should get this because the price is ONE DOLLAR!  This is a no-brainer!  Fun, relaxing little game with an excellent value.  Support this developer!","September 24, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics look simple but nice and (unlike some other breakout games) effects are not too flashy so you don't lose track of the ball very often. Also, very nice ambient music.\nI have one big complaint: Half of the achievements is broken. Their counters reset each gaming session so it's extremely hard to obtain them unless you finish the whole game in one sitting. It's been three months since the release and it's still not fixed and the developers remain silent. I'm really unhappy about this, it almost made me give the game a negative review.","August 22, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
