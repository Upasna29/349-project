There's nothing to lose! I could really see this game become a top-strategy game with enough time. Galcon 2 is a free-to-play game that truly deserves to be called free-to-play. The game is quick to learn, with a helpful tutorial right off the bat. The strategy aspect is cleraly evident and this game is 100% skill-based. I'm hooked to this game and, if you don't mind.

No matter if you're looking for something to play for a couple minutes to pass the time, or you want an RTS that you can really dig into and master Galcon 2 is for you.\n\nActual review: Alright, I may as well throw a review out there for Galcon 2. Long story short I've been playing different versions of Galcon since mid 2008. I've always loved real-time strategy games, and Galcon (being the very core of what makes them great) hooked me instantly. Galcon takes the idea of an RTS and condenses it into it's purist form. No spending the first 5-10 minutes building up your base, scouting the enemy, making sure you build the right units to counter your opponent. You have planets that generate ships, those ships can be sent to attack other planets to generate more ships or left to defend your planets. Now add 8 or so other people and you get an action packed fast paced arcade style RTS.\n\nThe game is super easy to learn, there's a tutorial, single-player bots with a wide range of difficulty levels, and even a co-op mode to play with your friends against bots. Once you've got the hang of it, multiplayer is a whole new world. Galcon 2 is the very definition of easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nTo top it all off, this version is totally free. The only micro-transactions are cosmetic, running a tournament, or running your own server which you really only need if you want to run mods (did I mention the game is modable?). You don't need to pay a penny to get the full experience, plus you can earn the in-game currency over time (but I'm not going to dive into that system here).\n\nThe community around this game is also dedicated and nice, there's always someone willing to help teach you if you'd like to learn more, just visit the forums and ask.\n\nAnyway, I'm absolutely biased, like I said I've been playing versions of this game for 5 or 6 years now. I also currently help moderate the forums, and have admined past versions of the game. But I've only stuck around this long because I really do love the game and it's community.\n\nIf you've ever got any questions about the game, want help getting better, or just a friendly face to play some rounds with, feel free to message me (Chi-Ro) on the website and I'll be happy to help!\n\nhttps://www.galcon.com/forums/msg.php?action=compose","December 12, 2014","true","73.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RA2lover/recommended/294160/","RA2lover","RA2lover","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RA2lover/","131 products in account","Galcon is an EXTREMELY fast-paced RTS game. In fact, most Galcon matches take less than a minute to be decided. However, due to its learning curve(plus game-specific quirks), new players will lose matches very quickly, very often.\n\nThe game supports microtransactions, but they only include cosmetic items(and it's possible to earn premium currency by winning tournaments, bets or by being given them by other players as a "good game" reward). However, time played still plays a massive role in how likely a player is to win matches, partly because of skill differences, partly because of an upgrade system based on gameplay frequency allowing players to receive more units at a match's start or produce/move them faster. New players get the advantage of being able to see how many forces opponents have, but this isn't very useful as more skilled players tend to not send all of their ships at once to an enemy planet, can produce enough ships to stop the attack, or send in reinforcements to that planet before your ships arrive to attack it.\n\nThe upgrade system uses diminishing returns for match rewards as an anti-poopsocking mechanic similar to CSGO's weekly XP boost/reduction, but with a continuous reset. A player playing for 15 minutes 2~3 times a day is going to get as many points as someone playing continuously, disincentivizing grinding. As such, it's possible to get a sufficiently competitive upgrade level by playing the game casually for 1~2 weeks.","January 9","true","15.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Learning curve can be a bit steep, but it's really rewarding once you get the hang of it.\n\nGalcon 2 brings (slightly) improved graphics and, most importantly, an already larger player base. This means way less waiting time compared to Galcon Fusion.\n\nMy one complaint is the F2P structure of the game. I do not like that in order to change your color in-game, or to setup a custom map, you need to spend in-game currency. Initially you have to buy currency, but afterwards it is possible to have your "investment" grow through the betting system. So in theory, if you're good at it, you could just pay once, and then just slowly build your fortune of in-game currency. But still, I would much rather just pay once and own the game and all features.\n\nOverall though, still an awesome game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagablade/recommended/294160/","shagablade","Peter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagablade/","35 products in account","Galcon 2 is the RTS genre boiled to its core. Its simplicity is really the only thing that makes this game great.\n\ntl;dr RTS fans should try, improved from previous game, can get quite repetitive\n\nI played a lot of Galcon Fusion (this game's predecessor) where there are only 2 popular modes: Classic and Teams. Classic is a free for all, which means the last man standing wins. Games often take longer than they should, and the inevitable fact is that camping is usually the best strategy. Some rounds can even last over an hour, and for a game like this, that's far too long. On the other hand, Teams games are extremely brief and therefore more engaging, but it can often feel more like a "clicking competition" than a game of tactics.\n\nThankfully, Galcon 2 added several new modes, including King of the Hill which is my personal favorite (it combines the strategy/independence of Classic with the intensity/speed of Teams). The new modes are definitely the greatest feature, but there's some other new things too. Betting and tournaments both raise the stakes and keep things interesting for advanced players, although clan wars are unnecessary and really don't work well with this kind of game. Almost like the developer said "Clan wars sound cool... idk, might as well try it!" That doesn't matter though, you can just play the actual game!\n\nSo it's a great game, but you have to realize that it's both free to play and limited in its features. Don't expect countless hours out of it, and don't expect you won't get bored of it... but definitely try it. Fun to play once in a while.","October 27, 2015","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is the best Galcon yet.  It is a unified version that pits iOS, Android and Steam players all in a single lobby so the full experience is present in every version be it portable or not.  Additional game modes, clans and tournaments are nice, but what I've noticed is that a single tweak has completely removed the long stalemates between two stubborn Grand Admirals.  An extended peace leads to a revolt to the largest player, meaning that the game actively encourages the largest player to end the game quickly.","December 10, 2014","true","191.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's free and a small download so I won't waste your time talking about the intracies of a game that appears to be so simple on the surface.

I'm not exaggerating, it is so lightning quick and easy. Finally, I want to bring to your attention that the Free to Play model of this game is one of the best implementations in gaming.

In my opinion the game is simple, and the most important thing to master is speed and timing. The objective is to move your ships from one planet to another capturing as many as you can, each planet produces more ships. To win you must capture all of the enemys planets. Galco 2 is multiplayer free to play. so there is no harm in trying it! the game is pretty small, so if you want a game that takes up little space, or has low requirments, this is also a good bet!","December 12, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The spaceships in “Galcon 2” are the most realistic physical depictions of spaceships in a video game to date. The amount of technology available overwhelms the player.\n\nFREE GAME! Honestly, this should be priced at $60, maybe even more.\n\nThe combat: It is amazing, you have high-detail next gen spaceships at your disposal, ready to attack enemy planets. There are so many different colors you can be, every time I am a new color, I feel like I am being born again, there is so much variety in the colors and the way they attack.\n\nMultiplayer: With internet getting about 4kb/s, I feared I wouldn't be able to play online, boy was I wrong. For the first time, I was able to play an online game without lag. I played with my friends and we worked together to conquer the planets. There are so many different gamemodes to pick from, I felt overwhelmed.\n\nSoundtrack: The music in this makes me want to get up and dance in the middle of my game. The song is constantly stuck in my head all day, but I actually like having this song in my head.\n\nExtras:\n+While playing the game there are neutral planets, all of these have clever, realistic names to them, adding more atmosphere to the game.\n\n+I just can't stop talking about the graphics, I literally fell backwards when I first opened the game, I felt as if I was actually in space.\n\n+Online, with eight people playing simultaneously, it's hard to even put into words. There's just so much happening at once, so fast, without any lag too.\n\nGalcon 2 might be the craziest, most intense video game experience I've had in years, but it's also amazing. With stunning graphics, beautiful music, intense, fast paced battles, and so much variety, I couldn't think of one way to improve this game.\n\nFinal Score: 11/10 - Best game I have ever played in my life. Game of the century. I would be shocked if I managed to find a game better than this.\n\n\n\n\n","January 16, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","43","3","7","6","0"

Its simple, yet comlicated, like a game of checkers, but lacks any sort of charm. It needs to take its self a little more serious.

Currently the blatant false advertising of games is getting anoying now they are on the free market with direct lies about their product.  Personally the massively RNG based portion of this game out weighs any strategy that you can come up with, not only is this hostile to the new players but it means that like most action movies you cannot plan ahead until your Luck shows up.

PLAY THIS GAME.\n\nFull review - After playing Galcon since I first found it back in the days of Instant Action, I've loved it and it's great to see that Hassey's kickstarter for Galcon2 succeeded and allowed us the constant and renewed enjoyment of this fantastic game. Believe it or not, triangle warfare takes some serious strategy and bodes an insane addiction. The game is easy to get into, has great tutorials, and an awesome community (on the whole, there's always some arrogant beansprout somewhere insulting everyone because he's the best player 2k17, but in what game does he/she not exist). You'll find yourself with a rapid boot time, a slick and easy to use interface (due to the game being multiplatform - which also adds an even greater community) and a quick but fully informative tutorial. From there you can join any game of any of the modes you choose. You start at the lowest rank, and games you join will show the average rank of the players in that game, which really helps you navigate to a game of your skill level.

The object of the game is to take over planets in a small galaxy. It may sound easy as it is being said but the trategy element is high. while you collecting planets someone else may swoop in while your weak and undefended. The games usually go for around 2 minutes - 5 minutes and by the end it will be at least 1000 troops vs 1000 troops. And adding to that some more the largest game i had was 7 people so we ended having huge wars over a planet in the middle.\n\nI have to say it is also one of the most addicting games to play as when you get on you will struggle to get off of it and it is only a small download so go wild about downloading it.\n\nConcerns?\nyes i have a concern about the game that brings this review down quite a bit. Ingame currency. im not complaining about the small things like different planets and being a colour becaue the devs need to have support but my biggest concern was that you have to pay to be in a clan.\n\nI am very dissapointed at this since i am in one my self and i dont fancy wasting some money on creating a clan where me and a couple of friend and people can go in and have fun together.\n\nThe next thing that i dont like is that i couldnt fine a feature to invite friends to a game. This was strange aat first but my friend managed to join my first go so invites would be nice.\n\nI have to say that this is still a great game although it's set backs.\n\noverall score i would give a 8/10\n\nGameplay is very addicting and fun but the in game currency and no invite option set it back alot.","December 9, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really liked BBS mode in the original, and found the clicking method far more difficult and not really ... as cool.\n\n\nIt needed multiplayer for me to adopt the clicking style.\n\n\nThis is incredibly cool multiplayer mayhem where you gain ships from owning planets (the numbers indicate how fast ships are generated) and then you can send the ships to other planets to take them over.  Insert increasingly difficult bots for co-op play; team versus play; and tournaments run by people who have formed clans.

There is no pay to win and all artificial  currency is used for cosmetics and running a coustom server, another plus if your willing to spend money.\nGalcon is a simple easy to lean game, and is a quick download so check it out!","December 8, 2014","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's super small maybe only 500Mb so it wont take up any space.\n4. Any system can run this it has almost no requirements and is not intensive even during the largest of battles.\n5. I enjoy this game even when I am losing constantly.\n6. The practice and training mode in the beginning will teach you the fundamentals well and allow you to jump straight into the game and start having a blast.\n7. Multiple game types mix up the game and change the dynamics greatly team battles etc are awesome and so are all the other game types.\n\nCONS:\n1. There is currently a slightly low population in this game (however i would like to mention this does not prevent you from getting into matches by any means people are always joining and leaving).\n2. In order to create custom rooms where you can earn in game cash you have to pay a small fee of $5 a month or there are some other small micro transaction fees.(this does not affect gameplay however).\n\n\nOVERALL\n\nI would recommend this game if nothing more give it a try for an hour if you dont like it then its probably not for you.\nI say one hour because in that time you can probably run about 40 games some are under 3min long depending on the game type you are playing as there are multiple game types.","December 11, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a highly strategic game that requires quick thinking, fast reaction time, and a little bit of luck. Galcon 2 is that and now it's bigger and better than before. The F2P model has allowed more people to join in the action, and still not give anyone an advantage in-game for spending money on it. The new modes are exciting, such as the Co-Op bot games, allowing players to fight computer opponents on increasingly harder difficulties. Also, the custom matches allow for more drastic changes to gameplay. Match-making in team games is balanced out to where players won't play uneven games, which was a huge problem in Galcon Fusion. There're plenty of other features included in this game that haven't been seen in previous Galcon games. Download it and give it a whirl, it'll be worth your time.\n\nRecommended 11/10","December 13, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Except now it is free.\n\nFor those that don't know old galcon - a simple space battle, where you conquer planets with fleet of your ships. No upgrades, no ship development, none of the complicated stuff. Just an initial fleet for all players and bunch of neutral planets on the field. Battle usually lasts few minutes, then you can just start a new game. Nice simple game for occasional battles :)","January 5, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get passed the learning curve and start playing for real! Strategy is key! 70 hours in two weeks, got addicted quick. Just need my re-up a few times a week now. Clan matches would throw a few more hours on. Oh its free. I never bought a coin pack and aquired 1,500 galcoins. No reason to spend real money.

PLAY THIS GAME.\n\nFull review - After playing Galcon since I first found it back in the days of Instant Action, I've loved it and it's great to see that Hassey's kickstarter for Galcon2 succeeded and allowed us the constant and renewed enjoyment of this fantastic game. Believe it or not, triangle warfare takes some serious strategy and bodes an insane addiction. The game is easy to get into, has great tutorials, and an awesome community (on the whole, there's always some arrogant beansprout somewhere insulting everyone because he's the best player 2k17, but in what game does he/she not exist). You'll find yourself with a rapid boot time, a slick and easy to use interface (due to the game being multiplatform - which also adds an even greater community) and a quick but fully informative tutorial. From there you can join any game of any of the modes you choose. You start at the lowest rank, and games you join will show the average rank of the players in that game, which really helps you navigate to a game of your skill level. From there your addiction to Galcon will ensue. You'll rank up, meet new friends and battle new enemies - and if you decide to join a clan, you'll find yourself enjoying the game even more.","January 6, 2015","true","79.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The object of the game is to take over planets in a small galaxy. It may sound easy as it is being said but the trategy element is high. while you collecting planets someone else may swoop in while your weak and undefended. The games usually go for around 2 minutes - 5 minutes and by the end it will be at least 1000 troops vs 1000 troops. And adding to that some more the largest game i had was 7 people so we ended having huge wars over a planet in the middle.\n\nI have to say it is also one of the most addicting games to play as when you get on you will struggle to get off of it and it is only a small download so go wild about downloading it.\n\nConcerns?\nyes i have a concern about the game that brings this review down quite a bit. Ingame currency. im not complaining about the small things like different planets and being a colour becaue the devs need to have support but my biggest concern was that you have to pay to be in a clan.\n\nI am very dissapointed at this since i am in one my self and i dont fancy wasting some money on creating a clan where me and a couple of friend and people can go in and have fun together.\n\nThe next thing that i dont like is that i couldnt fine a feature to invite friends to a game. This was strange aat first but my friend managed to join my first go so invites would be nice.\n\nI have to say that this is still a great game although it's set backs.\n\noverall score i would give a 8/10\n\nGameplay is very addicting and fun but the in game currency and no invite option set it back alot.","December 9, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If i were you i would be makeing it more like phage wars and allowing people to customize youre  nano bots or what ever they are in perfecting a certain area if you want speed or strgenth or numbers or attack defence with low production or have the game have its own set of nano bots you can use which i dont mind as well as you put what some one would like to mess around with if it has speed to movement or strong defence or both  or main defence with speed to go back to a defending cell that is outnumberd because youre defence or be a balanced in the middle of all or try to infect the most cells as possible and try to overwhelm youre foes or use strgenth tactis and break into new cells or use speed reproduction strength starting amount of nano bots or defence so things to add would be custom nano bots and i will play it a better quick match system and with nano bots i can make and i woudl like to be able to just play and not mess with upgrades unless its single player. but in multi player you need more maps new things added and im not gouing to say any more if you cant think an be creative but right now the game sucks. Its one way thinking like a shooting game with 1 gun and no grenades or anything else but objective to kill them and not being allowed to play with friends or do a quick match or customise anything its a one way i am the best at killing you game with a little strategy but not much...and if youre worried about my spelling this game is for you because youre just like it.","May 16, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When i first happened upon this game i thought it was just your basic little flash game copy... Well it is a hell of a lot deeper than that! Theres a bloody galactic map and factions and bunch of other general mishmash that is extremely uncomon for this genre. The base gameplay is that of a better than average cheap flash rts. But the community (Still somewhat small) is quite nice. This is game that is mostly played by people with ipads nd phones... BUT for a app store game gone steam its not bad at all. Altough i do admit it is more challenging to play with a mouse than touchscreen.  All in all i would recommend this game.\n\n(Played 2 hours as of this comment)","April 18","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
