I'm pleased to say Eterium is not one of those and is a fun game which holds your interest long enough to get through the campaign, which would probably take up at least 8 hours of your time if you go through all the pilot dialogue's in between missions.\n\nI was disappointed that I could not name my pilot, given that all dialogue is text based, they attempt to flesh out our character with a back story and is far from a silent protagonist.  I was also surprised to see that you could not gain rank, after being demoted early on in the game I expected a way to actually recover and improve upon my rank during the campaign.  I also found it hard to make my way up the kill board, may be my piloting skills were just not up to scratch and found myself consistently sitting at the bottom of the rankings.\n\nEterium supports Joystick, Xbox 360 Pad, and keyboard and mouse controls.  I played with the 360 pad and found that all controls needed to play where accessible solely through the pad's buttons.  The default layout worked well with the exception of the afterburner key, which to pop some enemies required you to after burn and fire at the same time and felt cumbersome - I'd recommend you reassign you afterburner key, which thankfully you can do.  Controlling your ship with the pad is easy and some space vets will be pleased to know you can roll your ship.\n\nIf you have played Wing Commander 1, then it's a similar experience to how the game plays out.  Before and in between missions you can go around the ship (between the bar and flight deck) where you can talk to some of the other pilots and crew which play out the story.  You are given a fairly generic briefing each time you fly out, in a similar style to the Wing Commander: Prophecy briefing screen and are able to choose the load out for your ship before heading out.\n\nThere is Newtonian style physics at play.  Fly forward at full speed, change direction and it will take several seconds for your ship to fly on the new intended course.  This makes flying asteroid and mine fields a little challenging at times, which break up the: Fly to Nav. point, kill anything that moves, move to next; though they are not particularly exciting to fly though.  You must be careful with mine fields as if you get hit the explosion force will change your trajectory and could push you in to another mine.  Thankfully, they are easier to navigate than those found in Wing Commander!\n\nCombat can be annoying early on when you are in the weaker starter ships and requires some practice to get the hand of lining up your guns to take out the enemy.   Enemies are always faster than you, especially the light fighters (S'tra) which zip by before you can score enough hits to pop them.  Thankfully they can be countered, wait till they attack then break off, on the break turn to face them and hit the afterburners, then blast them with your guns, as they generally fly straight for several seconds before re-engaging.  If you don't after burn they leave your guns range very quickly, leaving the only other choice of head-to-head conflict.  Missile's are more of the primary weapon hear, a bit like in aviation combat of today, which can either 1 hit kill lighter craft or soften up harder targets to be finished off with your main guns.\n\nTake hull damage and your ships systems will start to fail, ranging from guns to engines.  Your display screens will also shatter making it difficult or impossible to read them.  Your ship has a repair system, which will slowly repair systems to a point.  It does not appear to repair all damage, based on the overall damage amount, i.e. if you shield generator is damage by 26% if will only be repaired down to 20%.  Take too much damage and key systems will barely function as they cannot be repaired enough to keep them functional.\n\nThe graphics are pretty basic, you could argue Starlancer/Freelancer have better graphics than this game and ship designs are hardly inspiring.  Explosions appear generic and unexciting, mostly lots of smoke and no fireworks, and large ships disappear in a small explosion which disappoints when seen.\n\nCharacter art is done well, though only the one stance/pose is provided for each character making them come across emotionless when paired up with their dialogue.  It's anime but more western style than Japanese and feels a bit odd when they fit in backgrounds which have been pre-rendered in 3D.\n\nSound effects are plenty from your engines burning to the overzealous eject warning alarm.  There is a dynamic music track, just like in Wing Commander, which changes based on events during flight.  This varies based on enemies present, a friendly taking damage or returning from a successful mission.  I also have to say, that in all the time I played the game didn't crash once and there are no game breaking bugs either!\n\nOverall Eterium is a fun game and the worth picking up.  The 8+ hours from the main campaign full justifies its price tag and is a well put together game.  If the idea or reading lot's of dialogue does not appeal to you, skip it and jump straight in to the briefings, or just practice your skills in the simulator.  Highly recommended if you enjoy similar games, otherwise try the demo first.","April 18, 2014","true","18.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

A quick (and generally disappointing) search through steam and Eterium came up. I wasn't totally convinced but decided to gamble the ~$15 and am glad I did.\n\nRight away controller support is excellent. With my Joystick and Throttle in storage I hooked up the xbox-esque controller and it recognized it right away and mapped out the crucial controls in a well thought out and useful manner. For saving me the time of figuring out important controls and experimenting with mapping them that's a major +1. This being said this game deserves to be used with joystick and throttle (and oculus!) and I can't wait to try it again with those.\n\nOkay, so the simple graphics that make the interludes between missions is excessively basic and the story is pretty "blah" but the game picks up as soon as you're ready to fly. I love the fact they've included launch and recovery to be handflown. Okay, well, you can't really screw it up but the fact it's even there is great.\n\nCombat is simple but addictive and so far the two different fighters I've used have distinctly different fighting styles and handling. The interface (while cartoony) is a throwback to Wing Commander and does it wonderfully, allowing for easy weapon selection and giving you the right amount of information that keeps your eyes moving around but not excessively so.\n\nIs this the next great space flight sim? No, but it is highly entertaining and there is a lot of promise here and I can only hope they build and expand upon what they're offering now in the future. If you've got a spare $20 and loved TIE Fighter or Wing Commander you owe it to yourself to fire this one up.","November 18, 2014","true","2.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The influence of Wing Commander is apparent from the get go with things such as speaking to crew members between missions, carrier landings, mission types etc.\n\nFor fans of Wing Commander, WC Saga, Diaspora, Freespace, X-Wing/Tie Fighter or space sims in general there is a lot to enjoy here.  Functionally the game works very similar to those older classics in both controls and mission design.\n\nGameplay wise it is a solid sim with enough depth to keep it interesting without being overly complex or simple.  You will fly a variety of craft each that feels and handles differently and be able to play around with various weapon loadouts.  The dev's have included blackouts and redouts here when you perform heavy manuvers and I like this addition.  Also your pilot's head sways when you turn which I think is a lovely touch.\n\nAnother excellent feature is that when you are escorting vessels the hud no only displays the vessel you are to protect but also highlights enemies that are attacking that target with a difference colour on the radar.  This makes escort missions MUCH easier to handle and takes away alot of the frustation.  Combine that with the easy Wingman controls allows you to respond to changing battlefield conditions very rapidly and allows you to focus fire on particular threats.\n\nYour craft is a lot more "squishy" than in many games.  This takes some adjusting to much makes the dogfights much more intense and rewarding.\n\nThis was the easiest game to setup my T.Hotas X for, the setup screen in the laucher is very helpful and you can see what imputs do what allowing you to quickly setup a control scheme that works for you.\n\nGraphically the game is decent with a slight cartoonish feel yet this lends itself to the vibe of the game.  Considering this was a part time project by a 3 man developement team I think the graphics are perfectly acceptable and the handling of the craft feels responsive and unique to each vessel you fly.\n\nThe AI is good, acting intelligently and scale up as does the difficulty.  Your own wingmen work well and depending on the skill can be a major asset in battle, unlike some games where they are more of a hinderance than a help.\n\nOut of the cockpit your home base and comrades are rendered in 2D, with the characters displaying clear eastern influences.  When at base you can navigate to different areas and speak to different crewmen similar to Wing Commander.\n\nThere is no dialogue in the game, everything is written in text.  While this is fine for out of combat socialising, in combat it makes it harder to determine messages during the heat of combat.\n\nStorywise the game is ok but it throws alot of characters at you very quickly making things more confusing than they need to be, especially since some of them you appear to have a history with.  Given the fact that the characters are practically thrown in your face it makes it harder to get to like them.  I believe the game would have been better served providing a smaller, more flesh out cast but that is perhaps down to personal opinion.\n\nI also do not like that you are given virtually zero backstory before being thrown into the main story.  Combine this with the fact your character seems to have history within the way, where he serves and with certain other characters makes things more confusing than they need to be.  An intro story, perhaps in the manual or somewhere giving some insight into the story, who you are fighting and why would be appreciated.\n\nThe story and dialogue is ok without standing out.  Cookie cutter but enough to keep you engaged and in your cockpit.\n\nMusic is ok, does the job.\n\nOverall I find Eterium to be a solid sim especially given it's three man dev crew who made it as a side project.  That being said, Eterium holds up well in it's own right.  It is not a big budget game but handles well, is fun to fly and is available at a modest budget.\n\nI would recommend this to anybody who enjoys space flight sims.\n\nScore: 7.5/10","September 2, 2014","true","0.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Four missions in, this game's made a pretty good impression on me.  Haven't got much backstory yet, as to who the enemy is and why we're fighting them, and the bits of information you get from the other pilots in the lounge and hangar (at least, so far) haven't shed too much light on it.  As far as the actual combat goes, the fighters strike me as a little more fragile than you might be used to from other games, which adds a fair bit of intensity to the fighting.  The feature of your targeting system being able to tell which enemies are attacking you and which are attacking the ship you're escorting is very nice, and makes the dreaded escort missions a little less horrible.\n\nIf you grew up playing old school space sims like I did, you're probably going to like this.","April 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlinkRape/recommended/280200/","BlinkRape","Blink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlinkRape/","402 products in account","Overall, Eterium was a pretty fun game to play.  It definitely nails a lot of its design goals to bring back the feel of Space Combat games from the 90's and while some aspects of the game are off-putting to some (The horribly stock/generated looking Anime art) I don't think it really detracts from the overall experience;  unless you personally have a stick up your ♥♥♥.\n\nThe combat is fast paced and exciting,  and with the multitude of control options now available, people really have no excuse not to give the game a try.  It can feel a little "stiff" at times,  and it does seem like no matter what craft you fly, you might as well not have shields at all compared to the enemies, but it makes it all the more sweeter when you score that final kill to complete a mission in a banged up ship that is 1 hit away from exploding.\n\nThe story overall is certainly not unique in that it has been told countless times before, in many different forms,  but I still think the story is passable and has some very interesting moments - this despite the bland and generic  conversations between characters.   My only real let down was that near the end the story wraps up too quickly,  almost unexpectedly.   They really could have gotten another 5 or 10 missions out of the final story-arc and it would have been great to see that fleshed out more.\n\nFor what the game costs, and what its stated goals are, I think the product delivers on every level.   Wait for a sale if you must, but do not neglect this game if you are longing for that 90's  space combat experience.","May 3, 2014","true","16.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I dont mind so much out of mission, but during one it could really add to the atmosphere and such. (IE: When I failed to protect a friendly carrier).\n\nSound otherwise in general is relatively good, its not AAA quality but who expects it too be? For the size of the team the sound effects are very good and manage to uphold a good feeling of being in a starfighter.\n\nThe game seems quite difficult so far, not overly impossible on Veteran which is good. However I recommend using an Xbox 360 controller or Joystick to get the best out of the game. In otherwords, it holds true to the quota set by X-wing games and Wing commander, forcing you too think and play strategically. I found that combat was a careful balance between matching the enemies speed, and making sure I didn't overshoot them, and then quickly increasing speed to evade enemy attacks behind me. This kind of careful combat where I had to keep tabs on how I was flying was a lot of fun and kept me thinking most of the time.\n\nThis game has a similar control scheme to X-wing most certainly, however as with the sound it misses a few things in the sense that you can't rotate shield power from the rear half to the front etc, and full energy management (IE: To the engines, to the shields and guns) ALA X-wing would make it brilliant, this being said it might be the case that this would overly complicate the game. I'm unsure, however it certainly isn't gamebreaking but is definately a feature on my wishlist.\n\n\nThe HUD system, is pretty well thought out. The Radar is simplistic, easy to use and efficient. It doesn't confuse me like some games do, and doesn't throw a thousand things at once all at me. The usage of targeting computers on the right, and status computers on the left are pretty cool too. I like having to flick through the different subsystems to see how much damage I've sustained, or how many missiles I have left or shields etc etc. The right hand side Targeting computer/Nav information is nice too, showing enemy shield status and if I'm not in combat, the distance to a nearby navigation beacon.\n\n\nThe graphics in general, are pretty as well. You don't have that Battlefield Sun glare, or Star Citizen Polygon count true,  but the anime art style is enjoyable and the ships themselves look pretty damn fly (Pun intended).  It has a certain charming nature about it, and graphically superior to a lotta indie games out there. Especially once you get into space.\n\n\nStory wise, I find the characters somewhat forgettable, however I Kinda did skip a lot of cutscenes as I didn't want to spoil it (I was streaming during this initial playthrough). I'll be re-approaching it, and reading all of the writing next time however i feel its fully playable without having to do that.  That being said, the overall feel of the game makes it clear that gameplay is the main focus, and damn is it good!\n\nBugwise and optimization...well...It runs beautifully, no lag even when streaming with all graphics turned right up but there are quite a few WTF bug at the moment. I'm sure the dev team will fix them though. The biggest and most noticeable one being that asteroids where not appearing for me. Total mind♥♥♥♥ed as it happened on my first playthrough. This is kinda chafing and for some may be gamebreaking. Although it was resolved when I rebooted the game.\n\nIn conclusion, if you miss X-wing and Wing commander, feel that sometimes the X3 series is too tiring and stressful with all its economy stuff, (Even if its a good game) and wished for a spacesim with a campaign and combat focus? Then this is the game for you\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, This game is pretty enjoyable, missing a few potential improvements but in no way missing the mark it intends to hit!

The space battles remind me very much of very good space combat (arcade style) simulators. like from Starwars Xwing, Tiefighter, Starlancer etc. The space missions just look superb. The sfx sounds (lasers, engines etc) are worth it. It is so much fun just to able to launched into space from a space battle ship carrier and fly towards unknown foes and battle it out in futuristic space ships. The models actually look acceptable nice. The game makers actually did a lot of good effort in making a nice cockpit view. It gives the player the nice suggestion of being actually in a cockpit in the thick of spacebattles. I just love that. Well done.\n\n\nOnly cons or critical remarks I can make is the game really laks large bombastic music and voice dialogues. Especially in the between scenes or cut scenes. So there is somekind awkward silence in those cutscenes. Music and dialogues is always difficult to make and it has to fit into the movies.\n\nI must add that the gamemakers tried to make somekind of story that fits the spacecombat to give it some extra content. That's a good idea I must say. Only they used pictures and text to tell the story. Perhaps if they used a moving character (puppet) like in Xwing and add some voice overs the game would have (to me at least) a more professional look. I only talk about the cutscenes and not the spacecombat. The space combat looks very good and superb. But voice overs require some good voice acting and will add to the extra costs of producing this game. Also this game lacks multiplayer features. So you wont be able to fly with your online mates in the same game.\n\nI have to add that I do realise that this game has a different budget then the big gaming companies like e.g. Lucas Arts Studios, Activision, EA etc. Despite the critical remarks I do like even love this game. It runs smooth and has joystick support. I could play this game very well with my Logitech 3D. I expect to fly more and more in this game and have some nice hours of spacecombat with this.\n\nVery very good and well done most definitely worh the money. I do hope the gamemakers will get the chance to produce more games like these in the future.

Pretty much every character and ship in the game seems to be an expy for something you might have encountered in adventures involving The Tiger's Claw, and the basic gameplay elements all seem to be the same.\n\nIn the same vein, you should be ready for some pretty challenging combat. A few good hits will do you in, so you can't be lazy. Part of the nostalgia baked into games like this is that they're rather less forgiving than modern titles, so the learning curve might be steeper than you're used to.\n\nA fair amount of challenge also lies in the controls. They're pretty tough to truly master if you're a keyboard and mouse pilot - maybe they're better with a joystick or gamepad, but I wouldn't know. Getting enough cannon hits to take down an enemy can be a bit of a project.\n\n"Eterium" is hardly original, but it seems to have been made with commendable care. If you like "Wing Commander," it's probably worth a try.","January 8, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

During flights you have to keep track of your wingmen, your flight carrier (if needed) enemies and several sub and weapon systems.\nThe controls are close to perfect,e specially with a good flight stick and small things like maximum permitted take-off velocity add to the atmosphere of this game.\n\nThe overal presentation feels a bit like a mix between manga and anime, due to the look of the characters, but that didn't bother me at all.\n\nSo, all is cool?\nNo, not all is cool.\n1) During combat I don't have time to read text messages from my fellow pilots. I'm tracking my target and not reading a novel. This goes for the entire game. SFX are good, but there's no speech throughout the entire game and that is a bit of a mood killer. It would add a lot to the atmosphere if you could get some radio chatter during combat or when you're reading through the various scenes that tell the story.\n\nBut, beside of that, Eterium does something that many modern space combat games fail to do..,it delivers the feeling of X-Wing, Wing Commander and Starlancer in its own and good way. Wanting for more if you're a fan of those kinds of games.","May 13, 2014","true","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You follow the contradiction, and you die.\nYou try to follow the mission briefing, you die.\nIt also fails to explain what buttons do what in any cogent fashion.\nBasically, needs a huge brushing up on the UI/hotkey choices.\nOr just give me afrigging manual so I can read what is supposed to do what and ignore the ♥♥♥♥ of a tutorial someone slopped together.","January 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
