And It's a damn shame I have to stomp it into the ground because during the estimated 1-2 years of work I expected this game to take before beginning to reach a finished state, the developers had a stroke of genius and decided that it would be a good idea to call this HEAVY ALPHA GAME a FULLY RELEASED TITLE after being on Steam for only 5-6 months. Doing so, Avalanche Studios have yet again showed the world that they do not give a damn about actually delivering a polished product to customers and fans alike and instead falsely advertise & release yet another unfinished glitch-fest onto Steam like a big, flaccid díck onto your dinner table, expecting a price-tag of 30€ for an experience you can expect out of a glitchy tech demo.\n\nI mean holy hell. They JUST spewed out a new dinosaur with this "release update".. AND IT HAS NO TESTING DONE TO IT WHATSOEVER. If you still insist on buying this garbage, kindly make note of the following issues the game currently has:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Animations for both dinosaurs and players are on a "Proof of Concept" level at most, and when combined with point 2, It makes for a disgusting game-play experience as far as immersion is concerned.\n\n2. The AI is absolutely atrocious. All dinosaurs can get extremely stuck on certain hills, get seizures or freeze up indefinitely if you decide to go up on a rock, the T-Rex can use you as a surf-board and stand ontop of you indefinitely without being able to attack if you go prone and have him not see and "aggro" you directly (Realistic, right?), The smallest of dinosaurs can take 10+ shotgun slugs to the head (and smash their skulls to thousand pieces) and still be alive & charge your person endlessly with no difficulty or signs of being stunned whatsoever, T-Rexes can with a 100% accuracy pinpoint your location If they hear you, say, walk at a steady pace 500 meters away, they WILL rush your location and insta-gib you unless you log out. Fun fun fun!\n\n3. The game has a disgusting lack of realism. Building on the previous statement of the dinosaurs having nonexistant AI in regards to stun or reactions overall, the game does not allow you to do VERY basic things like jumping while also having an absolutely broken "Hit-detection" system whereas you can know the exact angle and 3d space of say, a raptor's heart, shoot it with a shotgun slug.. And have the bullet either go through him completely, missing all organs or hit another bodypart. It's disgustingly random and sometimes, you can even get one-shot-kills without hitting any organs - and have no damage show up in the dino death re-cap window. There are also another giant design problem and that is the way that foilage works in this game. Dinosaurs do not say, leave grass bent or otherwise moved when they pass through it. It's like they're ghosts, so every time you chase or otherwise look for a dino where foilage is thick - you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT. EVEN IF YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT INFRONT OF YOU IN THE GRASS. It is one of these GIANT design issues that force you to avoid grassy areas all-together and it really brings light on how much of an alpha game this shít of a title really is.\n\n4. The game is very unoptimized. Most PC's struggle to run this game and while I didn't have any particular big problems myself, the forums speak for themselves though and following the numerous complaints I saw, I made a closer inspection and did infact see that my G-Card had a tendency to being extremely hot when playing.\n\n5. The developers do not take advice or read the forums. Ditto. It took them literally 3-4 months to notice a typo in the forum section called "Thoughts & Suggtesions" or something like that and that's just a depressing realization as there are literally hundreds of posts made - Not ONE of them has seen their ideas/suggestions been implemented into the game.\n\n6. There is legitimately no goal in this game. You roam around like an idiot (sometimes for a whole hour or more if you're unlucky), looking for dinosaurs with a shoddy bow and If you want to have different weapons, you HAVE TO <-- go to a pre-defined location and rummage through larger crates... Or die and go to the store that have rétárded level restrictions on all weapons & ammo that can sometimes require you to kill literally hundreds of dinos before having THE OPTION <-- to spend your own points to spawn with the gun you want next time you die. Crafting? End-game? Goals? Plot? Story? What's that?\n\n7. Sounds are downright broken and extremely confusing. Your own footsteps can make stomping noises with that of a T-Rex if you take small steps and listen carefully while certain raptors simply have no sounds to them at all except the standard "chop" attack bits while others have loud yelping calls, aggro noises, etc etc. While It certainly has jump-scared me a few times to get my buttocks suddenly chewed on by something that didn't make even the tiniest of noise, having some raptors suddenly become Batman in the Jungle while the rest are akin with that of howler monkeys is not a good as far as gameplay consistency is concerned.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAvoid this game and for the love of god, avoid the developers just as much. unless you enjoy being ripped off.","March 31, 2015","false","12.0"," 1,959 of 2,150 people (91%) found this review helpful 264 people found this review funny","91","959","2","264","53"

They'll only do that now when you're on low health so it's much better.\n\nThe game has improved since my last update, the triceratops now act like rhinos instead of deer which is much better.\n\n\n===UPDATE===\nThey've updated the birds and the game is once again enjoyable as long as you stay away from the volcano (where the birds spawn).\n\nBut I still stand by my comments about it not being a release spec game, this is still the quality of an early access game by far.\n\n========================================\n\nREVIEW ON FIRST DAY OF RELEASE:\n\nIn early access this game was brilliant. On release however, they added the new flying dino with a strange name which I can't remember...\n\nThe new species has ruined the balance of the game, it'd been added with little to no thought whatsoever. It's a rushed release. In it's current state, I would not buy the game. I won't be playing it in it's current state either. The game used to be challenging but enjoyable, now it's overly challenging with you dying 10 times an hour and eventually rage quitting with nothing enjoyable about it. I'd rather take on a T-Rex than the over powered birds. With a T-Rex, you can hear it, you can see it coming, you have a chance. These birds, you'll probably shoot it once it'll grab you and drop you from a height and you die and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nThere are still crashes, tons of glitches, this is no where near a "release spec" game.

There is a lot of potential. I however would not suggest it due to the fact that there is so little to do. You can kill a few dinosaurs and go on about your business. You'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a few times, because of the occasional spawn kill but it gets boring. Not a high enough loot drop ratio to make things entirely fair and/or  interesting. Once you kill some t-rex's and trikes everything is boring from my perspective. If you've been eye-balling this game like I was, just wait a while because, as of right now, it's not worth $30.

D':\n\n[EDIT3]: I would like to update this review to address some of the points brought up by some reviewers who have thumbed up this game:\n\n1) People who thumb down this game are little kids who just want call of duty can can't handle the difficulty of this game.\nMy response: Um, hello? Have you been playing this game?  It's seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easy now.  I have no idea what you are talking about.  Yes, things used to be very dangerous, you used to have to actually hunt, but now you can just run full speed through the forest and if anything comes at you all you have to do is step to the side or next to a rock and because of the crappy pathing you can just blow anything away COD stye.  Let me just say for those that have not yet bought this game, anyone who makes this argument has no idea what they are talking about.  I mean seriously, there's one guy on here with like 500 hours on this game saying that . . . 500 ♥♥♥♥ing hours . . . 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS IN A ♥♥♥♥ING HALF BAKED EARLY ACCESS WITH 5 ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS THAT PRETTY MUCH JUST RANDOMLY WALK AROUND!  500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS!!!! ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME?!?!  I PLAYED THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF SKYRIM WITH LIKE A BILLION CHARACTERS, WEAPONS, QUESTS, ETC. AND I COULD ONLY DO 300 HOURS AND YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥ING TELLING ME YOU PUT IN 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS WITH LIKE A FEW ♥♥♥♥ING  WEAPONS AND 5 ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS THAT ALMOST DO ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING.  This game is not ♥♥♥♥ing better than my beloved Skyrim.  Don't waste your money.\n\n2) Yeah they shouldn't have released this game and yeah they messed up on the release update but they are trying to fix it so everything will be ok.\nMy response: I think you are delusional. :p  They are trying to fix the update because they haven't gotten any money because of all the negative reviews.  That is the only reason they have responded.  So let me explain what's really going on.  This is a cash grab.  The developers are trying to pull a fast one on us by making this very flashy appearing game that we have all been desiring for a long time, make it barely playable, release it as a full game, and rake in the doe as people buy this game thinking its something it's not.  They know exactly what they are doing and there will be nothing further added on to the game once they make it playable again after those f****** birds.  Furethermore, even if they fix the game from the update that's not the problem, the problem is that they are trying to rip us off by trying to make this whole debacule ok.  Well it's not ok babe.  So for those who haven't bought this yet, don't waste your money.\n\nChasing the early access dragon never pays off; I swear I will never do early access again.\n\n[EDIT]:  I hope this is an April fools joke.\n\n[EDIT2]: Nope not an April fools joke. Also, this is not a pre-release review!\n\nI just don't understand, this game has so much potential, it is so awesome even when it was early access.  Why release it now when it clearly is alpha?\n\nSo let me go through some of the clear issues real fast:\n1) As another review said, they just released a new dinosaur. . . untested. . .\n2) The entire island is made of predators (except the triceratops) . . .\n3) There are no interaction between dinosaurs (no t-rex eating raptors etc.)\n4) you can easily step to the side and are invulnerable to the raptors due to primitive pathing.\n5) AI in general is meh.  Dinosarus just walk around aimlessly until they sense a player and either run away or run towards them.  Sometimes you might be hunted by a raptor which is cool right up til you simply step to the side and blow him away cause he's a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n6) No real survival mechanics despite the claim in the discription.  As far as survival mechanics go, you just get weapons and shoot at poorly AI driven lizards.\n7) Sounds have no direction so you cannot tell where the dinosaurs are comming from.  You just know they are somewhere around you.\n8) Primitive hunting mechanics that are not explained at all.  There's cammo you can find but I'm not sure it actually does anything, nothing with smells as far as I can tell, and sounds are a factor but are prone to glitches.  A.k.a. it is impossible to hide from a T-Rex.  You can track dinosaurs and there is sign but it's obvious, takes no real effort, and your gps does all the work somehow for you.\n9) The characters look like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hipsters who have some fetish for taking weird selfies with whatever they've managed to kill on this island. DX  Makes me want to get eaten.\n10) There are so many things that obvously need to be put into the game for a full release but aren't its seriously depressing.  I mean this game could be good, like really really good.\n\nBasically I would recommend this game if and only if it was put back into early access and reasonably regular updates happened over the course of a year or two.  That is what we all expected and were happy with.  I mean seriously I'm perfectly fine with a game taking time to develop as long as reasonable progress is made.\n\nWhile this game has amazing potential, I cannot in good faith recommend it because it is alpha and should NOT be considered a full release.\n\n[EDIT]: And these god d**n birds have ruined everything.  Seriously I'm pretty sure this release is an early April fools joke because this is ridiculous.  I mean seriously unbelieveable.  If it is just a joke I will update this review to a recommend.\n\n[EDIT2]: Nope not April fools joke.  And you know what the worst part is?\n\n"We are satisfied with how the Early Access phase went, with comminuty's help we managed to develop and implement everything we planned and promised when we set off on this journey three and a half months ago - two new dinosaur species, PVP and team support, player XP, in-game currency and store, localization in 13 languages, two new weapons and lots of tweaks and fixes. "\n\nSo comming strait from the Dev's mouth here's how all this went down:\n\nFirst they came to the community with a concept that seemed great.  Then in three + months they added "two new dinosaur species, PVP and team support, player XP, in-game currency and store, localization in 13 languages, two new weapons and lots of tweaks and fixes", said the game was done and decided to charge $30 instead of the early access $20 (so apparently according to the Devs what actually amounts to a tiny bit of content and basic functionality is worth $10 percopy in and of itself).\n\nWell let's just say you need to do a lot more than that to finish a game.","March 31, 2015","false","13.5"," 285 of 350 people (81%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","81","285","350","40","12"

There are a fair share of bugs (rubberbanding dinosaurs, some collision issues), but for 85% of the game, you more than likely wont notice an issue.\n\nThis game fills a void that I have been longing to satiate for years.

They simply took the engine of the previous theHunter game and added a few dinosaurs, no improvements on the engine or any attempt to make the game actually exciting (So yes I'm saying 99% of the time the game is Very BORING).\n\n2. Your character can't carry more than 20KG, which is not nearly enough in comparison to the amount of bullets it takes to kill a single dinosaur (once I shot a triceretops with 23 bullets before it dropped, and that is only ONE dinosaur, it took me about week in real life to gather all those bullets). I managed to kill 2 T-rex's due to the Clipping bug where they got stuck in the wall. They either have to make the dinosaurs weaker, add more bullets, or add more backpack space.\n\n3. Your character dies 90% of the time with a single attack, a T-rex (one blow and you're dead), the Quetzalcoatlus picks you up and throws you down and you're dead, the Utahraptor comes in packs of 5 or 6 so unless you're carrying a vast amount of bullets, surving them is rather slim (but carrying a lot of bullets is also extremely unlikley since you have a 20KG limit)\n\n4. You start off with a machete, which does practically no damage at all. They wan't to give you the "feel" of a survival game, but no options to build a shelter or a place to store bullets and guns you've picked up (since you're sitting with limited space on you as a person), also no place to purchase more bullets once you run out.\n\n5. The game has a purchasing system where you get money for every kill (upon spawing ONLY), but you have to be an incredibly high level to be able to unlock decent guns, which is very stupid since you start off most of the time getting killed in the first 10 minutes (because you have no way to defend yourself properly).\n\n6. Running is a severe problem since the character is so slow, he only sprints for 100mtrs and takes forever to regenerate his stamina. Your character weights 60KG in the game and normally people that weight can sprint a LOT further since they have no extra body weight to carry.\n\n7. There are practically only carnivores in the game, which makes no sense at all (Apart from the triceretops). If there are only carnivores, what exactly do THEY eat? The had to add a lot more herbivores as well example: Galimimus (for the herd effect), Brachiosaurus (big game hunting), stegosaures etc.\n\n8. If it is supposed to be a hunting game, then your character must be able to look at tree bark to check for trails, you must be able to climb trees to be able to shoot the dinosaurs from above, little shelters close to watering holes. I honestly think the developers themselves never even went hunting once.\n\n9. As mentioned in section 2, dinosaurs have the capabilities to fly and travel through solid objects like rocks, but of course YOU dont. Your character cant even jump over small objects (since there is no such option), making climbing the volcano mountain in the middle of the map extremely tedious and it takes MUCH longer than what it would in real life (Also I think the developers never climbed a mountain in their lives either).\n\n10. The game (if you still want to call it that) is REALLY EXPENSIVE $29.99, with the same amount of money you can purchase much better games than this on Steam, since the developers aren't sure if they wanted to release a HUNTING game or a Survival game. So they took the worse out of both genres, added an insane price tag to it and sold it to the community. They ripped people off with theHunter, and now they're ripping people off with theHunter:Primal\n\nI normally don't complain about bad purchases, but seriously DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR MARKETING (as I was), rather spend your money on something else.\n\n****** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ************ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ************ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ******\n","April 4, 2015","false","20.5"," 457 of 601 people (76%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","76","457","601","50","23"

The giant god damn reptile walked right over us while we were laying there ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ our pants. When we thought we were safe, we slowly crawled away. After a few seconds passed, I heard a screen shaking, eardrum popping, massive sounding roar as I turned around to see my friend get devoured by a reptillian Satan. The beast then looked to me. We locked eyes for a moment, and a sense of understanding moved through me. It was then that the beast moved unto me, roared in my face, and ate me.\n\n\n\n10/10, would die again.\n\n\nBut now for an actual review.\n\nAfter puting an extensive amount of time playing the game, I feel that I am ready to give a completely honest and full fledged review. This game, at its core, is very hit or miss. Some people will love it, while others will instantly denounce it for being too hard or a cash grab. While I believe the game is well worth the money, don't take my word for it. I will attempt to give the pros and cons of the game in a completely unbiased fashion, so that you may form your own opinion about the game before you buy it.\n\nPROS:\n1. World and Atmosphere. This game couples amazing sound design with stunning visuals creates an amazing immersive world. You can hear T-Rexes stomping around from miles away, and spot Quezalcoatluses flying in the sky before they have a chance to see you. While this does add to the immersion, it also rewards attentive players who can see a threat before it even knows they exist.\n\n2. Weapons and Damage Models. The weapons of Primal are very grounded in reality. All weapons match to their respective ammunition types and every weapon looks, sounds, and feels like an actual weapon. Firearms are loud, bows have believable ballistics, and everything feels very solid. Coming from someone who is very experienced with firearms, I can attest to the realism of this game's weapons. Also, being based on a realistic hunting game, Primal's damage models are very precise. Heart shots are king, while general body/gut shots will not instantly drop most of Primal's beasts. Overall, the guns are good.\n\n3. The Actual Gameplay. Primal's gameplay is very intense, You can go from walking through a peaceful field to being chased by Utahraptors in mere seconds. This isn't a casual game. Deaths are punishing while kills are immensly rewarding. Even with high level gear, carelessness is often punished with death.\n\n\nCONS:\n1. Bugs. While the games stability has been immensely improved, the game still has lots of bugs. It wil crash every so often, and movement is very finicky. Also, the only servers are hosted through other player's internet connections, resulting in high pings and short lived servers.\n\n2. Developement. Until recently, this game had been declared dead by most. The developers of this game are very invested in other projects and seem to view Primal of a sort of hobby on the side. On the up side, they have issued a survey for players to take and have also decided to try and tackle some of the bugs. Even though the game has officially released, they still intend on giving it regular updates.\n\n\nCONSENSUS: Primal is a great concept, but it is still in the making. While basic gameplay is good, there are still things that need to be ironed out and content that should be added in. While I understand some negative reviews, I believe that many of them portray this game in a bad light. Many people simply expect things from the game that it simply cannot offer. There isn't crafting or base building (as of yet) because the game is developed and marketed as a dinosaur hunting game. But, in the end, it is for you to decide. If you enjoy challenging or intense games, this is for you. If you're looking for another Primal Carnage of Orion: Prelude, then you will be dissapointed.","December 19, 2014","true","139.2"," 330 of 427 people (77%) found this review helpful 171 people found this review funny","77","330","427","171","5"

After reading dozens of reviews, and playing it for a few dozen hours myself I have come to some conclusions about the game. First off this is NOT a game for EVERYONE. Are you patient? This is arguably the most expensive tramping simulator out there... No kidding! There have been times when I've tramped for over an hour and not seen a Dino or anything of real interest except very beautiful scenery, but even that can get old. Or, you can load the game up and stumble across several T-Rex or half a dozen Raptors that tear you to shreds and cause you to lose all your gear that you've spent over ten hours collecting.\n\nA lot of people review the game negatively based upon the fact the game "isn't finished". The game is perfectly playable and enjoyable as it is, and is indeed "finished" it isn't however very "polished" and a few areas of the game could do with vast improvement, in fact a lot of areas could. If you need a slick, styled, polished game, this probably isn't for you. This game however is extremely immersive, and also very lonely.\n\nOne of the great reasons for this game is the sense of abandonment, the aloneness, even with other players in the game. It's a harsh environment, there's big creatures out to kill and eat you, weapons are scarce and ammo is scarcer. It really does get the adrenaline going, which is a definite pro.\n\nSome say the game is easy, some say the game is hard. The game is both and neither. The difficulty is based on serveral variable factors, your skill at FPS, your gear (guns, ammo level, camo), your environment (jungle, plains, hills etc..), and the ammount and type of dinos around at the time. Sometimes it's near impossible to even stay alive, other times you're tramping around shooting things without a worry or care in the world. This is enjoyable as at times you can relax at times you need to focus more.\n\nAll in all I enjoy this game very much, I wish there were more types of dinosaurs, and some parts were more polished but I very happily recommend it to people who fit the criteria above.

The forests and wildlife sound authentic, and the dinosaurs don't use recycled soundbytes from other games/movies.\n\n2) Graphical fidelity is great, but it's nothing to write home about.\n\n3) The difficulty is refreshing and adds a feeling of helplessness as you're pursued by otherworldy creatures.\n\n4) Based on the developer's track record, this game won't be abandonded. I'm looking at you, The Stomping Land.\n\nCons:\n\n1) It's immediately clear that this isn't a finished product and requires more content. In most instances the game will spawn you next to one of the three available dinosaurs, which loses its charm after being mauled several times.\n\n2) I haven't been able to host or join multiplayer sessions. This will most likely be patched within the coming days before Christmas.\n\n3) Key-Binding seems to be a bit unorthodox. I found myself rebinding most of the default keys to more comfortable orientations to suit my casual play-style.\n\n4) Odd instances of AI-behavior and glitches. Despite being well-hidden, dinosaurs are inclined to walk directly towards you and into your line of sight; I also died in a pond reaching only my thighs.\n\n5) The Island is very large, but it still lacks a great deal of polish. More folliage and natural landscaping would do wonders for this game.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIf you're thinking of picking up this game, wait until more content is introduced. Ultimately, I picked this up as a future investment, and because I just love me some dinah-saours.

At no point did I believe that these people were remotely crazy enough to land the plane. I woke up on an abandoned runway having been knocked out via a blow to the head. The distant sound of a man and woman shouting at the top of their voices filled my entire body with dread and fear as I came around. I knew this was now a fight for survival!\n\nAs I moved swiftly and quietly through the thick, dense and foggy bush I hoped that I would find signs of life such as camps left over by previous people who dared venture to this ludicrous planet. Perhaps I could find some sort of radio or telephone that I could use to call for help. By now the valley around me filled with the unnerving sounds of various carnivores. The roars piercing my heart and sending tremors straight through my spine. There was no hope.\n\nAs I laid helplessly in a thick set plant I felt the horrifying thud as the ground started to shake. I then realised it was the same terror I had experienced some years ago in Jurassic Park. The thunderous sound began to get louder and louder. I then ran as fast as my legs would allow over the valley hill and found an abandoned camp called Sir Arthur’s Folley. To my delight and amazement I found a .700 rifle and 2 bullets. I do not like guns but I intended to survive this island as I have done twice previously. As I loaded the bullets the tyrannosaurus rex came crashing through the trees behind me…...I knew what had to be done.\n\nI tried to throw a stone to distract the foul beast but to no avail. His head raised into the air as he then let of a rambunctious growl before charging at me. I immediately ran behind one the compounds concrete walls in fear of what was about to happen, with adrenaline pumping around my body I looked around the wall at the oncoming charge. I raised my rifle and shot the creature in the head! Nothing happened... I then ran back behind the wall where I realised my health was low from when I dropped down the small cliff into the camp. I sprayed myself with magic spray that made me feel revitalised and full of energy. The mighty head of the beast then clipped straight through the corner of the wall scaring the s**t out of me. “How the f**k can you do that” I angrily yelled at the beast. It then stood still so I took my shot, BANG, I hit the animal in the upper chest just below the neck. He let of an almighty howl as I punctured the left lung. As I aimed down the sight for one last time I pulled the trigger….nothing happened. I had no ammo.\n\nI then thought LEG IT, so I ran down the hill until my stamina had deserted me. I laid down in a bush hoping the foul creature had not seen me. My heart was thumping and sweat was pouring from my entire body. The footsteps crashed down the hill behind me. I laid there motionless. The T Rex then stopped not knowing where I was. I had done it, I had got away from the beast when I then heard footsteps to my left. I looked to find a guy in a bright yellow shirt and orange trousers standing in my bush. I then slowly looked around at the T Rex as he then spotted me, charged me and then ate me. NOOOOOOOOO! The guy in yellow and orange clothes then proceeded to steal my gear and disappear into the night.\n\nHmmm, maybe I get into character a little too much when I play this game….It is an epic game especially when played with other people. Getting ambushed by raptors or five people running from two T Rex’s is sooo much fun! Awesome game that you must try.","January 9, 2015","true","241.1"," 266 of 360 people (74%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","74","266","360","168","11"

I went in with high expectations, i mean after all, a survival game with Dinos? that sounds amazing! sad to say it was not.\n\nMainly, there isn't enough content. I can't believe they would call this finished. There are none of your typical survival game aspects in here at all. No base building, trap building, crafting, hunger, nothing.\nYou spend the whole game wandering this GIANT map, (which wouldnt be such an issue if you didnt walk slower than a crippled grandmother), trying to find supply boxes (which mind you, are NO WHERE near eachother) in order to defend yourself against near impossible to kill dinosaurs. Then, hopefully, if you manage to stay alive long enough, you can freely track and hunt the dinosaurs. Thats it. seriously, thats all.\nNot to mention there are only a grand total of 5 dinosaurs in the game. all of which are carnivores. (minus the Triceratops) and if you get spoted by a Utahraptor, you are pretty much screwed. you have limited defense, and you can't run very far or fast. Its irritating.\nThe enviroment could use some cleaning up aswell. As much as they are beautiful, and perfect for screenshots and such, they aren't very functional for gameplay. most of the map has very steep hills, making it seem like the player shouldn't be there. Its very rocky, making it difficult to manuver. Most of the terrain is uneven, water clips through the beaches at places it shouldnt, the water randomly gets deep in some spots and seeing as you can't swim, also makes it hard to move across some beaches, and rivers/streams. Not to mention you can't jump.\nYou also cant carry very much, which becomes problematic, if you cant store your ammo anywhere. Especially when you usually spend mostof the game with far more ammo than weapons. (and more ammo for weapons you dont have)\n\nHonestly, I'm very dissapointed. The idea for this game was great, but it's far from finished and is lacking severly in content. ESPECIALLY when they want $30 for it.\n\ndont waste the money.","April 4, 2015","false","4.4"," 212 of 282 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","212","282","8","0"

Quetzalcoatlus aren't EVERYWHERE now (they only spawn near Volcano's and really high lands). This alone made the game so much better. Now you can actually EXPLORE the land without definite insta-death.\n\nHowever, every other issue I've stated is still a thing.\n1) You rarely see dinosaurs in a game about dinosaurs.\n2) You travel for LOOOOONG lengths of time (up to 50mins) with absolutely nothing happening.\n3) Killing dinosaurs is nigh impossible at the start of the game (i.e. Levels 1 through 5-ish)\n4) If you haven't racked up a few kills for exp and money then good luck killing anything after an hour.\n\nOnce you get to higher levels (9+) the game becomes a lot more tolerable; but from a gamer point of view: Why would I want to keep playing a game if the start of it is dreadful, boring, and hard (in the sense that you can't really kill anything)? I mean, yes, the survival aspect becomes fun once you're higher level; but with that promise, why would a person new to the game stick around long enough to sift through the bane of this game?\n\nI know I called the game "Garbage" in my original review; but it's not. What it is, is unbearable (at first). And you'll have to put up with that unbearable irritation for a long time because levels aren't easy to gain (since dinos are rare to come across). Once you get past that, however, you could potentially start to enjoy yourself.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game is a COMPLETE waste of money! Hear me out, because I keep coming back to this game, TRYING to like it, but it's terrible. And here's why:\n\n-There's NOTHING to do:\nYou spend, I kid you not, 90%+ of this game walking around with absolutely NOTHING eventful happening. NOTHING in this world can really be interacted with except for loot crates and dinos. Your objective for most of the game, survuve. How are you gonna survive? Find camp points that have survival equipment (weapons, camo-clothing, healing supplies, etc). But the map is HUGE and that becomes obvious when you're walking with your GPS for 20 minutes and you've literally only traveled a distance about the size of 1/3 your pinky finger. None of these camps are anywhere NEAR close to each other, either; so if you're at a camp and you try to travel to the next closest one, be prepared to walk in a straight line for about 50 minutes, with NOTHING happening.\n\n-It's nearly impossible to kill dinosaurs in a game about KILLING DINOSAURS:\nGame Story - "You're a convict sent to a dino planet to kill as many dinos as possible to pave the future for potential civilizations." Early game, you MAY get lucky enough to find small Raptors. You can kill those with the machete that you get for free when you spawn, and that's where you get experience and money to buy things when you die and have to respawn anew. However, the dinosaurs age within game, and after 30 minutes they're fully grown (your gps tells you the age). Cool mechanic, BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THEM BY THAT POINT! Fighting baby Raptors is likely to yield success, BUT your health is gonna be dried up by that point, so you're going to eventually die. HOWEVER, the timer for the dinos doesn't reset! So now you have ADULT raptors, which you can't kill because as soon as you get close to killing them, they run away; and there is NO catching up to them. You can run, but your stamia is a handicap BEYOND BELIEF! You can track them with your GPS (via blood trail, foot tracks, dung, etc) but you'll be tracking for at least 20 minutes before you catch up to it. The dinos can bleed out and eventually die once you hit them; cool mechanic, HOWEVER, the time for that varies and the odds are, you WONT find the dino that you wounded; but if you do it'll be like I said before, "Tracking them for 20 minutes before you finally catch up". Mind you, this is just the case for the raptors, THE EASIEST THING TO KILL IN THE GAME!\n\n-Quetzalcoatlus... Quetzalcoatlus...\nIf you can tolerate walking around doing nothing for 90% of the game, and don't mind the fact that after 30 minutes, you wont be able to kill dinosaurs anymore, then I present to you, the one dinosaur, that ruins this entire game. Quetzalcoatlus. This flying dinosaur is the ONE major flaw that was put into this boring, uneventful, over priced, waste of time game! Quetzalcoatlus flys down, picks you up, and carries you around for 10 (Mississippi) seconds. Then he drops you and you die... No questions about it. You WILL die when it drops you. I've survived drops twice (I don't know how) but then it circles around to finish the job... Quetzalcoatlus is the primary reason this game is absolute garbage. You think walking for 50 minutes to reach a camp and get its spoils finally pays off. Nope. Quetzalcoatlus are ALWAYS around these camps. You can go in and get the stuff, yeah, but Quetzalcoatlus WILL catch you while you try to leave, and it WILL kill you. When you die your body becomes a pack of bones that you can come back and loot for your old equipment; but of course Quetzalcoatlus will STILL be in the area; in fact, MORE Quetzalcoatlus will be in the area! Because it seems like every time you die to one, another one spawns in the area! Quetzalcoatlus are only a threat in open areas? Oh ok, so my options in this game are 1) Be safe from them while I walk around the forest areas where's there are no camps to get equipment, little hope of actually seeing a dinosaur, and just endless walking around with absolutely nothing else to do. or 2) Walk out to a camp in hopes of finding things to survive and die to Quetzalcoatlus, walk out into the open in hopes of exploring this huge world and die to Quetzalcoatlus, or try to walk from this forest to another forest and die to Quetzalcoatlus.\n\n-There are very few dinosaur sightings in a game about DINOSAURS!\nIt's so rare to actually see a dinosaur in this horrible game. You'll find tracks and other signs of them in your area, but they're constantly moving, and they're faster than you and don't have STAMINA ISSUES! You will NOT see dinosaurs often. So you will not kill dinosaurs often. So you will not gain money or experience to buy things that will help you kill dinosaurs... which are rare to find in a game ABOUT dinosaurs! There is one dinosaur that you can easily find though. Quetzalcoatlus! Just look up into the sky and there he is! Walk out of the boring tree's and die! Or stay in the boring uneventful tree's and NOT die!

If you are expecting a slow-burn, high tension survival title in an alien world of dinosaurs, you may garner a lot of enjoyment from this game.\nIf you are expecting a immersive, realistic hunting simulator where you pursue and down the greatest creatures to ever walk the land, you will probably be disappointed.\n\nFirst, the positive: the game is beautiful. The textures are crisp. The dinosaurs are quite colourful and varied looking, yet still manage to blend in enough to require careful spotting. The plantlife is dense and oppressive. The weather is startling to see for the first time. The world is huge and packed with dense forests, open plains, beaches and swampland.\n\nThe dinosaur damage model is highly detailed, with careful shot placement required to ensure that Utahraptor goes down in one shot, or at least bleeds out before it runs too far to track the body.\nThe sound design is also well thought out, as careful listening is needed to pick up approaching predators and tell their mood.\n\nWhat are the major problems with this game? The largest (in my opinion) is the stamina and running mechanics. I mentioned this game is huge. It truly is, yet you walk with the speed and haste of a high-class Victorian lady visiting the Botanic Gardens on Sunday afternoon. The stamina bar is woefully low and is depleted in 10-15 seconds of running (the running too is far slower than any person with full use of their legs would manage when being pursued by hungry dinos). It refills much slower than it is consumed. I can understand wanting to discourage endless running over kilometres without breaking a sweat, but for the self-proclaimed "most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created", this is extremely tiresome, not to mention immersion breaking. It also makes no sense from a standpoint of offering a challenge to players: most everything can outrun you if it makes a beeline for you, and running already makes extra noise, so why bother adding ANOTHER impediment to your escape? It would have made more sense to add a general "exhaustion" meter that slowly increases the more you run, that slows machete swings and makes aiming more difficult as it fills.It also makes tracking wounded dinos a pain, as they will run far from your position in the time it takes them to bleed out. The choice of stamina bar clashes harshly with the wide open spaces and fast dinos around you, especially considering you are meant to be a fit, strong colonist capable of crafting machetes and bows from scrap.\n\nThis brings me to the second major complaint: the predatory dinosaurs. The predators on this island are incredibly numerous, and VERY dangerous. This may sound exactly like a predatory dinosaur should be, but let me ellaborate. These creatures are determined to catch you. VERY determined. Too determined. T-rexs will more often than not just *happen* to wander in a straight line towards you, and once there refuse to leave until you move from hiding. Once again this would not be a problem if it were not for other choices made in development, such as the inability to run for any real length of time, and the limited weaponry or distractions. Just to reiterate, this helps makes the game stressful and tense, effective for survival gamers, but infuriating for hunting enthusiasts who simply want to grab a rifle and track down a triceratops.\n\nOther complaints involve the lack of swimming mechanics to allow lake crossings, or even crossing 10ft wide bays at the beach, the dinosaurs' stilted attack animations (that do fortunately make the machete a viable weapon against solitary raptors), and the absurdly high populations of predators. Arrows are also extremely difficult to track in flight, and hence getting a grip on the shooting mechanics is primarily trial and error (since you can't retrieve arrows from the ground you're discouraged from practicing shooting trees and stones). The predators themselves are too... predatory. Why is it the T-rex's will always go out of their way to catch a bite sized meal like me when a raptor just walked by them. Why can't they ever just not be hungry you know... LIKE REAL ANIMALS. In fact, other than apparently clearing out when a T-rex wanders their way, the other dinos don't come into ANY conflict with each other, limiting your strategies to deal with them.\nIf the developers DID intend this to be a survival game primarily, then I'm baffled by the lack of food requirements (other than health regenerating eggs and mushrooms), proper shelter (other then some bare concrete walls to hide behind) or other survival staples. The only goals really are to go from landmark to landmark across open ground, avoid the overly numerous Tyrannosaurs, gather some ammo and hunt something for points, before lettting yourself die so you can use those points to buy a better weapon. Survival in this game is too often down to dumb luck. HOPEFULLY a T-rex won't march right up to you just as you got a .44 magnum with no bullets. HOPEFULLY a Quetzacoatls won't grab you as you're lining up a shot on a raptor and drop you 70ft to you're death. HOPEFULLY those raptors won't wander on top of your hiding spot.\n\nIf what you were expecting was The Hunter with dinosaurs, where you choose from a variety of weapons a gadgets to track down elusive and deadly creatures in their natural habitat, then you'll probably be disappointed. I appreciate that Expansive Worlds wanted something different for this game. And there is still time to make a strong impression in future updates. But I feel that if they had simply ported the weapons and hunting mechanics from the Hunter, and made this current game mode optional, they would have made a stronger first impression.\n\nToo sum up: Buy if you want to crawl past huge predators, sneak around raptor packs and quietly through herds of triceratops with hair trigger tempers.\n\nDon't buy if you're looking for a hardcore hunting simulator where you can bring you're favourite mauser rifle to bag a velociraptor at 150m.\n\nTo each their own I suppose.","April 11, 2015","false","7.9"," 96 of 119 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","96","119","9","0"

While it is not all together in its current state, I have been in contact with the developers and they do have plans to continually update it with what the community wants. By purchasing this game, you show them that there is a market for it, and encourage them to better the game.\n\nHere is a video to show some gameplay mechanics.... Don't judge too hard, this was only my 3rd time playing\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX5V89qZgHs\n\n\nEdit: Some more footage with the shotgun. Protip.... dont engage a T-Rex by yourself unless you have ungodly amounts of high powered ammo.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoWonxvsZQM&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nPros:\n-Awesome sounds\n-Visually Stunning\n-Massive map\n-Stealth System\n\nCons\n-some of the weapons are underpowered (will explain later)\n-I have yet to kill a T-Rex. (May be a pro to some, but i put 8 slugs in ones heart/lung/brain.... plus 10 arrows in the lung region.... it should have died)\n-To many dinosaurs (wouldnt be a problem if you could actually kill them)\n-You move to slowly, and the stamina bar that allows you to run is depleted WAY to quickly, and recharges WAY to slowly. (seriously devs, go for a run, an average in-shape human can run alot farther than you imagine, and recover rather quickly)\n-Only 3 dinos (Im sure they plan on adding more\n\nEdit: After playing this game for  nearly 6 hours now, I wanted to redo this review. I still find some of the weapons to be underpowered coming from a real life point of view. Both the slug shotgun, and magnum handgun should be much more powerful than they are, but they provide a fun challenge. The hitboxes on the dinosuars are still a bit off IMO, however once you get the learning curve, you can get it with a bit of luck. It is pretty fun to explore the island and try to hunt or avoid being seen. The graphics are beautiful, and ive found myself stopping several times to enjoy the view. If this game continues to be updated, it will be great by the time it reaches full rollout!\n\nNote for the devs:\nI found a few bugs so far I wanted to report\n-Tab doesnt always pull up pda\n-Rebalance gun damage\n-As long as a dino is behind you, it cannot hurt you\n-when you create a new game it is not truely new, it also doesnt spawn you with anything half the time\n-When you leave the game and come back, sometimes your secondary weapon is gone.\n\nAs the game progresses and updates are made I will change my rating and review, I will also have gameplay video up shortly that I will link.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\nEdit 12/16/14: The developer contacted me confirming they had recieved my feedback and would be implementing several parts.I will be changing my recommendation to a thumbs up once the first update is out. As long as the devs will listen to the community and continue to put out updates, I will reccomend it. As I continue to play it, I enjoy it more and more. Of it still isnt fully there, but it is an enjoyable time waster. As of now there really is no objective, Im hoping some objective will be added later. Also another thing that I have found to be annoying is the fact that you cant stack  items. If you find a pile of 2 arrows, and one of 3 you cannot combine them. Once again im sure this will be fixed later.","December 15, 2014","false","44.0"," 474 of 699 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","474","699","5","33"

When you enter this game you can instantly see a lot of work was put into it, with the huge highly detailed island, with the dinosaur models with textures done so well and the very nice ground vegetation which give the game such a great sense of realism.\n\nAs a hunting game, the AI needs a lot of work, they are not buggy but rather dumb, like zombies in DayZ, and if they spot you they are close to impossible to kill, which in some cases can become frustrating. The mobile tracker device works perfectly, but I feel as if the original game deserves that credit.\n\nAs a survival game I get a nice immersed horrified feeling, the aspects of this game can really come off quite scary, as the forest tried so hard to do.\n\nSo far I can say that it is worth the money, the game shows hard work by the developers, and I have hope they can maintain creating a more realistic primal hunting game.\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","14.8"," 125 of 168 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","125","168","5","20"

We had found our first Raptor, and immediatly started plunging arrow after arrow into the flesh of the Jurassic Park reject. We were able to wound it slightly, and it ran off. Thinking to ourselves "wow arrows suk lel" we journeyed off for awhile looking to find some better gear. Every step of the way, we heard noises from behind us, thinking nothing of it and brushing as local ambience, we sprinted ourselves deeper and deeper into our godforsaken fate. My friends going for a crate we found, I'm off looking around while he gets whatevers inside (prolly wasn't gunna share ♥♥♥♥ neither that cheeky ♥♥♥) when out of the corner of my eye, I see something lunge out at me, and before I know it I'm dead and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I lost my sandbox toy level equipment. My friends sneaking into some bushes trying to get a look at what killed me, and before he's ultimately assaulted from the rear, the last words in that foolish life were "He's got arrows all over him!"\n\nHours later, we were molded by the forest, trained off of it and bred from it. No sound goes unnoticed, no footprint ignored. Each pack is avoided and a single raptor is taken down with as much precision and accuracey we could possibly muster up. We had become The Hunter at last, but even that wasn't enough to save us from death after death.\n\n\nso its p. cool n ♥♥♥♥ buy it","December 31, 2014","true","13.9"," 77 of 101 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","77","101","14","1"

Updates will be sparse at times.\n\n\n"10/10 like Dark Souls with Dinosaurs"- IGN\n\nWelcome to Primal Eden, where your ♥♥♥♥ gets shoved in faster than you can say "The hell just made that noise?".\n\nI've played theHunter since 2011, and knowing the Devs, and how they are, when I first saw this I thought it was a joke.\nI was really excited to see that it wasn't, and even more excited to see it was coming out not long after I read about it.\n\nIt's pretty hard to get the hang of at first but you will get it eventually, before it got updated to you starting with 10 arrows, and it was 5, after figuring out the general anatomy of the raptors I could take down usually 3 before I ran out. I recommend playing with a group, as it helps tremendously. I have to say I'm not a fan of unreasonably hard games, this pushed it at first, but I just kinda pushed through it, and now enjoy how difficult it is. After killing 3 Rex's 2 Triceratops, and about 200 raptors, I can only see this better as time goes on.\n\nNow if you guys are weary of early access because of Dev's ditching projects, that is DEFINETLY not going to happen with this, The guys that work on theHunter are some of the best Dev's out there with communicating and listening to the community, theHunter came out in 2008 and is being continuously developed with most of the ideas coming from the community itself, as I'm sure will happen with this too. They only add new animals every few months or so to the original because it's a pretty niche market and not a whole lot of money comes in, which is also why they have the micro-transaction system the way it is. However, this game is getting a tremendous amount of attention from famous Youtuber's and being the fact that it's survival which is the "in" genre,\n\nI HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this game, as once you get passed the steep learning curve, it'll become one of the best games you've played in awhile. And like I previously stated, It's only going to get better from here.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, this .700 isn't going to kill Prehistoric-Alien creatures itself.","December 25, 2014","true","210.4"," 73 of 96 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","73","96","13","10"

(there isnt a survival aspect to the game, you can just stay in a zone where dinos don't spawn, there is no reason to leave these zones.)\n\nB) there are only five dinos, and two of them are basically the same one.

Lets be clear about this: I loved this game, I still do. But I cannot recommend this to anyone at all just because it is extremely unfinished. When the Pre-alpha started in December I had really high hopes for this game. But I quickly realized that a really buggy pre-alpha really hurt the publicity of this game, so much that I feared that this game would be scrapped. It seems as if my fears have come true.\n\nAs a $30 dollar game it is alright. The objective of the game is to survive long enough so that you can gear up and hunt dinosaurs. It follows the basic structure of thehunter in that the OBJECTIVE is hunting. This confused allot of people at the beginning, they thought it was a DayZ with dino's which it is not. With a large Island and a 5 species of dinosaurs you can have alot of fun. Running from Raptors, hunting Triceratops, and teaming up to kill T-Rexes is essentially what you will be doing. Most of this game revolves around teamwork to take down the biggest and baddest of dinosaurs. This is really what made this game stand out. It fostered a teambuilding enviroment without holding your hand. But as with most pre-alpha's it had its downsides.\n\nIt started with only 3 types of dinosaurs (which grew to 5 types) which really wasn't that great. The weapons were lacking, the AI was terrible and it was all around a buggy game. Over the past 3 months the developers had been working really hard to polish up the pre-alpha and so it seemed as if everything was going just fine. Alas that was not the case...\n\nCurrently the game still feels like its stuck in pre-alpha, there are still bugs, a low amount of content, AI STILL SUCKS, there are only a few weapons in game, and in general it is unfinished all around. This really sucks as it had alot of potential to ge a GREAT game but in its current iteration I WOULD GIVE IT A 5/10 AT BEST.\n\nWill I still play it, Yeah. But I would not advise you to buy it. Hopefully the devs will continue to produce more content and this jewel of a game can be saved. If they do fix it I will revisit this revew but for now, save your money and buy any of the other great indie games out there. It will be a much better use of your time and money.","March 31, 2015","false","72.9"," 64 of 85 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","64","85","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l21791/recommended/322920/","l21791","Ser Wolfhunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l21791/","85 products in account","So I’ve noticed that this game has mixed reviews, most of the negative ones being written by people who have played it for a couple of hours and have been eaten alive, chewed up and spat back out only to be able to write  “this game sucks”. Well my fellow steamers, you are in luck! You’re about to get a summary from someone who’s played the game for 87 hours.\n\nI did write a ton about thehunter: Primal, but figured who will want to read a review the same size as The Wall the Nights Watch guard? So I’ve kindly summarised it.\n\n•	thehunter: Primal is an online hunting survival game.\n\n•	There are 5 different types of dinosaur,\n\n•	11 different weapons and many items.\n\n•	There is a shop where you can use in-game currency to buy weapons and items however you need to unlock them by levelling up. (It is not a P2W game)\n\n•	Everything wants to kill you.\n\n•	Hunting is similar to thehunter, you need to shoot the dinosaurs in the right place. But as the dinosaurs are usually trying to find you, you come across them more often.\n\n•	It is hard and challenging, but you get used to it once you've played for a few hours.\n\n•	There are no 24/7 servers and setting up your own can be difficult as you have to open ports.\n\n•	You can be a lone wolf or chose to band together with friends or you can try to make friends. However if playing the PVP mode, only team up with people you trust, as it’s a dog eat dog world out there.\n\n\n\nPros\n•	It’s hard to play, but rewarding when you do well.\n\n•	Great game to play with friends.\n\n•	Very big map.\n\n•	PVP is fun.\n\n•	Levelling up system.\n\n•	In-game shop.\n\n•	Updated by devs.\n\n•	At moments you are terrified.\n\n•	Nice to hunt and be hunted.\n\n•	Day and Night.\n\n•	You get immersed in the world.\n\n•	Great dinosaur behaviour.\n\n\n\nCons\n\n•	It’s hard to play, and annoying when you die a lot.\n\n•	PVP can be brutal.\n\n•	No 24/7 Severs and setting up your own can be a pain as you have to open ports.\n\n•	Render distance is similar to thehunter so dinosaurs/humans disappear when they get too far (however they have to be quite far to disappear.)\n\n•	Hit points on humans need to improve.\n\n•	Levelling up system needs something to show hunters how close they are to the next level.\n\n•	Transition from night to day needs to improve.\n\n\n\nIf you like to be challenged then this is a good game for you, especially the PVP. Hunting dinosaurs is really exciting and something cool is always happening in the game. This is the kind of thing you will expect:\n\nYou’ve been tracking a Triceratops you shot for the last 10 minutes, and you’re lead into a forest. Suddenly you hear raptors communicating with each other, then silence and a rush of footsteps. Screams from the U-Raptors fill your ears and you and your hunting party start manically firing at 5 U-Raptors ambushing you.\n\nWhilst PVPing you're making your way up the volcano with your hunting party and are hounded by the flying Quetzalcoatlus,  one of your party is caught by the Quetzalcoatlus and he’s flown into the sky and then dropped to his death. But the rest of you manage to make it to the base at the top. However a rival hunting party is already there and a fire fight ensues. Your team get mascaraed and you lose all your stuff.\n\nOr you’re walking through the open plains and start hearing thud after thud and the ground begins to shake, you realise a T-Rex is coming for you and all you can do is run. But remember you have a high calibre weapon so try to take it on. You begin shooting at it and its getting closer and closer, just as it’s about to rip you to pieces you see an opening to its heart and shoot your .700, killing it instantly.\n\n","June 20, 2015","true","107.9"," 86 of 122 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","86","122","9","8"

I have played this game a decent amount alone, with friends, and have made friends whilst playing it. The atmosphere is gorgeous, the dinosaurs terrifying at every point in the game no matter what items you have, and a game that works so incredibly well with teamwork.\n\nThe issue: Development hit a extremely hard wall to the point it was "released" even when incomplete. This angered me that, with still so many issues and room for so much to be added, it was abandoned and left behind. From there I moved to ARK Survival Evolved and havent regretted it, looking back on theHunter: Primal with some friends, I regret that development stopped.\n\nHonestly this was one of my favorite games to ever come out on account of how terrifying and realistic it can become when trying to survive. They say it is a hunting game, but they fail to hint you that you are the one being hunted.\n\nSo should you buy this game?\n\nDepends. Are you okay with a noncomplete game that has development seemingly halted at the moment?

Base building would be great in this game. Then again, early access so what ever, no big deal.\nRun speed at the current gesture comes in two catagories: Faster than light or extremely slow. It would be nice to get a happy medium.\nThe lobby/hosting needs some work.\nThe Dinosaurs can be quite stupid sometimes, then again, they had small brains right?\n\n\nAll in all, I reccomend this game, especially if you want to waste £15 and possibily have some fun doing it. I mean, its not the greatest game in the world, you'll find out how much patience you have and you will be in a bush for 80% of your game time, but even that being said, it's oddly addictive and way more fun with others.","December 19, 2014","true","24.4"," 53 of 71 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","53","71","0","0"

I suppose I thought this game had improved over time. It hasn't. This game is utter ♥♥♥♥. You're suppose to be a dinosaur hunter on an alien world, yet there are only a handfull of dinosaurs - most of them being carnivours. You start with a machette and the clothes on your back. For the first hour, you're not hunting ♥♥♥♥ but crates for weapons. What is this ♥♥♥♥? I was bored after only a few hours. I really feel like I was scammed, I don't see how they can even call this a game. It plays like a demo for a much better game, except I paid $25 for it and that's all there is. If this was still early access I might let it slide, but to call this a completed game is just a joke. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's not worth more than $5. I don't care how much you like dinosaurs or the idea of hunting them, you will not enjoy this game.","March 31, 2015","false","13.9"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","47","62","5","6"

It should be labeled as being in BETA at best.  Models and environment are top-notch.  Dino attacks still need some serious work.  Simple things like a drag-and-drop inventory aren't finished yet.  And most of all there's still no realistic interaction between the dinos, i.e. dinos preying on other dinos.  But its a lot better than it was.  It's getting there.  It has SO MUCH potential.\n\nThis may be one of my all-time favorite games. But its not for everyone. It's like being a cop, I suspect. A midget cop in a barbarian cannibal universe. Armed with a big ♥♥♥♥ing gun. That you don't always have ammo for. So you hide in a trash can and watch them eat your friends and neighbors and wait for them to leave. So you can get the ammo left on their fly-blown corpses. So you can track those barbarian cannibals down and explode their livers. Then you take selfies with their dead bodies.\n\n\nEarly Release Review:\nI will say up front that this is a hunting game.  You can spend a lot of time where nothing happens.  Ammo can be feast or famine, as it should be in a survival game.  The game pays off for those with patience and persistence.  You can sprint around so long as you hear nothing.  When you hear raptors, you have to slow down.  Move away.  "Make like a hole in the water."\n\nDespite its myriad of disastrous alpha bugs and severe lack of content, I LOVE this game.  The environment is best I've ever seen.  There's a real feeling of terror when you hear a pack of raptors and have 2 shells left.  Or you're solo armed modestly with a Tyrannosaur  20m that has your scent.  Surviving encounters like this and the eventual vengeance exacted through patience and planning is exhilarating.  Teaming up and taking down a T-rex is fantastic fun.\n\nBeginning tips:  Weapons are at the settlements.  Download a basic map that shows the settlement locs and you'll have a gun in no time.  Ammo is found randomly in the wild.  Then find someone you can tag along with and work with them to get camo and ammo.  Once you've done this, the game really opens up for you.  Shoot for the heart/lungs/spine.  With the bow, don't wait for them to get right up on you.  Work for a clean LOS to the target and reveal yourself at > 10 meters so they come straight at you, exposing their chest for a killshot.","January 16, 2015","true","246.2"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

Fix that pterodactyl, or im sorry, quetzalcoatlus because you dicided to use the less ocurring and known version of the pterodactyl. They shouldnt be just flying around whilly nilly, in the same area for a long ♥♥♥ time, and constantly randomly seeing you, and fly down and pick your ♥♥♥ up and drop you. You should either remove the sob, or have a way to defend yourself from it. And secondly hit detection. ADD IT. i wanna hear when im hitting something, tree ground animal, excetera. im flinging around my useless machete, and seeing in text that im hitting him. COOL DUDE. And third, add a ♥♥♥♥ing jump option. Even if you think it wont neccesarily be needed often, just add it. Its rewarding in a game to just be able to ♥♥♥♥ing jump in place if you want too, or jump to get unstuck, or fiddle with a ledge. (thanks la noire for being a ♥♥♥♥♥ like that) And 4, single player is basically multiplayer by yourself. Fix that in a way. No im not sure how, but if you want to exit the game, ♥♥♥♥ing exit right away, no need to wait to "exit" when you relaunch the game it changes your spawn annyways for god sakes (which is also stupid) and 5th, ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELVES. Might not seem helpful, but do it. Did you even play your own game? Those simple things i said can be noticed withing the first 5seconds to five minutes.. And sixth, the GPS.. The pointer moving and not the map moving when you turn kind of messes up your bairings a bit, and is confusing sometimes. Fix that ♥♥♥♥. Make the map move when you turn and not the pointer.

I will say this about this game, it has HUGE potential, but sadly it's taken a back seat to it's cousin, "The Hunter". The amount of glitches and the stupid easy ability to hack this game makes it no fun at all, if you're one of the few people who play it as intended. If you aren't using glitched or hacked equipment, your odds of survival are very, very slim. The foundation is very good, and it pains me to see a potentially good game go to ♥♥♥♥ because the Devs are too focused on a 1 paticular product. Take a page out of Blizzards play book, and you'll see they run and focus on several products at once, without discriminating another one.

This is a game of intense experiences.  It has stired a gaming interest in me that I haven't had in years.\n\nFor instance, you are fighting one T-Rex when you hear the sounds of a second T-Rex joining the fight.  You don't have enough ammo to take on a second T-Rex and you are in the open.  You are down to your last couple of shells as the first T-Rex drops but the second is closing in fast, so you go prone and start to back away into some heavy brush and slowly you do actually escape even though the second T-Rex is right in front of you and you manage to survive the encounter.\n\nOr you leave your drop pod to retrieve your items and you buy a lot of ammo but no rifle because your corpse has one already.  On the way to get your items on your corpse, you hear the raptors closing in and there is no way you can survive their attack with your machete.  If you die you will have your main loot on one corpse and a ton of ammo on another in a different location.  You don't want to die so you try to evade the raptors but they catch up and start to attack.  You try to dodge their lunges and then you hear the foot steps of a T-Rex in the nearby woods so you dash to the woods with the raptors in pursuit.  As the T-Rex appoaches to see what the fuss is about the raptors retreat and you back slowly away from the T-Rex on your belly.  After some time of keeping a large tree between you and the T-Rex you get up and make the rest of the journey to retrieve your items.\n\nThere are literally dozens of times I've had situations where I felt a sense of accomplishment because of the way a situation played out.  I just find the experiences to be rewarding when I find a way to survive a situation where the odds were not in my favor.  However, the game will challenge you and you will die quite often especially when you are starting out.  It is part of the game.\n\nThat said the game isn't perfect but I didn't expect perfection for $20 (the Early Access price I paid).  There are still bugs that have been around for some time but they have been issuing patches weekly to address them.\n\nThe official release was a sad moment for me though simply because the game could have used another month or two of polish.  I'm not one that is complaining about content because the content in the game at release is what the dev's said they would release but more content would obviously be welcome.\n\nUnfortunately, the release update was essentially game breaking.  I have no idea why the game was released the way it was.  The game literally oozes potential so to see it take such an unnecessary hit was truly unfortunate.  There are a ton of negative reviews as a result but the game breaking bugs that were introduced in the release update were addressed within two days.   The game is enjoyable again and the dev's are looking to address some gameplay issues with the Quetzaloatlus in the next patch.\n\nThis game feels like a survival game to me because you are truly trying to survive long enough to find that next batch of ammo or the next weapon but it is not a crafting game.  So if you feel that you have to have crafting and structures in order to be a survival game then this game isn't for you.\n\nThis game is unique and I hope it generates enough sales to make further development worthwhile.  Even if the game development stopped at this point it is money well spent if you enjoy the idea of hunting dinosaurs while being hunted yourself.  There are very intense moments and those are the moments that keep me coming back.\n\nTo be clear, this game is not a run and gun game.  If you want to feel like Rambo and run out killing everything in your path you are not going to have a good experience.  This is a much slower paced game that requires some patience.\n\nWhether or not you will enjoy a game such as this really depends on your personality.  If you like fast paced action at all times then this game probably isn't for you.  If you enjoy stealth and a slower pace with frantic moments then this game will most likely appeal to you.\n\nThe dev's appear to still be on a weekly update cycle even after release so bug fixes and gameplay tweaks are ongoing.  The game is not perfect but if you wait for perfection you will most likely be waiting a long time and you will be missing out on a lot of fun in the mean time.\n\nOne of the more humorous bugs is some of the dino's clip through solid objects.  Things like a T-Rex literally clipping his head through concrete.  Some people freak out about this and it can be irritating when you get killed in such a way but once you know it is possible you simply avoid putting yourself into that situation again.\n\nFor instance, I was using one of the new concrete tower structures that was recently added and had two T-Rex's on me.  As I entered the structure and ran upstairs I run into two T-Rex heads inside the structure.  They both stuck their heads straight through the wall on the second floor of the structure.  I literally screamed out loud when I nearly ran into their mouths.  It was a funny moment!  I just ran back downstairs got them to move a bit and then proceeded to the top to kill them both.  The dev's are still working on the clipping issues.\n\nThe way I approach whether a game like this is worth it is based on how much I've played the game comparied to the cost.  It is pretty obvious that I've got my money's worth considering I've played over 250 hours at this point and still play daily.  So I highly recommend the game, warts and all, simply because there is enough value to make it worth the expense in my opinion.  Only you can decide if you would get the same value out of it.","April 6, 2015","true","400.5"," 62 of 92 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","62","92","3","3"

The game is not perfect but if you wait for perfection you will most likely be waiting a long time and you will be missing out on a lot of fun in the mean time.\n\nOne of the more humorous bugs is some of the dino's clip through solid objects.  Things like a T-Rex literally clipping his head through concrete.  Some people freak out about this and it can be irritating when you get killed in such a way but once you know it is possible you simply avoid putting yourself into that situation again.\n\nFor instance, I was using one of the new concrete tower structures that was recently added and had two T-Rex's on me.  As I entered the structure and ran upstairs I run into two T-Rex heads inside the structure.  They both stuck their heads straight through the wall on the second floor of the structure.  I literally screamed out loud when I nearly ran into their mouths.  It was a funny moment!  I just ran back downstairs got them to move a bit and then proceeded to the top to kill them both.  The dev's are still working on the clipping issues.\n\nThe way I approach whether a game like this is worth it is based on how much I've played the game comparied to the cost.  It is pretty obvious that I've got my money's worth considering I've played over 250 hours at this point and still play daily.  So I highly recommend the game, warts and all, simply because there is enough value to make it worth the expense in my opinion.  Only you can decide if you would get the same value out of it.","April 6, 2015","true","400.5"," 62 of 92 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","62","92","3","3"

Still play it quite often to this day.\n\nI was always a fan of hunting games (Deer Hunter 2005, was amazing), and dinosaur games (Many hours were spent playing the Carnivores series of games, even the broken JP: Trespasser and Turok), so when I heard about theHunter:Primal, I was stoked to say the least.\n\nBefore purchasing this game I had high hopes of it basically being a clone of the original game, replacing the local fauna from our time period with the prehistoric variety, while keeping the same solid, fun gameplay that has made theHunter so popular since it's release quite a few years ago.\n\nWhat I got feels like an extremely rushed, unfinished, buggy "game" that still feels like it's in an early alpha state.\nI can't stress this enough: THIS GAME DOES NOT FEEL FINISHED.\n\nThe animations are for the most part awful. Don't get me wrong; when the dinosaurs aren't walking or anything they look very nice, and as realistic as anyone could expect from species that have been extinct for millions of years. But as soon as they start to walk/run, that's where the animations all go to hell. I've seen triceratops doing backflips trying to walk up hills, Dissappearing right infront of your eyes, and then magically reappearing a few hunded feet away.\n\nI've had Tyrannosaurs walk right up to me and stumble around me in circles before walking away, and when they get 100 feet or so away from me, suddenly realize I'm there, and then eat me (I was walking around while standing up this entire time).\n\nI've 1-hit-killed a Utah Raptor with a makeshift bow, while I was unable to drop a Triceratops by putting 6x 12guage slugs into it point blank, among others.\n\nAnother problem I have with this "game" is where in the original, you would spot lots of animal tracks, etc. Making it fun to stalk whichever animal you were following. In Primal, any sort of tracks or sign seem to be very few, and far between. I've followed a Triceratops as it stomps through the river banks for about 20 minutes, all while not leaving a single track. How are you supposed to hunt in this "hunting game" if there are no tracks or sign to go by?\n\nAlso, why did they feel the need to make this a survival style game, where you spend most of your time wandering around aimlessly trying to find a weapon powerful enough to even kill a raptor the size of a turkey?\n\nI'd be much happier if they went with the same hunting mechanic as the original where you pick your weapon loadout at the lodge before you head out.  I know they basically replaced the lodge with the drop ships, but the fact that you need to earn so many credits for even a basic weapon, makes this game ridiculously tedious, and hard to enjoy.\n\nYou should start the game with at least a capable rifle, and then scavenge/buy more ammo as you need it. Sure, have the player able to find new weapons in crates still, but at least give them a capable weapon to start with so they can enjoy the game. I didn't buy a hunting game to "survive", I bought it so I could hunt dinosaurs. And if I were going to hunt dinosaurs in real life, you can be damn sure I'd be taking a rifle with me from the get-go.\n\nAnother small issue that needs to be fixed is the weird "wave-splashing" effect, that seems to come out of the ground or in the middle of a lake. I think the water would look much better if that effect was just scrapped completely.\n\nThe flora in this game also doesn't seem to be nearly as convincing as it is in the original theHunter game. I'm not sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't look as good as the original. I love the look of the forests in the original game. The jungles in Primal, not so much.\n\nAlso, the sound is a big issue with me. In the original "theHunter", the sound has it's issues, sure (mainly just the fact that footsteps would sound like they're on top of you, even though they could be 100 yards away), but for the most part. "theHunter" sounds beautiful, the entire time you're playing.\n\nIn Primal, the sounds in the forests/jungle aren't anywhere near as immersive, and it also suffers from the same "close-sounding" footsteps problem. Also, some of the sounds are just strange. I'm not sure if it's just Utah Raptors, or all (I think there's like five...) of the species, but there's always this strange "dragging" sound when one is close, and I have no idea what that sound is supposed to represent, but it just sounds awful, and not natural at all.\n\nI've also encountered quite a few areas where there is a beeping sound as if I'm close to a supply crate, but there is nothing to be found. So after searching the area for a while to see if there is a "hidden" crate, I just give up, and leave. This has happened in quite a few areas for me.\n\n\nNow, I don't want to sound like I'm completely bashing this game, because I really want it to succed. I just feel that there's no way they should have let it out of early access in the current state it's in, and they definitely shouldn't have called it a full release. It's not even in beta state in my opinion. They should have spent at least another 6-8 months on it, and ironed out the bugs at least, before releasing it. And that's not including all of the gameplay issues I have with this game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this game yet, wait for them to (hopefully) release some major patches for it, to bring it closer to something that feels like an actual game, and not a tech demo. I'm glad they didn't go with the subscription price model like the original (Although I'm guessing that's the only thing that's kept the project alive for so long, otherwise they'd have no incentive to keep updating it), but I fear this "game" is going to become filled with microtransactions to bring it up to the caliber of hunting simulation it's predecessor is.","April 3, 2015","false","4.3"," 67 of 102 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","67","102","4","2"

I moved around for a while hoping that the sound would go away, I knew that it was something in great numbers that my tiny ♥♥♥♥ bow wouldn't stand a chance to defeat. 2min later I heard something roar and 3 raptors moved in attack mode straight to me...\n\nMy second time playing, I thought that I should stay away from the thick jungle and try some other place, maybe more open. That's when my GPS thing start to pick up some loud noice, I follow the GPS coordinates to the sound. After a 300m walk I heard big footsteps I thought to my self "I'm screwd, ain't I?" And betwin the trees a big T-rex walked towards me. I pulled my bow and start to fire me arrows, but the T-rex was pretty much careless and just continued to walking towards me. I became T food.\n\nI finally found it, a chalange that I can go for, that T-Rex head will hang on my wall, I named him Glen. I know I can take out Glen, I just need to be more carefull and better equipped then just a bow, so I started to scavange for a while, I eventually found a shotgun and ammo, but Glen was stalking me. No matter where I go hes there, it mocks me, I know that. It barely tries to kill me anymore, it just stept on me, or just smack me with it's head, no it didn't eat me, it punched me with it's nose.\n\nAfter some time I found a box with a new map location... It looked like a globe or an atom the icon... Could it be? YES, science! Science can probably help me, I know they can, is there something science can't do?\n\nSo I had my new destination, towards the science station. After my great journey to science, I could't belive it, Glen was here to, he was looking for me. I took a run for it to the science station, I could hear Glens big footsteps behind me, looking for me. I can't die here, I didn't walk 10 000m to die now. I run, I hide I need to get there, science must have left something good behind for me to take.\n\nWhen I finally arrived, I found two boxes, "finally, what could be in here?" I got the first one and opend it and found a shotgun... Well, this could be good, I read the ammo description and noticed it was was specially for big dinos. GREAT, I went to the second one and founda a magnum, this should work to I guess, if I lay down when I shoot I could take him on a mid range.\n\nI bucked up and headed towards Glen, he should have left some tracks after him, and he's weary loud to. It didn't take long till he start to roar so my GPS could find the posision the sound comes from. And there he was, Glen, my nemesis, the dino that have made my life to hell here on this planet, I will have my revenge!\n\nI found a good hiding spot in a bush, I pulled out my Magnum and aimed carefully on his side neck. If I get a good hit, he should bleed weary much there. I pulled out my first shot, but Glen didn't seem to care weary much. I pulled on more, he looked to the left with no care... WTH, I fire it again, and again and again and again. I fire him 16 times and Glen just didn't care. Then I took my shotgun and fired it. Glen reacted, Could this be it? His weaknes?\n\nGlen walked towards me, he knew I was somewhere around, he bypass me, I fired a shot on his neck, he turned around and start to stand over me. My heart start to beat weary loud, I have never been this close to him without him killing me. I couldn't tell if I did any great damage to him, but he walked pass me again later, and I found my chance, I gave him a shot on the side of his head. And I shot again, and again... After 10 round on the same spot, I couldn't believe it, he was still standing, after so much fire power Glen is still standing.\n\nGlen left after I feelt my defeat, and found some blood on the ground he left, I took my GPS and scanned it... No... how is it possible? The blood scanned showed that Glen still haves 99%hp left! It's not possible, I.... I... I don't know how to kill Glen... I... I need him dead, I have to see him dead now! I will continue fighting, I will have his head on my wall singing a fun jingle over my fireplace! Some day I will see him fall to the ground, if it so take me my entire LIFE!!!\n\n\n\n10/10 would Hunt for revenge again!","March 15, 2015","true","8.1"," 53 of 78 people (68%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","68","53","78","59","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/recommended/322920/","toxic_fuel","Toxic Fuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/","123 products in account","I've been putting off reviewing theHunter: Primal for a long time now, but considering the amount of time I've sunk into it, I'm going to give it my best shot. I've always debated as to whether or not I could recommend this game to someone, and it's honestly a hard choice. If there was an option between recommending and not recommending, I would go with that one. There are many great things about this game, but also many frustrating things, so I feel like a pros and cons list would best suit my review.\n\nPROS:\nThe map - The map itself is simply one large island with many points of interest, ranging from bases with torn down concrete structures and in-tact bunkers on the ground or on the side of a volcano (not active), to small campsites. When you first start off, it's fun to make it your goal to visit all of the bases on your map, since they provide the gear you need to survive. The rest of the map is fairly diverse, from dense forests, to large open plains. I had a blast exploring the map for the first time, and I would think other people will too if you don't mind a lot of walking.\n\nThe graphics - To add to the fact that you'll be doing a lot of walking, you can still appreciate the graphics the game has to offer. Granted, they aren't amazing like certain triple-A titles today, but they are still impressive and can make for some beautiful scenes on the island.\n\nWeapons/gear - I've always liked the choice of weapons in the game. If you fancy shotguns, rifles, handguns, or even a sniper rifle, you can find them all here. You can even unlock an assault rifle once you reach end-game content. The gear system is nice as well, as it has an impact on your visibility to dinosaurs. You start off in bright orange clothing but can work your way to camo that makes you very hard to detect, thus finding new gear can be rewarding.NEUTRAL:\nThe dinosaurs - It's unfortunate that the dinosaurs themselves are fairly lackluster. The game is filled with nothing but carnivores/dinosaurs that will attack on sight. There are only 5 species of dinosaurs, and one of which (the Quetzalcoatlus) is quite irritating to deal with, despite being reworked several times. The AI is good for the most part, but once you shoot anything it will head towards you like a heat-seeking missle, because apparently they can see you from anywhere. However, I will hand it to the game for having an organ system for all species, meaning every shot counts. You won't be taking down a T-rex easily by randomly shooting it in the body. However, if you know where the heart is and can hit it only a few times, they can go down quick. Same with all others in the game. You can even one-shot triceratops and raptors if you become familiar with the dinosaurs' anatomy. One other thing I should also note is that there are also variations of the dinosaurs, so you never know when you might come across an uncommon or rare dinosaur, which does add to the gameplay nicely.\n\n"End-game" content - Once you've done basically everything, you can still attempt to fight the game's "boss", so-to-speak, which is merely a reskinned T-rex with a stupid amount of health. However, the road to fighting the Queen can take an incredible amount of time, since you first have to find a rare T-rex that drops a scent gland, which are not guaranteed to spawn on the island, so it can take many tries. Once you kill the Queen, you can be rewarded with the assault rifle or a crossbow, both of which aren't very good for any of the big dinosaurs. And once you unlock these late game weapons, well...that's it. There is absolutely no other reason to kill the Queen a second time, if you ever even find another rare T-rex.\n\nWalking simulator and repetitiveness - This is a hunting game, so yes, there is a lot of walking. Know that before you buy the game. The thing I do not like, however, is the stamina. The fact that the running stamina runs out so quickly on a huge island with nothing but predators is...regrettable. Also, once you've aquired the best gear and weapons to suit your needs, the only thing to do is to keep hunting the same 5 species of dinosaurs, on the same island. Forever. The only reason I don't always have a problem with this is because I have several friends who also have this game, and it makes it much more bearable not having to play alone. Which brings me to the next point.\n\nDifficulty - There is no "easy" or "hard" difficulty. The game is what it is when you play it. You'll either have massive luck by spawning near a base with great loot, or you'll run into a huge open field with 2 T-rexes. And if you aren't prepared for that, you can kiss your gear goodbye. Yes, you keep your gear when quitting the game. However, when you die, you drop everything in a bag that must be retrieved after spawning back in. And this can be VERY annoying, because sometimes whatever killed you will seemingly camp your death spot, or you will spawn very far away, making for a long trek back without the gear you dropped. And this is where having friends will come in handy, as playing alone is all the more dangerous. Or if you happen to play on a server with strangers, anyone can loot your death bag. The game can be fun, or it can be unforgiving.CONS:\nBugs - Yes, most if not all games have bugs. But this one...you never know what could happen. I've run into an invisible raptor that couldn't be killed, I've lost tons of in-game money due to disappearing drop pods with gear in them, there's a scope flickering that can happen due to carrying the newer gear, the Quetz can become stuck in mid-air after "killing" it (thus making it impossible to harvest), bags will disappear even with items in them if you split a stack of ammo into your inventory, and many others. Granted, I can't guarantee you will always have these specific problems, as I haven't experienced the first one since it happened a long time ago. But you WILL run into some, and they WILL cause frustration.\n\nDevelopment - The development/updating of the game has been very slow and mostly dull. There have been massive gaps in between small updates, which have always brought on new bugs or glitches into the game, so clearly they've not been tested much, if at all. The game should never have left early access due to the lack of content, amount of bugs, and slow development. In fact, this is the main reason why I can't recommend this game yet.\nTL;DR/Conclusion:\ntheHunter: Primal can be really enjoyable with friends, and once you become familiar with the game's mechanics. That is why I have quite a few hours into it. However, without friends, I highly doubt I would have the amount of hours I have now. And once you've played enough, you start seeing the game for what it is: a repetitive, slow-to-update, slightly buggy walking-simulator, that can be very difficult at times. The game can definitely have its moments, though, where you can get lost in the world and have fun, so it is NOT all bad. In fact, I've even had one of my longest gaming sessions in this very game (8 hours). I just can't bring myself to recommend it with the bugs it still has and the dreadfully slow development.","April 4","false","198.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","2"

So theHunter: Primal is very very similar to theHunter (obviously) however the main difference are the fact that you cannot purchase anything and then equip them when you first start because it is not a hunting expedition, it's survival... However they have just added an in-game money system, where everytime you harvest a dino, you get money and when you level up, you unlock something in the shop, so when you die, you get taken to a shop where you can purchase weapons and whatnot before you spawn...\n\nBut it's not like other survival games... you can't build stuff... you basically just gotta scavenge containers and bags and/or kill other players and take their stuff... if it's set to PVP of course...\n\nThe graphics are a little better than the hunter in my opinion and who can ever forget the beautiful sunrise and sunset water colours... and choice scenery!\n\nAs far as gameplay, the mechanics are buggy, but can only get better with time. The player movements are different from the Hunter the walking and running are faster, but they have introduced a sprint system which uses stamina and is extremely loud to attract dinosaurs. (Only use in emergency) The hunter mate (although called settler mate) works exactly the same way, spotting and tracking works the same but there isn’t tracking or spotting skill levels, and of course trophy shots and harvesting work the same way also. You don't get experience for weapon use in this game either...\n\nThere is also a new tracking feature in which I really like... when you wound an animal and you track it's blood, it tells you in percentage how injured it is... for eg.... after shooting a T-Rex 6 times with a shotgun, after scanning it's blood it told me that it had 45-60% health left and the next time I shot it once... it said 30-48% (as well as body/intestine shot etc)\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Great graphics\n- Excellent immersion (especially when the t-rex is nearby or when a raptor knows you're there and he/she calls out to the pack to help look for you)\n- Cool map with central volcano (no dinosaur game is complete without a volcano to set the mood)\n- Has major potential for many wonderful things\n- No pay to win, no money at all (except in-game currency from harvesting)\n- Injury percentage for prey\n- When you die, you can retrieve your goods from your old backpack... as long as no-one else has pillaged it!!\n- Thunderstorms :D\n- Mean looking dinosaurs\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Lots of gameplay bugs and a rushed full release from Early Access\n- Only five dinosaurs... T-Rex, Utahraptors, Triceratops, Velociraptors and Quetzalcoatlus (Dino-birds)\n- Scavenging gets boring and old really quickly - needs traditional ‘the Hunter’ mode\n- Controls are very stiff and sometimes sluggish\n- Bad framerates in high detailed areas such as swamps and dense jungle regions\n- Faulty hit register, (shoot the 6,000kg T-Rex in the heart with a .700 while it's standing still and it registers as only a body hit, where sometimes I can drop a 10,000kg Triceratops on the run with one .308 round to the heart, where the bullet hole is on the leg... Can be quite frustrating at times... as you die from not dropping them or you run out of ammo...\n- Quetzalcoatlus seem to be able to swoop through hilly terrain and through metal spikes and grab you, even though you shot them in the head...\n- Sound is a little buggy crossing from biome to biome\n- The Quetzalcoatlus, although remarkable are very annoying and frustrating to deal with at times...\n\nWHAT IT NEEDS\n\n- Need to be able to craft something, to build defences to stand a chance killing dinosaurs without dying\n- Needs more dinosaur species (especially herbivores) and less of the current ones for a nice balanced game\n- Need to see the Dinosaurs attacking each other... raptors attacking T-rex and Triceratops, Velociraptors getting taken by Quetzalcoatlus and the traditional T-Rex versus triceratops battle...\n- Maybe a 4 wheeler would be good as usually the game spawns you on the other side of the map as your friends\n- The T-rex needs to have a bigger roar like on Jurassic Park... to really make your hairs stand on end.\n- A traditional ‘the Hunter’ mode, to create expeditions instead of scrounging around...\n\nVERDICT\n\nOverall I give this game a 6.5/10, well worth $15 - $20 AUD MAX... but knowing the developers... they did such an awesome job with ‘the Hunter’... So I expect the same with this... So if you like the Hunter I recommend getting ‘the Hunter: Primal’, especially since Dinosaurs will soon be ruling Hollywood again, it's nice to finally see a switch from zombie survival for once.\n\nAlso a funny thing... when you find some T-Rex poo, you'll notice it has human arms and some skulls in it... fkn hilarious!! Even funnier than that Jurassic Park satellite phone scene!!","February 4, 2015","true","88.8"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","29","37","9","0"

Maybe some more herbavores for the predators to nom on, or collosal sauropods to simply stare at and admire.\n- Dinosaurs interacting realisticly. Triceratops moving in groups, raptors working together to take down a kill, t-rex being attracted to the smell of said kill, raptors fleeing from approaching t-rex. That sort of stuff.\n- I know some probably won't agree with me on this, but make raptors more dangerous?

TL:DR version at bottom, even that is long.\n\nFirst things first, this is an EA release which means its full of issues and is incomplete as far as content goes. Visually it looks very good, and the sounds are good though there are a few glitches, especially when standing near someone who is trigger happy, or about to be eaten.  The issues I have no doubt will be ironed out but their release target of early March 2015 is rapidly approaching.  And as far as content, if this game ends up getting the same kind of attention to updates and additions as theHunter has, then we will not be wanting for different critters to hunt, or varying types of gear.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes this is one of the most fun games I've played in quite a while, and doubly so when playing with friends. And you do need to play with some friends or at least make some and travel around in a group, as your suvival chances are very slim with no allies.  The only thing that becomes an issue when in a large group is ammunition, as there is usually a shortage for everyone, not like that is better for solo players however.\nThe problem here lies in the loot tables, or rather the amount of loot/ammo whatever that shows up in each box. The boxes need to have at least double the ammo available if not more, and there really is no point in having a stack of 1 round that you cannot merge into other stacks, same with healing sprays.(Fixed! You can now stack ammo and stuff, GJ Devs!)\n\nPlayers shold be able to jump, and possibly climb low walls and rocks.\n\nAnd lastly, as with theHunter, there really needs to be dedicated servers for this game, as the host/client connection issues that plague theHunter are present in this game, with players timing out or crashing every few minutes, it can become frustrating just to play for a few hours.\n\nTL;DR version\n\nPros-\nAmazingly fun with a group.\nGood visuals, some of the scenery is quite beautiful.\nGood sound, the sound of a T-Rex stomping near me makes my whole house shake with the sound turned up!\nGreat potential\n\nCons-\nIncredibly high learning curve.\nExceptionally difficult almost futile to play solo, turning some gamers away, and others to hacking/exploits.\nObvious glitches and bugs that would cripple a live release (I expect they will fix this by release)\nNo Dedicated Servers, and with the crappy hosting/client system this will keep many players from fully experiencing the game.\nTiny pool of creatures to hunt (Obvious that more will be added)\nSmall pool of weapons (also expect this to change soon; WTF no .50 BMG? SRS GIEZ)\nNo combining stacks of ammo or healing sprays? (Fixed stacking now works!)\nVery low loot tables, crates need at least double the ammo/healing loot if not more.\nNo jumping, climbing or swimming, cause these trained dinosaur hunters haven't learned that, and they can't even run very far.\nAny idiot can hack the game, at the very least, hosts need to be able to ban players from their servers, as one bad experience can ruin the game for people.\n\nTakeaway: Great fun with a few friends and easily worth 20 bucks.","January 8, 2015","true","196.8"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

That's just the way it is! Its not for the cod or bf2 fans. Its not run and gunning and running around without consequences. You have to play it like you are actually hunting or as close to that as you can get in a game. If you run you'll only spook the herbivores and call the predators. You have to place your shots. I see all these videos and almost 90% of the time they shoot for the head. You must go for those body shots, Like real hunting specifically the vitals besides dinos in this game have small brains and the chance of hitting them there is slim if at all. Hit em in the hart or the lungs and their gona go down if not immediately then within a few feet. Your the hunter and the hunted depending on the situation.\nIve only been playing about 7 hours but I haven't died once yet, have no room left to carry anything and I have full camo because im careful and not in any rush. Ive never used the run meter once because you don't even need it if you play the way the game is intended. The metter is also for swinging handheld weapons so conserve it if you like to use it for running. The game is also very beautiful especially when everything is on high.\nWith all this said, are there issues with the game? Of course. Is the game getting better? I think so and the immersion is really that good especially the thunder and lightening. Dinos do get stuck on cliffs, the t-rex has some issues and yes there is no swimming to name a few. Basically  I think that most of the complaints are from people who expect this game to be something it never was going to be. I also believe the games not the problem here its the people who play it, then complain that its not what THEY expected it to be.\nLike I said at the beginning of this review, If you like the hunter than you'll like the the hunter primal. If your looking for run and gun or a swimming simulator then go play something else because this isn't it nor will it ever be. Please also remember, when they say realistic that is also realative! My deffinition of what realistic is, of course is different than yours but as games go this one comes very close. If its not realistic enough for you then I suggest going outside and doing some real hunting!","April 18, 2015","true","48.0"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","39","58","3","0"

Armed with nothing more than a bow, a handful of arrows and the clothes on your back, it's up to you to seek out better equipment and to try and survive.\n\nAs it's early access, the types of dinosaur are limited at the moment, with plans to add further animals as the development moves on.  Sure there's some kinks to be worked out, and some balancing issues to make the game enjoyable for the widest audience, but it's fully playable and highly enjoyable now.\n\nMy favorite ingame experience so far?\n\nIt was midnight, it was dark, and a badly timed trip had left me at the bottom of an open valley with trees on the slopes to either side of me.  A kilometer up ahead, the grasslands gave way to rock, and open country on the side of the islands volcano, a safe haven for me, if I could reach it, where I could hide amongst the crags with a clear view and wait out the dawn.\n\nBut that was a kilometer away.  Much closer, the heavy footfalls and roar of a T-Rex reminded me I needed to keep moving.  Somewhere nearby the strange, laughter like chittering of a raptor let me know I was not alone.  Was I hunter, or prey?\n\nCarefully I moved through the undergrowth, hoping to sneak away, every sound seeming amplified, and fear running her icy fingers down my spine.\n\nMy character brushed up against something toxic and coughed, the noise so unexpected, caused me to freak out and jump out of my chair, before logging out and then laughing at myself for it.\n\nWould I recommend the game to others? Absolutely.  If you enjoy hunting, dinosaurs or survival style games, then it's definitely worth a look.  As a caveat, however, this thing is in early access.  Expect a few bugs, balance issues and for things to change, but if you can live with that, it's really worth it.","December 16, 2014","true","9.4"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

If you're above the fence about buying it, just do it, you won't regret.\n\nNow to the review:\n\nFirst things first, i liked a lot The Hunter but i just could not stand the huge monthly pricing, it would probably be one of my favourite games if you could just pay it once and play forever. So, when i saw this game, i did not had much option other than to just buy, a game so similar to the hunter being pay it only once with no micro transations? I'm in!\n\nAbout the game> This is The Hunter on steroids, you are stranded on a wild planet, you've been sent as cannon fodder before the colonization, even though the lore is as basic as the Avatar movie, it is enough to get you going. You start off with just a bow and a few arrows, and you have to scavenge drop boxes left around the planet if you want to survive, and, while you do that, you get to hunt dinossaurs.\n\nHunting dinossaurs is a bit different from hunting wild boars, the carnivores won't hesitate to have you as their next meal, and they don't lack the ability to track you down. Most of the times, it is best to just let your prey go than to engage in combat, if you lack the element of surprise, this is not The Hunter, this is Be Hunted. You will find yourself lots of times listening closely for clues about your foes as you crawl away through the dense foliage, not for the faint hearted.\n\nExploring is just awesome as the world feals really life-like, with a awesome science-fiction touch as you see yourself orbiting another huge planet exploring a planet that highly resembles Earth. Bonus points for hunting with your friends, you won't forget the first triceratops you'll put down after a lot of teamwork, yes, the bow may not be the best weapon for hunting such beasts, but it surely can get the job done. Also, this comes to another point: can you play it offline? Yes, you can, but unlike The Hunter you WILL need some help taking down the larger animals and surviving the dinoes that hunt in pack, find some friends and do it together!\n\nAlso, as this game is based off on The Hunter, a hunting simulator, you can expect long walks and some frustrating situations,, but that is part of the features, if you don't like it, this game might not be for you.\n\nOf course not everything is great, and, for now, probably we can blame early access for it, sometimes the interface gets clunky, or there might be some technical errors. I am not mentioning the lack of content, as there is way too few dinossaurs and guns to keep you interest for a long time, but it will probably get only better with time.","December 16, 2014","true","62.4"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

Though shooting and everything else is basically the same as thehunter.\nIt is slow paced, you sneak around the jungle, avoiding the T-rex and maybe killing the smaller dinosaurs.\nIt seems like a game that would be good with a couple friends, all sneaking around trying to find better weapons.\noverall it is a good dinosaur survival game, (though there is no food/water requirements, just health) thats slow paced, only has a few dinosaurs, decent atmosphere and good either singleplayer or multiplayer (it has pvp and pve)\nid say for now in early access its a 7/10, though with more content and updates that will probably go up.\nEDIT\nAfter a bit more time, im going to talk about the atmosphere a bit more and do a basic pros and cons list.\nIn the regular game, you are wary of not disturbing the animals, but feel safe, though annoyed if you see a deer running away.\nIn Primal, you sneak around, constantly wary of not disturbing anything, like the first game, though you dont feel safe. If you are seen or heard, you might have a chance against the Utahraptors, but anything else will kill you or be very hard to kill. It adds a much more frightening atmosphere than the original, and is helped by the Jurassic Park-style destroyed facilities.\n\nPros-\n+ Good Atmosphere\n+ Nice Map (though there is only 1 at the moment)\n+ shooting physics/mechanic, however it isnt the greatest at doing quick draws if you are attacked, so it much favors stealth\n+ Decent Price\n+ Good for single or multiplayer\n\nCons-\n- Lack of dinosaur diversity\n- only 1 map ( so yeh, pro and con for that)\n- gameplay needs to be tweaked a bit so its easier to quickly shoot\n\nMeh-\nCant change loot spawn rates or starting equipment.

Avalanche Studios would have too much to lose if they ditched the game so do not see that happening. They are the ones responsible for the Just Cause games, I do not see them being willing to ditch a game to ruin sales of their other major games.\n-Yes there is bugs, it is early access.\n-Yes there is a lot of walking and patience required at some parts, this is hunting not a run and gun war game.\n\nSo far I am quite enjoying this game even at it's beginning state, from the amazing visuals to hunting and being hunted by dinosaurs.\nThere is currently 3 types of dinosaurs, 2 more planned during Early Access phase before release. You start off next to a pod in which you will receive a bow, arrows, and a map fragment, these items are quite weak (but can kill if used properly) and after exploring and surviving the dinosaur inhabitants you will stumble upon encampments and chests in which you can find loot. This can be anything from ammo, camo, health right up to guns.\n\nIf you are not careful you could wind up in the jaws of a T-Rex or ambushed by a pack of Raptors. Stealth is your friend when hunting these creatures. T-Rexs are not really advisable to hunt alone as they are extremely tough to take down but with a group of fellow hunters you can take them on. Raptors can track you and even plan to flank you, plenty of times some will creep up on you without you even noticing keeping you on your toes a lot of the time.\n\nYour items go with you after you relog or switch servers, they are with you until you die at which point if you want your items back you will have to run back to where you died to reclaim your items if someone has not already looted your items. PVP is an option for servers to have as well.\n\nSome people do complain about the damage of the weapons against the dinosaurs but the thing is, they're dinosaurs, not thin skinned humans. They have thick skin, thick skulls and small brains, you want to aim for vital organs such as the lungs/heart for the maximum effectiveness. A well placed shot will take down a Raptor in one shot, a T-Rex can be taken down with several well placed shots although if you hit in a not so vulnerable area it will take a lot more to take the mighty beasts down. Animals if hurt enough will bleed out over time as well, so do not just automatically expect a fleeing animal survived. Even the mighty T-Rex may flee if hurt enough.\n\nI do not want to give much about the story of the game away, but there is a bit of a storyline behind it which you will discover while playing if you keep your eyes peeled out for such things.\n\nAs for bugs, there is a few and I have crashed a few times but not enough for me to really complain.\n\nI could go on but this is already long. Overall if this is your type of game and do not mind supporting Early Access titles I would recommend it, if that does not sound like your thing, then wait it out.","December 16, 2014","true","39.3"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","0"

It's one of those 'survival sandbox' types, except.. streamlined? You have health, stamina, your only way of regaining health is rare-ish healing items and rare as crap mushrooms. You start with a bow and 10 arrows, bright friggin orange jumpsuit, and your trusty PDA map thingy. You pick your way through the landscape trying not to die and also find weapons/clothing/equipment at various ruined resource caches throughout the map. It's made with the engine of the prolific hunting game by the name of: TheHunter that i've played years off steam.\n\nTL:DR\nPros:\nRealistic AI: 'The hunter has become the hunted, hurrdurr'\nSatisfying gun/bowplay: Bloodsplats, you see your impacts and arrows sticking out of stuff.\nVaried-ish, huge map: You are on a giant subtropical island, swamps, beaches, mountains, and volcanic terrain\nPotential: TheHunter devs have been updating that game for years, and as satisfying as this is right now, wow!\n\nCons:\nServers: You basically have to make a solo multiplayer game to play, even if by yourself. As of this moment the only multiplayer games joinable are from folks who bothered to forward ports and all that. I hope that changes down the road as someone that enjoys multiplayer but also has a somewhat unstable connection.\nSteep difficulty curve: While by no means impossible, it so far has taken a long time to walk away from an encounter with raptors alive 50% of the time, not to mention with only a bow. I consider this game to be a DayZ lite, in that regard.\nLimited content: Despite my adoration of the game, as of this moment there isn't an awful lot in terms of weaponry/dinos to hunt/be hunted. 4 guns, I think 4 different outfits (counting hats and glasses and so on) 1 bow, 3 healing items, misc hunting gear, T-rex, Utahraptors, Triceratops.\n\n\nAll in all I totally reccomend this game for folks looking for a realistic sort of shooter where you roam around and loot stuff to survive and prosper. It's a survival game without the eating/drinking, which IMO leaves you a lot more time to worry about the staring at the t-rex 10 meters away while shivering.","January 22, 2015","true","30.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

Gunfire sounds extremely well in this game. You can hear a fellow hunter over 800m away fire round after round as he is swarmed by raptors.  Raptors sound great and you can hear them close in on you.\n-Terrain does what it should, the forest and different areas are very dense with foilage. So raptors can get real close to you without you seeing them. Stealth is a MAJOR part of gameplay.\n-The community seems very friendly and willing to help you or talk with you. Almost every game ive joined ive left adding a friend on steam.  Hunting together is extremely fun and has saved my life a few times being in a larger group. In that same note, ive seen 2 t-rexs tear up a crowd of players in a valley i was attempting to join up with.\n-The actual hunting can be really fun, as these dinosaurs can be tracked across the entire map, provided your skilled enough to keep their trail. It looks similiar to what i believe evolve is going to have for tracks. You can use dino calls, you scavenge for your gear like a dayz game, but your customizing and inventory is like an old school resident evil. Not much to it yet, there are scopes and different weapons but not many so far. 1 bow, 1 pistol, 2 rifles, 1 shotgun. different rounds for them liek the shotty has buck and slug.\nThe cons:\n-DINO AI..(sometimes)......it needs patching but potential is there. A dinosaur can hear you, see you, and even track you. The raptors work in packs and can provide an issue because you do seem to get attacked by them from multpile directions. However, sometimes they charge past you, or walk right by you even tho your not hidden, they walk funny up hills, they sometimes aimlessly make wierd turns,The trex seems to have a few malfunctions aswell. Theres only 3 dinosaurs at the moment, with what i assume is ALOT more to come. SOmetimes dinosaurs stand there or get stuck and you can take them down easily. Other times, you get killed and never even saw it coming. Due to the small amount of species in the game thus far, their interactions from what i have seen are minimal. Smaller dinos run away from the big one. I would love to see the world become more alive in future updates. Maybe come over a hill and find a pack of raptors attacking a herd of herbavores or a single trex. I wish the raptors necks would turn to acknowldge you, the seem very rigid at times. other times its fine.\n\nConclusion\nIts in alpha, and its already as solid as the carnivors games we had on pc in the early 2000s. Even with the bugs, that we all know alphas must go through, this game is a blast, and i do recommend it alsong as you dont get mad easily and can undertsand there will be problems as the game polishes out. I am having a blast though.\n..I made this 1min 40 sec youtube video of the game just for fun,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZH7idrkI58&feature=youtu.be","January 15, 2015","true","41.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","2"

The game starts off with a single pioneer. You are basically forced to Primal Eden at gun point to help the Expansion Galaxies eradicate dinosaurs on the planet. If you die your close relatives volunteer to pick up where you left off.\n2.

You can find weapons or buy them if your a high enough rank.\n3. When you kill one of the  five dinosaurs on the planet. You use your settlers mate to harvest it. There are rare dinosaurs aswell that drop special weapons that is later purchasable through the In game market when you die. From the harvests you gain G that is used to purchase these weapons and equipment.\n4. There is these settlements throughout Primal Eden that offer crates of weapons, equipment and ammo. Certain settlements offer special weapons that are extremely expensive in the in game market. Like the .50 cal rifle that is only found in one location and only spawns one  per server.\n5. Hosting a game is a bit difficult to setup. The game has a fare amount of bugs. You will have to open ports 42303 and 27015 in order to host. The game has no dedicated servers and what this means is your PC will become a server basically. You may still get the port error code message even if your ports are forwarded correctly. Your game may crash with other errors aswell.\n6. If your into open world  survival horror first person shooters where you can hunt dinosaurs or other players? Then I highly recommend this game.

This 3 things are very important in game.\n\nFor hunting you never musn't run because some on dinosaurs can hear you and attack you from behind. So all you need to is just to walk and you will come to place to place. At begging you start with bow and pda. For searching new weapons you need to find camps, there will be items or not, better items you have faster and more damage you will give. After you die you will lose the items you found and you will start again with bow and pda so be careful of dinosaurs and big hills. The map is huge. You need to spend pretty much hours to go everywhere.\n\nIf you want to survive you don't need to run always move and when you see dino try to avoid him or attack him if is not so dangerous... You need to go away from some plants that can steal your health or kill, avoid big hills because you can die if is a rock mountain.\n\nSome of Dinosaurs are not dangerous...

T Rex's are perhaps the most terrifying thing you will ever try to run, hide, or even fight, as even hiding silently they can randomly find you within dense foliage, or inside a hollow tree trunk.\n\nThere are a few problems with the inventory such as 1 buckshot round can take up the same amount of space as 5 buckshot rounds for example. It's like ammo is sorted out into individual groups, and once you run out of shots in an "ammo group", then you have to go into your inventory and place new group into the active slot, which would be tedious during a big fight.\n\nThe game is very slow paced, as the player must allways take care when traveling from outpost to outpost. Sprinting randomly while traveling can leave the player in dire situations. I haven't been able to play multiplayer yet, but when I do I will update my early access review. Overall, the game has a "hardcore" feeling to it, and I have enjoyed the game so far.\n\nUPDATE\n\nStarted getting into multiplayer, but no PVP stuff (perhaps for the better). We managed to take down a T Rex after tracking it for about 20 minutes, as it was wounded and we were following blood trails.\nVideo of the moment below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp8Vx3uavnY&feature=youtu.be\n\nOverall, I think I'm gonna be playing a lot more multiplayer now.","December 21, 2014","true","582.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The 3 dinosaurs, and duplicating glitches, allowed people to enjoy the game and have fun playing it. The ballence of rexs and the other dinosaurs were almost perfect, and if it released then, way more people would have played it. Then here comes the new updates, which ruined the game. First, the machette was added instead of the usual bow. The bow was good because, with experence, you could kill any dinosaur you wish. But now its almost impossible to hit or kill the flying Quetzalcoatlus or the rex due to the rex having its ability to stomp on you (even if you are ahead of it sometimes you can be "stomped"). What I also dislike was when the rex was in early alpha, you could dodge the rex, and could kill it with any type of weapon (even a bow if you had enough arrows). If would charge and you would dodge it. Simple as that. Then came the "improvements" with it. The first and fixed part was an increased spawn rate (which was bad, I will come back to this point in a minute), and secondly they "fixed" the rex running in one direction and can now (on a dime) spin and one shot you. Pair that with horrible hit markers and you got a n almost unkillable beast. The last and final straw was when they added the Quetzalcoatlus. They made the birds so common and so deadly (it would pick you up and drop you to your death) that most players stopped playing until the devs created a patch for them. The other "broken" thing about them is that it is almost impossible to "lead" you gun when they fly, and can only land a hit on them when they are in their attack charge. The worst part about these "birds" is that they can only be one shotted with a 700. gun (the 2nd best gun in the game) and even if you shoot it n the face with shotgun shells, it will shake off the damage and still kill you. Overall a unfinished and unpolished game.

Going to lay the line out flat now so you guys know the cons before anything else in this game.\n1. It's a survival/hunting game, so you have to scanvenge for gear and level for better gear. This depends on your forte in gaming, but there is no crafting in this game. So minecrafters......stay out.\n2. Still a few bugs to do with in game, but no need to fear. The devs have cleaned this game quite a bit since early access and its smooth and clean. so far anyway :D\n3. if you faint of heart and you don't have a good set of headphones, i suggest you get them otherwise you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants every 5 mins at the start of your first day alone :P good luck!\nNow the pros of this game\n1. 5 dinosaur species, Trex, 2 sets of raptors, Velociraptor and Utahraptor <(I'm from jurassic park). and the famous triceratops and lastly the quatzocoatlutus. Each animal is extremely unique and can be very dangerous to you if you dont know whats up, read up your guides and even then, you won't be prepared.\n2. Buddies, amazing that you have em. With the games Co-op/pvp servers which you can create on your own simply opening a port in your router. Now you have friends to play with and dont forget steam voice chat! communcation is key when hunting a rex. Or maybe you get caught in a ravine and mashed by 30 raptors :P\n3. Very expansive world, there isnt anywhere on this map you can't travel and mutliple biomes to explore. From the plains to the volcano it doesnt get any better then this. I have personally walked the map a few times now, and it roughly takes up to 8 hours if not more to cover it all. Have fun!\n4. Graphics are gorgeous even on a lower power PC. The animals look amazing, between the butterflys to the leaves falling the game doesnt get any better than that.\nNow you now the pros and cons and a whole 30 bucks and look what it got me :P 400 hours of good ole fashioned fun so please join the game and our community. The more support this game gets the more dinos it may or may not have to weapons etc. And think of you and your buddies getting together to go hunt a rex for that big trophy only to be eaten! Its a blast and it gets my 5 out 5 stars. Good luck out in the field folks!","April 26, 2015","true","611.7"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","2"

To this day a lot of people still have trouble hosting, even after forwarding the correct ports, which they shouldn't have to do in the first place!\n\nThis game was more fun in its EA stage than it is right now. They released it prematurely without ironing out all the bugs.\n\nThe dino populations and AI are still a mess. There are glitches o' plenty (Birds grabbing you even though you're clearly out of reach, Rexes biting through walls etc.)\n\nGameplay is missing basic fundamentals. (No jump ability, Crippled Aim Down Site/Slow movement while aiming, inadequate stamina, etc.)\n\nNo dedicated servers. (official or player hosted)\n\nNo control for the Game host. (weather control, selective dino species, gear theft -other players can take your gear in the PVE environment-)\n\nThere are no interactions between the Dinos. No Bull Trikes battling each other. No raptors ganging up on Trikes. No rexes eating raptors. Boasting "most realistic" and then delivering this as a final product? You gotta be kidding me...\n\nAt one point I loved where this game was going.\n\nAt this point I cannot recommend it.\n\nI really hope they make some drastic changes soon.

I'll try to ignore it and just play. Then I spent the next 20 minutes dying over and over from  the flying dinosaurs on the map. There was no way to counteract them I couldn't hide, run, on fight them off becasue I couldn't find any weapons due to the strange foliage problem. I doubt I would have been able to kill them if I even wasn't dealiing with my strange glitch as what these enemies do is pick you up, fly you way up in the sky, and drop you for a one hit kill.

I was able to kill one Raptor with a bow so far which was fun. I can't wait to see how the game progresses during this early access period.\n\nI did encounter an achievment glitch which gave me 4 achievments on entering my frineds map. They were all travel achievments that I did not earn which would have been given after traveling 15km - 200km but thats not a big issue :P\n\nThe dinosaurs look great and tracking is fun just like in theHunter but the way you funtion has slightly changed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harvenator02/recommended/322920/","harvenator02","RV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harvenator02/","49 products in account","Ok, so let me start by saying I do enjoy this game a lot, but I (and im sure many others) would like it a lot better if there were more dino's and possibly even more weapons, but I'm not too fussed about it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\ntheHunter: Primal is a hunting game. So don't go into it expecting to be able to kill the dino's, cook their meat and eat it, or be able to build a shelter. This game is a survival game, but not in the sense like the forest or stranded deep. I haven't played the normal theHunter game so I'm not sure if this game has the same mechanics, but i do enjoy the tracking system, and the ability to use stealth to your advantage to either hunt or get away from a dino. The game has no plot or storyline which does make it a bit boring for those people who expect to have an overall mission. 8/10 for gameplay.\n\nTHE MAP\nThe world that this game is set on is visually stunning (if you have a decent computer) and is actually really big, so you can spend a lot of hours just navigating your way around the map and discovering the different environments which in itself is enjoyable. The addition of settlements is great because they can provide players with a goal or shelter. 10/10 for the map.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nThis game is pretty much just a multiplayer game. There is no point even bothering to play singleplayer because you will die. I am yet to play on a PvP server because personally I find it more enjoyable to hunt with others, not against them. This game is meant for friends to actually play together and take down a rex, which is why you can buy it in a 4-pack. You will find people even in PvE servers that will backstab you and take your stuff, but you will find even more people that will help you survive if you are a new player ( I have helped multiple new player get to a settlement and get some gear). 8/10 for multiplayer.\n\nDINO AI, SPAWNRATE AND HITBOXES\nOk, so this is defeniatly the biggest issue that the game has. The AI for most of the dino's is really annoying and is kinda dumb (they are working on improving this though). The spawnrate of dino's is actually reasonably good at the moment, and pretty much all old players will know of the problems created by some updates (When they increased the rex spawn rate so you couldn't walk through a field without seeing 10 rexes, and the Quetz update where you couldn't walk though a field without being dropped to your death). The hitboxes at the moment are terrible and gotta be fixed. I have been picked up by quetz's when i am standing 10 feet on either side of it, and bitten by Utahraptors even when I sidestep them. 6/10 for the AI, spawnrate and hitboxes\n\nOVERALL VERDICT\nOverall, i would defeniatly recommend this game for people looking for a game which provides a good teamwork experience, and are looking to make friends while hunting dino's (it's a win-win if you ask me). I would tell people that want a game where they can just jump in and start spraying dino's to look somewhere else.\n8/10 rating for the whole game.","April 9, 2015","true","72.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","16","22","3","0"

Although still in Early Access, I think this game is oozing with potential, a few things will need to be changed and added, such as sorting out the spawnzones, adding more dinosaurs and changing how frequent those darn raptors are, but all in due time! Although this version has more to do with Survival, it is still much like the original TheHunter, as this game is very strategic and also very entertaining, intense and immersive once you get going! (especially on multi player).\n\nThis is how my gameplay has been so far:\n1st life: Spawned into the world, only to find myself instantly surrounded by Utahraptors, I majestically pulled out my bow and managed to kill 4 of the little buggers, only to be killed by a 5th one that caught me off guard... "Clever girl...".\n2nd life: Spawned to hear more Utahraptors; I ran before obtaining a bow and died instantly.\n3rd life: Spawned in a clearing, only to hear a loud, booming roar behind me.

They COULD HAVE just told me what this error meant or if they even knew what it meant in the first reply but for some reason didn't and just said "sorry for the delay.

It won't make you wet yourself with glee but it's nice and clean.  No painful visual issues, at all.  Whoever did the lighting work did an excellent job.\n\nControls: 8/10\nThe controls are a bit unwieldy.  I adjusted the keyboard settings and it became quite comfortable though.

I understand that it is an in dev game but there is oddly little to do.  Maybe more will come later but for those considering buying let me simplify it.  Right now, your life will consist of first hiding and crawling around on your belly to avoid scaly monsters.  Then, if you are very very lucky, you will get a weapon and it becomes your job to stop hiding and hunt them.    There are no other activities, strictly speaking, as far as I can tell.  You decide if that's fun for you.\n\nPrice: 3/10\nWhile I definitely see the possibility for this game to become good I would say, 'Save your money for a bit.'

I can't even count how many times I've screamed out loud in terror as a pack of Utahraptors rushed me or a T-rex snuck up on me. It's a very intense and addictive game, but I recommend adding more than just the 2 new dinosaurs (whatever they may be) in the further future. You need more herbivores than just the Triceratops, so that you can have a realistic ecosystem. Also, if you plan on adding animals like Edmontosaurus or Parasaurolophus, there will definitely need to be better herding mechanics like with the Caribou and Elk in theHunter. So yeah, my only real concern right now is primmitive herding mechanic and lack of herbivores, but I'm certain you guys won't disappoint!","February 5, 2015","true","74.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Yes they have feathers wich means the developers didnt fall into the jurassic park trap and made all the dino's like the movies.\n\nDINOSAURS\n\nThe game now has 4 dino's the Tyranosaurus Rex the Triceratops the Utah Raptor wich is the raptor they SHOULD've used in jurassic park and the Velociraptor. I like the modelling of the dino's and the behaviour off them is great.\n\nI realy Like the new AI Utahraptors are a lot more dangerous and can instakill if you give them the chance.\n\nThe Velociraptors are a nice species that is realy hard to see in fiolage and can be a real thread if you are almost out of ammo. It gives a more scary feeling to the game wich is always good.\n\nRexes are smarter too and use their senses more like smell and hearing. So you should keep your distance without the proper ammo.\n\nTriceratops should still attack more 1 out of 10 attacks at the moment and this isnt enough I think it should be if you shoot badly it should attack you.\n\nGAME OVERALL\n\nI like this game a lot, this is the game i was looking for, for about 10 years now. The survival and hunting combo is great.\nMany people are talking about crafting etc but i dont like this. I like it how it is now but i would like some missions. Maybe some sort of campaign in single player and one seperate for multiplayer. Like bring a package there or hunt these animals maybe give some rexes names like in the logs. ( big chop etc...)\n\nYes i know about the steam achievements but I dont think this will keep me busy.\n\nLeveling is nice and if you choose you can buy some ammo or even weapons and camo in the shop but only when you die. I first thought it to be a bit lame but now I understand that it is to give you a headstart and I like it.\nIt means that you still have to loot after you bought things when you run out.\n\nPVE or PVP\n\nWell i only played PVE and I realy like the fact of hunting together. Only one thing could be added in PVE and thats locked bags so if you die nobody can steal your stuff. For that they need to do PVP.\n\nWEAPONS\n\nBow - Its the first weapon you get on primal eden. Its not very powerfull so you have to get close range with dinosaurs and aim very well. I wouldnt advice using it on a rex.\n\n.44 handgun - Nice little handgun for using on the velociraptors and utahraptors although its not strong enough for rex you can kill a trice with it if you aim it right.\n\nShotgun - My second favorite weapon its a very good weapon against all dino's when you learn how to use it. I have killed many rexes with it close range and against large utah raptor packs its realy the only option to get out off it alive.\nIt has 2 kinds of bullets Buck wich spreads and Slug wich is a large solid bullet i leave it up to you to find out wich is best for what.\n\n.308 Marksman Rifle - My favorite weapon I use it for all dino's although its very very hard to kill a rex with it because a rex doesnt take much damage from it long range. I think this is unrealistic though and if it becomes more powerfull over long ranges I would use it against rexes aswell.\nOh yeah and it has a scope maybe thats why I like it so much :).\n\n.700 Dual Barrel Rifle - It is the strongest weapon available in the game but weirdly I dont like it very much. It is a heavy rifle and it can kill a rex in 1 - 4 shots if aimed properly.\n\nBecause you have limited inventory space you can only take 2 big weapons and 1 little weapon. I choose the shotgun and .308 every single time so I can cary enough ammo for both.\n\nDEVELOPERS\n\nWel i heard some horror story's about developers before. (ehum stomping lands...)\nBut i think we can trust this lot, they always answer when they can and they keep fixing bugs and adding stuff.\nI realy like what im seeing here keep it up ;).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor an early acces game i can only say its great. The developers keep bussy. Its a nice sometimes even enslaving game. If you add ingame missions for me and my mates I would be more than happy.\n\nIf I have to give this game a grade I would give it 8 out of 10 maybe it gets to 10 out of 10 when its ready ;).\n\nI would recomment this game to people who like hunting games or shooting games where you have to sneak a lot. And ofcourse people who like dino's. But its not a silly game in wich you cant die by casual playing so keep that in mind.","February 5, 2015","true","197.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","13","18","3","0"

I've had and played this game since pre-release. It had so much potential. In its current state it is playable, but there are a lot of little bugs that will annoy you over time and you'll reach end game rather quickly with nothing else to motivate you to continue playing. The company behind the game is the main issue I have with the game and not the game concept itself. They are just not putting enough effort into keeping the game fresh and bug free. It's a real shame to see a good idea go to waste, but the company has a real bad track record for neglecting their other titles in similar fashions as they have with this one and being only motivated by money sadly. Now that they have people's money I don't honestly expect anything new (and not just some reskin or rehash) added to the game unless it costs extra and the only bug fixes I'd expect to ever see are ones that are gamebreaking but the little fine tuning ones like the multiplayer bugs will most likely never get fixed. I gave the game and the company a huge amount of time to prove me wrong, but sadly they haven't so now I don't have much hope that this game will ever reach its top potential. I have to vote negative on the game and not recommend it to others unless you're getting it free or as a gift. Just don't waste your money. It's pretty much a game that you'll play through completely once and never touch again as the replayability factor just isn't there. All I can hope for is at some point the company cleans up its act and comes back and actually cares about this game enough to take advantage of its full potential. If that ever does occur I will gladly change my review, but I'm not holding my breath at this point.","May 29","false","353.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

A name like Avalanche Studios carries weight with me, and that's mostly the reason I bought this game a few days after it came out on early access. It didn't have much content, but it was in early access, so I has expecting that they'd add more. I was so very much hoping that I'd able to return to this game after a few months of development. I was wrong.\n\nFirst of all, this is not a bad game. It's a good game, don't get me wrong. The graphics are amazing, the sound design is probably the best of any game I've ever played, the dinosaurs are well designed and the terrain is well crafted. The world is massive and will take you at least an hour to walk from one side to the other on foot.\n\nWith that being said, mechanically, this game is sound, more or less. The new flying dinos broke the game with their bugs, (thankfully, the worst one was fixed) they fly through terrain, are sometimes impossible to see or hear, and make you unable to reclaim your gear after you become dino-chow. There are a few more bugs related to the dinosaurs, but thankfully I've never encountered a crash.\n\nThe game (to my knowledge) advertised this to be a survival game, but, don't be fooled: there is anything that remotely has to do with the "survival" genre that we've come to know and love within games like The Forest and Stranded Deep. The only type of "survival" to be found here is the kind where you avoid not being killed. This IS "survival", per se, as surviving literally means "not dying", but hey, semantics. I was really looking forward to the kind of survival that I thought was being advertised, and I suppose that it could be said that it was my misinterpretation of what I read that lead to my disappointment. I was so excited to make a base, look for food, water and weapons, make medicines and then go hunting for some large extraterrestrial lizards. (Yes, in case you didn't know, this game takes place on an alien planet.) I do know for sure that this game labels itself as "realistic". This is probably where my misconception originated from:\n\n"Hunt - Explore - Survive The most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created." theHunter: Primal, 2014.\n\nThere's nothing realistic about hunting dinosaurs on an alien planet. Trust me. I know my ♥♥♥♥. But do I care about that? No, of course not. I get to hunt dinosaurs realistically, of course. All sillyness aside, and to summarize what I've just said, I'm sad I can't have a real dino-hunting/survival game.\n\nThis leads me to me largest and most bitter gripe with this game: there's no content. There's nothing. Literally. Well, not literally... there's a few gigs of space being taken up by this on my C: drive, but it's substance is lacking quite a lot. There are a total of 5 dinosaurs to hunt. 5 dinosaurs in total.This is a dinosaur hunting game with only 5 dinosaurs. Why? There are only a few weapons too. These are what I can think of: Magnum, Rifle, Shotgun, .50 cal Sniper Rifle, Machete, Bow. The bow is REALLY buggy too, and I've never found the .50 cal Sniper Rifle. While there are some cool attachments you can put on your weapons, there is no excusing the lack of content here. Sure the world is big, but what good is it if there's nothing to do.\n\nThe game is thirsty, it's STARVING, its emaciated; just begging---"Please, please, give me sustenance! Food, water!" And we're here, kneeling beside this sad mess of skin and bones, screaming, "Yes! Please! Feed it, FEED IT! WE BEG OF YOU!"\nThe developer answered our cries for more content by saying, "Hmm... maybe. If it sold more copies, we might."\n\n(I can provide a link to the discussion thread where a dev said this, if anyone wants it. Assuming they don't delete it, of course. The thread is titled "Post-release heads up.)\n\nUhh. I paid $20 dollars for this game. For some unimaginable reason, the devs think that the small, bare-bones amount of content they added within the few short months of early access somehow, and unexplainably, warrented a 50% increase to the price of the game. It's insulting, really. I never would have bought this game in early access if I knew that they wouldn't add anything to it. That's the risk we take when we buy early access games and technically it is our fault for making a bad purchase, but still, it makes me feel sh*tty. Something needs to be done about early access and fast, otherwise, I'm probably never going to buy early access again. The sheer amount of failures of games that come out of that proverbial cesspool too early, or in this case, looking like a actor/actress who overdid the pea soup diet for their first appearance at the Academy Awards is staggering. To conclude, this game is a massive disappointment and a massive waste of potential, one of the largest for me in recent memory. Do youself and your loved ones a favor and stay away from this thing.\n\nI might have expected this sort of thing from Expansive Worlds, but not Avalanche. Why Avalanche, why! I'm not not sure what kind of role they played in developing this game, but just the fact alone that they had anything to do with this game makes me want to give Just Cause 3 a miss.","April 1, 2015","false","4.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/armitige/recommended/322920/","armitige","Armitige","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armitige/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\ntldr; I'm recommending this game, but only if you're a fan of Avalanche Studio's other hunting sim, theHunter, and games with roguelike death mechanics, like DayZ or Dark Souls, and only if you'd like to support the development of the game. It's at a point that I would consider very early development.\n\nAfter only playing this game for a little over an hour, I can say it's extremely challenging in it's current form. If you're adverse to dying a lot early on in a game, then this isn't for you. Unlike in theHunter, everything in these hunting grounds is in reality hunting you, and it's your job to avoid them as best you can, at least until you can get a better weapon than the crappy bow you start with.\n\nWhen you first spawn, you're presented with the all too familiar tracking/GPS tool you use in theHunter. In this it's called the Settlersmate, the premise of the game being you're a convict, banished to an island on a planet called Primal Eden, and tasked with "cleaning up" the island of it's wild life. In front of you is what appears to be the pod you are dropped onto the planet in. It contains an improvised bow, 10 arrows and a map fragment. That's your starting kit, but don't expect to be taking down a lot with it. It does very little to most of the inhabitants of this paradise, other than to serve to ♥♥♥♥ them off. The map fragment uncovers a small, random portion of the map, which is mostly blanketed by a 'fog of war'.\n\nFrom then on, you're pretty much on your own to roam around the map. Keep a sharp eye on your Settlersmate, because there are supply crates that can contain ammunition, possibly weapons (although I've only ever found the starter bows), and occasionally new items of clothing scattered about, and a few POIs you can stumble across that usually have loot crates, and even a little bit of lore.\n\nIf you're unlucky enough to come across any dino activity, it works pretty much the same as in theHunter. You get an audible queue from your Settlersmate and you can left click to analyze the sound or track marks.\n\nThis game mixes the hunting simulation of theHunter with roguelike elements of games akin to DayZ (if the zombies were gaint eating machines that can run at 30mph). You die, you respawn in a random location on the map (which looks to be quite enormous), with the starter kit.\n\nPros:\nExtremely large map (although right now seems mostly empty of POIs)\nUses a proven game engine, so the graphics are decent for such a lite client.\nUses theHunter's tracking system.\nGreat audio queues.Cons:\nDinosaur AI can be quite derpy. The first dino I encountered was a T-rex, and after circling a wooden structure to avoid it, it seemed to become stuck in stuck on it. Dinos also seem to have some kind of 6th sense, and almost always wander straight towards you when you get within a certain distance of them.\nThe starter gear seems woefully inadequate. If you're very lucky, you can kill a utahraptor with 1 or 2 arrows, but the 2 to 3 other 'raptors in the pack will kill you, and forget about even denting a T-rex, I plugged 1 with about 30 arrows in the head, it was seriously a pin cushion, and it did little more than ♥♥♥♥ it off.\nI only encountered 2 dinosaur species. I've read there's only 3 in the game.\nExtreme levels of challenge makes this a game not everyone will like, but if you're a fan of Avalanche's other hunting sim, you might enjoy the reversal of roles.","January 12, 2015","true","2.5"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

Then they decided to throw the flying dino in the game (which is broken overpowered) and apparently decided to up the spawns on other dinos. At least from what i've seen today. I'm not sure if the developers got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the guy giving them the deadline and said "fine, lets jack this #### up and give them the release they want" or if they are actually that incompetent as to what players want in a game. At any rate, unless they either do a rollback patch or fix the current state of the game it's essentially unplayable. Unless you enjoy dying every few minutes. You may make it 15 minutes with EXTREME caution and a lucky spawn. Good luck killing anything of value though.","March 31, 2015","false","15.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

SOOO MUCH. This could've been game of the year (being generous). But like most every other game creators and developers out there, they just want your money. I got this during early access thinking it was going to be some awesome game with tons of dino's, and gun's. Also the thought of building a fort or post, to hunt from, and keep my guns, sounded awesome as most people thought. This game had SOO much going for it. And then it was released and the only thing we got out of all the ideas, us players have been showering the developers with, was a flying dino. Thats it. Just 1 dino. I was in shock. But then i thought wait. They just want your money.\nSo, bottom line, if you want a buggy, laggy (sometimes), crappy (via multiplayer) game that lets you hunt only 5 dinos then by all means waste your hard earned money on this.

Its got five weapons as of this point in development- Bow, pistol, shotgun with slugs or buckshot, 308 rifle, and the .700 double rifle. Your prey are raptors, tricerotops, and Tyranosaurrus Rex. The game starts off very punishing as you discover alot of your movements only work to aid raptors and rexes to find you. But you get used to how everything works and soon your getting the first attacks in and eventually rounding up the troops and getting revenge on the rex that just ate you.\nSeeing a rex lower its head and widen its stance to get ready to charge is downright horrifying. The stomping around as it gets closer and eventually shakes the screen with screams puts you into the scenerio of being the prey for once. Raptors have calls that you will learn as well. They have different vocalisations for when they hear you, when they spot you, and even then they plan on lunging at you.\nThere are some downers about the game though becuase its still early in development. It crashes alot still, often times at clutch moments right before a big takedown, or after you die, when you drop items, or during a trophy shot. Hosting a game requires you to open ports and thats annoying for many.\nI still find that this game is highly addicting and worth playing. I have no doubt in my mind that many of the issues will be ironed out before its formal release. I do love this game and I've been playing it non stop. I recommend this game whole-heartedly.","December 31, 2014","true","409.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

These pauses last no longer than 13 seconds but still can be rather frustrating.

Yet, maybe that's why I came out of it pleasantly surprised at the quite enjoyable game play. It's similar to theHunter, which is also made by the same people, in the way it plays. You follow tracks or dinosaur sounds to find them, then shoot them, and have to track them down to claim your prize. However, this being dinosaurs, it doesn't tend to go that smoothly.\nI will admit I've encountered the bug or two, having been launched into the air by a raptor who took a bite out of my face before running away, the stand button suddenly not working as I'm having my groin ravaged or watching as raptors furiously run into a wall as they attempt to flee from me after I've shot them.\nHowever, despite all this. It's fun, and can be quite exhilarating when you suddenly find yourself smashed into by a Quetz for the first time or hear the footsteps of a T-Rex that's now dangerously close, having to fall to the floor and hold your breath in the hopes it will pass you by.","May 19","true","22.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You will poo your pants the first time the screen shakes and you hear the t-rex stomping!\n4) Supports multiplayer and is extremely fun to play with friends\n5) The dinos looks so amazing\n6) Giant world to explore\n\nCons:\n1) The dinosaurs can act a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, they don't really behave as you would expect\n2) If you crouch or lie still, the dinos will still find and kill you. There is no way to not die if spotted by one\n3) Messy inventory aka. no way to "mash" ammo together. It just takes up unnessecary space\n4) Camoflage does not really work as you would expect\n\nIf I had the chance to make any changes in the game as is, I would make the dinosaurs behavoiur a bit more "predictable" and realistic in terms of what you would expect to happen if you were either walking very quiet or lying perfectly still. It can be extremely annoying at times when you spot a dino 200 meters away, lie still, and somehow the thing still manages to track you down and eat you for lunch.\n\nAll in all I really do recommend this game to pretty much any one.","December 22, 2014","true","389.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Its not hard finding the animals.....they will find you. It starts you with a bow and from there you can use it to protect yourself as you branch out to find weapon and supply crates. If you enjoy a difficult play style then this will keep you on the edge of your seat.\nIf you have a few friends who also have this game, a lot of fun can be had. The only issue, is you always have one friend that can talk your group into the worst ideas.....such as all 6 of you trying to take down a t-rex with only bows. Can it be done? I dont know, most of us got ate and the survivors spent quite a bit of time crawling out of the area to regroup. It was a bad idea and we all knew it but it was alot of fun.\nThe people who are reviewing this, saying its too hard, are not skilled players or they have no friends....or both. Just as you do in any hunting game, where you place your shots matter, go for the vital organs or spine. Just keep in mind that the animals your hunting in this game, are not going to get spooked and run away.\n\nAs of the time I am writing this, I have 12.3 hrs logged and 0 t-rex kills.

And now you can be a hunter on a prehistoric island. What is better than running around in an island with friends hunting T-Rex's and other dinosaurs? This game is a great addition to theHunter series. Being theHunter but with new prey to hunt is great. This game is very well developed, and has quite an active player base with dedicated servers to join friends or other random players.\n\nPros:You can hunt DINOSAURS\nBeautiful graphics and animations\nGood net code for online gameplay\nProgress/gear can be server transferred\nGood weapon mechanics\nVery large map\n\nCons:Few guns or weapons to choose from\nLimited clothes/gear selection\nSome dinosaurs seem to take too much damage\nNo vehicles so get ready to walk/run a lot\nSometimes repetitive kills of the same type\nNo progression system except leveling which doesn't directly give you anything\n\nConclusion:If you enjoy theHunter, theHunter: Primal is great addition to your library. This gives the same great realistic hunting experience but with dinosaurs that chase you. Only if the overall item list was larger and more diverse prey this game would be perfect. If you're looking for a realistic hunting game with a touch of fantasy this a good choice.\n\nFor more reviews check out  Original Curators Group\n","September 23, 2015","true","10.3"," 51 of 95 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","51","95","9","3"

The game has sub par graphics and many technical problems, so why am i recommending it.\n\n1) The graphics are still good and it is accaptable for an indie game, i call it this because it is a small company. The graphics do not bother me in the slightest.\n\n2) The gameplay is difficult but very fun. You must learn where certain dinosaurs roam and avoid the dangerous areas until equiped properly. In many of my encounters i am killed quickly but i learned to avoid dinosaurs until i had looted a gun from a supply box. Tactics and teamwork is essential to playing this game.\n\n3) The developers are active and constanlty fixing issues and adding new content to their game.\n\n4) Supplies are always limited adding a scare factor to encounters. Inorder to survive you MUST pick your fights wisely, a pack utahraptors may be best avoided than going comando.\n\n5) Each type of dinosaur has a different personality and tactic they employ. You need to learn the behavior of the dinosaur that you are hunting or you will become the hunted.\n\n6) Players are typically very helpful and friendly.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game to a player who is looking for a game to play on the side. It has many entertaining aspects and the community is very friendly.","June 7, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomraptor-studios/recommended/322920/","phantomraptor-studios","PhantomRaptor (Overwatch)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomraptor-studios/","170 products in account","I have been meaning to create a huge, in depth review of this game for quite a while, so I hope it is helpful to some new players that, hearing things said from others, may be a little wary.\n\nHistory of theHunter PrimalThe developers of theHunter and theHunter Primal, Expansive Worlds are constantly involved with educational visits and there is normally at least 2 interns at any time working in the development team alongside the regular, employed developers. The development team have also had lots of requests in the past to add dinosaurs to theHunter and had been interested in doing so in the past before, but they felt it would ruin the realism that many players of the game (a fair amount of which are real hunters). So, behind the scenes they started work on Primal, which was originally given the name 'Project Flintastek' (which according to google translates to 'Flintstones Fry', the developers are Swedish). Project Flintastek also quickly become a program for the interns to work on and quickly became a place where new ideas, gameplay mechanics and... stuff, would be worked on experimentally, after Project Flintastek was starting to look more and more like a complete game, Expansive Worlds decided to make it as a full game and started more serious development on it and thats where we are today.\n\nThe StoryStory clearly isn't the main focus of theHunter Primal, nor should it be really, this game is about hunting primarily, however it still manages to tell an interesting story, that is, if you are eagle-eyed enough to find the hidden logs and traces left by previous Pioneers and some kind of native inhabitants, or just, really loopy people. The story that we know first off is that you are sent down onto this alien world to kill (hunt) the native inhabitants, which just happen to be very similar to the dinosaurs that we know from our past. If you fail? Your close family will be offered up as pioneers themselves. So, dont fail. Whilst I say that story shouldn't be the main focus of this game, it would be awesome if it were included/integrated more, such as finding an old camera that would then play a cutscene of a settlement being attacked, or something similar. But, yeah, interesting story but sadly most of it is hidden away in log entries of abandoned old settler mates.\n\nUpon stepping into the game world for the first time...You will be equipped with nothing but a Machete, some basic clothing and boots as well as a map fragment, which will highlight a random settlement on your map (these are the only places to find weapons). It immediatley hits home the feeling of helplessness as you are stuck on an alien planet, with just a machete to defend yourself. However, if you are just starting out, find a map on the internet and go to a settlement. You are going to need a better gun, I would also reccommend playing only on your own for a while as this will help you get better at the game more than if playing with friends.\n\nIn the first hour of playing...Within the first hour you will have certainly met your first dinosaurs and hopefully have found your first proper weapon, preferably in reverse order. This is when you will, probably start to get frustrated. This game, you realise, is hard as nails and I will admit, it is very unforgiving for new players to theHunter series or just new players in general. However, if you stick at it like I did and keep trying, you will get the hang of it and start hunting dinosaurs, instead of them hunting you.\n\nGeneral Review of the GametheHunter Primal is, and dont get me wrong here, incredibly frustrating, at times very difficult and can, at its very worst feel like a chore, having to go and get your stuff of your dead body whilst avoiding what killed you. But other than that, the game is so, so enjoyable and when you finally start to get the hang of the game and get used to all of the mechanics etc... it is the most rewarding experience I have ever seen in video games, the sheer feeling of joy when you finally kill your first T.Rex or when you track down a wounded Triceratops to find it later, dead from bleeding damage and to claim it as a kill, or when you find ammo for your favourite weapon or just discover new things, these special moments are what makes the game so, so worthwile. It can also be a very eerie and creepy experience, so people who don't want to get their heart racing should probably stay away from this title... it can get so intense when a T.Rex is just metres away from you and you are just lying in the ferns and vegetation, hoping that it wont spot you and that it will just leave already, the way the ground shakes with its footsteps can be downright horrifying.\n\nSo, to put it rather simply, theHunter Primal can be frustrating, but is an intensley rewarding experience that can both make your heart race with joy, or fear. If you are looking for a survival and building game, you wont quite find that here, despite being classed as a survival game this is a hunting game truly, you won't find crafting here.\n\nQuick Reviews of Individual AspectsGraphics - The Graphics in this game are very good and suit the tone of the game well, certain things could be done better, such as the character models and various textures being stretched on some areas of the environment, but this is a good looking game.\nGameplay - This game doesn't play like your typical survival shooter and actually takes a while to get used to how to use all of the functions and elements to aid your gameplay. The controls will feel slightly strange at first but you will definitley get used to it. It plays like a more fast-paced version of theHunter, the movement is faster as well as equipping weapons and items, everything is just smoother and more slick looking, so I would certainly reccommend that you go play theHunter if you are not sure about whether you will like this game, the movement etc is the same however the world and animal species are of couse, very different.\nUpdates - The developers have never yet missed a weekly update, except when they went on christmas holiday, which, to be fair, is totally acceptable.\nStability -  The game is, admittedly, somewhat plagued by glitches that can hamper (or at times, even enhance your experience) but none of them are of the game breaking variety.\n\nThe Future of theHunter PrimalEven though the game is 'finished' at the time of writing (11/05/2015 GMT) the developers have not missed a single weekly update (most commonly published on Thursdays) that will always either contain bug fixes, new content or changes and tweaks to the existing game. The developers say that there is no guarantee of new content to be added to the game however the future looks bright. As theHunter Primal has and will continue to be not just a standalone game, but also a place for interns and the developers to test new ideas and mechanics so it is very likely that, maybe not as frequently as we have had new content recently but it is not unreasonable to assume that as things are experimented with that we will see new content in Primal.","January 1, 2015","true","315.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Every now and then I would encounter a bug such as a flying Utahraptor(or whatever their called) or a wall-clipping T-Rex. This didn't happen often but when it did I lost alot of good stuff and I got quite upset. My final complaint is that the AI in this game are really dumb or really smart and by that I mean sometimes they would spot me from a mile away when im crouching or prone, other times I could walk right in front of them without being spotted. In conclusion when the game is being fair I have alot of fun hunting and tracking dinos. I understand that this game is still in development but some of the problems are killing my gaming experience.\n\n[EDIT 1, 4/7/16] I came back to this game after not playing it for awhile and I am glad to see that some issues have been fixed but unfortunately some new issue seemed to have popped up as well. Crate spawns appear to be unbalenced. There are times where I would be walking for a hour without finding a single crate and there are other times where I would find 5 crates in under 7 minutes. I also tried playing multiplayer PVP. I joinded an almost full server and walked around the map for two hours without finding a single person. Until the developers add a way to find and track players quicker I would not reccomend playing PVP. On the other hand PVE seems to be just fine. In PVE you can see other players on the map so it is easier to find people. In conclusion this game has gotton a lot better since my last review but I believe It still needs more work.\n\nPros:\n-Realistic Dino Tracking\n-Nice Looking Enviornment(Not The Best Looking But Still Good)\n-Money/Shop System Works Fine\n-GPS Feature\n\nCons:\n-Dinos Sometimes Wall-Clip(Walk/Kill Through Walls)\n-AI Are Really Dumb or Really Smart\n-Spawns Are Horrible\n-Crate Spawns Are Unbalenced\n\nGraphics-7.5/10\nAI-6/10\nPreformance-9/10\nGameplay-7/10\n\nOverall I would rate this game a 7.5/10.","August 21, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is no crafting, there is no real permanent shelter or objective. You walk, crawl, and run around hoping that the buggy glitchy dinosaurs dont ignore the multiple shotgun slugs to their heads and kill you.\n\nThe newest addition, quetzocoatalus, is the biggest annoyance of all. Spent HOURS collecting items, guns, and ammunition? Too bad. death from above one hit killer.\n\nUtahraptor, velociraptor, tyrannosaurus, quetzocoatalus, and triceratops are the only other living things in this game. Its a little pathetic that in 2015 a game developer has only 5 dinosaurs in their DINOSAUR HUNTING GAME.\n\nSaying this is release worthy is embarassing to the devs, and insulting to everyone who paid for early access.

Not only can you set the 16 player servers to PvP, you will have to outsmart some raptors and T-Rex while hunting some triops.. small bugs in the early access stage but a pretty good looking game from the start!  You have to find items to build up your armament to take on these creatures.. You most likely will start with a longbow found in a pod.. pretty good feel in the game and massive size for the island.  You finally learn why crouching and staying "quiet" is an advantage ..  worth the buy in!!  Still.."the best forest" in any game!\n\n\nif you're thinking of TheHunter: Primal before xmas... good suggestion.. install "The Hunter" first thru steam.. then buy The hunter Primal.. you will recieve a free shotgun and 30 days premium in "The Hunter".. win win..  give it a shot..primal has PvP as well as Dino hunting.. still "The best forest" in any game!! IF you already have a "The Hunter" account outside steam.. you have to "link" it to the Steam version for teh gifts..easy..easy.. just install the hunter from steam and play it. The first screen that pops up allows you to add the hunter account you had outside of steam right to it.. works like a charm.. after, you can keep the steam version or just disconnect the steam version and go back to playing it thru TheHunter website.. hope this helps.","December 16, 2014","true","7.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The Cretaceaous style world looks and sounds great.  The dinosaurs sound realistic to me, meaning they sound like actual animals instead of movie monsters.  Their behavior seems believable as well.  This is a hunting game and not an all out action game, so patience and thought are required.  There is a minimal storyline that serves it's purpose, but this game is all about your experiences hunting, being hunted, and trying to survive.  This game creates some truly frightening situations.  You really feel like you're being stalked.\n\nI think there should have been a couple more herbavore species in the game, because as far as i know, the triceratops is the only plant eater in the game.  The rest are carnivores, which makes it seem less realistc.  The weapons are very scarce.  I'm glad it takes time and effort to get them, but sometimes they seem too hard to come by.  I always play alone, so this problem is probably not so bad in multiplayer, since you can scavenge weapons from dead players.\n\nI would certainly recomend this game to anyone that likes dinosaurs and/or hunting games.  I'm already hoping for a Jurassic themed sequel or add on.\n\n\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","20.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I've played almost right when the game came out. I heard of it through TheHunter. Since at the time, I played just Thehunter. But, In the end, I ended up playing this one over the normal TheHunter. There was more to do with friends and it was a faster pace. Who doesn't like Dinos? It's a very pretty game, and realistic looking. But anyways, this game has been through many changes. There was a time where Triceratops were nice and ran away. And also a time where there were groups of T-Rex would never let you retrieve your items, Lol. I can remember how mad I was back then. Back in that time too, there was no in-game store, when you died. So there was no point to die. This game was just so much fun to play with my friends. I miss the times we had, haha.\n\nTo keep the game alive, They could and should add more to the game, even if it's DLC. A new map with 5 more dinos would be nice. More places to visit, new guns in the new map. They could also add more achievements along with that. One more thing that would be nice, is more characters. You do kinda get tried seeing the same people everywhere, since there's only 4 to choose from.\n>>>But going along with this, there are some bugs that are really annoying. They need fixed bad. One is where the drop-pod disappears and you don't get anything in there that you bought, obviously. And there's another where when a dino is shot and it glitches the animal in an idle state, and you can't claim it. (Though sometimes you can, if you figure out where it actually died.) But the one that is the most annoying- There is one where if you set extra ammo you bought down, it disappears. That is really in need of fixing.<<<\n\nAnyways, overall I feel this game is worth buying. But keep in mind, this game isn't just like COD or any crazy shooting game. You can't just expect T-rex to die in one shot. And you the player are slow, you do not have infinite stamina or ammo. So running around shooting, you are going to waste your ammo. If you like games where you can just shoot with unlimited ammo, go play something else.\n\nMy Rating: ★★★★☆.","April 23","true","662.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Ammo in general is easy to find keeping it is another thing how many shots does it take to kill a T-Rex? everything you shoot at you run out of ammo they charge you kill you with one hit and you start the game over again and again and this gets a little repeitive. I didn't read any of the reviews on this game because I wanted to play it for myself and do my own review.  this game has a lot of potential but it lacks a lot of things that will make it a great Multiplayer game. #7 the glitches are very annoying the crashes are as well, you can't save your progress to keep your map open or to find your way back to the pile of poop to get your Map fragments that the T-Rex pooped out When it ate you. I was hoping for a lot of great things in this game but I only found that the more I played it the more I hated it. #8 the weapons or lack of them. 11 different kinds of weapons but no Machine guns no throwing weapons no explosives no shoulder fired weapons So the very basic weapons to survive the Dinosaur world, if your alone and you fire at one most likely it will kill you. maybe the devs who made this game had godmode and unlimited ammo because I highly doubt they can survive 1 day without it. #9 when you split ammo you lose some of it somehow could be a glitch but it has happened since day 1 and it's annoying. this is one of those games that you should look at watch some video's of it but keep walking. i would have hated to play this game right out of early access and now it's been a while I can see the problems with the game when it was released are still going strong. #10 in a group of 8 people we decided to go through a dense forrest to get to 4 other players who were on the other side Well between us all we had a small Army of weapons none of us made it out because the Velociraptors killed everyone they move faster than you can aim at them they kill you even faster they jump on your face start sucking out your eyeballs and move onto the next hunter when your dead. they are easy to kill but you have to be able to hit them. the game settings keep changing during gameplay if you set your aim at a higher rate and your look at a higher look the first time you encounter anything the game changes your settings so you can't keep up with the movement of the Dinosaurs and that is another reason I hate this game. needing to go back into settings but wait you can't you can only do that before you start the game what a joke. no game settings while in game? 2 Thumbs down on this game. I think ill wait for about a year before playing this title again.","September 8, 2015","false","11.9"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","4"

The t-rex walking sound… is simply superb! And you can imagine that this game will get better and better over time, as EW by this many years doing the theHunter are experts in hunting games.\nUnlike theHunter, it’s a fast paced game where you will enjoy every minute. Sometimes I got bored in theHunter because I would rush and eventually scared off the animals ending up not seeing one or taking a lot of time to find one. In theHunter: Primal, you don’t have that problem. If you can’t find an animal, they will find you! (and you might regret it… lol). Also, there’s nothing else to pay in the game. In Primal, you just buy the game and that’s it. Everything that’s in game it’s yours and you don’t have to pay for anything else.\n\nComplete opinion at http://www.hucorner.com/blog/thehunter-primal-early-access/","December 21, 2014","true","234.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fishfishbutterbutter/recommended/322920/","fishfishbutterbutter","Cross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fishfishbutterbutter/","332 products in account","DETAILED PROS AND CONS - TL;DR PARTS HAVE THESE THINGS [ ]\n\nPros:\n\n\n- Looks pretty. Really pretty.\n\n- Runs on a toaster at 60 frames, even if it says 3 ghz processor my buddy can run it fine on low with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop.\n\n- DINOSAURS.\n\n- Rewarding when things go to plan.\n\n- [Dinosaurs have all of their internal organs mapped out and different weapons will have different effects in the sense that you probably wont penetrate the skull of a T-REX with a bow.]Enemies have lungs,heart,spine,neck, all that good ♥♥♥♥ just like all the animals in theHunter and they respond accordingly. If you put holes in a T-REX's intestines, he is going to bleed out very slowly. If you damage it's legs it's going to move slower. The more blood it loses the more it is stunned and once it is really not feeling well it'll likely try to run away to the safety of others T-REX-es.\n\n- [Tracking system of theHunter, including the ability to find DINOSAUR ♥♥♥♥. ]Scan tracks with the PDA to get detailed information rather than just looking at them, but if you're a badass following them as they run away in fear (like me) you can just look at it and the finer details of the track are physically able to be seen on the ground (bright red blood for lungs/heart and darker for body). This also includes if the animal is fleeing or just roaming an area, or whatever, just like theHunter.\n\n- Dynamic experiences in the game can make for some very memorable moments. A friend and I were in a large open area on a huge volcanic rock formation when we heard raptor sounds on the other side. Suddenly spanned 10 meters apart infront of us, 4 raptors slowly started to walk towards us. We fired, they charged, had an epic showdown where my buddy almost got killed as 2 we did not see earlier decided to flank us hard along our right, which was covered by rocks.  Another time we both managed to stealth our way past a pack of T-REX(es?).\n\n\n- It seems [certain types of dinosaurs inhabit certain types of terrain], a pack of T-REX can be found in a valley and around it for a while, while we encountered many raptors in dense forest (p.s: spooky as ♥♥♥♥)\n\n- Variety of terrain, has swamps, valleys, large dark forests, large bright forests, forest clearings, large mountains, volcanic rock stuff, deserted settlements etc.\n\n- Map is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big. And I mean, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big.\n\n- Really nice atmosphere, rebuilt sound system from theHunter to give you a really nice experience with a world that feels alive (can see butterflies and dragonflies and all that ♥♥♥♥, mice on the jungle floor at times).\n\n- [Can find datapads with lore and further story of the game found on them, mostly diary entries of characters that had spent their time there before.] Can usually find decent loot here and they're near settlements or camps and ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- (Opinion) Game isn't meant to be easy and you do have to learn as you play to know how to survive. I managed to get it down quite quickly since you can take from the mechanics of theHunter. It's similar to theHunter except much more rewarding to successfully evade your enemies, since they are essentially hunting you at times when you need to hide.\n\n- (Opinion) T-rex likes to nominate you for their space program\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- [Dinosaurs DO NOT ATTACK EACHOTHER.] Seriously this one was the worst to find out, big ole triceratops was rushing a T-REX I was hiding near and he just runs right past to have a sip out of the water. Worst ♥♥♥♥ing thing, I was expecting him to go FULL ♥♥♥♥ING BRAWL/BRO MODE. But nah, never happened. Hopefully this gets added in.\n\n- [Only FIVE types of dinosaur are in the game right now.] Hopefully they add more but right now they have Utahraptors, T-rex and Triceratops, Velociraptos and the Quetzalcoatlus.\n\n- [Not too many weapons in the game, as I've found all of them] (.44 revolver, .700 double rifle, .308 marksman rifle, the 12G pump action, the bow, the machete and the extremely rare .50). Hopefully more come in future.\n\n- AI pathfinding can SOMETIMES be a ♥♥♥♥. And by that, I mean the T-rex sees you, you go prone, and it just runs up to you and stands on your body where you can go crouch and fill the ♥♥♥♥er with arrows without it doing ♥♥♥♥. Also utahraptors and velociraptors like to stop and have a smoke sometimes rather than attacking you (this is somewhat fixed but it is still there).\n\n- [NO ♥♥♥♥ING VEHICLES]. While I don't really mind that much since I played many hours of numerous walking simulators and sleeping games (modded arma 2, dayz, breaking point, EVE online) I'm probably going to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at some point that I don't have some sort of lame vehicle or something. Let me ride a Triceratops, devs. Let me be a dino-rider and relive childhood. That'd be so ♥♥♥♥in' baller.\n\n- (Opinion) Not really a big one, I like hunting and all, but after the first encounter where you find out that most times raptors have the common courtesy of letting you know they're there before attacking, alot of the horror element subsides. This might be just me not being afraid of things because I'm a STONK HAIRY MAN and if you're a little ♥♥♥♥♥ (that's okay, some of us are) you might always see horror in this game aside from the first encounter.\n\nNow, I know tips are more of a guide thing but I honestly can't be ♥♥♥♥ed making a guide, I'm the god of hunting dinosaurs (not really) and I have better ♥♥♥♥ to do than write a guide. Still, I want to help so take these tips and don't quit early.\n\n\nTIPS:\n\n- DINOSAURS ARE TOUGH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S. DO NOT FIGHT T-REXs ALONE WITHOUT LOTS OF AMMO AND A GOOD VANTAGE POINT. DO NOT FIGHT TREXs WITH FRIENDS WITHOUT LOTS OF AMMO AND A GOOD VANTAGE POINT. 6000 KG OF SCALE ARMOUR AND REPTILE ♥♥♥♥, DON'T DO IT.  Fight raptors all you like though. If you manage to spot them first and you want to fight, see how many there are. With starting gear and not much experience you could probably take down one, then once you know where their weak spot is at the front take on more and more, depending on how capable you are with aiming.\n\n- In regards to the last tip, fighting them is the best way to learn how to kill them. If you manage to bring any dinosaur down and he's alone, take a screenshot of the kill page and look for vital spots to try shoot at next time. Be careful, raptors are rarely alone.\n\n- Use stealth. It's the only way you'll survive to find a shiny rifle and ammo, aswell as some camo clothes and all that dandy ♥♥♥♥. You'll learn more about dinosaur behavior that way.\n\n- Always assume that the highest % guess of health from blood sprays is what the dinosaur has. A friend of mine was tracking a T-REX for quite some time, thinking it had basically none left but it had a high end scale % he didn't quite take into account.\n\n\n- This game is not supposed to be easy. I mean it is for me, because I'm so cool, but if  you're a quitter, you shouldn't buy into this game. It will take time to know what you're doing unless you have a friend guiding you that knows whats up. The challenge is what makes the game rewarding, and thats what I really really love about this game.\n\n\nAnything you want me to address let me know, will update review as the game is updated.","December 15, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjboy6/recommended/322920/","jjboy6","Kersey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjboy6/","32 products in account","This game I see has got alot of negativity, mostly from those who havent played the game more than a few hours and rage quit after getting killed a few times. There is no doubt that this game takes a while to get used to, even I used to get extremely frustrated at not being able to locate settlements with weapons. But once you start to learn thestructure of the map and the mechanics of the game, and you start to learn new skills and stratagies, this is an extremely fun and exiting game to play solo and with friends. The concept of theHunter: Primal is great, the graphics and enviroment is breathtaking and overall this game truly does deserve more attention. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves survival, dinosaurs, action and of course having a great time.\n\nFor those who are just starting out, here are some useful tips:\n\nSurvival:\n\nThe Hunter Primal is all about killing dinosaurs, finding gear and most importantly, survival. You may find the best gear but if you don’t know how to survive and keep it, it’s pointless. If you come across a dinosaur that you are not equipped to fight, you must hide. The best way to stay undetected is by crouching instead of walking if you hear something, and lying in thick bushes if something gets too close… Around the map, you can find health canisters which you can use if you are struggling for health. So if you have one and you need it, don’t save it, use it! When you come across a cliff or steep drop, you should never take the chance of just walking off to get where you want to go, you will most likely just fall to your death…\n\n\nKilling Dinosaurs:\n\nUtahraptors:\n\nTo kill these vicious beasts, it’s all about hitting them in the heart. You can hit them as many times as you like anywhere else and pretty much nothing will happen. To hit their heart, you must hit them directly in the front center of the body. Hits such as in the back of the spine or in the lungs (which are in the center of the side body) are effective too. It is recommended to use a weapon such as a pistol or shotgun against these.\n\nVelociraptors:\n\nThese turkey sized predators can really mow you down if you are not careful, there is no set way to kill these, all you have to do it hit them and they will die… Using a machete or axe is by far the best option when fighting these things, although be prepared as they can come in packs of up to 12…\n\nTyrannosaurus Rex:\n\nI reccomend NOT attacking this alone! You should always bring a friend along. (by playing online) If you choose to take on one, be sure to bring powerful guns and plenty of ammo. You need guns with at least the power of a 308 Rifle but a 700 Rifle or .50 Cal is recommended. When firing at this beast, you want to be hitting the heart which is located in-between its small arms.\n\nTriceratops:\n\nWhen taking on a Triceratops, you need to have a decent weapon with plenty of ammo, it is unlikely to attack you but you never know. When trying to hit it, go for the lungs, spine and heart. It is recommended to use a 700 Rifle or a 308 Rifle with plenty of ammo.\n\nQuetzalcoatlus:\n\nThis flying dino can be annoying considering it can be hard to hit, the best way to take one down, is to shoot at its body as it attacks by swooping down on you. They are quite fragile creatures and can be taken down with as little as two hits from almost any gun.\n\n\nSettlements & Gear:\n\nFinding Settlements:\n\nIt may seem hart at first, but finding settlements is very easy. When you start the game, you will get a “Map fragment” when you use that, you will be revealed a settlement on the map, all you have to fo is set a waypoint there by going on the map and clicking a point and go for it!\n\nFinding Weapons/Ammo:\n\nWeapons and ammo spawn at places called "settlements" these are marked by little symbols on your map. The best place to go is the settlement at the top of the volcano in the center of the map. This is the ony place you can find the .50 cal rifle, however it is still extremely rare. At this settlement you are likley to find shotguns and good camoflauge equipment.","January 1","true","136.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Overall I like the game. I’m not going to go in to the balance and state of the game as of this review because that changes from patch. Instead I am going to cover how I play the game, and some of the notable aspects that struck me. Side note, I have never played any hunting games (The Hunter or otherwise) and do not have an interest in doing so. I have yet to try any of the PVP but having played the original DAYZ mod for Arma 2… ya I’ll just stick to the PvE where the humans can’t ruin your day.\nFirst off, the visuals started out very decent and just got better over time. Now in April of 2015, the weather effects are absolutely fantastic and wandering around the island is still breathtaking. And it’s not just grand vistas, it’s the attention to detail. The little PDA you use that shows what you are looking at in game is accurate when another player looks at your PDA for example. You can see the world reflect in other players eyes, the leaves from trees blow in a uniform direction to denote wind. It’s little things like that which impressed me.\nAnother interesting feature of the game is the sound. This is one of the few games where it actually matters. Almost any game I have played, I really could blair music or have a movie playing at the same time and not be affected. In Primal, everything is silenced but the game sounds. Even after you get comfortable with the game, the sounds are essential to knowing what’s coming and what it is. I found that having a nice subwoofer is one of the best early warning T-Rex detection systems available :-).\nMy third point is the most subjective but you are reading my review so you’re going to get my opinions. In my opinion, the game is beyond my patience and skill to play solo and enjoy; it’s too hard. I found I had much more fun with a small group, even if it was just one other person (WITH VOICE CHAT). If I did not have friends to play with, I probably would have abandoned the game after a few hours of exploring and being eaten. Not only can you be overwhelmed by dinosaurs but the supplies in the game are relatively scarce. This is not a complaint; I LIKE that things are scarce and that you are often down to a few precious rounds and if those fail, you are likely to die. But because there is that element of chance and that “being in the wrong place at the wrong time” aspect, the few people working with you can avert a total loss into a narrow escape or only a few deaths. Even after you are pimped out in the noble came and have whatever weapons you wanted, you are just as frail as you were when you landed and having the most powerful gun does NOT mean you are safe.\nSo overall, I am pleased with the game. You need 2-3 hour sections of time to really enjoy it when you hop on so don’t think you are going to play for 20 minute and be fine when you log on next, but I am happy with the time I have got out of it to date.","April 8, 2015","true","200.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Hunting games have its roots in realism, covering mechanics of smell, wind, weather, anatomy, bullet calibres, camouflage. These features all play a part in your success of hunting the prey. In other words, shooting everything in the face won't work out when your'e facing an animal with the skull thickness of armor plating on a T51 tank and the capability kill you before you finish reloading a magazine.\n\nThe game doesn't give many tools, because it wants to be a survival game, they expect people to come in, know how hunting games work, and apply that to survivalism and dinosaurs, when most people think this is killing floor with dinosaurs, myself included.\n\nA big realization of the difference of this game is, how your prey will almost always outrun you when its health gets low. This occurs almost all the time, provided that everyone spawns with a knife at level 1, they run faster, hit harder, and have more bodies than you.\n\nSo what do you do to succeed, you run, you hide, you scavenge other players bodies, and abandoned outposts for weapons.\n\nBecause in this game, access to weapons doesn't mean it gets easier, it just allows you to make more mistakes. A player can use a bow and one shot a triceratops if you aim for its heart and because ammo is limited, it is encouraged to do so.\n\nYou hide in the woods, listen for the noise and stalk the pack, finding one triceratops by itself muching grass, by watching the foliage you figure out the wind direction, staying downwind, so it can't detect you by smell, you crouch up to its side of the belly, drawing the bow, aiming for the spot behind the joint of the foreleg, a direct hit pierces its heart and kills it instantly, while the kid that plays call of duty is shooting it with a 50 cal, 11 times on the crown of its skull doing 1% total damage.\n\nIf you miss, you aim for its lungs, then its intestines, because it won't run as far without proper respirations, and it will bleed out if you shoot it in the intestines.\n\nI hope this helps you understand this game better.","August 25, 2015","true","17.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

This game has the potential to be something great but whats keeping it from that possibility is the endless bugs, shady mechanics and or lack there of. This is a survival game without starvation,dehydration hell you dont even get to build a shelter or a storage box! The game is missing a few things but it does have some positives. The Ease at which you can die (which you should die if a T-Rex bites you), Graphic-wise this game gets a 8.5 outta 10! Being a multiplayer is a definite must to this type of game not only for the competitive but for the sheer difficulty of this game. However this game misses out on the the whole cook food,build shelter genre when it would clearly make it better i mean who wouldnt wanna kill and eat a dinosaur! Mechanics on the new flying Dinosaur could be twerked a bit not just in favor of killing the animal but a way to maybe put that machete to good use! This game has the right idea but just doesnt seem to follow through. When i saw i could buy items i got a little excited think yea i definitely would spend a little hard earn USD for guns and ammo, But  its not so and why when all you would have to do is when you die /land they are in the pod  with that crap machete (cause your a special prisoner kinda thing) ya know like his family is sending him commisarry, But its Guns instead of HoneyBuns.

It had stealth, some guns and hunting dinosaurs. What could you ask for? How about actual working mechanics for guns! Constant and true hit boxes for hearts, lungs and what not! T-rex's that don't run straight to you when your crouched and have full lvl 5 camo and haven't moved or made noise in 5 mins! Quets were a nice touch. To bad they fly through everything, including the ground, then pick you up fly high enough and drop you to your death! Oh did I forget their is no counter for the bird either!

Putting aside the fact that it looks like absolute garbage compared to the trailers, the controls are easily the worst i've EVER had to attempt to use, and even after changing them to controls i'd be used to, it's still just so slow and clunky and uncomfortable to play. I spent the entirety of my time avoiding Utahraptors, literally just walking fast enough that they couldn't catch up to me, and not being able to do anything but continue walking away from them. I started out with a Bow, but no arrows, and i lost that useless bow as soon as i died from that Utahraptor relentlessly biting at me. The sprint bar goes down extremely fast, with practically no real speed bonus, and only recharges at an acceptable rate when you're standing still. I wandered around for about what i'd say was a mile, being attacked by several Utahraptors along the way, and saw nothing at all worth my time. No other dinosaurs, no weapons, nothing to interact with other than rocks and dino ♥♥♥♥, literally just those ♥♥♥♥ing Utahraptors. Altogether, I'd have to say that i wasted $30, and i really wish that i could refund this steaming pile of dogshit. All i can really think is that this game was thrown together by a couple of Jurrasic Park wannabe-fanatics with 0 talent in 3D modeling and animation.

Maybe stuff like avatar and weapon customization would be nice. Also if you die and can't get back to your corpse without quitting the game, you shouldn't lose all of your stuff. There should be some way to get it back.\n\nAnother nice feature would be skills that level up such as endurance, stealth, accuracy, etc. You would gain points by killing dino's that could be spent on level ups.\n\nAnyway, just my thoughts.

The gun play is very realistic feeling and the game's mechanics demand players be a marksman or face being eaten. Playing something like a survival game at first players must search the map for gear and weapons while being hunted by Velociraptors, Tyrannosaurs Rex, and Quetzalcoaltlus.   There is no crafting, you only need manage your health, clothing, weapon, and ammo.  Once you have leveled up with points accumulated from kills you can spawn in with better equipment and the game becomes more hunting orientated, less survival orientated.

I been playing this game ever since it was early access, and judging from my experience with the game, I recommend this game ONLY to people with a lot of patience and a sense of intelligence. Besides, most of the bad reviews on this game were made by players who played less than 30 hours or gave up on the game because the developers were barely adding content, even though they were working on new games like Mad Max or Just Cause 3. TheHunter: Primal is also nowhere near a survival game. It is more of a hunting stimulator, but with dinosaurs. If you really want a dinosaur survival game, go to freakin ARK. Last thing I want to see on the game's community discussions is more ARK favoritism and hateful rants.\n\nAnyway, when I played the game at launch, I did had some terrible experiences with TheHunter Primal, but eventually I managed to learn from my mistakes and applied them to my skills.\nIt is true, this is game is hard for new players but it is part of the learning process and requires patience. Once you begin the game, it is recommended that you find a group of people to hunt with, especially if one of them has experience with the game, but ASK FIRST. It is also important to put time into the game in order to have a basic idea on the game's mechanics and to understand the strengths/weaknesses of certain guns/weapons, the dinosaurs and their AI functions/behaviors, the hunting advantages/disadvantages in certain environments, and what parts of a dinosaur's body is best to shoot at. And lastly, do expect to walk a lot; the map layout is pretty big and there are some momemts where you don't run into many dinosaurs. That is where patience and intelligence is needed.\n\nIf you can't dedicate the time to learn from the game, too impatient, or lack basic common sense, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I used to join groups when I was a noob, but now I can solo-hunt with just a bow, a .44 magmum revolver and a machete/hatchet.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of guides made to help new players out, and most of us pro-players are willing to provide tips/tricks for the game. Take advantage of them. Who knows... perhaps someday I may run into one of you new players. Do expect me to hunt naked since I got rid of all of my noble clothing to get more inventory space for stuff. DON'T DO THIS STUNT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE DINOSAURS.

You hunt and explore alone or with other survivors (multi-player) and are also hunted by the creatures of this game. Experiences can make you feel horrified if you forget your actually playing a game to some. What started out as a mega promising game fell to the wayside with no updates or patches for almost a year. A NEW DLC has been released with some new fixes along with a great mission to kill the Primal Queen T-Rex. You must first seek out the rare T-Rex and aquire its gland to lure the Primal "Queen|' out into the open. She is must stronger than the normal Rex's found within the game.  New high tech weapons are gifted to the players skilled enough to bring down the Primal Queen.  A new survey for players was put out by Expansive Worlds asking numerous questions about future things that could possibly make the game better. New DLC's and such. There are some bugs still noticably found in the game that are said to be fixed soon. Hopefully the Devs are now onboard with this project permanently and can give us tons of new explorations, more creatures to horrify the faint of heart. The game deserves to be updated and new materials added frequently even if it means spending money on new DLC's by its fanbase. There are not many Dino games out there that are worth anyones time. This one has the potential to be a great one. Great game, needs some Dev love before it loses its fanbase and is lost forever. Time will tell if the effort is put into it.

Always liked the idea of a game like this. The nuts and bolts of it are that you are dropped into a prehistoric world filled with three dinosaur types as of this review in which your score is based upon how many you take down sucessfully. You start with basic gear which includs a bow and arrow. I do like the bow and arrow idea however I thought it a little simple considering you're race has mastered interstella travel but yet you start with a bow and arrow...Perhaps it would be better to start with a bow that at least resembles your current state in evolution and not made of simple wood, maybe some type of carbon fibre similar to the ones featured in Crysis 3.\n\nThe graphics seem decent at the higher settings, sound is also of a satifactory quality, would be nice if the T-Rex sounded like the Jurrasic Park one's though. The animals behaviour is slightley weird at the moment, you are pretty much invisible if you lie down, not that that makes much difference as you can hardly kill things with your starting gear. One thing i did really like it that fact that if you score hits on the animal you can follow their blood trail to their piont of death with arrows stuck in them. Unfrotunatley at this time it seems you cannot retreive arrows which is sad because ultimatley thats what makes a bow a good choice of weapon.\n\nBelow are a list of things\n\n- Better dinasaur sounds\n- retreivable arrows\n- different types of arrows\n- better looking bow\n- craftables.\n- some sort of black market to sell skins for better gear\n- bigger vegatation and trees, the trees are too small for the time period its depicting.\n- Packs or heards of more dinasaur types roaming.\n- Would like to see dinosaur AI and own survival nature, IE all dinosaurs should get hungry and look for food, the    herbavurs should eat and drink as well as the carnivors. dinosaurs should stay in packs (mainly the herbavaurs) In essence i would love to see a whole echo stystem in place before any player is put in the mix.\n- In talking echo balances I would like to see dinosaures who have nests as they did, if you stuumbled on a T-rex nest you may well find an angry mother and/or father around which would give the game more depth. Would like to see the young ones as well as a apart of tracking and of fear as if you spotted a lone young T-rex you'd be sure his perents wern't to far away and could cry for its mother (similar to Jurrasic Park The Lost World)\n- I want the feeling of being a hunter, but at the same time i want to feel like im being activley hunted sometimes.\n\nover all a very basic game at the moment but if they add depth such as creating a pre historic echo system they may well find they have a great hunting game here.","December 17, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not the best, but certainly not the worst.\n\nThe main draw of the game is survivng on an island full of dinosaurs which is a ton of fun. Although the dinosaurse's AI is mediocre at best, the thrill of being hunted by a pack of raptors or chased by a T-Rex is pretty terrifying. The scenery and sound effects are extremely impressive, adding life to a massive jungle world, which gives the illusion that the animals are talking to one another.\n\nUnfortunately there is not much to do but make your way across the island, hunting for loot while the combat and weapon options are limited.\n\nAs it stands at the time of this review, I only recommend it if you have close friends to enjoy it with. That being said, if the development of this game continues at a reliable pace, theHunter: Primal has the potential to be a great game.\n","January 21, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Awesome game physics and highly detailed landscapes and dinosaurs make for a thrilling hunting experience.  An air of caution to those easily scared. Do not play in the dark with headphones.\n\nThe experience starts you off in a space capsule that lands on a planet filled with blood thirsty dinosaurs.  Your main objective is to hunt, kill and rid the island of these man eating beasts.  You start off with a bow and few arrows to tide you over unitl you eventually find crates scattered around the map, containing different weapons and ammo.  When encountering these larger that life beasts, I recommend you use the environment to your advantage.  There's plenty of undergrowth to conceal yourself until the perfect shot presents itself to you.\n\nAs an early release for $19.00, you get more than you pay for.  You'll find the plush and vibrant island environment and a variety of three Dinosaurs, anough to contend with until further developement.  The targets include the infamous Utahraptor, T-Rex and Triceratops.  As developement continues, more dinosaurs will be added along with more objectives i'm sure.  This is a single/multiplayer interface where you can either go it alone, or team up with others.\n\nPower in numbers!!\n\nAnd good hunting.....","January 8, 2015","true","157.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not a patient guy. That being said, it is quite rewarding when you get used to the ideals of the game.\nI do agree with most other reviews which often say "This game is basically still being developed and it shouldn't be a full release yet" Because it's true. There are only five species on the island so some variety would'nt go amiss. A couple more herbivores too.\n\nWhat I'd also like to see is being able to construct some sort of shelter, I know it's included in a lot of other games now, especially those with a bit of survival in them, but this game is literally all about survival yet we wander about for the entire duration.\n\nThere are bugs. Some are infuriating. For me I've been able to ignore them, and I'm still discovering the game.\n\nOverall this is a fun game, feels great when you get on top of the local meat eaters and the ability to team up with people helps too.\n\nNeeds more content and a couple of dodgy bugs fixed. That's all. I hope within two months of writing this review there'll be a little more to chew on.\n\n\n\nEdit - It's been seven months. Devs have done nothing to update the game whatsoever.

I was hosting a game of 15 people and my client crashed. So many people get dissapointed when playing. It's a pain really, but IT'S WORTH IT. It's seriously so much fun that i've given up on all other games. Getting stalked across the landbridge by a pack of raptors, getting eaten by a t-rex that comes out of nowhere, taking selfies with triceratops that got their head stuck in a hill. What more can you want?\n\nRemember that you actually need to aim on vital areas of the animals. If you shoot head on you're likely to be eaten. I hit a raptor from the front 4 times with shotgun slugs, but it still ate me, but you can one-shot them with bow and arrow if you hit straight in the heart! Taking down a t-rex on your own is not impossible. They are afraid of walking down really steep hills, so if you find a ledge, it's easy to get a few shots on the rex to make it start running away, then you pick out your marksman rifle and take it down but this game is best if you play it with friends.\n\nMap knowledge is key. There some settlements spread across the map where you can find various firearms. If you find a settlement, write down the coordinates, which you can find in the hand computer.","December 27, 2014","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would also like to see more sophisticated dinosaur movement and behaviour. So far they act well, especially the Utahraptors, but occasionally, I have noticed that the Trex will get stuck against a large tree or a rock. I would be very excited if they can manage to make the dinos interact more. It would be awesome in the carnivores would hunt herbavores and Trex would fight eachother (excetera).\n\nBuildings: I want there to be more sophisticated ruins or buildings. There are towers and runied forts but there are no doors or you can't enter any of the old buildings. This bothers me because it makes no sense...

You start off as a what I assume is a hunter who is sent to a foreign planet in futuristic drop pod with fancy, expensive hunting equiptment. However, the sponsers who sent you to this planet decided to cut some corners and instead of giving you a proper weapon, they gave you an improvised bow and 10 arrows. You heard correct, the sponsors cut corners on the weapon. It's not a nice bow, but one of those bows people made when they were twelve and hanging out with friends in the backyard.","March 12, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the concept, but in it's current state, the game mechanics make it near impossible to survive for any prolonged amount of time.\n\nOne very large issue is with running and (the lack of) jumping. I understand the point of the game is slow movement and tracking, but that doesn't always work. Particularly when a T-Rex comes wandering by. Maybe I haven't figured out what draws their attention yet, but at this point, it seems like merely being in their presence brings them right to you no matter your actions. And once they are onto you, it's nearly impossible to get away thanks to the movement mechanics. Being able to run in something like 15-second burts, and otherwise having to walk everywhere is not realistic in any sense, and makes evasion impossible. Even someone massivly out of shape can run for longer than 15 seconds before being winded, so there's no reason why a group of fit looking hunters shouldn't. I'm all for stamina, and having prolongued running affect your ability to shoot or something would be great. But basically not being able to run as a means of evasion when you end up in a fight you cannot win, that makes the game seriously fustrating.\n\nAlso, the T-Rex seems to sort of have a homing ability. In several instances with multiple players, a T-Rex has killed one of us, only to ingore the other players and instead head in a straight path directly where the player respawned, sometimes several hundred meters away. I don't know if this is a glitch or not (I really hope so), but it is also fustrating to spawn into the game with a T-Rex already zoned in to come find you and kill you.\n\nThose two issues aside, the game really is very tense, and a lot of fun. I see a lot of potential here. I hope that the two issues above are a result of bugs or experimentation, and not perminant gameplay mechnanics.","January 31, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarthegryphon/recommended/322920/","fubarthegryphon","MattchuDeePorkupineh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarthegryphon/","1599 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOriginal article with a hilarious picture of a dino with four arrows sticking out of his head here: http://rgz.ca/gaming/thehunter-primal-preview-a-promising-amorphously-designed-game/\n\nI’ve been playing theHunter for quite some time. Once a year, I throw in my yearly subscription and it allows me to pick up a gun or bow and go patiently wait for deer, bears, elk, and more to come close enough to shoot. Other than the fact that you’re shooting animals, it’s an almost calming experience. A relaxing, slow simulation that still allows you to feel accomplished over the course of a single hunt.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was pretty excited when I saw theHunter: Primal. theHunter is already a great hunting simulation with some impressive AI and gorgeous scenery. It’s also regularly updated and, even now, is still getting new animals every so often. There’s also not much risk in the base game, though. Sure, a boar could maul you but you can jump right back in with all your stuff intact. You don’t die. You’re just “injured.” This new edition could very easily have become the prehistoric Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts of the series.\n\nThen I read the store page a little more. Worry set in. Rather than being a new edition of theHunter, the game seemed to want to take the core gameplay and underlying technology and make something closer to a futuristic version of The Stomping Land, sans dino-wrangling. PvP was the first alarm. Then I read about “survival” and “permadeath” features. It was starting to sound a bit like something I didn’t really want.\n\nFortunately, it isn’t as bad as it may sound. It is still very much theHunter. theHunter with a bizarre, vague story, futuristic setting, and dinosaurs thrown in, but theHunter, nonetheless. I didn’t personally try out PvP so it would be hard to give an opinion on how that works – I didn’t even come in contact with Kat during the time we were playing – but the basic gameplay is there. I would be surprised if it weren’t. There’s an acclaimed game that it’s being built on.\n\nYou can tell, too. The basic AI behavior is there. Raptors hunt in packs, with the occasional raptor scouting ahead and then returning to the group. Tyrannosaurs shake the ground as they walk, and will often pay no mind to you unless you make yourself very obvious. Triceratops are generally more peaceful and won’t bother with you.\n\nIt isn’t all there, though. I experienced a number of problems with the AI, mostly pertaining to raptors. I mean, triceratops paying no mind to the tyrannosaurs that are coming right at them, shaking the ground as they go, and then bolting at the first sign of your tiny human self makes no sense to me but it’s more of a design flaw than an issue with the AI, and one that was probably carried over from the more peaceful creatures in theHunter. I was even used to animals that hopelessly walk into rocks repeatedly, hoping to finally get past them, having experienced many issues like it in the original game. No, my problems run deeper.\n\nRaptors work perfectly fine – until they become aware of you. Then they break. Not all the time, mind you, but they are broken pretty easily and there have been several ways in which I’ve experienced them breaking. The most frustrating is when you’re being chased. They do this awkward thing where they will attack you and then stop, wait for the animation to finish, and continue to sit there, as if “getting their bearings.” They can’t attack you and move at the same time. They don’t jump at you in any sort of way or pin you down. They just run up to you and come to a full stop when attacking. As if this didn’t break immersion enough, with raptors repeatedly falling yards behind you only to suddenly start running after you again, if you save your stamina until you’re attacked bolt towards the nearest brush without looking back, and dive into it, there is a high chance you can escape a raptor. You know, a raptor that is faster than you and was chasing you.\n\nThat’s not all that is wrong with them, though. Sometimes, when you are in areas with a lot of cover, and you dive into cover, raptors will still know where you are – sort of. They run at you…and then proceed to stand over you, turn at a ninety degree angle to you and just sit there. If you move, there’s a 50-50 chance it will fix them and they will kill you. If you don’t move, there’s about a ten percent chance that they will lose interest and walk off. Yes, you read that right. Raptors that know you’re there will sometimes randomly walk off rather than killing you. However, the most hilarious encounter I had with one of them occurred when it knew I was there, so it ran around an entire group of trees, sideways the entire time, making me think I was safe before showing up right next to me, facing a different direction without moving.\n\nIt’s not like you can really take advantage of this, either. The bow is very, very hard to use, requiring exacting precision in the right places to take anything down. No, headshots don’t work. I’ve tried. I should have known better, being someone who plays theHunter, a hunting simulation, meaning you should, as you do in real life, aim for the lungs and heart, but I tried anyways. The result was a hilarious four arrows sticking out of the raptor’s head as it sat there, not killing me.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is hinted at in the article title. Right now, it’s just a bit of an amorphous blob of awkward game design. More like a mod for theHunter than anything, a testing bed for ideas as they throw dinosaurs in and try to figure out how the community wants them to do things. It’s very much theHunter. Other than losing everything when you die, which doesn’t exactly feel like you’ve lost much currently, it is very much not a survival game. Not yet, at least. At the same time, though, just enough has changed to make it feel less meaningful than theHunter. By introducing survival aspects, it’s not about killing the biggest dino or having the most successful hunt. It’s about survival. But theHunter isn’t and, right now, at least, it’s sitting in this spot where just enough has changed that it doesn’t scratch the same itch as theHunter but it isn’t changed enough to warrant not just playing theHunter.\n\nIt’s fortunate, then, that the game is buy-to-play, rather than a hybrid of subscription and free-to-play models. You can buy Primal once during Early Access and never have to worry about any other fees. If you’re an existing fan of theHunter, regardless of what happens, you will probably get your money’s worth through the joy of hunting dinosaurs using their existing hunting model before inevitably going back to theHunter while you wait for them to sort everything out. Don’t worry, you can turn off PvP and make it a dino hunting marathon. If you’re a fan of survival games that incorporate PvP, however, I would wait a while. The mechanics to make it one aren’t all there yet and it’s a bit unclear of where they’re going to go from here. It shows promise for both ends of the spectrum but it needs a bit of time to find itself first.","December 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Harldy any bugs for Alpha, those it does crash now and then (fortunately that's at the game menu when starting not half way through a hunt) It's a slow paced game but a highly rewarding one and the encounters with the Dinosaurs I'd describe as more frequent than the original Hunter game, and perfectly balanced between realism and entertainment.\nIf you don't think properly when you start you may not enjoy the game, you cannot aimlessly roam on your own with a bow and expect to live. I teamed up with someone else so if we did encounter a Raptor before we got a gun, we'd both have a good chance at taking it down together. Gradually you build up your weapons and ammo, and now I'm roaming around taking everything out. The introductions of pvp optional servers give you more to shoot at for impatient gamers, but also dents your survivability as often people gift you guns in non pvp.\nI'd recommend viewing the forums for a 'base map' - there are 25 so far in the game and if you know where they are you can enter the game and run to the base in the hope of getting a big gun. I'm now kitted out in full camo gear, i have a sniper and scope rifle, and a shotgun. It's really, really fun, especially seeing the holes you can blast out the dinosaurs with the rifle. I'm totally impressed and what a bargain at 15.99 for the hours I've now put in (16), I can't wait to see what else is added as the game develops - a really throroughly good effort.","December 20, 2014","true","256.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than that I like the game lots of fun playing with friends.  No comments from the Devs in the forums also not looking very good.\n\n(edit)   Well I had to edit my review finally after some updates I was able to play again.  There are still some issues that need to be addressed 1. in multiplayer if your not the host your shots are not counting when shooting animals.  So if you shoot 30 times into a T-rex and your friend shoots 30 times only his shots count.  Same with the other animals as well.  2. The shotgun has issues off and on with the different ammo types, have to take the shotgun out of the slot place it into inventory then replace it back into weapon slot.  Was killed because of this 3 or 4 times.  Also sometimes the shotgun doesn't want to fire not sure what is causing this but it does happen.  3. The power of the ammo doesn't seem to be strong enough at times one time it drops everything no problem.  Then other times its like you have to shoot for example T-rex 60 times to kill it point blank something wrong with that.  First came out I was able to get a T-rex with 4 to 10 shots not anymore.  4. The grouping of dinos odd load ratios.  Raptors seem to be in larger packs of 7 to 9 more often now.  Triceratops seem to be in groups of 3 to 6 .  If your unlucky like me at times you get the 3 and 4 T-rex at one time.  Most of the time can get 1 maybe 2 of them but then the other 2 get you.  The ammo stacking has made things alot nicer able to have ammo with no worries now.  Still kinda buggy at times with it but not as bad.  Now comes the weather I was dreading the day when the rain from hell would hit the game.  I do not care for the rain system had it in the regular thehunter game.  Is way too loud needs to have a way to lower the sound level.  Try playing this game with headphones in TS when it rains you can't hear anyone and it gives you a headache.  I haven't tried pvp yet first off I don't want to lose the clothing it took me days to find.  I really would like to have a second game profile so I could have one for the regular game play and one for PVP play. That way I wouldn't care if I lost what I had when in PVP etc.  Other than that I like the game nothing like the ROAR of the mighty T-rex .  Then the foot steps the screen shake then  the first sight of the Mighty Rex.  You hide where ever you can it walks past you then suddenly stops and sniffs the air. Your heart races you wonder do I shoot or do I stay still.  50/50 chance I say go for it.  I would now have to recommend this game now as I do hope they keep updating with goodies.  I say 8 out of 10  as it is now.   After more things are added I will see about updating my review and see if it should get a better score.","December 24, 2014","true","846.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

They are challenging and feel natural. The environment is huge! so there is plenty of time to expore and get a feel for the place. You might not encounter a dino right away but the suspense really keeps you on your toes. Especially when youre in a dense forest and they are camoflaged so well (another reason I love the realism of this game).\n\nA few times I thought I had avoided a raptor then came face to face with one or more only to realize they were hunting me. When you hear them and cant see them you really get a sense of F**K I'm going to die.\n\nFor rougly half an hour I had to camp in some ferns and wait for a female raptor to move away. I had to listen for a call to know where she was so I could scurry to more cover. In reality if dinos were real I feel this game nails it. I dont care that I had to wait half an hour to escape the raptor because it felt like she hunting me. Later I lured her to my hiding spot and murdered her in cold blood (she got a couple bites in the process). The thrill of killing a raptor is awesome and the kicker of getting to take a trophy shot is just the icing on the cake.\n\nThere are definately some things I would like to see in the finished versions like more herbivors and carnivores of carivous sizes etc even pterosaurs would be aweome! Aside from what I want if the developers continue to provide polished content there is no reason not to get this game especially if you love dinosaurs.\n\nThere is so much potential for this game. I can only hope they flesh it out with a greater variety of wildlife to make the island really feel alive (it already does but what I mean is more so).\n\nI am happy I did. I hope that with more people buying this they can push out more content faster.\n\nThis game litterally drops you in the middle of no where with a bow and arrow a GPS tracker and thats it. For a game to do that it has to be good and this one is. I can't praise it enough.\n\nIf you buy it don't expect a finished product but do buy it to help this game reach full release. Its awesome.","January 14, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I start to explore and i have my first dinossaur, a female raptor calling. Is great, but i only have a bow with 5 arrows. Ok, i need a rifle or something better to kill this lady, then i move 200m and i see a T-Rex, he make a creapy call and i try to get back slowly, but i have the lady in my back. Ok, i die... I get in again and in a few minutes i get my firt kill, a triceratops.\nThis is a early version of the game, and we know is a lot of work comming, but now is alredy a good game.\n\nProblems:\n\nThis game is great, but have a few problems.\n\n- The volume of the T-Rex call is very low.\n- When a dinossaur (triceratops) go for a hole in the midle of the clifs, he stuck in there and you shoot at 3m, he dont run and dont see you.\n- So many dinossaurs in the map (i realise is because we have only 3 species yet) is very dificult to move without step in a carnivor.\n- Not the call, but the noise of a triceratops (presence noise), looks like a carnivor in my opinion. The call is perfect.\n- To many crashes on the servers.\n\nI'm a big fan of TheHunter and now of TheHunter: Primal and for Expansive Worlds and all the people envolved in this game, thanks for this great game, nice work.\n\n(Excuse my english)","December 19, 2014","true","108.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As an early access title there is still not much to hunt, you have the choice of 3 dinosaurs all with unique AI and attitudes. What this game does really well is the sense of how epic these animals truly are, going up against a T-rex alone is truly a deathwish most of the time, you're going to need some perfectly placed shots to take it down. PVP servers also add to the chaos, with full-loot pvp you can trust no one in this world and it leaves for a very Jurassic Park-like survival game. The loot system is very dry and could be improved and of course dinosaur selection can be expanded but I'm sure that will come.\n\nOverall 8/10 and easily a 9 by release.","December 18, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nonetheless, it's a good game and it's actively maintained at the moment.\n\nFirst off, let me clarify: this is NOT a survival game. As long as you don't walk off a cliff or get torn limb from limb by a dinosaur, you'll live forever.\n\nSo then what is it? Well I have seen two ways of playing this game.  You can play it as an exploration game, full of emergent narratives and fantastic vistas waiting to be seen by those willing to tread the most dangerous paths. Or, you can play it as a hunting game, full of big things to kill with your big gun and get money and a fancy dead trophy.  I am aware that the game is being designed with the latter in mind. But emergence is one of the truly wondrous elements of the video game as a narrative medium.  New and unanticipated things happen when your audience is also your performer and your performance.\n\nYou have probably guessed by now which play style I embrace.  I have ZERO interest in game hunting, dinosaur or otherwise.  I am, however, interested in walking among dinosaurs, as I have dreamed of fondly ever since that childhood  trans-Atlantic flight I spent reading a National Geographic book about them cover to cover, and I apparently was so adorably excited about the whole thing that the pilot gave me his Lufthansa captain's pin and patted me on the head.  More so than any other game I've played, this game allows me to do that.\n\nDinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect? -Dr Alan Grant\nLuckily you have me to tell you a little bit about what to expect. The very limpid premise to justify your simultaneous existence with dinosaurs is that you are a scout selected to spearhead a colonization effort on this alien "Eden."  Isn't it a little chilling that we are presumably doing this by enacting the mass slaughter of the native fauna? There's some commentary there, intended or otherwise.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, this is not a survival game.  There are no hunger or thirst mechanics.  There's a fairly typical stamina bar depleted by sprinting or melee but quickly recharged.  There is food out there in the wilds to be scavenged, but despite its realistic appearance it's arcade food: eat it to restore health.  Scavenging rather than crafting is your main way of acquiring weapons and equipment.  There are busted colony pods, half-finished bunkers, and the well-supplied bodies of many a less fortunate colonist scattered throughout the landscape.  Early on this will be your only source of gear that *might* protect you when you accidentally cross upwind of that T-Rex you've been tracking.  But more likely you will join the broken bodies of the brave stacked up for carrion (to paraphrase Homer).\n\nPlaying as an explorer is indeed punctuated by intense action.  I will shoot a dinosaur to save myself. I will flail my gun around in terror as I hear but can't see the pack of utahraptors close in on me. I will use my machete to hack aside the velociraptor lunging my jugular.  When you kill and catalog a dinosaur you get money and experience based on its rarity, its difficulty to kill, and the integrity of the corpse (prohint: you won't get much for blasting a campysaur with you shotty).  Every time you perish you are brought to a shop screen where you can purchase gear.  The availability of different items is a function of both your xp level and your accumulated capital.  Slowly but surely you get to a point where you can survive most run-ins with smaller dinosaurs on your own.  If you plan to take on a T-Rex or if you want to blast a herd of peaceful triceratops for no reason, hop on a multiplayer server and team up.  Your character is persistent across servers, but taking down a Tyrannosaur (possibly to protect those innocent triceratops) requires well coordinated tactical engagement. Still most of you will die. It's glorious.\n\nI continue to thoroughly enjoy this game.  The crass masculinity infecting the multiplayer chat can be irritating, but it's not game-ruining, and frankly when is it not asserting itself with knuckles dragged and chests bumped in whatever multiplayer chat you find.  The graphics are beautiful, gameplay is challenging and the shooting mechanics are fairly realistic.  The dino AI gets better with every update.  They really will sniff you out if your upwind and enact coordinated assaults complete with feints to draw your attention while they flank.  It's wondrous.\n\nIf you are now or ever were a dinosaur nerd, this game is essential.  Highly recommended.","May 29, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","29"

Sadly, the same can not be said for The Hunter Primal. The graphics are great and alot of the animals look real enough (I dont know fully as I have never seen a T Rex in the flesh) but its let down by a very clunky old style engine, It is what The Hunter was using in the original beta from the feeling. The Animals charge you, then sort of mill around doing nothing for 2-3 seconds before running off and charging again.\n\nMy other couple of gripes with this that annoy the hell out of me, is the weapons and gear factor, unlike The Hunter you dont have an account with all your gear saved to it. Its what you had on you when you last logged out, This is fine, apart from when it bugs out and you lose what you have, Or worse yet, due to personal hosting, If you die and are running back to your corpse to get your gear, and they decide to log out.

The Animals charge you, then sort of mill around doing nothing for 2-3 seconds before running off and charging again.\n\nMy other couple of gripes with this that annoy the hell out of me, is the weapons and gear factor, unlike The Hunter you dont have an account with all your gear saved to it. Its what you had on you when you last logged out, This is fine, apart from when it bugs out and you lose what you have, Or worse yet, due to personal hosting, If you die and are running back to your corpse to get your gear, and they decide to log out.

I honestly think it was part of a bundlestars bundle.\nWhen i received it i rolled my eyes abit, as most of my bundles I get from friends after I pick them up a game or two we kinda buy games for one another to try as a group. I saw the reviews and they seemed absolutely attrocious.\nFast forward to playing this game. Asides from your items not saving on your person when the server gets shut down. I really, like the suspense in this game. Sure it's got afew developement glitches and optimization issues that could probably be resolved. So here are some of my pro's and cons.\nPro:\n-Tracker is awesome, as well as your ability to see tracks and the estimated time the tracks were made.\n-The suspense when hunting a T-Rex is incredible, they don't auto run to you. Instead they sniff you out if your laying down and they've caught your scent.\n-Raptors will attack you, but if you fight them off they will dip, for self preservation.\n-Dino's will hunt one another.\n\nCons\n-Some A.I.'s will occassionally glitch out(story: after two-three hours i fired afew round into a raptor that wasn't moving... i unloaded into it afew more rounds... it didn't die. I walked up to it...nothing)\n-No graphics settings, what you see when you log in is what you get.\n-Server's are host-player based and rarely Server, server based.\n-Zero PVP.\n\nAll around it's pretty fun. I certainly wouldn't buy it for full price inless improvement's are made. But if you see it on sale or pick it up on a bundle. Try this game.

These are not the only dinosaurs, there is also the ever illusive triceratops. This is my only real criticism, with such a huge amount of background available, there are only three trackable, huntable, lethal dinosaurs to be found in this massive island. That being said, the game is tense, rewards exploration and if you're into big game hunting,the game doesn't get much bigger.\n\nLess so however is the inclusion of modern paleantology, the dinosaurs in this game don't have feathers for instance. But I doubt if this really matters much, the game gives the classic hunting dinos of Jurassic Park feel.

We only see updates once every few months now and they dont fix the fundamental problems of the game.  This is listed as a survival game, that they are 100% correct on.  They dont give you enough ammo to survive on so you either spend all your time trying to sneak around the dinosaurs which usually end up sniffing you out no matter how well camoflauged you are and you end up wasting your precious ammo on trying to kill them because the devs dont add enough ammo in the boxes they spawn in that you are supposed to use to keep yourself stocked up on.  There are numerous bugs and glitches that they need to fix and in order to survive you usually see people exploiting them just to get enough ammo to survive, that or you spend all your time throwing yourself off cliffs to "buy" ammo which is only purchasable in your death screen.  There arent enough dinosaur varieties in the game, especially herbivores and you never see the carnivores interact with the herbivores, they completely ignore each other for the most part no matter what is going on in-game.  There are a few "crown" or good camps that drop decent gear so expect to do nothing more in this game but running between those camps trying to outfit yourself enough to take down a rex and getting eaten many many times in the process.  If I had a dollar every time I screamed at my pc: "Devs, fix your game!"  I could replace my current setup with a triple SLI'd Titan GTX PC and go pick up ARK instead and run it at ultra and 60 fps.","December 26, 2015","false","141.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Yes you're slow, and you can't sprint as long as you'd like.  But the stamina bar is plenty when utilized properly (even when you're face to face with a T-Rex), and if you're running around you have to pay attention to your surroundings or you will get rushed by raptors.  You have to listen for the distant noises that clue you in as to what lies ahead, and you have to watch the terrain and figure out where each dino likes to hang out at different times during the day.  The game definitely is not what you'd expect, but in a good way.  You can dodge a T-Rex and solo a pack of raptors, but there's plenty of learning to be had from trial and error.  But once you find out where to hit, you're twenty steps ahead of everyone else.\n\nYou will get frustrated.\nYou will get scared.\nAnd you'll probably get bored at some point when you can't find a high powered gun.\nHang in there! :)\n\nThe in game experience requires patience, but so does the development of the game.  No, despite what steam says, it's not a finished product.  There is still much more that needs to be either fixed or implemented into the current game.\n\nAnd yes, the game is so much more enjoyable with a friend or two, especially if you have something like Ventrilo, Skype, or Team Speak.  Especially when you get jumped by two T-Rex because you're buddy decided to shoot a Triceratops from 200m out.... it's plenty rewarding for the average players when you somehow take them both down as a team, and then realize you're out of ammo :)\n\nI highly recommend this game!  It's too soon to say don't buy it, if you're worried then wait for it to go on sale, but it's definitely a game worth watching in the mean time.","April 6, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Its in Early Access and the devs are adding more dino types and game play tweaks so it should improve. Also the devs are active in the forums which is very good. The one thing that, for me stops it from being very good is the survival aspect, all this involves at the moment is just not being eaten by a dino. You are being asked to 'survive' but without any crafting abilities. So add some basic crafting elements, like crafting arrows from trees and dino feathers, health packs from the islands fauna and even teepee type structure made from dino skin and sticks, this would allow you to create a spawn point for the player. Expand on this and get your team to build some teepees together, then you've got a team camp to start your hunting from. If this kind of thing was added the game would be superb and should be on top of every dino hunters list. There are loot chest around the map which contain guns and ammo, but this feels like a 'cop-out' from providing any kind of true survival game mechanics.\n\nEDIT: and whatever you do, dont, and I mean REALLY don't, under any circumstances mention the word 'ZOMBIE' mod in the forums because you will get Phlamed by the games narrow minded FANBOYS.","December 18, 2014","true","128.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you easy get bored by just exploring a natural enviroment, then you probably should stay away from this game.\n\nFor those who love it, to lurk, to seek and to hunt the game offers a dense atmosphere with peaks of exciting fights and shout-outs. It´s not a conventional Shooter. Here you can´t easily lock and load your weapon and rush into battle. Fast-paced action is a quick way to death at Primal Eden, the dino-island.\n\nFor me the most fun is to playing with a friend or at small groups. It is a way to range the woods without to many squat-behind-the-bush interludes. As a team you can protect each other and in addition it´s possible to check all the loot-camps efficiently.\n\nAn essentiall aspect of hunter tactics you should adopt quickly, is to scent out your prey early. Some players don´t care about observing the enviroment. They run through the jungle and some minutes later they find themselves in a middle of a raptor-pack. It´s possible to avoid a lot of dangerous and probably deadly situations, if you stay calm and canny. I think this is a way to prevent the frustration of getting killed again and again.\n\nHunter and prey quickly switch sides at Primal Eden. Be prepared to withdraw for the sake of survival.\n","February 21, 2015","true","369.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I can't hardly find my way up the freakin' volcano to the research center to get better gear without being killed by a dino that shouldn't of seen me. Prone does nothing, crouch does nothing, moving slow does, guess what? NOTHING\n\nThen there's the 'store' to unlock and buy better starting gear. There is nothing telling you how to level, there is nothing telling you how to earn the stuff to purchase things (such as the bow) from the store. I can only assume that you have to kill dinos and get the trophy ones to gain xp and coins, but again, if found it IMPOSSIBLE to do this without the proper gear, which I found IMPOSSIBLE to gain.\n\nThere's also the fact that this is labeled as a survival game, which I indeed am in love with as a genre. Here's the thing, this isn't a survival game. This is a 'run around like a chicken with it's head cut off, falling off a cliff and dieing multiple time as you attempt to get gear to kill stuff' game. There is no crafting, there is no 'good' way to get the improved gear, you can't build a camp of any sort for any kind of protection. It's run, kill, run, kill, loot if you can, and try to SURVIVE the dinos, but there is no way to actually do this. It's not a survival game because you have to survive, it's a survival game if you have to survive WITH THE MEANS TO DO SO.\n\nLastly, maybe this game isn't just for me. I'll be honest here and admit that. I think I would enjoy it with the ability to craft better items, maybe some resource gathering? BUilding up a base camp for protection, make me need to eat and drink, or at the very least, GIVE ME GEAR AT THE START THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP.\n\nWith these things being said, I'm giving it a down vote for the time. I understand it is still in development, and I understand that it's probably got a long way to go. The thing is that at this stage, I don't see an appeal to it, and don't recommend it to anyone that's looking for a fun game that they can acomplish something with. I'll revisit it in the future some time and see how it's going then, but for now, I'm deleting it, and not planning on checking in for a few months, hopefully it becomes worth the 20$ soon!","March 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I am trying to think of a few cons to add to this, but i currently don't have any, except I do really miss the original raptor skins, and while the new ones are nice I would still like to see the old ones sometimes! The thing about this game that i know receives criticism is that there is a lot of walking around, and if your not properly equipped, getting killed. It just takes a little bit of planning and if you can find a group of people that's the best, but when you start out you will probably die a lot while you learn the game, and this is totally ok!","May 31, 2015","true","53.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There's no real plot, it's just shoot dinosaurs.

This game can be scary at times.\n\nNuetral:\n- OK netcode\n\nCons:\n- Small variety of weapons and dinosaurs alike. Feels very limited\n- Dinosaurs seem unkillable at times unless you hit them directly in a vital organ. Once, I unloaded 6 shotgun shells and a rifle round into the chest of a Utahraptor. Then proceeded to die.\n- Takes FOREVER to get from one place to another based on how slow you walk, and how SNAIL-PACED your stamina recharges. Seriously, I should be able to run for longer than 10 seconds and I should be able to run again in at least a minute.\n- Lack of dinosaur interaction. Tyrannosaurs walk past Trikes and the Trikes don't seem to care at all.\n- Poor AI. You can just continue to walk a rex in circles by staying at his back leg.\n\nOverall: 6/10\n\nThis game is fun and a cool idea, but it feels unfinished.

I bought this game 100% random & out of bordom to find something new to play. Both me & my friend bought the game, downloaded it and started playing @ the same time. A few good things about this game is that 1.) it will keep you busy and curious looking for new items to make you a better and more effective hunter. 2.) the hunt can quickly get difficult to keep you on your toes and making sure you are making every shot count.. but there is also some cons I have ran across while playing the game thus far, Like simple bugs in multiplayer as well.. But nothing too bad to really effect your gameplay too much. there is a leveling system in the game as well as a store in game asking you if you would like to buy items you can get in the world with coin that you get for hunting down and killing dinos! the thing that I find painful and boring is that there is no other way to travel.. Basically you will be walking and running.. Hiding and etc.. CONSTANTLY.. No fast travel, No swimming & no cars etc to help you get around faster and your stamina is horrible.. But, with a game that will have you constantly running I think they should make it last longer than it does.. Also something that really bothers me in this game is the fact that it is a survival hunting game, But yet you don't have to worry about food, shelter or etc.. so the game is NOT so in depth.. it's straight to the point here aim and take your shot and claim your beautiful new trophy, That is the 1 and only point to this game! if your looking for a more realistic and more in depth exsperince this game may not be for you, also there is no ability to build or craft ANYTHING.. and there is not really a big variaty of weapons here either.. But honestly it's something to play when your bored. so, the main question you may be wanting to know here is: is the game worth the $29.99 asking price... NO!

The Island is beautiful and so are the dinosaurs, and it never gets old to shoot another dinosaur and claim it's corpse. People assume the developers are just abandoning their game, but people are also ***holes and don't seem to understand how things work. Developers are humans to, and they have lives outside of this, and if they want to work on another game for a little bit then let them, they will update this game more and it will become a much better game.\n\nNow to talk about from my experience of the game. I love the game. I play it a lot, and especially when I am just wanting to relax, I can just walk around, because this game is a lot of walking. But it is not as bad as people say, and it is nice to not always have a dinosaur trying to murder your face. After playing a lot I have learned better ways to take down dinosaurs more efficiently which in my opinion just makes me feel so powerful and unstoppable... until a Trex eats me. When I die I do not get mad because its part of the game, and it was not the devs fault for me dying, they made these dinosaurs to do 1 thing and 1 thing only... to kill you. How would the game be anywhere near fun if the dinosaurs couldn't just murder you so quickly, it makes you have to think. When I play I see a lot of people who think they can just run up to a Rex and unload all their bullets into it randomly, then they die and get mad at the game. Thats not how it works. This game is also fun if you have friends, also makes the long walks a little less lonely.\n\nAll in all I really love this game, I just don't like people who get mad at games. I recommend this because with little stuff in it, it is a really good game and I can not wait for future updates.","June 7, 2015","true","143.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

I have played since early access and the game has improved slowly and steadily, to the point where there is a decent amount of content.\n\nThe learning curve is very steep for new players, even for a seasoned player losing all their gear and starting from scratch can be difficult. Don't let this put you off as the game offers many rewarding experiences once you get your bearings.\n\nYou start off with a machete and must explore and loot settlements and chests to find gear. Once you have a few kills under your belt you may buy items from the store which strictly uses in-game money, there are no microtransactions.\n\nYou will die often to begin with but with practice you can drop every dinosaur with a few arrows and then theres the other weaponry, which are all diverse and good for different purposes. Pistol, machete and .308 rifle are good for smaller dinosaurs, whilst Shotgun, .700 double rifle and .50 sniper rifle are good for big prey, like T-Rex.\n\nKilling every dinosaur is rewarding not only mentally but earning XP and money too to level up and buy items. When you kill your first T-Rex alone or with others, it's a very good feeling, and leaves you wanting more.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to those who are patient and can apperciate a good looking game, where stealth and aiming your shots plays a huge role. As I said before, if you are into dinosaurs in any way, shape or form then this is a must buy. Please don't let the bad reviews put you off, there has been significant patching of the issues mentioned in them. The game is very enjoyable as of writing this.\n\n9/10","April 5, 2015","true","379.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This is a good thing in my opinion as it adds another layer to "the hunter".\n\nFor those of you who are thinking of buying this, play "The Hunter" first, it's free to play and it's a hunting simulator, so if you are not prepared to spend literally hours walking and tracking creatures sometimes without spotting anything for quite some time, this game is not for you.\n\nTry the hunter for free before dropping money on this game because they are essentially the same game.

The entire time you are in game you are on edge waiting for what dinosaur might come around the corner or sneak up on you.  This game sort of draws you in and will not let you go.\n\nThere are a few things that are quite annoying, when someone begins to lose connection the entire game I suppose pauses for everyone.  When you spawn you could very well spawn right next to a Raptor or Big Rexy.\n\nI have not played this game long, I feel I will enjoy it for quite some time, though I do feel as though after playing it for a day or so it might lose its replayability because killing three types of dinos can only be entertaining for so long.

Graphics look great like the original, sounds are cool and imursive which is what you want.  The gameplay not so much.  You start off with just a bow and 5 arrows in a world that currently only has tricerotops which act like deer when you get close and tyranasaurus and raptors.  Now thats all cool and dandy but the fact your suppose to find better gear in this huge world with only 5 arrows to start and your surronded by these predators makes for very not fun gameplay.\n\nNo matter where you spawn there willl be either a raptor or trex near by, no joke.  also one major bug ive noticed is when you attack a raptor pack (yes i said pack they are never alone) if they kill you that same group will stalk right to you when you respawn. NO JOKE, try it attack one group die and start walking and you'll noticed there is a group stalking you.  If  you had better gear id accpet that but 5 arrows folks thats it. Also attacking is not easy you can shoot your 5 arrows into a raptor and he still will not go down, which make self deffense very hard to do when hes attacking.  And running away lol come on be realistic.\n\nIt has Potential but at this point its more frustrating then fun, i'm still giving it a positive review because i have high hopes for it, and i know what they did with the original hunter so *fingers crossed*","December 15, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Took me multiple times to figure out how to fire my bow but after four arrows and me crying like a little girl I finally killed the damn thing with a sliver of my own health left.\n\n...Except I wasn't expecting the female to be right around the corner.  I managed to duck into the roots of an old tree fast enough to avoid being detected right as it ran by.  After accepting that my pants would be forever soiled I decided to play it ballsy and take on another Utahraptor with only a single arrow.\n\nThree minutes of getting myself lined up later, I finally took what I thought to be my last shot before dying a violent death... Except the raptor dropped almost instantly.  Shot through the heart and got an insta-kill.\n\nI'm not even mad that my butt got torn off by a T-Rex several minutes later while trying to find more ammo.

The other dinos are fairly well balanced, with the exception of a few glitchy bits, like t-rex's biting through trees to get you. Another HUGE issue I have with the game is the stamina system.

Playing with other hunters is a must do, because sometimes you can get yourself into a really sticky situation it's always best to have someone watch your back.Some situations can be so intense for example hiding under a bush when a T Rex is standing right next to you.\n\nOr the absolutely wonderful feeling you get when you find a .700, or noble gear for example.Even walking halfway across the map to meet up with your fellow hunter just gives you this great feeling of relief and joy.\n\nFor an early access game, i say this is a MUST PLAY! so go on, get the game - support the devs they really do deserve the support!\n\nThank You","March 18, 2015","true","210.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

While it sounds good on paper and sounds like it would be like the iOS game, Carnivores, this game is sadly a tedious attempt at a great game. Where Carnivores had good hunting strategies, sudden death as always a fear, fast travel, and a way to find your prey, this game lacks most of the listed. It is merely a running simulator, where you can literally press Q to automatically walk. The hunting system in the game is interesting to say the least. If you pick up on your prey's trail, you can actually track them on your device through their footprints and whatnot. The area is pretty well designed to say the least, giving the impression of a vast, open, and terrifying open world, but that is not the case. There are hardly any dinosaurs and the combat is done so ♥♥♥♥ poor its nearly impossible to kill any of the dinos. Not to mention walking around waiting for something to happen can get pretty tedious after a while. All in all, i would not recomend spending your money on this game. If you want to, then by all means go for it. Its not a terible game, but it will become boring.","June 19, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is no sub fee or any way to use real money to become better then others. There are only 3 dinasaurs at the moment but they all provide a challenge. The utahraptors travel in pack usually. Sometimes you'll find one alone. The Triceratops wont attack unless you get to close or attack it. And they are hard to kill. The T-REX is difficutlt but not impossible. When dinasaurs get hurt badly they run away or attempt to. Thats what the T-REX did it ran because it was near death. I almost killed it but didn't happen. The game has around 6 or 7 guns. You do have to find all your weapons and when you die you do start over but its a survival game. I rate it a 9/10 in early acess.

So a better tag would be "hunting simulator". If you try to run and gun you will die most times although in ceratin cases you can do this. The weapons are geared towards hunting not a frantic FPS experience. Strategy and tactics are needed to survive in this game initially but once you get a handle on the controls of the guns, body movement,crouch and prone and then stand again you will be a master hunter. Did I say you are hunting dinosaurs? The devs did not abandoned the game but are adding updates slowly because their main game is "theHunter". In december of 2015 the devs added new weapons and a new Primal dinosaur and also with it came several bugs they need to fix. The game is good at its core and looks beautiful so have patiences with it and enjoy it for what it is until they add more dinos and other stuff whatever that may be and whenever that may be. If it has the support they will continue to make it a great game. FOR THE PRICE or on sale it is worth doing all the achievements and hopefully finding your first gold T-rex so you can summon a Primal T-rex. Remember it is not a run and gun game. It will be hard when you first start off. Explore the map and die if you must looking for settlements. Once you learn the map things will be easier to find. Crates have stuff you can use but only settlements have the weapons and camo. Have fun and happy hunting.\n\nApril 2016 Review: A game still worth playing if you like simulators. Don't compare it to any other game where you can just blow off bullets or 1 headshot kill an enemy or animal. The devs have it the way it is so you have use some skill to prevail. It is not am MMO so there isn't any quirky stuff like mounts and taming. It is for mature people mostly but kids can enjoy it too as long as they see it for what it is: A HUNTING SIMULATOR where you have to work for your stuff and learn to be good at it. I even had a negative comment about the game on my Youtube page about "if you can't headshot a dinosaur in the brain once then the game sucks" or something similar to that. What shallow thinking. What idiocy. The game is good but still has bugs but if you have a good system to play on the bugs don't seem to fly as much. Therefore, it is still worth the price and if it is on sale definately get it. It has COOP so playing with friends is fun too.\n\nHAPPY HUNTING (Look for my videos on Google : GameCookerUSRocks)","January 7","true","333.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it when it was first released.  The devs promised a lot more content, so I stuck around for a while.  I really love hunting games, and this game gave me dinos.  The AI at first was okay I guess, but barely realistic.  When the devs messed with the AI, the game became sort of broken.  Nothing was hard to kill anymore, even the trikes are stupid easy.  After I killed a rex with a bow, I got bored.  Almost 100 hours of mostly fun game time, though.  When this game becomes a three dollar sale, go for it.  Just know that it is very unlikely that this game will go anywhere.  ARK: Survival Evolved is taking over as the Dino Niche game for now.  I have that game, too.  It's much more fun, imo.  However, I can't REALLY say that I dont' reccommend the game...I can just say that it's not worth the current retail.  It's largely unfinished, and there are just too many bugs to make it a solid game.  Hope this helps.  Giving it a thumbs down over all, but wish I didn't have to.","July 12, 2015","false","100.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's far from that at the moment.\nI'd say this was more survive and try to hunt...mostly find a dino, shoot a dino, run from dino and then shoot it again.\nHowever for some reason I really enjoy this game, don't get me wrong it doesn't look the best in the world and it really doesn't play the best in the world, but if your wanting to play something that's relaxed and fun this is it. If you've got friends to play with you in game then you'll have even more fun!\nGo on...kill that REX!","May 5, 2015","true","35.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it sounds good on paper and sounds like it would be like the iOS game, Carnivores, this game is sadly a tedious attempt at a great game. Where Carnivores had good hunting strategies, sudden death as always a fear, fast travel, and a way to find your prey, this game lacks most of the listed. It is merely a running simulator, where you can literally press Q to automatically walk. The hunting system in the game is interesting to say the least. If you pick up on your prey's trail, you can actually track them on your device through their footprints and whatnot. The area is pretty well designed to say the least, giving the impression of a vast, open, and terrifying open world, but that is not the case. There are hardly any dinosaurs and the combat is done so ♥♥♥♥ poor its nearly impossible to kill any of the dinos. Not to mention walking around waiting for something to happen can get pretty tedious after a while. All in all, i would not recomend spending your money on this game. If you want to, then by all means go for it. Its not a terible game, but it will become boring.","June 19, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It was new with a surprisingly familiar feel to it, and was superior to most other dinosaur games of that time. But several months after being available at the store, it was soon revealed to be "finished" and was somewhat abandoned with a lousy variety of 5 dinosaurs. It is true that during the early hours of the game are great fun and a good challenge, even to the seasoned gamer (unlike myslef XD) however after a few hours of similar game play, wandering through the forests with nothing but a machete and getting killed by the same sodding species of dinosaur (the Utahraptor) I truly grew bored. I would definitely reccomend ARK Survival Evolved over this game.

First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it when it was first released.  The devs promised a lot more content, so I stuck around for a while.  I really love hunting games, and this game gave me dinos.  The AI at first was okay I guess, but barely realistic.  When the devs messed with the AI, the game became sort of broken.  Nothing was hard to kill anymore, even the trikes are stupid easy.  After I killed a rex with a bow, I got bored.  Almost 100 hours of mostly fun game time, though.  When this game becomes a three dollar sale, go for it.  Just know that it is very unlikely that this game will go anywhere.  ARK: Survival Evolved is taking over as the Dino Niche game for now.  I have that game, too.  It's much more fun, imo.  However, I can't REALLY say that I dont' reccommend the game...I can just say that it's not worth the current retail.  It's largely unfinished, and there are just too many bugs to make it a solid game.  Hope this helps.  Giving it a thumbs down over all, but wish I didn't have to.","July 12, 2015","false","100.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No. Updates take months, their last update was just to add Hungarian localization. Let me adress that... you speant months just to add Hungarian localization? There are no new dinosaurs, no new guns, new anything is absolutely 0. This game could be amazing, but the developers are just chipping in on the cash everyone spends without giving back to the customer who paid to play their game. The game has become repetitive and a snooze, am I the only one who dreads walking? What can sometimes take up to an hour to get to the other side of a map? Why not throw in a vehicle and the only way to get fuel is to find it at a base. Base locations, heres an idea make a few places actually look like a base, it'd be cool to be able to enter into buildings and search for crates or maybe through lockers for items to use and have some smaller dinos lurking inside. What would I rate this game if i had to say 1-5 I'd give it a 2 the graphics are amazing but that doesnt make up for the fact that this game is brutally lacking. Not enough dinosaurs, hardly any guns. It gets old and you will get bored of this game. Would i recommend this game? Nope like i said before not enough content and asking for 30 dollars for an early access game that i thought would be updated on a regular basis is pretty scummy. 30 dollars people, we paid them 30 dollars for this unfinished game. I would not even deem it early access any more I'd say they're done updating this, they prooved that with the "Hungarian localization". Months and months upon waiting for dinosaurs and guns only to get that... Sorry but this game will probably be uninstalled on my list. I'll check back on it in a year or 2 to see if anything has changed which I highly doubt.","September 26, 2015","false","56.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

So much potential and they wasted it. It just comes across as laziness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/recommended/322920/","mercury7elite","Game Cooker US Rocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercury7elite/","169 products in account","Part 3 of my review now into the game 900+ hours.\n\nAll I have to say is look at my screenshots and my Youtube videos to get your own opinion.\nI still recommend it at $19 or on sale.\n\nPart 1 of my review near the beginning of me playing:\nI do not know if the devs will read this but they should keep working on this game and make it the greatest coop hunting game ever. It is not easy imo,at least, at first. If they add more dinos and more hunting weapons and more situations to be involved in this game will be fun and challenging. I have watched gameplay videos which seemed to show challeneg. And I checked out the world myself a bit and got attacked by a little guy who gladly dragged me off for food I presume so I am pleased that it is not in the spirit of an MMO where dying essentially is obsolete. For the low price I think people should get on board with this game to keep the devs making content for it. I only had a machete to start and really did not know how to fight so I imagine the weapons will take some time to get use to which is fine for me for this type of game. Note: I am not a hard core gamer either. People said the world is ugly. I am not sure where they got that idea from. It is not Crysis but I would not say it was ugly. The graphics were fine for me. I am sure they will add more textures later as they did with the dinos. Turn everything up on high if you have a good rig. If it is on sale definately give it a try. If it is not I still say give it a go. It has coop so why not? I have yet to play with my son this week so I'll probably have more to say about my experience with this game at a later date.\n\n\nThis is part 2 of my first update:\n\nIf you want a good pvp game this is not the game for you unless you have a large party of people to enter your server and fight each other. I don't even know why people would want this to be pvp.\n\nFor those who like to hunt:  This is game is great for the patient person. Why? because it takes a lot of time to hunt in this game if you want to survive. You can not just run around and expect to live, especially solo. It is ideal and preferred (in my opinion) to have a person or more with you on your hunt but not necessary. Carefully go around and collect the weapons and gear from as many boxes as you can (which could take a while) and then find your ideal hunting spot where access to you is as limited as possible or you have some shielding if a dino makes it to your location which right now will be most of the time. Soloing a T-Rex is possible but be sure to have lots of ammo and a good fsr location to pick him off with a rifle with a scope.\n\nOverall the game is hard and can be frustrating if you are ina hurry and the game needs tweaking badly but it does work well enough if you are careful and have hours to collect weapons and then log off and get back on find a good spot and do your killing. There are guides posted on the discussion boards if you need a walkthrough although I have never read them so I do not know how they are helpful.\n\nPatience and weapon supply is key to this game. Practice as much as possible to get use to all of your resources and the mechanics of the game. This is my fairly lame review.\n\nIf you get the game on sale it is well worth it in my opinion as you can start local servers as far as I know for friends or play it by yourself. Ark and some of the other games are not really realistic but this is close and needs tweaking as i said.\n\nPart 3 of my review now into the game 900+ hours.\n\nAll I have to say is look at my screenshots and my Youtube videos to get your own opinion.\n\nPart 4\n\nIn my opinion most of the glitches that people have been experiencing most commonly before the last patch are because people have horrible servers, ISP, or a crappy computer.  Why do I say this? Because I have played over 1000 hours and have played with friends a lot of times and rarely do we have "lots" of glitches. We for the most part have a smooth run. My videos will testify to this and keep in mind I did not film all 1000 hours of gameplay. You will see some glitches but they are trivial to me and actually make the game more interestingly difficult imo most times. The game is worth the 9.99 sale right now and 19.99 regular imo. Remember it is a hunting game and not run and gun.\n\nThey just had a patch in December and some things may be glitchy again. The Devs said they will be actively working out the bugs. So I will not complain and just say thank you. Please do the same.\n\nHappy Hunting !!!","June 21, 2015","true","283.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sound design is absolutely amazing and you will feel yourself in a pristine island. The calls of dinosaurs in the distance, or the rustling of leaves in the foliage, or the ominous steady stomps from T-rexes are just a few of the environmental surround that you will experience.\n\nThere are weapon crates scattered all over the island, but these are still a bit scarce. This is the first game to actually give me a survival-feel that are absent in most open world survival/apocalypse games. The dinosaurs are scarce too, or will feel like it until you learn to notice footprints and the small darting movements from the corner of your eyes in thick jungles.\n\nTwo negatives I want to address. The island is freaking big but you travel really slow. That does add immersion but also adds tediousness. I recommend getting a trainer that gives unlimited sprint (but even that is slow).\nThe second is that the devs abandoned the game. So what you experience the first 10 hours will probably be just about everything the game has to offer in terms of novelty.\n\nI would still recommend it, if you're into an immersive game.\n","May 30","true","20.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My adventures were eventually brought to a white-knuckle climax when my path was blocked by a body of water too watery for even my heroic pioneer to consider. He could sprint for only 5 seconds before succumbing to exhaustion, so perhaps he was not the most bouyant of heroes.\n\nFortunately there's an auto-walk key, so I can be off manicuring my toes while my hero wanders the terrain in search of house-sized carnivores he doesn't want to be anywhere near, happens across loot crates left in tree stumps by mischievous leprechauns, gets eaten by the carnivores, pretends he's lost any SPAS-12s he could've received from the leprechauns and starts all over again, all with the press of a button!\n\nOne of the most convenient games on the market.","December 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","0"

And PLEASE, MAKE IT SO CLOTHES DON'T WEIGH ANYTHING WHILE YOU'RE WEARING THEM. (I'll update this more after I've played it a bit more.)\n\nThe game is impossible after the last few patches. I would LOVE to recommend it if they haven't made the game nearly impossible. The T-rex spawnrate is horrendous, the lighting and sound bugs, and the list could go ON AND ON. For new players, they'll get a machete and do what exactly? What are you going to do? Kill a T rex? Nope. I recommend that the T rexes fight each other. But otherwise, I do not recommend theHunter: Primal. This game is absolutely terrible, it is underdeveloped, unplanned and was obviously just a quick scheme to get some funds for the company.\n\nThe IDEA for the game was good, and I really tried to like it, but the application was horrific.\n\n[EDIT2]: This game has given me some of the most heart pounding moments, but T-rexes home in on you now... the game HAS become a bit more playable, but there still are inventory (Inventory randomly resets sometimes), sound, graphical, and AI, glitches.)\n\nYou start off with a machete, which does practically no damage at all. They want to give you the "feel" of a survival game, but no options to build a shelter or a place to store bullets and guns you've picked up (since you're sitting with limited space on you as a person), also no place to purchase more bullets once you run out. [EDIT 3: Ok, they did add an ingame store, but you can only access it when you die.]\n\nMainly, there isn't enough content. I can't believe they would call this finished. There are none of your typical survival game aspects in here at all. No base building, trap building, crafting, hunger, nothing.\nYou spend the whole game wandering this GIANT map, (which wouldnt be such an issue if you didnt walk slower than a crippled grandmother), trying to find supply boxes (which mind you, are NO WHERE near eachother) in order to defend yourself against near impossible to kill dinosaurs. Then, hopefully, if you manage to stay alive long enough, you can freely track and hunt the dinosaurs. Thats it. seriously, thats all.\nNot to mention there are only a grand total of 5 dinosaurs in the game. all of which are carnivores. (minus the Triceratops)\n\n[EDIT]: Ok, ok, I forgot to say a few things, here they are:\nThis game was not ready for release, it still has quite a ways to go.\nHere it is, straight for the dev's mouth: "Well, we managed to pull it off in such a short space of time and deliver on everything we’d planned (and more).

So don't expect an easy ride here.\nThere are a number of complaints I'm seeing in the review that suggest to me that most people are out of their comfort zones with this game.\n\nI'll say this; This game is awesome and compelling but not the sort of thing you should expect to be great at right away!\nWhen I first began I got mauled by a T-rex within about an hour. Then I met the Raptors and got eaten alive. Slowly but surely I got the hang of the noises they make, their movement patterns and how to use my inventory effectively.\nI treated it like a Rogue-like and got better as I went on, I'm now playing on a file where I'm armed to the teeth and still going after several hours of surviving! It feels great to have gotten to this stage.\n\nI don't usually do this but I'll lay out a few pros and cons for this game as there are a few things I feel could use some polish to really put the cherry on this tasty Dino-cake;\n\nPros:\n1) Huge, lush, GORGEOUS environment with varied lighting and weather.\n2) Intelligent, smoothly animated Dinos with unique features and weak points.\n3) Easy to use inventory system\n4) Feathered, (almost) accurate dinosaurs! At last!\n5) Raptor selfies! (Trophy shot option)\n\nCons and nitpicks:\n1) Some dodgy sound transitions, especially when approaching the beach. The ocean sounds don't fade in very well.\n2) Online features could be better implemented. Not a huge problem for me though as I prefer to play solo anyway!\n3) NOT ENOUGH DINOSAUR SPECIES!! Come on guys, this is my main complaint.\nI love this experience as it is but seriously; ONE herbivore type? Hell just stick some un-killable Sauropods in there if you must but please add some more to the roster. T-rex and two types of Raptor is challenging and cool but again a bit more variety would be nice.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\nThis is a great survival game if you can cope with its tough difficulty curve. It's a genuine pleasure to master it but time and patience is required; for tough-guy shooty action, look elsewhere.\nI can't think of a better single player Dinosaur experience on Steam at the moment and my only reall issue is with the severely limited variety of Dinosaurs in the game.\nAdd some more herbivores and perhaps one new mid-sized carnivore and this would be a must -have.\n[EDIT] With reguards to 'Game breaking bugs' people have found so far, it's poor form for a dev to have left so many in there at release. However, my review doesn't mention them as I have had the good fortune not to have encountered any of them in my playthroughs!\nThis review is my opinion based on my experiences playing the game, if you don't like it, that's cool. You'll have to excuse my ''Glass half full'' attitude.","April 1, 2015","true","19.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","4"

Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out\n\n- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.\nLoot mostly contains:\nWeapons\nClothes\nAmmo\nHealth\n\nFinal:\nAs i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to play\nJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay?\n\nFinal-Final:\nSo is this  a good game to buy and play: YES\nIt is worth the $20 you stole\n\n\n\n\n","March 22, 2015","true","20.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Not for your run-n-gun type player.  It takes patience and planning when hunting or evading.  I do not see it so much as a hunting game but rather as a survival game.  Your odds of surviving go up tremendously when you have a companion with you.  The sounds are amazing on headphones and really immerse you into the game.  I know there are still tweaks to the sounds as some pings on containers are not correct and you get sound drops during rain storms.\n\nUtahraptors, velociraptors, and tri's all interact and react well  when attacking and being shot.  The T-Rex I have not figured out yet.  I have killed several throughout the changes and thank goodness the population was decreased some; however, I am still finding multiple in a common areas, which really makes it tough to escape or hunt.  Their vision is incredible (too good) and I do not see them fleeing when shot. They seem to continue to attack you until they are finally dead.\n\nI like the tweaks to the weapons and the opportunity to purchase a weapon at the start upon reaching the right level.  The Bow can be effective it just takes some time on learning to aim it properly based on distance to target.\n\nI would like to see more interaction between the dino's especially when there are multiple T-Rex. Interaction between Triceratops and T-Rex, Pack of Utahs and T-Rex, and Utah's vs Utahs when in different packs.  They should be more territorial areas to develop this interaction. I am still looking forward to more dinos being introduced.\n\nAdditional Game play comments:\nI don't like that you can only see 250 m with marksman scope, past that range the humans, dinos disappear but all the vegetation and land looks the same.    If it's due to a range issue with the gun you should just show the shot dropping and hitting before the animal.  I often use it to scan a valley to search for dinos before proceeding but then when I think it is clear a T-Rex will suddenly appear.\n\nEquipment could include a tree stand, however, the height allowed would have to be limited keeping you vulnerable to Utahs and T-Rex.\n\nInstead of a red screen at your death, you could show a more animated death from the attacker in a 3rd person view.  And while you wait your 10 seconds you could watch them eat your body.\n\nReally Enjoying the game!   Keep up the development, the price is a steal at the early release price, when finished it surely will increase and still be well worth the cost.\n\n","March 13, 2015","true","397.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The intentionally cut the game short to release "version 1.0" which only has five dinosaur species. It honestly sounds like the game isn't getting anymore major patches either.\n\nDefeinitely disppointed in the developers.\n\nPros:\nDinosaurs\nActual hunting mechanics. Shoot a vital organ? Does more damage. Too many bad shots? You ruin the trophy.\nA very realistic game. You need to camoflauge, and survive against the dinosaurs. They'll also actively look for you through scene.\nMultiplayer is generally a friendly community.\nCons:\nThere's no more major updates as it looks like. Which effectively kills the game.\nEach "pro" factor mentioned above is fun for about an hour or two, until it gets boring.\nThe game can be fun if you play multiplayer, otherwise you're going to get bored quickly.\nProgression system sucks to begin with. You are given a makeshift machete, and will have to die repeatedly, maybe getting a kill in to progress. You progress by killing dinosaurs. If a dinosaur takes too much damage, it will run. It will run faster than you, and thus your melee attacks will render you incapable of getting a kill, halting your progression before it starts.\n\n\nWould not recommend. I did a first-impression to the game if anyone is interested.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOJmNcNw3zU","June 9, 2015","false","7.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yet to Encounter more Dinosaurs. So i won't stop playing it.\n\nAt first its more like you're the one being hunted, until you get some good guns (if you live long enough)\nSo far ive only played by myself, and i'm pretty sure with some friends like 3 or more you can survive with some effort.\n\n+im pretty sure some of the features in-game are from The Hunter, like (Dinosaur Droppings to Help Hunt them, and the little Device you use to Identify the Poop and find crates)\n\nOverall you really need to play with people and/or Friends to get your moneys worth(you can do it by yourself), Yet even still i did enjoy most of it!!\n\nMy Review is Mixed, i'll Thumb it up because its not bad....but playing alone is pretty annoying\n","January 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is enjoyable in single player or multiplayer and the progression of items and levelling provides incentives for progression. The difficulty is a strong draw for me (though other players may not like intense difficulty).\n\nHowever, the numerous string of bugs that have gone on unfixed (after reading well before I started playing) is frustrating. Of note the recurring issues I experienced were: inventory items not saving, level progression not being saved, frequent game crashes/false starts. More frustrating however is the reaction the devs have to constructive feed back - no responses/acknowledgements nor plans for fixes. The patches target minor glitches that rarely negatively impact the player base -or- increase content. Content increases aren't a bad thing at all, but when there are no published plans or discussions for fixing major game issues it's a problem because it indicates that fixing major issues is not a priority.\n\nFurther, it appears that efforts to discuss these issues are censored from their discussion forums as numnerous posts I have made (and others read) were subsequently deleted within a day of writing. The posts were professional and constructive in nature and contained no derrogatory language.\n\nNote: The discussion forums are moderated to not allow negative discussion of game facets (even in a professional and constructive manner).","April 29, 2015","false","913.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Appreciate the fact this game will run on any pc and looks gorgeous. Its fun to just explore and take photos as it is to hunt dinos or humans. The PVP or PVE option will accomodate those who enjoy having thier stuff still in inventory should you quit and rejoin later.

The controls are severely limiting, basically not allowing you to point shoot, and locking you in place, or to a slow crawl while you gradually aim your weapon.  It's fine to aim, but sometimes, a raptor is close enough to you that it's not necesary, and quite fatal to aim, for you that is.   I feel like they based the controls on what some fat chair jockey programming all day is capable of doing.  If that's the goal, you've achieved it quite well because I have never felt like such a slow sluggish out of shape fat man in my entire life.  They did some great stuff with this game, but sadly, were not ambitious enough.  They could have included a dozen more species of dinosaur, but they stopped at what I'm supposing were their favorites.  They could have enabled you to interact with some of the dinosaurs in other ways than killing them, such as riding a triceratops.  It takes some time to get around the map since you have to walk everywhere, and it is quite dangerous.  Maybe a vehicle of some sort would have been good.  In all, this game didn't quite achieve what I hoped for.  I would recommend playing Ark: Survival Evolved instead, if you like dinosaurs. It's much more fun, much more ambitious, has WAAAAAAAY more dinosaurs... and it's got a lot more things to do.","August 16, 2015","false","44.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","6"

This is the game to go for if you want a marginally realistic dinosaur hunting game, no other game comes even close.","March 15","true","204.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I love ARK but it just takes too long to accomplish much of anything in that game and the real fun *exploring and hunting dinos* (at least for me) is almost entirely overshadowed by the need to craft a bow and arrows and other weapons everytime I die and need to go on the hunt again when i spawn back in, almost guaranteeing the necessity for multiplayer/tribe forming gameplay.  Now enter tH:P...\n\nNo crafting, no dying from exposure to the elements or from hunger/thirst and a leveling system that is beautiful in its simplicity - hunt dinos and you level up a little and acquire cash monies as well!! As you level you'll gain access to weapons and clothing, as well as some items, that will aid you in your quest to track down and kill as many dinos as possible. Plus you can find stuff in supply crates. What's more, the island environment looks pretty convincing, even from a great distance, the day/night cycle is realistically long, the weather effects/clouds are great, namely the sky (which I think is one of the best looking/convincing ones I've ever seen in a game) and the weapon/item selection is decent which overall makes for a very pleasant and satisfying gaming experience.","April 16","true","29.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can't enjoy the game if it keeps killing you every 10 minutes. How it goes: at first you have your machete and you walk around with it. Then you see a dinosaur and you die. The End.\n\nOk, that's what's going on most of the time. I do managed to kill one utharaptor with my rusty machete, and then i bought bow. And I was thinking "oh my, at last i can shoot at things!", but then i had to exit the game (lunch time) and when i ran it again - my bow was GONE. It seems if you have something, you must use it right away to earn more money. Yeah... then i tried to kill another utharaptor with my machete so I could buy another bow, but i just died, died and died... If you're theHunter or Carnivores fan - I DO NOT recommend it. Avoid it at all costs. But if you have masochistic needs... go on, buy it. Graphics and sounds ar nice. Yeah, those are really nice. 4/10","April 19","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If that is simply the end game scope for this game, simply bagging kills then that would kill the game for me. It would be such an anti-climax. This game has huge potential.

Zim","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010403528/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTop Notch! This is the best dino game that has been out for years. It has incorperated the surival system into to it very nicely, it makes the sense of finding a cache or camp/settelment rewarding. The looting system is implemented very well making it easy to grab and run and the GPS tracker "SettlerMate" makes navigation and tracking a dream.\n\nThe dinos are difficult to kill which they should be, tracking dinos is also very immersive due to the fact that you may find tracks from a different Utahraptor then the one your tracking, also dino could be tracking you at the same time (bloody T-Rex).\n\nThe Map is huge as well which is amazing, a lot of room for tactics on the hunt. The landscape has a very unique feel to it with plenty of places to hide if being tracked. The plants are spot on and the dangerous plants add a glorious mechanic to the game.\n\nThe Cons are you can't swim yet, the Dino AI needs a bit of work (got tons of pics of T-Rex smiling for his close ups). The pathfinding needs to be refined around obsticles and no real character customization at the moment. The sound of T-rex walking sounds like a drum not a dino stomping around.\n\nALL IN ALL IT HAS ONLY JUST BEEN RELEASED SO HANG ON.\n\n","December 15, 2014","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can sprint but it's loud so you have to desperately take your time and on the rare chance that you do meet up with someone, the feeling is great because you are two, now. The map is large but not infinite, allowing you to reach other players if you can survive the trek. It can be scary at times, when you're crouched next to a bush hearing something far off coming closer. Trying to guage where it's coming from. And how many they are. Very tense moments, like the first time you see a Rex from far off.\n\nThe game does change a bit once you find a gun or two. I know it's a hunting game but when all you have is 5 bows, you aren't hunting anymore. You're fleeing to the safety of other players and the slim chance of good luck along the way.\n\nThere are things that I love about this game. The 8 year old in me that still loves dinosaurs more than anything else loves the bejesus out this game. But there are some issues.\n\nThe crashing is still bad. That is going to need to improve quickly. It's hard to develop a rhythym when players are constantly getting dropped. I'm on win8.1 and I'm not lagging. But it still crashes all the time.\n\nThe other big issue and I swear it's not because I'm bad, but the aiming mechanism is awful. Bow"hunting" is nearly impossible. The guns are a lottle bit better because you don't have to draw them back but it still ain't great. The game gets choppy to the point of death. And then you respawn all the way across the map and have to sneak, crawl, and walk a good 4000m to reach the other players. The game has a way of spreading you all out .\n\nSo. It has amaing potential but right now, developers, this has to get better. Like, $20 better, if you catch my drift. Please don't let this die.","December 15, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

TheHunter is a game that you can take slow, enjoy stalking prey and bring your own weapons to the field. What I loved about TheHunter is I can play by myself if I wish, and all I have to do if I need to pause game is bring up menu screen.... I understand during multiplayer this cannot happen BUT I do NOT play multiplayer. Being able to pause is very useful with a toddler and a baby in the house.\n\nNow my huge gripe... as I see so far, this game is totaly NOT solo friendly. I have played for hours, have found many backpacks and such to open, and all I get is a bow. I had a shotgun for 2 seconds before a Trex got me. So now all I have is a bow, and a couple arrows. First, after running around for 15 mins I see no dinos.... at all. The only animal that wont instantly attack me runs from me. I got a lung/heart shot on it with a bow and it ran a quarter of the map and never died, shot it two more times before I gave up. Doc would be ashamed! The second dino which I can kill, runs in packs..... and then the third dino all I see in desription is, dont hunt it alone..... So Tri/dont take down easy dont hunt alont, Raptor/runs in packs dont take along, Trex/dont take alone... I mean come on!!!\n\nMany other small issues so far, like arrows not combining when you find them. I still have yet to harvest my first kill... even with lung/heart shots... I just dont know..... I do however recomend TheHunter for people who like slow paced hunting games that are semi realistic.","December 15, 2014","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If they take the focus off the player on player, and make it more about hunting the actual dinosaurs, I'll be alot happier. This is something I'd play alone, or with friends. I'm not into the whole Day Z experience, of working really hard on something then someone comes and robs all your hard earned stuff.\nIf they add more dinosaurs, some herd based herbivores, and get some more survival aspects in there, this will be top notch. At the moment it is very unforgiving. You start with a bow and 5 arrows, which has not been enough for me to bag a raptor, as of yet. The problem with the raptor being the "easy" prey is that they travel in groups. Once they get some more dinos in, I will be more inclined to play.\nAs of yet, I'd say hold off and wait for some much needed content, unless you want to jump on a populated server and run the risk of being camped by someone lacking thumbs.","December 15, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At present there are only three dinosaurs with two more coming...not exactly a wide variety.  In addition to more dinosaur types, I'd like to see a survival element added to the game (hunger, thirst, etc.) that could be toggled on or off since some hate mixing and matching hunting and survival.  The stamina bar runs out a bit too quickly for my taste as the average human being can sprint longer than say, two to three seconds.  With all of that said, the idea of hunting dinos is a rather appealing notion and I can't wait to see what else gets added over the course of development.

I won't lie, I enjoyed it a lot the first few hours. But as fast as I heard about the so called "full release" I lost hope completely. I mean it's pretty clear that it's an unfinished game lacking a ton of content. Sure we can expect that glitches and bugs will get fixed in future updates but if they have no plans of future content such as survival aspects and new dinosaurs I wouldn't recommend it.","April 6, 2015","false","29.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game started out bumpy, but now with the introduction of the Velociraptor, the game has become much better. The next great addition was the addition of the machete which allows you to kill Velociraptors in one hit and Utahraptors in 3-5 hits.

THP is the closest sans the narration by Sir Richard Attenbourough (John Hammond), w/c lent a brilliant eeriness to the environment. Primal Eden is so like Site B in Trespasser, but much improved and with more realistic dino behavior. The gameplay is much simplified and more user friendly in THP. It only needs more dinos like the Brachiosaur or Ankylossur. Love this game.","March 27, 2015","true","229.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game runs great on my rig at maximum and looks fantastic. The dinos movement is realistic and they look like massive predators. Guns handle well, and sound realistic.\n\nThough there are a few things i would like to see implamented.\n\n1)Base/Camp building. Setting down tents for storage, and perhaps sonic emitters to keep away dinos. Wooden barricades to keep out pesky thieves. Trips wires and more.\n\n2) A more informative/User friendly UI and Inventory. Perhaps a grid inventory system.\n\n3) Group creation on PVP servers.\n\n4) Hunger/Thirst implamamentation.\n\nRight now they have the workings of DayZ but it seems half hearted like they dove into the genre because its popular not because they know exactly what there doing. I could be wrong and it could be a big surprise hit. But for right now its a decent game, and fun to watch friends be mauled and shook around like a chew toy when the Rex catches their scent.","January 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There no controller compatible, you can walk all the way that you have to find the weapons of course when you start the game, you don't have guns but the only weapon you have is just a knife. The dinosaurs are hard to hunt them because they move really fast, when I try to kill them they go around me and its really hard to kill them. That's my review I'm not saing its a bad game but its a good game, my rating is 7/10.","November 22, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I'm always wanting more from it, not just variety in dinosaurs but in gameplay aspects. There's nothing beyond get a gun and kill dinosaurs. You can skulk around and maybe ambush a few while prone, but that's it. Shoot and kill.\n\nI'd rather them put items like wood to build a tree stand, smoke bomb to escape a raptor attack, decoys to ambush dino's from a distance. I say these things because they seem feasible within the engine. I'll comeback to the gam every few months and go at it for a day or two, then get bored again.\n\nBottom-Line: If it's less than $10, pick it up. You're fist dino encoutner will be exhilirating. The second will be your practice trials. The third will be taking on a trike probably. And finally you'll take on a rex. After that, the gmae is over.","October 18, 2015","true","46.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some definate high and low points to this game.\n\nPros\nGorgeous.\nFun\nHuge map\nDecent weapon selection\nsound effects are great.\npeople tend to be nice.\n\nCons\nA tad overpriced. However a great buy if its on sale. (i got it in a bundle for 5$)\nKind of a pain to get your own hosted server to work\nGame sometimes spawns you over and over by a trex....ouch\nWhile infinitely better than having to buy EVERYTHING with real money like the original, random loots are terrible sometimes when your 1 hit from death and you get 6 boxes with no health items in it and a tiny little dino bites your toe and kills you.\n\nA couple weather bugs where the sun goes all truman show...its not game breaking but it breaks the immersion....though its hillarious to see.\n\nLacks a fast travel mechanic... which i could do without for taveling...but when spawning it would be appreciated... Like you go to join a server with a friend Oh hey....your.....2 miles that way and im unarmed... takes a while to get to your friends sometimes...\n\nOverall...its quite a fun experience and almost forces you to quite jurassic park atleast once if you like the original or the concept...id highly reccomend picking this game up when its on sale\n\nOverall 7.75/10","October 25, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You need to explore the island in search of more powerful weapons, clothing and equipment. Sounds easy? Well not only is the island littered with poisonous plants, but deadly dinosaurs that roam the island looking to feast on the weak. Only the foolish will challenge the mighty Tyrannosaur Rex alone. Careful planning, cooperation and backpacks filled with ammo and weapons is needed to bring this beast down. But watch out! The island is also populated with highly intelligent Utahraptors traveling in packs. Like wolves they communicate and work together to bring down a lonely hunter. Make sure to check you six! Want a more peaceful hunt? In that case the Triceratops might be an easier prey.","October 2, 2015","true","63.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But while the dinosaurs are impressive and the world large there is just something not fun about having to search for weapons in order to hunt. A hunting game that you do not get weapons and cannot even punch to defend yourself while you search. I am not sure if there is a pattern but I have spent large amounts of time in the game looking for the tools needed to actually hunt. When I play a hunting game I want to search for animals, not the weapons.","February 3","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I LOVE IT catastrophic is the word because that is how the game is intended to play like EX: this is u starting u hear the faint cherp of something thinking it might be a bird u sprint to were the gps located a base about 4000 meters away u have nothing to fear if this is like the other the hunter game were u dont see a thing for about six hours and then some how it disapears then u should be fine, but its not at all like the other the hunter it is 100X quicker with spotting something. now u hear a growl u hope its ambient but its not so u are cowaring in ur own crap waiting for this moster to stroll off, well it smells u and it is hungry its been hunting all day and the most its gotten was a cricket so it is going to follow u and hunt u till its dead or u are. so u finallly decide ima person i am smart i should be able to kill it, then u step out to find 6 raptors waiting, yep ur screwed  better get back in the tree trunk u were just in ohhh wait they now know ur hiding spot and have found and have killed u now they will have a delisous dinner. next u respawn only theres a  peson next to u they say they want to team and u do and that person leads u to bases u had no idea about so now ur geared in noble hunting clothes and have a shotgun with tons of ammo and a elephant gun(the .700 rifle) and are ready to take on the world of eden, well the world of eden it already knows u want to kill a rex so whats better then to give u 3 ahhhhhh this is ur first time seeing 3 rexes so u hide ur buddy on the other hand runs and lewers 2 of em away ahh theres 1 just there u know u want to so  u shoot this bahemeth of a liizard and realize it gonna take a few shots so u shoot it 1nce more and u hope it goes down but ur luck has run out. u imbasol i shot it in the foot twice and its only 80 meters from u so u pull out ur shotgun in hopes u can make it run away,remember how ur a bad shot well u still are u miss 6 times and u die u rage wuit and realise that game is amazingly catastrophic in the end\n\nAs i said before this game is catastrophice at the end this stroy might not happen the same way u might get killed by something else but eventually u will die and it will be a major death that makes u rage quit\n\nI recomend this to all who have patience like fps games and like sitting in there own feases (jk on the feases part) but i will say dont buy it now unless u cant resist wait for the next update when they add there 4th dino","January 24, 2015","true","80.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I recommend you to wear headphones while playing this game because the sounds are just beautiful like hearing yourself cross a swamp while keeping an eye out for raptors just makes the game intense and realistic. Unfortunatly there are some things that the game lacks like how it only has 1 map, 5 dinos, and 12 or more weapons. Weapons are not really the problem for me, it just needs more dinosaurs and maybe another map. I HOPE that in the future the devs will add more content, other than that I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME if you like adventure, hunting, survival, or dinosaurs.

Also everyone right now in game seems to be wearing the same....dull\n\nMaybe some sort of save of some achieved game items. Whats the point in joining a server then building up a weapon arsenal only for the person who created the server to decide to take the server down resulting in you losing everything ? You then have to start from the very beginning again on a new server. Its frustrating and not your fault when this happens. But it feels like you are being penalised.\n\nMore Dinosaurs.

The developers are patching and fixing bugs as they go along. Excellent, UNIQUE, game play. This is part of the reason it gets bad reviews, its not what people are use to. One size fits all difficulty, best gameplay experience, join open games. Port forewarding internet play. This game probably is not worth 60 dollars, however it also does not cost that much. Buy, Join, Play, then constructively give criticism to the developers for a much better gameplay experience.","April 2, 2015","true","9.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I liked the premise of this game and finally convinced myself to download it, hoping it would fulfill the dinosaur-hunting void in my life. I played this game for about 6 hours before finally rage-quitting. I found the game very frustrating. At times I would be insta-chomped by a tyrannosaurus or pack of utahraptors without any chance of using my weapons In other lives I would be running away like crazy or staring down at a weak little velociraptor thinking about how nice it would be if I had ammunition and could therefore kill the dinosaur before it killed me. The ability to go back to your death-location and recover your weapons was nice, except that the game's respawn point was so far away from where you needed to go. The five minute walk to recover your weapons felt like an hour.\n\nAll I wanted in this game was to kill dinosaurs. I couldn't care less about the "survival" aspect of the game. I finally did kill some utah raptors and velociraptors, but the amount of effort I was putting was not worth the reward. I thought about recruiting my boyfriend to play with me, but with the size of the map and the spawn points and death-respawn and all, there is no way we could have physically gotten close enough to each other to play cooperatively.\n\n\nIf you want a dinosaur-themed game, invest $1 into Orion:Prelude and satisfy your dinosaur-killing urges. And now the trailers for ARK:Survival have come out and I am now in counting down the days until I get to kill dinosaurs AND ride them.","May 24, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I would just like to state that first, the Q's can easily be killed, I killed one in one shot, they can easily be avoided and dodged too, and with the newest update they aren't really a problem anymore, but when you find them still a threat. I think this game could be huge if you update it lots and prove everyone wrong about it. The quality of the scenery is amazing, the sounds are too, there's birds and butterflies flying around, at night it's really sketchy and different, there's crazy storms that happen. I'm a big fan of this game and I have a few suggestions that I think other people will like. Definitely add the ability to swim and jump... those are pretty basic skills for people who just dropped in on pods. I also think you should add crafting, such as traps, and cutting wood, it would be so scary to try and harvest wood sometimes when you need to and who drops into this environment with no survival skills am i right? I feel as if there is a low field of vision, like you can't see dinos farther than a certain distance which makes no sense when you should be able to see them. I'm not sure why none of the dinosaurs attack each other, but I think it would cool if say a T-rex ate a Triceratops, and then after little raptors come in for a meal, because they're scavengers. I'm sure you're working on a lot of things already, but if you aren't I would like to see more guns, and silenced ones, maybe a stash for your items and overall deeper character and skill customization and possibly some vehicles or something cool. Being in a storm made me feel like there should be natural disasters, such as a tsunami, hurricane, or especially a volcanic eruption! But OVERALL, the number 1 thing that I would like to see ASAP, is more dinosaurs because I feel as if I don't run into as many dinosaurs as I normally would like to. Plus that there is literally 5 dinosaurs right now, the T-rex,velociraptor,Utahraptor,triceratops and the Quetzalcoatlus. You should add more flying reptiles and aquatic dino's such as the Spinosaurus, and maybe the Crocodile. I realize that you can only place dino's that are in the same time era but I have some suggestions for some must have's. The Pachycephalosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Stegasaurus, Brontosaurus and Pentaceratops. A few more random ones I would like are The Giant Sloth, Allosaurus, Iguanodon, Pachyrhinosaurus, Herrerasaurus, Scipionyx, also some omnivores such as the Abrictosaurus, Avimimus, and the Chirostenotes.\nNow I feel like if you guys updated a lot, and you see what I mean by these paragraphs, that this could be a game everyone loves.

The dinosaurs can be really terrifying, especially when you are alone. Once you have a group and some guns (with ammo!) the Velociraptors and Utahraptors become fairly easy to kill.\n\nThe Quetz birds are still very dangerous since they grab you and drop you (one of us got 'chain killed' by the birds at least 4-5 times hehe). They are huge and dangerous and really bring an added element of danger (death from above) when you are walking around in open areas.\n\nOf course the T-Rex is death on two legs as always and requires a good group effort to take down (or powerful guns, e.g. .700 rifle or .50 sniper).\n\nFor more relaxing and hunting type of gameplay you can focus on the Triceratops, since shooting those means wounding them 10 times out of 10, so you end up having to follow their tracks and blood trails for follow up shots to kill them. They are not dangerous at all (never had one attack me) and the biggest danger hunting those comes from not paying attention to, or attracting due to gunshots, the other dinosaurs.\n\nMy two main things that I hope to see improved in the game though:\n\nBetter AI and dinosaur movement - they are sometimes a bit robotic, e.g. they run to a spot and then freeze for no reason. This makes it a little easier to kill them, but they are still lethal and can do lots of damage to you, especially if you play solo.\n\nMore dinosaurs! - Sure there are 5 ingame now, but I am hoping they will add more dinosaurs. I'd like to see a mix of both docile (like the triceratops) and lethal ones.. both large ones and small ones!\n\nOverall though the game is really fun, especially if you play with friends!","April 2, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Shooting mechanics on this game are realistic, but I think the bow and arrows need a little bit of work.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty immersive. I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants after a T-rex quickly snuck up on me while I was trying to get loot from a storage crate. I really enjoyed the time I've spent on this game so far. I've been waiting for years for another game like carnivores (except improved greatly), and I really think this game has the potential to fill the gap in the market for a quality dinosaur survival/hunting game.\n\nSince this is an early release, there aren't many dinosaurs to hunt, and there are just a few graphic glitches that I've come across. A save option (or a hive that saves your gear/progress like DayZ) would be great, and I'm sure they'll implement something like that in the time to come.\n\nI hope this game gets more publicity and traction in the gaming community because this game would be very fun to play with/against larger groups of people.","December 15, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However with the the totally unrealistic  balance of predators to prey no claims of a serious hunting simulation can be made.    Most of the animals should be herbivores not carnivores.  I knew thay intended a March release but five total species with four of them being predators is just wrong.  Also the developers just squashed any hope of any further development.  In their latest post they said they would only be working on patches and would not be devloping it any further.   (See there April 1st post release round up).  In addition they said that the current sorry state of the game exceeds their original intentions.\nI have backed several early access games and this is about the worst. (The Stomping Land takes that honor).  They took advantage of peoples assumption that early access games are to help fund devlopment.  They went from early access to release in six months.  This was basically having people pay to beta test.  This is a common complaint about early access but I have never seen one so blatant about it.","April 1, 2015","false","38.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Imagine DayZ with dinosaurs, cool right? Wrong, this game is just so poorly put together it is unbelievable. You start the game off landed on some "Primal" planet. You are given no objective, all you are given is a crap machete and a thumb drive or something. This thumb drive gives you the location of something... sometimes. Honestley I don't know what its for; sometimes it gives a location sometimes it doesn't, its emotional I don't know. So your "goal" I assume is to hunt things, judging by the way THATS THE NAME OF THE GAME! But all they give you is this crap machete that does ♥♥♥♥ for damage and drains your stamina. OH, did I mention theres stamina; this takes longer to regen then stamina in Darksouls. There is this huge map but it is impossible to explore because you move slower then the snail that won worlds slowest snail! It isn't like that matters anyways because by the time you get anywhere something will have found you and killed you. These Dinosaurs have more spatial awareness then you as a player could ever hope for. I know what you're thinking, "But that's more realistic!" ONE: What are you a paleontologist or a time traveler how do you know how dinosaurs work, and TWO: That's fine, but you can have that if you give your player nothing to defend themselves with. There are weapons, I assume, I only found one gun and bullets for others. Just like in DayZ you have to just wander until you find something, the differance is that in DayZ there are clear locations that suggest loot. Here it's just strait RNG, maybe you'll fine a box out in the middle of nowhere, maybe you wont. Maybe you do find something, it most likely won't have any weapons, just ammo to taunt you. I guess there are like bases that have a better chance of finding something but I could only find one.

(Its also a lot better to play with friends)\n\nThe only thing I really dont get is that this is a full release, but really it should still be in Alpha.\nAlpha is mainly the additions being added to the game.\nBeta is mainly the fixing of bugs and glitchs from those additions, etc.\nIt seems like the devs are doing both of these at the same time in a scatterbrain sorta way.\n\nPros:\n\n-Open world\n-Great Graphics\n-Amazing Sounds\n-Easy Controls\n-Nice dino animations (can be a little glitchy at times)\n-Co-op and multiplayer is fun and smooth (depending on host)\n\nCons:\n\n-Many bugs\n-Can't swim\n-Cant climb/Jump\n-Cant build/place anything, not even traps\n-Only 5 dino types in the world\n-Weight system is very limited (leaning more towards realism)\n\nAs for the content in the game so far, its quite playable but limited in the variety of dinos to hunt.\nthere are lots of different "biomes" and areas to explore in the world.\n\nI would love to see more herbivores added as there is only one.\nThe ratio is 4:1 (5:1 counting pvp) so be very cautious this is a survival game that relays on your senses and judgement for life or death.\n\nTip:\nIf its storming out, wait it out. A T-Rex came charging at me full speed and I couldn't react becuase visability was so low. Nearly had a heart attack.\n\nVerdict 6.5/10\nPlayble, fun online and rewarding (when you finally get that T-rex down)","May 6, 2015","false","32.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It just feels too complicated..please make the server hosting the same method as the original hunter...1 click and go..until this is made better I cannot reccomend this game.. while I will continue to play, I don't reccomend others do unless you already have it.","April 20, 2015","false","22.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"
