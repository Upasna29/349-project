If you find that none of it was helpful, then downvote. Thank you.\n\nA bit of background on me: I'm a lover of visual novels and otome games, and have been for a few years, back when Voltage only had My Forged Wedding and Pirates in Love out in English and they were considered pioneers for casual visual novels in America. (PSP games didn't count for casual, since it was a console with a relatively small market even then.) Since then, I've played probably 30-40 visual novels, from the 20-minute to the 10-hour full playthroughs, and from PC to Android.\n\nWhen I saw True Lover's Knot, I went for it immediately after reading the description and looking at the screenshots. I'm personally a big fan of vacation romances, and cruises are my favorite type of vacation romance. The character art was gorgeous as well, and my initial assessment of the art wasn't incorrect. However, I can't say that after having played this game I would pay anything more than $0.99 for it. Here's why, in a short list format that I then explain in detail below.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Gorgeous character sprites\n+ Random video sequences of cruise things happening\n+ Travel facts about European cities in "guides" that can be skipped, if desired\n+ A fun match-3 minigame that isn't too difficult\n+ Proper spelling and grammar\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-  "No" to a stranger on a cruise means nothing: CONSENT (nonsexual, see below)\n-  Short for the price, only a 45 minute first playthrough\n-  Forces minigames in otherwise pointless scenes\n-  Dialogue mundane and expositional at times\n-  My personal favorite character was not a love interest :(\n\n-  Can't overwrite save files\n-  Sprites aren't same size relative to each other\n-  Sprites sometimes enlarge and cut off the hair in certain scenes\n-  Audio overlaps weirdly in a certain scene\n-  Can't skip long animation sequences\n\n\nEXPLANATION: Why do I not recommend this game?\n\nFirst of all, and the most obvious reason, is that this game is SHORT. A $7 game should not be 45 minutes long for a single playthrough, and certainly not 1.5 hours long in its entirety. I am a generally fast reader, and I see that other reviewers have had first game playthroughs from 1-2 hours, but that's still VERY short for a $7 game. I'm also certain I got all the dialogue I could squeeze out of the game, as I went back to the beginning and re-read all the choices possible, which was a massive pain because I could not overwrite save files and didn't know that when I created them (6 slots available).\n\nA visual novel is first and foremost about the novel half of it, and even discarding the brevity of this game, the writing still fell short. As in, it wasn't great, maybe not even good. No matter how gorgeous the art, few will finish a visual novel if the writing is poor, unless it is an H-game, which this is not, or very short, which this is.\n\nMost of the dialogue in the beginning centered around what the main character and her friend planned to do next. Scene-setting detail was bare and actual description of actions and events were uninteresting and gave very little feeling that the author knew what cruise entertainment was. A certain scene seemed to exist entirely to introduce a new character, who then had no bearing on the following plot, and another scene was entirely there for the purpose of making the player play a minigame.\n\nOn the minigame, a small pet peeve of mine was that it's a software-based minigame that manipulates familiar file types for audio and images, which made no sense when it was deployed to unstick the coolant in a cruise engine. Another smaller mistake is that at a certain point, after choosing an option, a voice recording just keeps playing over the BGM even when you choose to leave the room. (The instance of voice acting is poorly fitting for the characters, one moreso than the other. The worse one seemed creepy at best and slimy at worst.)\n\nAnd finally, on the topic that cinched my disapproval for the game: CONSENT and how it relates to the main character's personality. When meeting a stranger on the cruise, he offers to sex you up within five minutes of meeting. If you choose the choices to decline further interaction with him, he then offers to show you around a Spanish city the next day. There is no choice here now; the main character will "dream about him," accompany him, and continues to associate with him after that tour. The way the narrative was written, it was clear that to save writing the author just kept this character as the tour guide for the city, and if that meant making the main character choose to accompany him, so be it.\n\nNot only does this ignore the player's choices, rendering them pointless if they choose to deny the man, it also gives the feeling that if a strange man on a cruise offers to bang you and you decline to talk to him, you will still end up following him like a pup.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game. If it were free, I would give it a 5/10 (mediocre next to many free visual novels in English), but for the price, I would give it a 2.5/10. I would not buy this again under any circumstances, and hope that if you choose to purchase it, you know what you are buying at least a little bit more with my review.\n\nIf you read all the way down here and still find my review unhelpful, then downvote. Otherwise, don't. Thank you.","December 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 144 of 163 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","144","163","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/416630/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","As someone who has been on a cruise before and enjoys visual novels, I had high hopes for this game. The character sprites are appealing and the trailer look promising. Sadly, the moment I turned on the game I felt a bit turned off, which only increased when I began to play it. It took quite a while for me to gather the will power to finish this game, despite it being so short.\n\nThe story is what drives most visual novels; love-able characters, dialog that draws you in and a desire to see where the protagonist ends up. This game has none of that. True Lover’s Knot is about an IT worker named Emma Long who is from America but now works and lives in London. Her best friend Lucas has acquired two tickets for a seven day cruise thanks to his charming personality and scoring a great deal for their company. He invites Emma and what you would expect to happen next is tons of fun and lots of surprises.\n\nWrong. What you get is conversations with characters that are very short and a lot of the times don’t matter to the ending. In the banner for the game there are seven characters, only two of which are romantic options. Santi and Scott are your only choices, not Lucas who is awesome nor any of the female characters who are barely fleshed out anyway. Anna and Erica work on the ship and despite both having to deal with their busy jobs they seem to find a lot of time to talk to Emma and Lucas. Tiffany is a woman randomly met on the ship who doesn’t offer anything to the story at all but hey, she’s cute.\n\nYou meet Santi randomly on the ship, he’s a Casanova who offers to do you right. You only meet with him twice and that’s apparently all it takes to fall in love. His dialog reads like a horribly cliche romance novel and made me cringe the entire time, however his voice mail that he left Emma was the worst. It was actually voiced by someone, saying horribly cheesy “romantic” things and it was a huge turn off. Your other choice is Scott, a dull but very stable man who is rich beyond your wildest dreams. He’s also your ex boyfriend from college whom you left for another man who was a “bad boy” and gave you the D. Somehow, after you screwed him over in college ten years ago in dare I might say an insulting way, he’s still in love with you. Despite you explaining why you left him (after cheating on him) and the most disgusting line in the whole game, which was utter by Emma, saying that she and Scott had dated for three months and he never put out. She just flat out admits she left him because he worked too hard, studied too hard and didn’t put out and Scott STILL wants to love her. I was done.\n\nIf the shallow protagonist and the shallow story weren’t bad enough, the general look of the game is also not appealing. When I first started up what I noticed was the very basic look of things, the title screen, the menu, the text...it was all bland. Ok, not the end of the world, right? But then I noticed the backgrounds. All the character sprites are very cute and one in an anime style but the background are mostly stock photos, real life stock photos. So you see real people and real environments in back of these cute sprites. I did not like how they meshed together. Another thing I wasn’t fond of were the unskippable movies. They were short but they were recycled and also were with real people. Not to mention, they took the place of where actual dialog and descriptions could go. Why show a video of random people dancing when you can write about it? This is a novel, yes a visual one but a novel none the less.\n\nI also found fault in the gameplay of True Lover’s Knot. Emma is an IT worker and ends up being asked to fix things over and over in the game. From someone’s cellphone to an actual issue with the ship, all these situation do nothing for the story. These could have easily been worked in to help raise someone’s affection but you gain nothing from doing these tasks so they just feel shoe horned in. What you do get is a boring match three mini game, that you can’t skip. You have to keep playing the mini game when it pops up, completely distracting from the story. You also cannot skip text in the game and you can’t put the dialog on auto play, you have to keep clicking through text. There is also no option to change the speed of the text.\n\nI only found two things that I enjoyed about this title, Lucas and the music. The music has a very relaxing feel to it and made playing the game a little bit easier. The story is rushed, the endings are unsatisfying and it seems like whoever wrote it has never been on a cruise before. The game is even too short to collect all the cards, so be prepared to idle a bit. If it’s on sale buy it, maybe, but I cannot in good consciousness recommend this game.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","February 24","false","3.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Your "friend" and even some of the side characters have more depth.\n- The city "tours" are very basic outlines of culture, cuisine and economy, over a single static screen, reading a bit like Wikipedia summaries.\n- There are very few meaningful decisions. In the end, I think, only one.\n- After that particular decision, the ending is staggeringly short.\n- The puzzle minigame does add variety, but because the game is quite short you'll only actually play it a dozen or so times.\n- The puzzle game really feels tacked-on in any case. It adds relatively little meat to the game, while interrupting the (minimal) plot.\n\nOn the plus side, the art is nice, as is the concluding song.\n\nA thorough waste of US$7. Get Clannad or Fruit of Grisaia or something instead. Costs more, but the amount of depth bears no comparison. If you want an otome game... maybe hatoful boyfirend; it shouldn't be hard to find something better, in any case.","February 28","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. First of all it's linear, and when I say that I mean your choices don't mean anything (you can't even decline a date...seriously WTF?!?!). Also you go on a cruise with Lucas and you can't romance him. Are you serious?!? This a romantic novel and I can't get together with my best friend!?! And to rub salt on the wound he always marries another girl. So that made me mad. Plus the two potential lovers are boring and creepy. One of them is a creeper who doesn't take no for an answer and the other can't shut up about his work. Also why only guys? Us lesbians and bisexuals play these games too. As a bisexual myself I have to say that I'm qute dissapointed. I mean you had three female charaters you could've easily made love interests. Overall this game felt empty and lazily made. So I suggest that you save your money and go for a game that doesn't feel incomplete.","December 30, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
