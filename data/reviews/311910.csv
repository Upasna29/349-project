The idea of a digging company would be to create a digging site for a big major contruction company or even mine a location down to size for money. Sadly, this game dosent have that. In my short play through this is what you get. You get a sandbox, where size decides how big your vehicles are, not the size of the location your working on. The location you work on is overly small with options to only a few vehicles. In sandbox, you do not buy vehicles. You can not even travel your lot. The map is so small you can travel it from one end to the other end in about 10 seconds. In short, the sandbox has no purpose.\n\nThe campaign is, sad. You do create a company, but all your doing is going from lot to lot. It's boring, the money you get unlocks better vehicles, sadly thats all it does. Playing an hour of it is the most boring game I have. It would be more interesting if the city itself was freeroam. It would be great if you can roam a construction site instead of just a lot. What you get is a very short game with nothing going for it and sadly will scare away most modders that would come to a game to make it better. Secret to fixing the game? Make the map bigger, and make sandbox mean something more than just toying with small vehicles.\n\nAlso in some maps your vehicles are too large for you to move around or even dig. Dumptrucks are also useless. I mean completely useless, its faster to drive to unload instead of unload to the dumptruck and dump on the other side of the map. The other side of the map is 7 to 12 seconds away. And thats not going 30 mph, or even close. Would only recommend this game to children. Too simple for adults to play.","October 15, 2014","false","1.6"," 160 of 224 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","160","224","4","2"

I would have wished for a bit more of a challenge in the progression or more levels as I am afraid you will beat the game fairly quickly.\n\nHaving said that; I am pretty sure if you try to have your Construction site as tidy as possible and a hole that is as accurate as possible, you will have a bit more of a challenge, when I tested the game I was too tired to give a darn about tidyness.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game to everybody who was deeply dissapointed with the other Digger Simulators out there.","October 15, 2014","true","2.5"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","28","50","0","1"

I have tried the most available games about excavator simulation, and what i really liked about this one was the controller - IF you use a controller, i use a USB Xbox 360 controller and it really feel good, i can work fast with presission and this is a huge advantage contra keyboard, the controller is more intunitive, its analogue sensitivity so you can regulate how fast you want to move any part of the excavator, that again makes you able to work faster and do several actions at the same time. I guess it is from my perspective the greatest adventage of this game, that you are able to operate the machinery with joysticks - and with the same motions as in a real excavator. That said, yeah it is a digger simulator, it aint supposed to be perfect, it got its flaws both in dynamic and physics BUT not bad compared to other simulators.\n\nWhen it comes to equipment, it got what you need and even more. And i love the fact that you actualy can switch to different buckets on some of the excavators. My favorite class is with no doubt the medium class, it feels bether than the largest class.\n\nAll in all, YES it is a digger "arcade" simulator, but it got a great potential, it is fun and when using a analogue controller MAYBE the most realistic one. I got some experience with real excavators, and i have to say it is much more fun when you got that feeling that you manage all the controllers flawless at your first dig! - I have not tried the game with keyboard, and i do not dare to eighter!  :)","October 28, 2014","true","3.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

I've gone through the most digging games and simulators and I must say I enjoy this one. The gameplay is solid, the controls are good especially if played with a controller (Altho the big truck could use some remaps) and there are quite a lot of machines. Physics are good too, but sometimes the bucket thinks it's empty/full when it shouldn't be.

Wish there were more levels but then again it is only a week old.... For me, i am a actually operator in real life it was extremely hard to use the jeyboard controls but once i pluged in my controller it became much easier due to the fact that the joysticks were laid out similar to my machine in real life. The missions take to long and are very hard to complete being accurate.... also the judgeing system is very harsh 10 mins to dig a foundation might be a little short if i was designing a game id give the people 15-20 mins. Not that many vehicles, the buckets on the machines and the back of the dumptruck fill up way to fast. The bulldozer still makes no sense to me after 4 hrs of gameplay cant figure out how to properly move the dirt and get a good rating. Also wish there was a way to skip missions. But overall id give it a 7/10 not a bad game for being very new.

No patches yet. I might change my view later if the developer decides to upgrade Dig It! to something better, but I doubt it.\n\nThis game has the potential to be a nice game. But it isn't a good game as it is when I write this. The areas you can "work" in, are so small you would belive it is an actual sandbox. You can hardly turn your vehicle inside some of the places (reminds me of Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, where he has to turn between two walls). The developer team chose to have awkward key combinations, instead of making them intuitive. You never have to drive the trucks and deliver sand or gravel, just drive to the gate and it is empty. How can they call that a simulator? Its not even close!\n\nBugs. Lots of bugs and problems:\n-People are reporting they can't dig (it is a DIGGING SIMULATOR!!).\n-If you can dig, you can scrape the ground and get a pile of dirt from nothing. In fact you can produce dirt from nothing.\n-Camera is crap! I wonder how the developers played this game without noticing the camera-bugs.\n-If you try to exit a vehicle close to another object, you start to fly... you can see the whole city from up in the air while you fall down again.\n-There is no animation for the people sitting in the machines. None at all! How come the developers never did think of that?\n\nConclusion: I would give this game a 1.5/10 (where 0.5 points is for nice colours). I recommend you give your money to charity instead of buying this game.","October 27, 2014","false","4.9"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","2"
