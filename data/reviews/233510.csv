"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/recommended/233510/","kekmet","kekmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/","501 products in account","Lunnye Devitsy has taught me that I am secretly a homing pigeon.\n\nA simple platformer/exploration game, you play a little alien that has fallen from the moon and now wishes to find its way back. Lunnye Devitsy boasts a great deal of atmosphere and many different paths to take... eventually. Until you find all the necessary 'powerups' to properly explore, though, there are relatively few paths you can take, and some of these are dead ends with no escape. This, combined with a labyrinthian world to explore, can make early progress frustrating if you aren't very good at picking out different paths through the overwhelming particle effects and sometimes washed-out graphics. Which I at least, was not, resulting in getting stuck in the same dang place several times. Since there seems to be no ingame restart feature, quitting and restarting can be the only way to get out of some of these traps.\n\nOnce you find the double jump, though, the game is so much less frustrating and exploration so much more engaging that it boggles the mind a bit that it wasn't implemented right out of the gate (right when you drop off of the moon?). Immediately more paths are open to you and those traps are less common. That you can miss this entirely for the first part of the game if you go the wrong way- and the game offers no hints of which direction to head- is a confusing choice. So, head right first, is my advice. Your salvation is in the forest.\n\nThe game does save what collectibles you find along the way, though, which is helpful in decreasing frustration. The controls are simple enough, the alien is a little floaty and can get difficult to land precisely, and nothing aside from dead ends are a threat, so explore and enjoy the music. Even falling (or in my case, purposefully flinging myself) off the world is only a minor incovenience.\n\nNormally I'm inclined to give higher ranking to games with an interesting visual presence; I love my shinies. At first glance, Lunnye Devitsy does seem to have this in spades. The stark, sharp black landscapes and flashes of color are gorgeous, but the particle effects and glow of some of the areas makes things difficult to see at times. It could've been toned down just a bit and would've improved the atmosphere they were going for. The wind and water effects and sounds are very cool, though a little too loud for the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nSo, as a casual exploration platformer, it doesn't offer too much new or different. If you really enjoy that sort of game, though, like I do, you'll probably enjoy it for awhile.","February 22, 2014","true","4.0"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

The premise is very simple - you are a little alien that drops off the moon and you need to find your way back. The gameplay is 2D platform style, and involves exploring a huge floating mountain trying to find 6 different ways to return to the moon at the top of the map. The game offers very little instruction, tasking you with figuring out everything on your own. None of the tasks are overly difficult, but some require thorough exploration, experimentation and deduction. Overall, the vibe of the game is very laid back and mysterious, which is probably its best aspect. I love that there's a game out there in 2013 that offers no explanations and just wants you to explore and figure stuff out on your own. It reminds me of the good old days, playing the original Zelda and Metroid for the first time. Playing a game with a sense of mystery and no hand-holding is a rarity now, and I guess that's what I like about this one so much. It's probably not for everyone, though. At its core, this is a fairly casual game (though it does get surprisingly difficult at the very end) and it doesn't last too long. Also, I am well aware that some people probably won't appreciate the lack if direction/instruction as much as I do. That said, for the price, it's hard to not recommend if you're at all interested in trying out something new and are up for a bit of mystery and exploration.","August 17, 2013","true","8.4"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","0"

You'll probably even enjoy finding the first two or three paths to the moon.\n\nHowever, after perhaps half an hour of playing, the game becomes a tedious log through overly-large labyrinthian environments designed to pad out the game as long as possible. And if you think you're finally done once you get all six endings, you're dead wrong--once you do, a secret seventh ending is unlocked, requiring you to redo the platforming for all six of the previous endings again, except this time you're stuck in a thunderstorm. Once you've done that, you're still not done; a new part of the map is unlocked, requiring you to beat several more obnoxiously hard jumping puzzles...which cannot be completed due to a persistent bug with the game's cannon physics that has been reported by dozens of users and the developers have stubbornly refused to fix.\n\nThe game starts out decent, but then alternates between mindlessly dull and bugged into impossibility.","February 2, 2014","false","2.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","0"

The game had nice spare looking style and sound.\n\nThe goal in the game is to return to the moon in a few different ways. The first few puzzles were extremely simple (for one of them you just wait in a post office and the mailman delivers you to the moon), but then a majority of them ended up being exercises in tedium.\n\nLunnye Devitsy is lacking. It has open world that is not interesting and stops being mysterious fairly early on. Sometimes messing up means having to trek back and forth between the boring areas. The controls and character are also a bit finicky and take more maneuvering than I think should be required. There are also puzzles that are all about guess work rather than puzzle solving (a completely blind maze, and then cannons take brute trial and error). And the "organic" aspects just got on my nerves:  you can edit a text file to turn post processing on and off, you can enter full screen with "F" and you can't pause or change any other options.\n\nThis isn't a terrible game, it's just a game with terrible pacing and some poor choices. Its not even that this game is challenging on a puzzle or platforming level, because it's really not. It is quite simple, and, aside from the mentioned nuisances, the platforming is easy. The problem is that the game seems to deliberately want to inconvenience the player.  Instead of being open, this game would have done better to be contained with levels and/or check points.\n\nThe price may be tempting, but I think you should consider other games.","July 22, 2014","false","5.4"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

Perhaps too simple as it soon becomes a tedious task of collecting nicknacks and repetitive platforming back and forth through the same areas all while trying to explore completely unexplained goals and unclear interactions. They don't tell you that you are trying to get to the moon in multiple ways or that you can use up to interact with some things - had to look that up online. It seems rather obtuse in retrospect, but at least the soundtrack is nice. Oh? What's this? Free soundtrack in the game files? That's nice of them.\n\nThe last puzzles require skill, but one of those last puzzles depends on ambiguous mechanics which will require senseless repetition when it's completely unclear why it fails. What seems to be the exact same action produces the needed results only the rare time out of dozens of attempts and, if you screw up the platforming above in the wrong way, you are forced to do it all over again. At least in finishing that challenge alone, I feel some catharsis from the experience.","August 3, 2013","true","4.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

In attempting to create a feeling of the unknown developer Boss Baddie went too far and ended up with a game that has no direction, and by the end feels just as hollow and pointless as when it begins.\n\nYou play as a odd little alien, literally dropped into the world, who's sole goal is to make it back to where it came from. To do this you much explore the lifeless and convoluted structures around you, collecting various objects to use to send yourself home. However this is where the game runs into problems, as environments are designed in such a way as to require copious amounts of tedious backtracking, to say nothing of the plentiful dead-ends and empty caverns that serve no purpose but to confuse and disorient you, as you attempt to traverse them with no guide or means to mark your progress. It's tiresome to say the least, and the game as a whole suffers from what seems a poor means of elongating the still very short experience (I was able to finish it in just under an hour).\n\nI won't deny that the presentation is very artistic and creative, but again the developer got overzealous and failed to realize that less can often equal more. This is most evident in the excessive use of bloom and fog, as well as other needless effects that obscure and distort the image until it is simply painful to look at. Taken by itself I actually found the soundtrack rather lovely, but in this context it feels displaced and sets an oddly sinister tone which clashes with what is otherwise a more curious and relaxing adventure.\n\nEven considering the very low price as half of the Lunar Bundle, I couldn't say that Lunnye Devitsy is something I found to be worthwhile. Nothing fits right together and even after finishing it I would be hard pressed to pick any point that stuck out as memorable or enjoyable to play. Whatever potential I felt was here ended up falling on the wayside, replaced with a shallow journey that feels akin to a tech demo, and in a similar fashion amounts to little more than a mildly interesting experiment.","November 29, 2013","false","1.6"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","33","57","0","2"

Now if you're looking for a story that tells you every single piece of the puzzle, you're not going to find that in this title, but you will have to go looking for them. See, one day, a little Moon Maiden, our heroine of the story, falls off the moon! On a normal day this would seem like a serious misfortune, but our little friend never fears, because throughout the bizarre world below there just so happens to be several helpful ways of getting back home. With helping a geologist find his moon marbles, a scientist to build a rocket and blastoff, a relay station to get its message out, discovering that gravity has some very "loopy" consequences, finding a springboard with some astonishing power, or having the postman make a very long-distance delivery, getting home has never been such an adventure! Even more so, because once you've made it home all those ways, you'll discover a magma monster has lost all his pocket change and once you've collected it for him, he'll give you quite a lift.\n\nLunnye Devitsy puts wonder, entertainment, and, of course, that good old feeling of accomplishing something so much bigger than you in the genre of platformers. There's mystery, a few scares, and a good bunch of cursing involved for everyone. It's the journey home that makes Lunnye Devitsy such a fantastic title to add to your Steam Library. Run, Jump, Double Jump, and Dive into this platformer for an excellent adventure with outstanding music and sound effects. It's a great excuse to spend some time with a little friend from the stars and send her on her way back home.","January 11, 2014","true","13.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Yeah, this is one of those games (along with Wake) that you kinda are willing to spend money on just because you can. "Ah, I got like 5 bucks left... Can't really buy anything. I guess I'll just take this..."\n\nAt first I was intrigued and relaxed. But upon only finding half of the ways to get to the moon, the game because so boring, I had to quit in order to save some sanity. So, I got a better computer and played this on it as one of the first games to test its intensity of RAM (since it lagged like crazy on my laptop). So yes, I gave it a second go. Appearently, it was not my laptop...\n\nThe game was just so SLOW paced that you can't get anywhere in a decent time. The level design along with the slow paced gameplay makes finding all the endings take probably more than several days. That's just not how to design a game. I explored every area and got two powerups, then there was nothing to do, so I stopped. For good. I will never come back to this game because I'm one of those people who want to experience everything for themselves. If you tell me what powerup you get in a game, that will suddenly render the game unplayable for me, because I want everything to be exciting, new, and not spoiled.\n\nI don't like writing down rates for games that are pretty good, but really, this belongs on a flash website. It's one of those flash games that you really shouldn't spend money on. Not because it's short or anything, but just the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it. Again, it's soooo boooring. I understand it's supposed to be atmospheric, and it was. But after about halfway through the game, you just simply cannot find any ways back to the moon, no more upgrades, and literally nothing to do.\n\nCall me biased because I didn't technically complete the game, but a human being cannot go through so much loss of sanity by playing a game like this. Again, it's "okay" but the pace is way too slow, goal way too indirect, and progression even worse so.\n\n\n\nI don't know what else to say for this other than to save your money. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm one of those people that would rather spend on a game I end up disliking due to genre or whatever rather than a game I just end up not enjoying because of its experience. Buy it if you want, but I don't want anyone else losing any sanity or time either.\n\nMy suggestions to developer (even though I know the game won't get updated ever):\n- Smaller level design or less filler areas just to slow you down\n- More quick movement speed and not so much "moon" gravity\n- Add a decent title screen with some possible, oh I don't know, options, then tell the player what to do in some way fitting to the game's atmosphere (basically, not a tutorial, but still telling them what to do)","January 30","false","2.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The goal of the character in this game is to find different ways to return to the moon after jumping off of it to explore; a strange plot, indeed.\nIn attempting to fully complete the game, though, I encountered one platforming challenge near the end that seriously frustrated me for hours. The challenge involves firing the character out of a cannon that is basically random in hitting or missing your landing area, and a series of hard-to-time jumps afterwards, in which one can easily fall all the way down back to the cannon if one messes up. Plus, there are bouts of lightling that are not dissimilar to camera flashes going off in front of your face every 10 seconds, so one either slowly becomes blind over the course of playing, or one looks away and gets hit by one of the regular mini lag spikes, resulting in a plunge back to the bottom of the stage.

If it were for free, I'd give it a higher score. I say this because it lacks many things that make a it a full fledged game.\nLong story short you have to send this little moon guy (who falls from the moon) back to the moon. There are many ways to get to the moon. One way to get to the moon per the game is immediately next to the place you land after falling from the moon. What I mean is you can beat the game (one of the ways) within seconds after you begin to play.Also, the game is buggy. Mostly that it won't play on most computers. It plays very slow, even on really fast machines. Not sure why, considering it's a simple 2D game, although with much post effects. No way to turn off these effects without editing the .ini in the game. I had to turn off post effects and was unable to play full screen without getting lag. The lag is so bad, and at first you'll think that's how slow the game is because you'll wonder why it'd lag on such a simple short game.Things that cheapen the game are seemingly unfinished portions of the game. For instance there's a rocket ship connected to the flying island you land on. You jump at it, and it has no landing area, it's simply a flat 2D no design piece of real estate... you fall through it all the way past the map, and then you fly upwards. Why? This makes no sense... maybe if you landed in the spacecraft and it took off... not sure. Incredibly odd and not in an artistic way.Also, there are puzzles to solve to take you back to the moon, and the presentation of these puzzles aren't the most appealing, the eye is drawn to the puzzles.  There are also things to collect that make absolutely no sense, the presentation of things you collect need more work.","December 31, 2013","false","5.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

This is only a real problem at the beginning, though, before discovering moves like the double jump.  As progress in the game is saved, this is only a minor annoyance.

By that I mean I will play anything that gives me a wide open world to explore, and doesn't make it too onerous to explore. Platformers usually do exploration the metroidvania route, but there are a few quality indie games that just let you run freely around their world. Lunnye Devitsy is one of those.\n\nThe only story you're going to get is that you're a tiny alien who fell off his tiny planet and onto a great big mountain. You want to get home, and as it turns out there are six ways to do that, but you have to find them and piece together a few puzzles to make them work. Some are as simple as jumping on a springboard, some are as complex as building a rocket, and some defy any sort of logic whatsoever.\n\nYou can run and you can jump, and that's all you need to unlock Lunnye Devitsy's secrets. The running takes a little getting used to, since you have to build up momentum before you can really get going, but there's plenty of space to practice your sprinting. You also can't die here, which takes any possible edge off the game. Anything that looks lethal most assuredly is not, and falling off the screen just wraps you around to the other side.\n\nIt's not hard to sink a few hours into this one trying to divine its secrets, but without any sort of character progression, collectibles, or story, it's also not hard to get bored quickly. I certainly appreciate it for its stark, otherworldly atmosphere and simple exploration, but not enough to suss out all the endings. Still, I'd say it's worth a look, especially if you're a fan of games like Knytt.","February 15","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Throughout my play of this game, I ran into several design flaws, but I kept going, to see where the concept was taken, seeing its potential.\nWell, after 3 long, long hours, I simply quit.\nThe game claims it's about exploration, and aiding mysterious characters, but there's barely any of it. You arrive on the world and nothing is told to you. And that could be fine. But it simply keeps that way for the rest of the game. Nothing is told to the player, not even indirectly.\nI usually enjoy exploration games a lot, since they keep throwing little clues at the player, little pieces of the overall puzzle. But not here. I've forced myself to play it through, to see if anything changed, but barely anything did.\n\nThe puzzles are senseless. They could make a bit more sense, if there were references to them throughout the game, that one could get through exploration.\nSince there's nothing, this game is about trial a error. Constantly. And it's simply not fun.\nYou're not exploring anything. The map is just a labyrinthic mess, with fake walls that you can't tell from a normal wall. So, the only thing left to do, is roam around the world. Which has nothing special. It barely has any landmarks that could tell something interesting. There's nothing. The world feels as dead as it could. The characters are simply there for you to have a very vague idea of what to do to progress in the game, but they don't actually feel like characters. Only a chore board.\n\nThe controls aren't anything to write home about either. And, on top of it, it tries to be a hard platformer. And it falls flat on its face. With these imprecise controls, you actually have to land on the tips of triangles. Seriously? Who could've thought this was a good idea? Then, a dark block with hidden paths inside. There's no way to see where you're going. Again, HOW could someone think this was a good idea? It's just frustrating trial and error. And it adds absolutely nothing positive to the game.\n\nThe visuals did look unique, but you'd better turn off the post processing effects. Those are really, really bad. They simply blur your vision and end up hurting your eyes.\n\nThe redeeming factor is this may be the music (althought not sound design). The music was really enjoyable, although it didn't quite play into the atmosphere of the game. Simply good, random, background music.\n\nI'm sorry if I'm being overly negative, but I had certain expectations for this, the idea seemed right up my alley. But... no. It's simply a badly designed game.\nIn exploration games, you should learn something about the world. The world should have a story to tell. Something. But there's nothing here. I took no satisfaction from playing this after the first half hour or so.\nPlus, don't make it frustrating as it is. The controls aren't tight enough for it to try to be Super Meat Boy. The visual effects are way too exagerated. The map has no landmarks, it's simply labyrinthic, with "secrets" areas that make no sense.\n\nToo many ideas that were badly implemented. My advice would be to polish each aspect of the game a lot before trying to get it all together. Otherwise you get this. And it's not very good.\nDon't pick this one up.\n\nWith that said, I'll still keep an eye out for Boss Baddie, these games might actually get pretty good after a lot of work has been put into them.","January 5, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So I am please to say, this game isn't that bad.  It isn't that good, either.\n\nThe game is the definition of minimalism, for better or worse.  There are no tutorials, no menu screens, no help at all.  In a way, that harkens back to the old Atari days, I suppose.  If you guess correctly at the start, you will see signs that tell you what buttons to push.  Of course, these buttons do not work.\n\nThere may or may not be a goal to this game.  Damned if I can tell.  You wander around a complex of caves and water.  Seems nothing, not even lava can hurt you, but it is horribly easy to get lost or stuck.  While you explore, you find items such as moons, which so far, don't seem to do anything.  The game is very slow-paced, and aside from exploring, there isn't anything to do.  No matter how into games you may be, you will be bored by this game.\n\nLike Wake, the game is poorly optimized, and for all of its minimalism, feels very sluggish.  Not only does the game play at a snail's pace, it runs at a snail's pace as well.  It is not unplayable like Wake was for many people, but it is noticable.  I have also had it crash every time I have run the game, sometimes on exit, sometimes on the start.  It also caused an odd behavior while the game was running.  My shift key acted like D, as did X on my gamepad, and Y acted like the w key.  Somehow this game managed to make it almost impossible to type while it was running, even when alt-tabbed.  Perhaps this is why the buttons didn't seem to do anything?\n\nDespite being basically a bad game, there is some value to the Lunar Pack.  If you buy this game on a sale, the card drops will more than pay for it, so you might just turn a profit.  But is that kind of suffering worth it?","November 10, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let me tell you about this God-forsaken game, Lunnye Devitsy.\n\nYou play as a cute little alien that falls from the moon and you need to find your way back. There are several ways to get back, 7 in fact. That's the premise of the game. There are no enemies, nothing can kill you... it's pure puzzle platforming. The design is ALL atmosphere and what an atmosphere it is! Further, there is zero guidance, no on-screen instruction, not even a main menu of any kind. This minimalistic approach isn't for everyone, but I appreciate its purity.\nThe game comes includes with a map file. Use it! The game is virtually impossible without it! I advise against using online guides of walkthroughs, that way you can get a decent amount of time into the game... probably over 20 hours. Your time is spent finding all of the different ways back to the moon by looking for visual clues, as there are no words. It will test your attention to detail, patience and platforming abilities.\nAbout 98% of the game is the perfect little puzzle platformer, but there is one glaring design flaw that nearly drove me to the brink in my playthrough. Eventually, towards the end of the game, you need to collect coins around the entire map to unlock the final method of getting back to the moon. Of the few dozen coins to collect, there is ONE that is infuriatingly frustrating to collect. Getting this one coin took longer than unlocking any other method for lunar return. To get the coin, you need to launch yourself from a cannon onto a certain platform. This cannon needs to be aimed PERFECTLY. By perfectly I mean PER-FREAKIN'-FECTLY. There is maybe a 2 pixel window that makes up the sweet spot. Whether you're using a joypad or keyboard, the aim is WAY too sensitive. On top of that,  everytime you miss and get back in the cannon, it resets. Even when you do get it right, you then have to traverse what is probably one of the hardest platforming obstacle courses in the history of the genre. And if you mess up and fall? Back in the cannon! So you spend the majority of your time firing the cannon, missing, firing again, missing, firing again, missing... over and over and over and over. This is not fun, this is not challenging, this is bad design and frustrating more than anything else.\nHowever, I can't decry the entire game because of this one puzzle. In fact, if and when you do finally pull it off, it's quite the sense of accomplishment! That's something many AAA titles can't claim. At the end of the day, it's a visually appealing, unique and tough puzzler that makes you think and challenges you. You've been warned.","March 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The environment is overly large and featureless in a way that feels more like empty padding than lonely atmosphere, and an overabundance of fake walls force you to ram your face into every surface along the way.  Instead of relaxing and soaking up the ambience, you're more likely to be holding an arrow key with one hand and your forehead in the other while you wait to move from one end of each empty room to the other.","September 28, 2014","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The entire point of the game is to explore the map and find six different ways to make it back to the moon in one piece, only to unlock the seventh way, but since even then nothing new will happen, achievements are probably your best motivation to make it that far. Apart from that, you know absolutely nothing about the alien's life, the planet, the random creatures you will find on the planet or even the purpose of the entire game; aside from two or three easter eggs that will award you with an achievement each once you get to them, the entire map is a empty maze in which your only purpose is to get to the other end in order to collect a part for something that should take you to the moon. As much as the game focuses on exploration, as it leaves menus, instructions or quests behind, there really isn't much out there to explore and without looking it up online you will have a hard time figuring out what you're supposed to do with those random pieces you find scattered around the map. Even with seven different ways to make it back to the moon, the entire experience feels repetitive and mediocre, as almost all the routes will require you to collect a number of items from around the map, not knowing in what direction they might be, bringing them back to an NPC which will then present you with another way to make it back. This is one of those games that it's painful to watch or play as nothing interesting ever happens and even when the challenge is supposed to make it better, there will be issues that will stop it from being enjoyable.\nRating: 3\n\nGameplay\nLunnye Devitsy fails to follow the first rule of any platformer: being fun to play; instead of that you get a boring, frustrating and luck-based experience that you won't miss once you press the escape button. For the first bit, Lunnye Devitsy wants to give you freedom of exploration, giving you the choice to take on the six different endings at your own phase and theoretically figuring out each one of them on your own. However, the game has absolutely no instructions whatsoever and even though you will bump into an engine part or a moon piece frequently, it will take a while to piece them all together and figure out where you're supposed to go once you have collected them all, time in which you will simply move from one edge of the world to the opposite one trying to find that object that you're supposed to interact with, as there is no hint to the whereabouts of that object or NPC, or the action you're supposed to perform in order to interact with that object / NPC. Once you do eventually get back to the moon six times, a seventh ending will be unlocked which is supposed to be longer and more challenging, but ended up being nothing like that. In order to get back to the moon the seventh time you must collect all the coins scattered around the map, some of them in almost unreachable areas, so this is where your abilities were supposed to interfere, making use of the double jump techniques and the cannons, which were useless before, however the cannon shooting mechanic is completely broke, sending you way off track from where you're supposed to be and in different directions each time, no matter if the cannon is positioned at the same angle it was a try before, making reaching those hard areas a game of luck rather than skill; combine that with the double jump mechanic which randomly stops working at times after you come out of the cannon, even though you obviously need it to reach the ledge near you, and you've got yourself an almost impossible to finish game. Believe it or not, that was only the core of the problem, as there are many more issues such as your character randomly being transported on the other side of a wall or getting stuck for a few moments in the floor.\nRating: 2.5\n\nGraphics\nThe resolution is for some reason fixed, which works fine if you play the entire game in window mode using only a portion of your screen, but if you do decide to go fullscreen, then that becomes a problem since the resolution is nowhere near HD. The map is relatively small and even though it's somehow divided into different areas, they all look alike; the black is always dominant and there are little things to differentiate one area from another, and because of that until you get familiar with the layout, it will be easy to get lost. The visual effects will always be around in some way, whether it's rain, fog or a combination of both, but they only make it harder to see, something that can become extremely annoying later in the game when you you have to jump from one platform to another and the fog or rain effects will cause you to miss your target.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nThis game sounds just as mediocre as it looks, there are few sound effects and the ones that are there feel like they've been extracted from a 90's basic effects pack. While that song playing the background as you jump around isn't necessarily bad, you will eventually grow tired of hearing it, and after the four or five hours you'll spend with the game if you're into getting all the achievements for returning to the moon seven times you will be glad it's over. Even though the game has a lot of issues aside from audio related ones, it would've been nice to have a background story narrated while playing, at least offering some details on why the alien that you control keeps jumping from the surface of the moon, or at least make some jokes about it.\nRating: 3.5\n\nExtras\nCompleting the game takes around 3-4 hours depending on how long you take to find everything and if you're using a guide or not, something that you will probably do at some point since there are no indications to what your objective is or where you should start looking for something, but even so most of the players will probably give up on this game in less than an hour, leaving you with a question if you really do want to complete it or not; I did, and I already regret wasting 4 hours of my life with this.\nRating: 2\n\nVerdict\nLunnye Devitsy is a bad idea with a worse execution, and that's the kind way to say it; the story or the purpose of the game makes no sense, the bugs and technical issues will sometimes make the game impossible to play and on top of that most of the players won't even know what to do without a guide since there are no indications whatsoever. You can, however, grab the game for only a few bucks, so if you're still interested you can try it without spending too much and give it your verdict.\nRating Overall: 2.9\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Lunnye Devitsy at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=243","April 18, 2014","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The final level, the coin collection, randomly flashes a bright burst of light every 3-10 seconds randomly to simulate "lightning", filling the screen, blinding the player, and making it impossible to see what you're doing. The game was fine up until that point (if a little floaty) but it just feels like a crappy Limbo knock-off. Additionally it seems the final level, which is the only thing you can do once you've gotten the first six win conditions, covers up the decent soundtrack with a terrible "rain" sound effect, making it unpleasant to listen to. Unless you really like pixel-perfect platforming, don't buy this game. It's just obnoxious.","March 31, 2014","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, Lunnye is also a waste of time and combined they are the two worst titles I've ever encountered on Steam.\n\nLunnye feels aimless and lacking structure, but promises you can "build cannons and spaceships." Presumably you build things by gathering enough items that you walk over and never hear from again. You have no HUD or menu to see what you've collected, no idea what they will be for, and no mechanics to involve you in their use. You can walk. You can jump. That's all. The only direction you get for this game is on the Steam store page. While I enjoy the openness and mystery of other games, Lunnye lacks the proper feeling of mystery and possibilities and instead feels poorly designed and constricted.\n\nThis is not Proteus. This is not Limbo. It's a nice looking yet poorly designed and executed platformer. If you've had the misfortune of purchasing this game, farm the cards while you read a book and then move on.","April 1, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You cannot die so I felt pretty relaxed when playing it.\n\nAmbience is good, both the graphics and the music are really well done.\nPlatforming is solid, and the character handles really well. The difficulty is fair, normal at the start and pretty difficult at the end.\n\nAbout the bad, the game is not really that hard to learn, but the tutorial/introduction is really bare bones and lacking.\nThe most basic things they don't explain are:\n- "Your objective is to go back to the moon" Yes, this is dumb but the game never tells you, so, if you don't know the game, you have to go to the forums or figure out by pure chance.\n- "The interaction button is [up]" Also pretty dumb you don't get an explanation of the controls. I wasted a ton of time runnning around seeing if I had missed anything until I found out pressing up in certain places made "stuff happen".\n\nA better introduction would have made this game even better, that's all. I really recommend it anyway, and if you read this till the end, you already know what the tutorial doesn't teach you, so you are ready... :D:","August 10, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
