A couple days later, the developer issued a patch that fixed...well...everything! Now this is a fine shootemup with several good ideas, plenty of content, and solid controls.\n\nThis is one of those games where everything you need to know, is spelled out in the title. Your job is to destroy asteroids, but apparently there's a price on your head, and bounty hunters from all over the galaxy are looking to collect. Karma, your ship, is armed with four weapons, three of which operate on cool-down timers. The strategy is in using these weapons at the right moments to avoid getting crushed by asteroids or blasted by hunters. As you complete stages and acquire experience, you can level up your weapons and shields.\n\nEach stage plays out in the same manner. Your mission is to destroy x number of asteroids, and you're frequently attacked by bounty hunters. In my opinion, these stages are implemented in too rigid a fashion. When hunters appear, rocks stop flying at the player. By the end of the game, there are five types of hunters, but it gets pretty dull just fighting them.\n\nHowever, in this version of Asteroid Bounty Hunter, two new modifiers were added, and they dramatically increase the fun-factor of this game. When you turn on the Bounty Hunter setting, hunters continously spawn every few seconds. If you can't keep up with them, you're liable to get overwhelmed. The Bullet Hell setting causes asteroids to continually assault the player, no matter how many hunters are onscreen. While it's very nice that toggling these modifiers adds a significant boost to your experience, I like them simply because they make the game a lot more dynamic and entertaining.\n\nTo really explain just how much these additions improve the game, I'll provide a couple examples. Some hunters prefer to stay on the far right side of the screen, so that they can pelt you with bullets. Since asteroids are continually flying around, they're going to block most of your shots. This means that you'll have to work harder to find openings, or focus entirely on dodging until the enemy ship flies off. There are other enemies that fire giant lasers and spin around, you can move in a circle to avoid the lasers, but that isn't always possible with everything else flying around. You either have to unload your powerful weapons to destroy these foes quickly, or trust in your shields and take the damage. As new enemy-types are introduced, the game becomes even deeper. You really have to be considerate of your options, in order to survive these dangerous challenges.\n\nIt's important to also keep in mind that if these modifiers prove to be too much for you, then turn them off. Even with my level 180+ ship, I tend to get crushed when I play the latter stages on the harder difficulties. Sometimes you'll need to grind a little and bring your weapon levels up. Being able to destroy asteroids and aliens quickly is paramount to your survival. The difficulty can become a little unbalanced when hunters are constantly pouring into the chaos, but that's the trade-off if you want the exp. multiplier bonus.\n\nThe bosses provide a nice break from the other stages. Each of the five rivals has their own arsenal of weapons, and there are other factors to consider like black-holes and laser-walls. If you want an added challenge, you can choose to have bounty hunters attack, while you're fighting the boss. This is an especially risky decision, because there's so much that can go wrong. The bosses are large targets, and it's very easy for hunters to hide behind the boss, all the while firing away at you. Certain boss-attacks will also "funnel" you, leaving very little maneuverability. If hunters start firing at these few safe-spots available to you... Too bad! Again, these modifiers are optional, but who can turn down the added challenge and triple the experience?\n\nAlongside the substantially improved controls and mechanics, Asteroid Bounty Hunter also provides a great soundtrack, a rather charming storyline, and more than enough action to earn your money and time.\n\nThough it's now obsolete, in the interest of preservation, I've attached my review of an earlier version of this game[pepsimanvsjoe.blogspot.com].\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 3","true","7.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","5"

The Milky Way is the Galaxy we used to call home, Earth was destroyed in the year 2150, a huge asteroid stuck and destroyed the Earth laying to waste millions of years of human civilizations.  The left over remnants of Earth's population have taken up residency in Andromeda galaxy.  On a nearly Earth sized planet where life was sustainable.  Since an Asteroid was the root cause of Earth's destruction, the governing body of New Earth have been paying adventurers to pilot their ships into the vast ocean of space and destroy all the Astroids before they can endanger New Earth..\n\nYou take on the role of John, a down on his luck alcoholic who enjoys drinking, forgetting to feed his dog and owing people money... lots and lots of money..  Can you help save New Earth while at the same time killing off the bounty hunters looking to cash in on your death..  (as an Alcoholic who borrows money I can't afford to pay back I can assure you this game is top notch, and really helps put you in the shoes of John)\n\nGameplay - you're typical shmup fair, you control a ship, asteroids of various size fly toward your ship, occasional breaks in action see Bounty Hunter ships try to attack you using various forms of attack..  The game has 25 stages, each stage gets progressively harder.  After every fourth stage you fight a boss.  The five bosses have unique attack patterns and can prove to be quite difficult.  Memorization of their attacks is key to beating them.  Look for the pattern, exploit that pattern and bask in all the glory and riches that should follow our hero John.\n\nThe ship has four main weapons/attacks..  the basic attack, the laser, the spinning balls of death (Photon Swarm), and the Bird of flying missles.. otherwise known as the Final Blast  (no we're not talking about the money shot).  As you kill asteroids, you gain experience which can be used to boost up various skills your individual ship has.  Furthermore you can upgrade your global ship states which act independently of the ship skills.   You can unlock a total of 5 unique ships, each ship gets slightly improved stats over the one before it.  You should also learn how to dodge, probably the most important aspect of any shmup.\n\nPros'\nfun factor is through the roof.\nAwesome music (and you can add your own songs!!!!  Fight for your right to Party, blaring in your ears while you blow up asteroids... yes please)\nEasy achievements that for the most part don't feel like a grind (for those times when you want to tell someone your opinion is more right by showing off your e-peen)\nSome amazing looking hand drawn art work for the cut scenes (I think they are hand drawn.. either way the art style is unique in a good way.\nThe asteroids are varied enough that you won't find yourself looking at the same ones over and over again.\n\nCon's\nThe game crashed a few times after exiting a stage.  In 2 hours of playing I had about 3 or 4 crashes.  Nothing a Ctl, Atl, DEL couldn't fix, but for a game this simplistic I'd expect little to no crashes\nThe background could have given the appearance of movement, as it stands now it looks like it's a static background, although some of the plants move around.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?  I'd say yes, if you're a fan of shoot em up's spaceship flying or having a game which is nice laid back experience, this very well could be that game.  Keep in mind this game isn't all bells and whistles, it's not your traditional bullet hell game, but the option exist to make the game resemble other classic shmup's, on the easier settings you may very well find yourself wanting more action.","March 3","true","5.2"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

You will fight bad guys and destroy asterodis. The end.\nOkay, the story is slightly more complicated, but unlike ShipLord it is more fun and interesting, and I kind dug the cutscenes. But it still isn't that great.\n\nGRAPHICSThe engine is the same one of ShipLord: pretty background, good-looking asteroids and a good variety of bounty hunters that you fight. The enemy projectiles are also clearer, and they hardly blend into the environment.\n\nGAMEPLAYThis time you can actually shoot! You have a basic laser attack and other special attacks with cooldowns: fire balls that damage the asteroids, a straight-line of power that constantly delivers constant damage, and a phoenix that shoots missiles in all directions for a couple of seconds which deal a lot of damage.\nYour main goal is to destroy a certain amount of asteroids. The longer you play, the stronger they get, giving you a tough time to blow them up. And between waves of asteroids, some bounty hunters appear, trying to kill you, so you need to kill them or avoid their projectiles. At the end of each round, you get XP points to use to lower the cooldown lenght, improve the power of your abilities and so on. It is very entertaining and way more fun than ShipLord, delivering a more complete experience.\n\nCHALLENGEYou have a health bar that recharges over time, but the game is still pretty tough on the higher difficulties. However, replaying a level multiple times will give some XP points to spend in order to improve your abilities and manage to sustain more damage.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are really solid, and the soundtrack is pretty good. A welcome addition is the possibility to skip the track you are listening and to add your own music to the game's library.\n\nREPLAYABILITYYou have 25 levels, three difficulty modes and different modifiers that will greatly improve the lenght of the game.\n\nOverall, this is a very damn good game about blowing up asteroids and bounty hunters. If you enjoy arcade-y games like this, you must play it right now. Otherwise, pick it up on sale.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8\nFRUSTRATION: 6.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 8","true","13.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/444220/","tablis","Tablis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/","741 products in account","Imagine a little kid comes up to you (not yours, but maybe your friend's or neighbour's), holds up a picture that they have just drawn in your face, and asks "is it pwetty?!" all the while beaming with pride. And you have an urge to respond with the truth - "NO IT SUCKS" - but that would be wrong, maybe even socially inappropriate. This metaphor accurately describes the dynamic in play between me and this game.\n\nFrom a distance it looks like a typical indie horizontal scroller, maybe even a bit above-average if you're as gullible as me when it comes to Store descriptions. The 3D spinning asteroids look pretty cool in the video preview, the ships made from simple geometric shapes don't look that bad and the abilities are shiny. The first real hints of trouble appear when you boot up the game for the first time; cheap-sounding vocal trance hits you in the main menu, the lettering on buttons is pixelated and when you click Exit, the confirmation prompt reads "Do you really wanna quit the game?"\n\nThe game... the game itself is what it says on the tin, surprisingly. You fly a ship, you shoot asteroids, enemies ("bounty hunters") and bosses, you upgrade your stuff. It's solid, if mediocre. It never crashed for me (or maybe once)! The crux of the issue here, is that this core gameplay is packaged in layers upon layers of unprofessional... everything. Here are a few examples; viewed together, as a common denominator of sorts, they portray the overall quality of this game:\n\nthe "yellow wasp" enemy can randomly instakill you when plotting its flight plan. I guess that's a bug, but who knows? In any case it adds extra difficulty to the last few levels.\nthe way collisions work is that the thing with more CurrentHP survives, after deducting the CurrentHP of the other thing. So you can faceram the biggest asteroids (or bosses...) as long as you soften them up beforehand.\nsome tooltips are messed up (bits and pieces of text from other places).\nillegible text in lower resolutions.\ntypos and inappropriately informal English everywhere.\nin the final cutscenes of the game, two characters in turn refer to each other as "little brother" because apparently nobody quite understood what was being written.\non the subject of cutscenes: they look like they were commissioned from a DeviantArt reject and the writing is on a similar level\nthe Shipyard screen is so counterintuitive, it took me around 8 hours to decisively figure out how to read the amount of MP needed for the next ship to unlock\nthe "ultimate" ability is the most useless in the long run\nthe Credits are a daunting, slow-moving wall of CC:BY attributions for all the free, Soundcloud music used as the soundtrack. Supposedly the identities of the authors are beneath that but I gave up after around 10 minutes.\nOkay, I needed that. So why, pray tell, is there a thumbs up here? Because I can see how much love and effort went into this. Not the best effort, admittedly, if we ended up with this, but still. There are some horrible design decisions here, yet the conviction with which they're implemented gave me pause. The creator had a very particular vision and chose to stick by it, even if they had to poop all over modern game design tenets in the process (defined as "what sells and what doesn't on iTunes"). This resulted in a bizarre, mostly negative product that I find a bit inspiring at the same time. And over the past week three updates were pushed that improved the game significantly, fixed some things and added some other things, so they're still trying. And I tend to believe that trying is more valuable than winning.","May 9","true","11.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Asteroid Bounty Hunter is a two-dimensional side-scrolling shoot-em-up (shmup) rendered in 3D, with great music, pretty graphics, ship upgrades, a cliché story played out in weirdly drawn and partly animated comic-style cutscenes, and lots and lots of asteroids.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics are a bit mixed. The 3D asteroids come in an assortment of textures, colours, shapes, and sizes, and are rendered well, although some of them seem a bit too realistic for the rest of the game. The backgrounds are for the most part very pretty and different enough so as to not get boring. The player ships are a bit unimpressive and samey -- the typical enemy ships even more so -- but the weapons are mostly nice and bright and colourful, giving you a pretty satisfying feeling of power and destruction. Boss enemies are unique. I've only seen two of them so far and they're also a bit uninspiring, although their weapon effects are mostly pretty good.\n\nI haven't experienced any slowdown on my aging gaming laptop (I7, Nvidia 485m graphics) playing at 1920x1080 and with all of the (fairly limited) bell-and-whistle selections enabled, even when there are enough missiles, lazers, swirly flamey things, and exploding asteroids to all but cover the screen. Overall the game looks pretty good, and moves smoothly.\n\nSound - Music is terrific: absolutely excellent. I haven't looked into where it came from, but the game comes with a selection of electronic music tracks in a number of genres, and I've liked every one that I've heard. If it's not to your taste, though, don't worry: just add some .ogg files to the relevant folder and you can listen to your own music instead. Sound effects are okay -- what you'd expect for the game -- and voiceovers are very variable, but a welcome inclusion regardless.\n\nGameplay - The plot is introduced through a very slow cutscene. The style is interesting, like a black-and-white sketched comic with some portions coloured and some small parts animated, but the subtitles are terribly written and full of extremely bad grammar and spelling errors. I also don't know if it's bugged, but there was no sound for me, and screen fades that took many seconds to move between scenes. Anyway, you play the titled bounty hunter, destroying asteroids for money to protect endangered planets. You're also a terrible booze-hound and quickly manage to get other bounty hunters coming after you. The plot is quite thin and you've mostly seen it all before, but it's fun nonetheless, and later cutscenes are much better, with voiceovers that range from really quite good (Karma) to rather awful (Nix). Oh, and the terrible grammar doesn't get any better!\n\nThe game itself is divided into 25 stages, each of which can be played at one of three difficulty levels, although there seems to be no way to track which ones you've completed at which difficulty levels (and there's also only one achievement based on difficulty, so there's not that much reason to replay them).\n\nThe first four stages of each group of five are all the same: progressively more difficult waves of randomised asteroids that you need to try to destroy, interspersed with short waves of enemy ships that move to set patterns. On each stage you need to destroy an increasing number of asteroids without losing all of your ship's health and exploding. Destroying some asteroids breaks them into smaller ones, and often causes massive speed-up and ricocheting of these smaller asteroids, presumably through some simulated conservation of momentum. From stage four and beyond you have four weapons available to you at any time, each with a varying cooldown timer. Each level thus requires some strategic thinking to work out when best to fire each weapon.\n\nThe fifth stage in each group of five is a boss fight, which I believe is against a different bounty hunter out for your blood each time. I've only completed the first ten levels so far (after playing for more than two hours), so there's a fair bit of time required to get through the whole game. I'd guess that you'd gain most of the included achievements, if not all, through a single play through.\n\nCompleting a stage awards points to upgrade your ship's weapons and shields, as well as different points to upgrade your ship itself. There are five ships to choose from, but they're really all much the same, with each new ship simply having bonuses to various attributes. Still, together with the sort-of interesting cutscenes and the achievements, this gives you something to keep playing for if the goal of shmup frenzy fun itself isn't enough for you.\n\nI've only played with keyboard, although it's a bit annoying having to navigate menus with the mouse. The game apparently 'partially supports' controllers, too. A controller would probably be a better option.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Addictive and fun\n+ Excellent included music with an option to play your own instead (including simple 'radio' controls to change the track that's currently playing in game)\n+ Pretty graphics\n+ Weird cutscene style that grows on you\n+ A good number of achievements and ship upgrades to keep you playing\n+ Runs well with a lot of action on screen like a good shmup should\n+ The four weapons with different cooldowns works quite well as a strategic consideration, making it more than just bullet hell\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- Cliché story with very poor writing. It could have at least been run through a spell checker!\n- Upgrades and new ships are just stronger versions of the starting ones; at level four you've seen everything your ship will be able to do -- it'll just get better at those things as you upgrade it\n- No visual representation of weapon powerups\n- A bit repetitive, but not too bad for a shmup\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Asteroid Bounty Hunter is addictive and quite fun. It has its bad points, but in my opinion the good points far outweigh them. There's currently an announcement on the Steam game page regarding co-op play and further graphics improvements coming soon, which will make it even better! If you're into side scrolling shmups then I'd recommend you give it a try.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 28","true","3.1"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","19","30","2","0"

This is a similar type of game except it's asterioids and its a horizontal screen rather then the old vertical screens in Galaga or Galaxian.  The boss fights are pretty fun, but it's really a game about dodging and fast reflexes.\n\nI played with my keyboard, and I like that this game allows you to customize your keys to whatever you desire.  I've clearly given the developer my suggestions on how to improve this game, and it's really simply stuff that could go a long ways to improving the overall feel of this game for the player I think.  - Things like adding some cool explosion and rock busting sound effects and some tweaking of the player ship movement.\n\nOverall, I gave this game a recommend but with a note in all-caps that's I recommend it only for arcade action loving gamers who miss the old-school games like Galaga or Galaxian.\n\nMy score in the video above was a 67%.  It's okay, but these days, there's much better arcade action space shooters available for less money.  Hopefully the developer will add some needed sound effects to this game, tweak it a little, and perhaps reduce the price to under $5 USD for its regular price to being up it's value for the typical Steam user today.","February 28","true","0.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The whole game feels like the designers didn't care one bit what they were doing or how it'd feel to its players, and it shows because they didn't even bother to proofread anything. Even though it was $2.19 on sale, because they can't be bothered to read their own menus and subtitles I can't be bothered to give them two dollars.

An average story, there is not really anything to say about that. It had some "humour", but it just felt forced and tastless.\n\n//GAMEPLAY:   7/10\nTo finish the level you have to destroy a certain number of asteroids, sometimes some bad guys pop up. There are 25 levels, every fifth level is a boss battle. You shoot lasers with Q and use special powers with W, E and R, you upgrade those powers and you ships shield in the "upgrades" and "store" sections in the main menu. The gameplay itself is challenging, it's not so hard that will make you lose your ♥♥♥♥ and rage, but it will give you that feeling of achievement when you beat the level, you will feel good about it. And it's smooth, no bugs, glitches and such.\n\n//GRAPHICS:   6/10\nGraphics in this game are simple, but nice, backgrounds fit in nicely, ships look kinda cool and the effects are nice too. Cutscenes look really cool, they look like some old cowboy comic book, so that gives a special "cowboy" feel to this game. Only thing that bothered me was the main menu and the HUD, they are not bad, but they look weird and somewhat oldfashioned, not really a bad thing, but it bothered me.\n\n//AUDIO:   4/10\nNow, this is the weakest thing in this game, the sound effects from the lasers and collisions with the asteroids and enemy projectiles are good. Voice acting is really good, they've done a great job. But the thing that bothers me is the music, it's totally out of place, main menu music is some cheap techno music with bad female vocals, it totally ruins the mood of the game and the music in levels is not good, a weird hype dubstep and techno music really feel out of place in this retro space game, I turned the music off and I realised that there really isn't much effects, that the sound is empty then. I was dissapointed.\n\n//ENJOYMENT:   6/10\nI don't like this kind of games, but this one was actually fun to play with the audio off and my custom playlist to fit the mood. Boss battles had me at the edge of my seat, they were really intense and interesting. But the game is a bit short, that is a bit dissapointing.\n\n\n//OVERALL:   5.6/10\nThis game is a really interesting and cool game, it had some flaws, but it was still enjoyable. Buy it when it's on sale, it's worth the money.","March 1","true","2.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Having already reviewed their other game Ship Lord, I'll start out by saying, they have a lot of similarities.\n\nYou are in a small spaceship with space rocks flying at you and bounty hunters trying to kill you. Unlike Ship Lord, however, you actually get to shoot back this time. Your ship, Karma has four weapons capable of blasting those pesky chunks of dirt into pieces, which is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay aspect. Along the way you will encounter bounty hunters who want to kill your alcoholic pilot and bosses who have odd mechanics to make themselves more annoying.\n\nYou can upgrade your ship components and your ship itself through the completion of levels, the annihilation of bounty hunters (culminating in the collection of Mastery Points) and by leveling up through killing every asteroid you come across. There are three difficulty ranks per level, easy, medium, and hard, each of which modifies the maximum HP and Experience granted by asteroid kills, and two multipliers, Bullet Hell, and Bounty Hunters.\n\nBullet Hell modifies the level so that there is no longer a break between the asteroid waves and the bounty hunter waves, effectively upping the difficulty. Bounty Hunters modifies the game so that bounty hunters will spawn endlessly, asteroids or not, this can snowball quickly.\n\nAll in all it is a great addition to the space shooter genre. The controls are smooth and easy even on keyboard and I had a lot of fun playing through the game.

I'm not sure if Whoracle is the dev or not. He says in his own (glowing) review that he got the game from a friend, yet it was Whoracle who sent me 2 keys for the game via steam PM. [edit: apparently whoracle is a friend of the dev who the dev got to help out by giving them keys to distribute and does not work for the dev. I'm just stating that as what the dev told me in PM, with no editorial]\n\nThis is a very simple and somewhat amateur game. Basically it boils down to thirty something stages. Each stage is a horizontally scrolling shmup that features asteroids followed by spaceships bullet hell followed by asteroids... repeat. Every few stages there is a boss fight with more extreme bullet hell mechanics and some story in the form of amateur art with amateur voice acting. The music is of a better quality than the other assets in the game, probably because it's all by other people (it's all cc by attribution).\n\nThe weapons are upgradable and there's some limited tactics to when you decide to use them rather than just spamming them and there's ship ugrades which amount to stats of shield or damage, and then there's different ships that I didn't get to see because I didn't get that far.\n\nIt's not utterly terrible and it can be challenging but it's so repetitive! I only played as long as I did because I was reviewing it: I would have given up a lot sooner if I got this game in a bundle say. In fact I doubt I would have installed it based on the screenshots.\n\nHere are the reasons my review is negative:\n\n1. Price: The game is £5.59. This is too expensive. It should be £1.99 in my opinion, considering the repetition and simplicity.\n2. The store page seems to go out of its way to make the game seem more interesting than it is:\n"defend the nearby planets from vicious asteroids attacks " = shoot asteroids while planets appear in the background\n"Your job is to save planets from incoming asteroids, while taking care of your affairs with other bounty hunters. " = shoot asteroids while planets appear in the background for most levels, while every few levels the level is a boss fight.\n\n3. There's also little annoyances like the default option when you press return at the end of a successful level is to repeat the level, rather than continue.\n\n4. The extremely high number of positive reviews and the fact that the most glowing review is by the guy who gave me the keys for the game makes me extremely suspicious. [edit: I am not claiming, nor do I wish to imply that they bought reviews in any way, merely that I believe they contacted people and gave them free keys with a suggestion that they might review the game]","March 3","false","1.3"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","10"

This game starts similiar to alot of the classic/retro type arcade shooters out there. But, to me where it stands out the most, is the level up aspect, which is typical in alot of games these days in general. Why it works so well in this is simple to me, you take a classic game and really ramp up the action and effects, to the point where your screen is immersed in total chaos and action. This is when it gets fun for me, chaos in gaming is what I am all about. The destruction and mayhem is indeed signifigant in gaming. The thing I was most surprised on was the Soundtrack, it turned out to be much better than I imagined, Even before, I actually even played the Game. The only thing I think, in terms of what could be improved on a game, that just came out and IMO at it's current state is, I would only shorten a good storyline, but, it seems to long for a game of this type, again the storyline{Good), art style (Very Good) and voice acting (Good). Nothing I have seen in this game is close to bad. I am enjoying Asteroid Bounty Hunter very much and will be much more in the future. I would suggest people to try this game with a ton of fun (every level up gets more exciting and chaotic). The Dev and or /Devs have themself quite a nice game, that could be around longer than some may think at first glance. This game has major replay vlalue, which to me is the key to a purchase at any price, this game is a game good enough to pay full price and not to wait for a sale, but, if you do decide to wait, missing some good ole" classic fun, with rewarding leveling, that brings the game, to a new high with each level up.\nI am now myself an, "Asteroid Bounty Hunter"!","February 25","true","11.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Attacking objects and enemies while dodging bullets and debris is the core gameplay of ABH, and it’s a lot of fun. The controls are responsive (I played with an Xbox One controller on PC), and the level of challenge you take on is completely up to you.\n\nAsteroid Bounty Hunter is exactly the kind of game I would’ve pumped tons of quarters into at the arcade back in the day.

The abscence of a level cap means it's progress is really only halted by a combination of skill and patience. Too hard ? Repeat some levels and get stronger.\n\nGraphics wise it looks really great (the actual ships could go with an overhaul perhaps) and the music inhearantly in the game is solid as well.\nThe fact that you there is an actual way of skipping tracks sounds minor but I actually do find very useful. Most games will have some tracks you like and some you don't, being able to skip past those just is a nice little extra. And if you don't like the music? Hey, you can change it and shoot asteroids to your favourite tune.\n\nPrice to quality is something that in theory shouldn't be factor in to all of this but considering the game costs less then €5, seeing what we got for that price range, it be a mistake not to.\n\nA negative point though : Lack of variety, and that's not just in the asteroid levels as they are called here. I'm talking about the ship weaponry here. Mainly because the extra ships you unlock just get better stats, meaning no change in strategy, just a straight upgrade meaning going back to previous ships is also not recommended.\n\nAll in all though, I feel like I can recommend this game if you're looking for a good looking casual shoot em up in the lower price range.\n\nWatch my video review here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLwUT0vq62w","March 3","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I do recommend this.\nThere is no in-game achievement list. There are  achievements but you have to shift-tab to check them out.\n\nAbout the game.\nThere is interesting and good artwork during the cutscene.\nGame could be Repetitive.\nStory could be a bit boring to follow at the start.\nYou are able to skip the story.\nText font is a bit too small in-game and upgrade menu? There is no option to increasse the size too.\n\nControls feels a bit unnatural and it seems that they slowly move to a random location on their own. Which could be an affect of the game. (or it is just me).  You will feel this the most with a xbox controller.\n\nYou are able to change music and even add your own music into it. (which is not shown at the controls). But you are able to change the music with 1,2,3, numbers. Number 3 choose a random song.\n\nThe dialogue are fully voiced over.\nThere is a difficulty settings.\nThere are enemy ships that attack you in a pattern.\nYou are able to upgrade your ships.\nAsteroids do get stronger overtime, More damage if they hit you and more hitpoints.\n\nYou are able to unlock more ships the more "master points" you get.\n\nOther things.\nWhenever you complete a mission on "medium, or easy" it stays it is completed for hard aswell. Which should be changed whenever you clicked on that difficulty. You still do not have it completed it on the hard difficulty but the white bar is totally filled up and this may causes for confusing.\n\nWhenever an asteroid is damaging you,  they will get destroyed and will not collapse. However you will get 1 asteroid kill in return. But do becareful if you are doing this too often and to big ones.\n\nYou are able to destroy an enemy bounty hunter ship instantly whenever you are hitting him. You will take a huge ammount of damage in return. But the trade could be worthwhile to save alot of time. The damage that you get depends on their. current HP.\n\nWhenever you are completing it on a higher difficulty level. The ones that are lower will not be marked as completed whenever you did a higher one. So an example. You play on hard and you beat a level on hard. Achievements on medium or easy are still locked which means you have to play the level again on the lower difficulty settings. Which could be annoying at higher levels.\n\nVideo Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyxEaKK5NBk\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","March 3","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

What ABH does especially well is create some tense battle moments that make you almost fall off your chair as you make it in the slip of the moment (or not). I can definitly recommend it for that, if you can put the awful story aside.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have not seen many space shooters that actually give a damn aside from smashing the gunbuttons, so the effort is appreciated and should serve as an example for other space shooters. It cannot be helped, however, that the story is non-existant, with mediocre quality voice-acting and merely serves as small intermezzo's to keep a certain line of interest among the levels (which succeeded in that very small aspect). In short:\n\n+ Excellent combat\n+ Excellent powers, they all have their devastating effect and none of them are too OP or worthless\n+ Moderatly good upgrade system, allowing you to choose early-on what's most important for your ship\n+ Very original bossfights\n+ Multiple ships to choose from\n+ Decent graphics and great-looking effects\n+ Repetitive, although replayable levels that after finishing them offers replayabilty on a number of different difficulties\n+ You can play your OWN music through the game (highly recommended look below)\n\n- Terrible voice acting\n- Story could have more substance rather than: "Oh I see this next boss, let's kill him" 5 times over.\n- The music is mindblowing in almost the literal sense... Completely out of place in a spacegenre BUT it's driving nontheless. Still, more a negative than a positive. Default songs suck ♥♥♥ and you're better off playing your own through the game, which is possible (see above)\n\nThe price is solid for the amount of gameplay and the quality of the difficulty progression. You won't regret it even at full price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGGjiv4dUU","March 5","true","7.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

However, I’d like to write today just for a moment about how the site, the relationships that have been formed through it and the positive influence that the site is having for developers, publishers and players make me feel. I feel absolutely blessed. I feel even more blessed and appreciative when I get to play games such as Asteroid Bounty Hunter and feature these types of games for young up and coming developers. Steamified has featured games from developers who have worked on a ton of games and that’s always fantastic but to provide exposure for really good games from devs who maybe have one or a few games on Steam feels really good.\n\nThis is Just1337 Studio’s second game on Steam following the Steam userbase praised ShipLord which was released in December. Asteroid Bounty Hunter is similar in genre to ShipLord and that’s a good thing. Both games are extremely addictive games set in space where the objective is essentially to survive waves and then conquer boss battles using the mechanics that you’ve learned throughout a series of levels to get you to the battle. For a small indie developer I find that the production value here is extremely good.\n\nThe devs or their marketing team went a little overboard with the Steam description for the game – which I decided to post in all of its glory below. But it explains their game perfectly and really that’s all that we can ask for when it comes to Steam games. It just shows the amount of work that went into the game.\n\nWhat a fantastic little soundtrack. It inspired the headline for this feature – Take Me Home Tonight is one of the songs on the soundtrack. The entire soundtrack is spot on. It’s perfect for the game and is genuinely among my favorite soundtracks for any game that I have featured this year. My only real wish with the game is that they make available a special edition with the soundtrack and add it separately for those of us who already have the game. I’d definitely spend a couple of dollars on the soundtrack. Hopefully they retain the artists for their future games or find music that is equally as good because it really was an appreciative touch.\n\nThis is a game that I would recommend to everyone. You may not like the genre but there’s a combination of action packed sequences with a relaxing tone of the game that will have you mesmerized for at the very least several hours. The game is at a 40% discount through to the 3rd of March and at $4.79 should be considered a very good price for what you’re going to get. The game is addictive as hell and a real pleasure to play.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFeel free to join our Steam group and Curation http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","March 1","true","20.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I enjoyed playing it, though some things about the game were a little off. Using the attack bound to W teleports you to the middle of the screen, and if you use it on the right click it depelets all the charges in one shot. Oftentimes your ultimate attack is completely useless as well, and the last two bosses are a gigantic difficulty spike\n\nThe cutscenes are alright and the dialogue is a little cheesy, but pretty fun. The gameplay is pretty solid and overall, i had a good time except for the very last boss.

There are quite a few places you can plug your XP points or Mastery points into to upgrade your ship - and you play as a cocky male bounty hunter who just cares about money. The only real downside to this game is the loading screens. Between each level there is a loading screen that does need loading.

I have only tested it (1st 4 levels) on easy mode for his sake to see if I should keep or refund it and it's a keeper.

Because new bullethells are eather too far off or identical to old ones.\n\n*GAMEPLAY (7/10)\n\nYou drive, shoot, upgrade and repeat. This is that same simple concept that got us hooked back in days and still works amazing. Take that and add upgrades, different ships and story and you have amazing game. Also boss fight are awesome.\n\n*GRAPHICS (6/10)\n\nThey are simple. That's just it. I only liked looks of story parts. I'm not saying they're awful just now amazing either. They're plane graphics for that genre.\n\n*SOUND (10/10)\n\nSound effects are ok but what I really want to talk about is playlist. I never heard any of those songs before but liked most of them. I'm sure there is few songs for everyone. I have spent 10 minutes in menu just listening. Don't like effects? Turn them off and just listen to sweet tunes. Good voice acting.\n\n*STORY (8/10)\n\nThere is honestly not much to it for parts I played through. It's they way game tells it what got my attention. You're not a superhero, you're a drunk, lazy asteroid hunter, which is a cool change to what     you usualy get. Also "cinematics" have really good art style and I personaly think they don't need animation, they're awesome as they are.\n\n*PHYSICS (6/10)\n\nReally not much to say on this part. 4 different attacks, asteriods burst and make new ones and that's about it... Simple but effective.\n\n*CONTENT/PRICE (8/10)\n\nFew ships, some enemies, different types of asteroids, powers and upgrades. There are 20 normal stages and 5 boss battles. There are also few modes you can activate. Difficulty system is set perfectly. You can have at least few hours of fun with it :D\n\n***OVERALL SCORE 7.5/10\n\n*RECOMMEND\n\nEveryone who likes bullethell, 2d space shooters and oldschool games. If you have some time on your hands or are looking for something new this is for you. If you see it on sale be sure to pick it up.\n\nKey given by developer for review.","March 5","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It doesn't really matter. None of this matters.

I'm a miner in EVE and thought it would be funny to just shoot at asteroids, maybe asteroids who were shooting back or something. while the humour is mostly OK (I'm sorry, but dogs dying isn't funny), the English is so poor that I didn't understand a lot of it. the soundtrack is nice, and you can change the music playing if you want to (I find that it breaks my concentration), and apparently you can add your own sound files but I couldn't get it to work.","May 16","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Previously, I thought it was an artifact of my four-year-old compy, but, no, it was a feature.  I think performance has improved since last time I played;  refighting a boss showed much less slowdown than the first time.\nDocumentation is cleaned up (though the typeface might benefit from lower-case letters) and I haven't seen more loading screen errors.\n\nThe addition of two game modes helps to alleviate the level monotony somewhat, and paradoxically makes them more passable.  Normal mode has about a dozen rocks hurtling towards you, after which one or more enemy ships crawl in and shoot, asteroid-free.  This runs up the level timer, which has the effect of multiplying asteroid hp and xp... but you hit a wall where you can't output enough damage to any single asteroid before it runs past you... and there's more ships to shoot again.  Bounty hunter mode keeps the asteroids coming when ships show, or perhaps makes the ships show when the asteroids are coming.  This way, you can keep accomplishing something while the ships crawl in invincibly.\n\nOverall, it's better than when I first played, but still don't think it's a must-buy.  Fans of the genre might enjoy it, the graphics guys know what they're doing (calling it merely "pretty" isn't fair, I suppose), but I can't get more enthusiastic about it.","February 24","false","1.4"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"
