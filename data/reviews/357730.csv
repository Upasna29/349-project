There is a fair amount of camera motion so it's not for folks with weak stomachs (Blaze Rush is a better VR alternative for those players).\n\nPerformance was good on a gaming laptop with Nvidia GTX 765M with a DK2 in extended mode so it should be fine on any decent VR rig. The UI is done nicely in a VR mode.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the game develops. My only suggestion for improvement is that the scale of the player hands and steering wheel feel a bit large.","April 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

It feels like a VR Mario kart. The only thing I think I'd change would be to add difficulty levels for the Ai karts as I found it a little too easy.","January 12","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is more like technical demo than game and there is free VR Karts demo available too. Here are very minimal improvements compared to that free demo, therefore as of today I cannot recommend paying for that (unless if you want to just support developers). Looking forward for much more content, it has potential to be the best "real game" for Oculus. Idea itself is working very well. I'm going to change my "not recommended" to "recommended" when there will be more content- different maps, different music, possibility to save, some progressive game mode, multiplayer... right now its all missing.\n\nUpdate: changing my recommendation to thumb up as I see lots of improvements here.","May 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Good driving feel.  However, the tracks all feel WAY too similar....all castle themed with only two very similar sounding songs.  Racing the same track over and over in the free demo feels no different than the retail version.","October 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

There needs to be more maps and more map types. More than that though, the maps need to be more unique and crazy, I would wait until a little more content is released.","August 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I couldn't find a keyboard config menu item either.\nThe speed is also too slow, although I had it set to speed fast, and th turning is not great on the pc, it woudl be nice to have it be  perhaps more graduated or something or maybe if you hold shift to have 2 different angles of slight corner or sharp corner - it's possible to pulse the key so a sharper turn ange wouldn't hurt, but it's current turn radius is too shallow.\n3rd issue is I purchaed the full game but only had 2 tracks, I suspect something got messed up with the demo on his upload, hopefully he will correct this, and that I'm not mistaken, maybe it's a green light thing to\nFinally the kills are too long, they need to be about 1/2 the time, have more fun ones, and more stuff to catch up (like mario cart's bullet when you've pretty much lost all hope of making a comeback - remember it's a game which is to be fun, it's no fun if you know 1/2 thorugh you are going to lose)\n\nHaving said that, it is a game that shows huge promise and it' is probably a much better game if you have a controller.  I am playing it on the occulus 0.7 driver and it works really awesome!   I had no crashes in the 45 mins I played which  is really a testimate to a pretty well put together game all in all for a single indie dev!","October 9, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
