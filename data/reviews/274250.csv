I say runner, because even though you're riding a skateboard, you can't stop. You're always moving to the right. Its an original take on the genre and a fresh skateboarder. I'm not sure this game is for everyone because of the genre and control scheme.\n\nThe goal is simple, make it to the end of each level without falling off your board. You'll grind, jump and ride your board to the end. Just you. Getting to the end unlocks the next level. Each career level has five optional goals. Things like get X score or X combo. Jump gaps, collect spray cans, do a kick flip, only use one push or grind everything that needs girding. When you accomplish all five goals in an amateur level, it unlocks a pro level. Not only do the goals keep you in the relatively short levels, but you're rewarded for playing completing them. Outside of the career half of the game there is a "spot" half, with 25 more armature levels. These spots require you to do one long trick combination to the end of the level. There are 25 pro spot levels to compliment the amateurs.\n\nThe challenge isn't avoiding obstacles, its the unique control scheme. To get speed, you need to push with the simple tap of a button. Two taps gets you up to top speed. Now for the tricky part. Instead of having a jump button, you use the analog stick to hold in one direction to charge the jump and release. So you flick the stick to jump. The direction you flick the stick determines the trick in the jump. There is a trictionary if you're looking for a specific trip, but I don't think it matters what trick you do. Your momentum determines the distance of the jump. You can even do quarter circles, half circles and so on to perform bigger tricks. Its elegant and simple yet complex and difficult to time because of how unique it is.\n\nWhen you are about to land the jump, you need to hit the land button, which is the same as the push button. If you don't push the land button, you'll land a "sloppy" which briefly stuns your rider by making him unbalanced. Getting stunned makes you vulnerable to falling off your board because you can't jump. Hitting obstacles or falling down a flight of stairs sends your rider tumbling a comical distance. In a way its a funny bit to tell you that you've failed, but in another way its a time wasting punishment. There are several grades to your landing depending how close to the ground you hit the button. A sloppy landing can make 20 trick combination worthless for point value. The grade of your landing not only determines the score you get for the combination, but it changes your momentum. A sloppy landing slows you down while a perfect landing will make you speed up.\n\nOutside of pushes, jumps and landings, there are grinds and twists. Twisting in air requires you to hold the button before you jump so your rider gets into position. I didn't find these necessary, but if you want a bigger score, you'll twist like its the 1950s. Twists are true risks and rewards, because you can fail the level if you mess up. Grinds are much easier. If there's a wall, railing or rooftop, just push the analog stick and hold it. Releasing it makes the rider jump as he normally would. Getting big combos relies on your ability to grind. Like with landings, you can score perfect grinds too, depending on how late you time your grind. Some of the later levels rely on your ability to make perfect grinds, because they keep your momentum going. Just know this is what you're getting yourself into.\n\nThere is an easy to use, optional tutorial that explains all the controls. Everything gets explained one by one before the game makes you do them.\n\nThere are five themes in OlliOlli each has its own color pallet. A grey urban, a brown pallet junkyard, a blue port, a snowy white base reminiscent of Rush'n Attack and finally the bright neon city. They are all beautiful, but they go by in an unnoticeable blur. I couldn't pay attention to anything other than was there a grind or a landing coming? As the levels get higher, the challenge grows. The base has safe pavement to land on, but a lot of it is snow that sends you tumbling. Its fun to grind over helicopter blades and statues instead of simple railings and walls. Neon city is mostly rooftops and railings to grind on, because the ground is either pink spikes or wide stairways.\n\nTo keep you in the game there are daily challenges that let you practice as much as you want, but you only have one real attempt. Each level has its own leader boards after every attempt.  The game keeps track of your high score of each level and your best trick combination for that run. Truth be told, the game did freeze and twice crash in four hours after some completed runs. I assume because it was loading leader board standings and couldn't.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a real standout. The lo fi electronic beats fit the art style. For the most part it felt like all mellow songs, but there is an eclectic mix of tunes. No matter what the beat, nothing got in the way and just added to the feeling of zoning out that I had while playing. The game became all timing with no thought. I just knew from playing that was the millisecond I needed to do something. After spending 20 - 30 minutes on some of the later levels of the amateur career, I could might be able to do them blindfolded.\n\nIn the future I'd like to see different riders to unlock. Not that the rider was anything bad, but it was just him for the 4 hours I played. I am thankful for him having a red hat, otherwise he may have gotten lost in the blur of the background.\n\nIn conclusion, its a fantastic presentation and a test of skill, but I'm not sure how fun the game actually is. I found my mind not as engaged as my reflexes were. I wasn't having any joy going through the motions. Although I did get a few laughs seeing my rider tumble down flights of staircases and seeing just how many meters he could go. Its still a good game, but after going through the armature career and spots, I'm just not that willing to unlock all the pro levels.","February 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

This learning curve might also be tough for some players, because it involves practicing many combos (flick movement on the left stick) and learning which of them score bigger than others. But this is really the key to high scores, know what to do, with enough variety and safety (and just doing ollies all along a level is not half the fun)\n\nOn the downside, the Vita sticks are perfect for this game, small and short so flicks are super fast todo. While on the Xbox360 controller, the physical movement is longer (so slower to perform), and in my case as it is wireless it adds some lag, so have to press buttons earlier than on the Vita.\n","July 24, 2014","true","25.7"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","35","46","0","0"

I haven't tried playing with my keyboard, but with the controller you use your analog stick to do tricks, so it involves a lot of spinning it around in multiple ways and pressing buttons along to do all the complex stunts you need without really having to think too much about it. Simple to learn, challenging (in a fun way!) to master, as it offers a fulfilling variety of stunts of different levels that you can perform.\n\nIs this another one of those endless running / distance games?It involves distance, but it isn't endless. The game is comprised of "stages" with a number of goals you can accomplish in each of those. Each stage has a certain distance, to go to the next one, usually all you need to do is finish the stage in one piece. However, you also have the option of completing one or more of those multiple goals that each stage offers. Completing all goals in a level unlocks a new difficulty of that level, with even more challenges. So it's a bit different of the boring endless distance games that have been crowding the game market lately.\n\nIs there a story?Sorry, not really, but even though I love games with stories, I didn't miss in this case because the game mechanics keep you hooked init. It's actually very easy to completely forget about your goals even, just because you got so excited that you got like 10 perfects in a row and you want to see how far you can go.\n\nWhat else can you say about this game?As you're playing, you learn with your mistakes, so even when you fail it doesn't get frustrating, because you get that feeling that in just a few more tries you'll get it right. Some times you'll have to stop doing the stunts you tend to overuse, and pull different strategies and combos to get the objects in the field that you need to collect to complete a challenge. There's also a big variety of stunts you can perform, as well as the techniques you need to develop to get perfect landings, nosegrinds, to get better speed without having to put your foot on the ground to push your skate faster, etc.\n\nYeah, it's a casual game, but I tell you, it's addictive. (I just spent 2 hours playing it nonstop, and had to stop myself because I had work to do, otherwise I would've kept going - even just writing this review makes me want to go back and play it a bit more!) My only sadness so far? I wish it had more steam achievs, I feel like this game has a lot of cool achievement possibilities, but sadly that wasn't well explored. At least we get cool in-game coals to achieve, though!","November 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

There are many ways I can fall off that board, and I imagine all of them have to do with something like falling onto a turd or a water hydrant or onto a set of figurines that are participating in a heated battle of Warhammer 40,000 on the sidewalk, where I will pierce one of my internal organs on a Tyranid and have to explain to God when I get to the pearly gates why I am such an ultra-wuss.\n\nOlliOlli captures some of that terror because it has a difficulty curve that's steep as hell, like learning how to ride an actual skateboard. The tutorial could have been better (for some reason I couldn't actually figure out how to do Perfect Grinds until I just said '♥♥♥♥ this' and played an actual level, where I slowly figured it out on my own, but I think that's more of my blatant inattentiveness than the tutorial's fault), but the real learning experience is pretty much about getting better and faster at the game, and learning how to squeeze in more tricks between grinds for higher scores or for unlocking bigger, better levels. If you want to unlock those "Pro" levels, you gotta ♥♥♥♥ing earn your keep. Once you get in the groove of actually starting to pull off sweet moves and getting in the habit of varying what moves you pull off, the game opens up dramatically and challenges you even more.\n\nDespite OlliOlli's semi-'thrown in the deep end' type of tutorial, it gets its vibe right. The soundtrack is the perfect thing to grind to, and the controls are a bit finicky but the way they are built allows for effortless cool stunts between jumps. It looks cool and I bet you will not be called a nerd if you show people how you can do a 1080 Backside Flip-It to people on the bus without losing. It's Super Meat Boy hard - you will break your knees and ankles so many times before you can finally pull off that grind-flip-grind-twist-grind-perfect landing combo, and it will feel glorious. If you can beat all the Rad levels, I bet you can show someone at the interview for your next job and you will get that job.\n\nPersonally (oh no! Personally, the verboten word in video game reviews), I'm not a fan of these endless hardcore trek-up-Death-Mountain challenges, and OlliOlli didn't change my mind. But I like what it's doing enough to recommend it.","June 9, 2015","true","3.5"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","19","25","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/274250/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","OlliOlli strips trick-based skateboarding down to its most exhilarating, addicting elements.\n\nIt’s the practice and lead up to a perfect run; the repeated failure and experimentation over and over until finally you nail that perfect combo and the multipliers go crazy. OlliOlli takes that key moment and feeling that was pioneered, refined, and then beaten into the ground by Tony Hawk Pro-Skater, and removes all the fluff and needless bloat that began to weigh the series down the further it went on.\n\nSome of this is accomplished inherently by moving from a 3D sandbox to an always moving sidescroller, which immediately gives OlliOlli a great deal of originality. But developer Roll7 clearly knows and loves the games that built (and subsequently largely destroyed) the extreme sports genre, and borrows liberally the pieces that worked best from them to make a new, disturbingly addictive blend of mechanics.\n\nIt’s Tony Hawk’s eccentricity, Skate’s organic trick system, and a whole lot of intelligent endless runner progression design. Performing tricks is as simple as flicking the analogue stick, but having to time your landings adds a considerable amount of risk versus reward to performing longer tricks when your movement speed is largely out of your control and it’s not always easy to predict what’s going to meet you later on in the level.\n\nOlliOlli can be absurdly difficult at parts, but it’s a challenge that I always felt prepared for. The goals for each level gradually introduce new moves into your skillset, and then gave me the perfect area to learn them. There’s a feeling of constant growth as you clear each level and the gradually climbs to counteract it, but also an understanding that for some players certain challenges will be out of their reach. OlliOlli never forced me to clear a goal or spend more time on a certain level than I wanted to, but it was so successful at instilling confidence in my ability to overcome whatever it threw at me that I rarely had any desire to move on before showing the game how capable I was.\n\nI did eventually abandon some levels, surrendering that I wasn’t quite as skilled as I pretended to be, but unlike a lot of games my experience wasn’t tarnished in any way for doing so. OlliOlli seems designed from the ground up to be as much as you want to put into it, and providing an awesome time whatever that is. The short levels are perfect for picking off in small bursts, and the addition of a daily grind which changes daily and gives a you only one chance to hit your best score, gave even more reason to return to the game instead of trying to plow through it all at once.\n\nMy biggest frustration with OlliOlli actually doesn’t have anything to do with what’s here, but the disappointing absence of a convenient leaderboard. You can track your score and compare it with others in any level you choose, but instead of being prominently displayed it’s put on a separate screen completely removed from gameplay. For a game so perfectly designed for chasing high scores (you even unlock score focused “spots” after clearing each level once), having something like Geometry Wars 2’s immediate tracking of leaderboard positioning and your next score to beat would have been far more compelling a motivator for me to chase my friend’s best scores.\n\nThat may matter more or not at all depending on your feelings toward competing on leaderboards, but it’s at least telling that my only major issue with OlliOlli is in something it lacks (and even then, it’s more the implementation than complete absence of a feature). It’s a game so precisely tuned and refined that I found myself becoming lost for hours at a time repeating levels attempting to best my prior run. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and elation at expertly executing a sequence of tricks I haven’t felt in a decade, and reminded me why I’m so sad games of this nature were killed off by their own insistence on flooding the market and deluding themselves with features nobody wanted. OlliOlli suffers from none of that. It’s pure, sublime skating perfection.\n\nOn the PC version:\nWhile the PC version of OlliOlli is content complete to its Playstation 4 and Vita counterparts, the port has sadly suffered a great deal in the transition. I experience a significant amount of technical issues, from dropped frames, persistent slowdown, leaderboards crashing the game, and a generally lower level of responsiveness than a game so reliant on timing needs. It wasn’t so bad I was unable to enjoy the game or play it successfully, but if you have the ability to play it on another platform it might be advisable to do so.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Timing-based scoring system (Perfect! Sick! Sloppy! Sketchy!) makes for a solid "perfectionist" type of challenge, yet one not exactly punishing at early levels. Animations are pretty choppy and the character art (while often charming, such as the bails) is unrefined and downright ugly at times. Kickflips and heelflips for example, are visually indistinguishable, and for a 2D game, good sprite work and animation seems like a pretty important thing.

This is true-- but OlliOlli's difficulty is fair, fun, and rewarding. Landing tricks is legitimately difficult and feels great. After a few play sessions, you should really start to feel yourself improving.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple-- left analog stick to line up a trick, 'A' button to push against the ground or land the end of a trick combo. Tricks are controlled by the directions you push the left analog stick. Releasing the stick causes your character to jump in the air and attempt the trick. Sweeping the stick around in a circle will line up a more complicated trick, based on the distance and direction you sweeped it. The only way to get credit for a trick or a combo is to tap the 'A'button quickly just before you hit the ground. The closer to the ground, the better multiplier you get.\n\nOverall, the system is simple and rewards practice. Chaining together a long combo is quite difficult, and you'll have to chain some pretty ridiculous ones to complete all the objectives in each campaign level.\n\nSpeaking of levels-- the "Career" campaign has several "acts" with eight tracks each-- four easy, four hard. Each act has its own art style. There's also a "Spots" mode, where you get to execute precisely one combo before the level ends. Extending that combo gets you more points and a better spot on the leaderboards. The final game mode is the "Daily Grind." It provides a single randomly-generated track that you only get one chance to set a score on. So far, the Daily Grind I've tried has been quite hard.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys twitchy, timing-based platformers or arcadey, combo-centric skill games. Not for the weak of heart, but ultimately accessible to anyone with a gamepad and the will to improve.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack is excellent.","July 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

If you like challenging games that get you try and re-try until perfection, this is it. The tricks are easy to start, but developing skill is an entirely different thing. This is a game where you're going to have to practice and become skilled at what you're doing, which is something I understood the moment I completed the tutorial and tried the first level. It's satisfying when you finally do what you wanted to do or clear the goal you've been trying to clear for the past several minutes. I definitely recommend a game pad with this, as it brings that EA Skate stick control to the game and you can get a better feel for doing the tricks. The music is fantastic. It's a nice blend of mellow Hip Hop (sampled or synth) and it helps take the edge off when playing.\nIf you like skateboarding, you'll like this. If you like challenge, you'll like this. If a rage quit is something you're fond of, you'll like this game.\n\nMy only hope is the developer considers adding character customization to the game.","July 22, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/recommended/274250/","IStayPuft","I Stay Puft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/","552 products in account","OlliOlli is a 2d skateboarding game that bares similarities to the gameplay of now defunct developer Black Box skateboarding game "Skate". The basic control scheme is all there, you have your left analog stick quarter circles, full circles and point analog at said direction to pull off a variety of combo skateboarding tricks and grinds. Sure it doesn't have any of the crazy stunts of a Tony Hawk like 720 shove it-to -superman-heelflip-whatever but pulling off chain combo in OlliOlli has just the degree of difficult and requires just the amount of skill that pulling them off will give players an equal amount of gratification when done properly. Players progress in challenge latened levels where either collecting, pulling off x amount of combos, or reaching a certain amount of score will progress you to the next level and ultimately to more difficult challenges.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation OlliOlli 2d pixelated art style helps sets it apart from the more well known 3D skateboarding franchises by giving the game a indie feel very reminiscent of underground skateboarding back in the day. This feeling is reinforced by the music that not only helps set the tone but remind players the variety and diversity skateboarding is. There's a level of cool brought to this game simply by choosing these aesthetics.\n\nA few issues I had with this game was primarily on the mechanics side where the initial timing for the landing of tricks require players to press a button at the right time to pull it off perfectly. This window to press the button is fairly short and requires you to pay attention to how far your board is to the ground. This can prove an issue because like other 2d endless runners before it if you aren't paying attention to the screen correctly your character may blend into the background which can prove troublesome.  Failing to pull off the perfect landing on a trick can be the difference between getting 100k score on a perfectly run level to 20k score on a poorly runned one.\n\nOverall if you ever had an interest in skateboarding games or were interested in this game when it initally came out on Playstation Vita but didn't have the hardware to play it, I think this is a game worth picking up.","August 9, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also, OlliOlli is a quite diffcult game, especially if you want to break some highscores. Everything is happening quite fast and if you're bailing you'll have to start again.\nAlso, you'll have to learn how the tricks are executed, because some challenges require certain tricks. OlliOlli will challenge your reactions and your hand-eye coordination!\nWhat I like about it is, that there are lots of different flip and grind tricks, but in my opinion they should have included grabs, lateflips, more grinds/slides and more fliptricks, because it still has space for more tricks and there are some buttons with no function (for example on the xbox 360 controller.) A gamepad is recommended! The leaderboard function and the daily grind feature makes this game highly replayable, although there aren't that much levels. But still, it will take some time if you want to beat all levels with 5 stars plus the pro levels.\nI think it would have been awesome to be able to costumize your skater and skateboard, sadly this isn't possible.\nGraphics are typical arcade 2d style, but it still looks nice and stylish.\nAlthough it does  lack a little bit of content in my opinion  (ok, it costs only 11 €), it is an absolute fun game to play.\n\nIf you're into arcade/Indie and skate games, you definitely should check this one out!\n\nRating:\n83/100","September 28, 2014","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The glorious times when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) games were the shizzle. It has that charm of chaining together obscenely long combos, demand for extreme precision and OCD inducing goals. The game is what happened after a night of heavy drinking where broken down and sad THPS caught the eye of Super Meat Boy, what we got from this mash up is devilishly difficult but at the same addictive skating game.\nWhat makes OlliOlli hard to put down are the systems under the hood. On the surface it is rather simple, moving left stick to do tricks and grinds with the shoulder buttons that double as spin and modifier buttons. But once the game reveals that you can do perfect landings, perfect grinds that all give you score and speed boosts that is the moment where OlliOlli really got me hooked. Now I knew I could demolish the target score, now the 50x combo didn't seem as impossible. And in the same way as in the old THPS games you learn the individual levels by heart, knowing when to jump, grind, spin or land just by muscle memory. OlliOlli is a very good and fun little game, that thanks to its editor will last you a long time so the price tag is totally reasonable.","September 6, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your objective is skating as far as you can along short, but somewhat demanding levels featuring stairs, grinds, vehicles, obstacles. Along the level you get scores for tricks, grinds and combos.\n\nWith 8 key controls the game seems to be easy, but it is relatively unforgiving, which makes you wanna beat it. I mean, how many times can you smash your face into the floor just after landing an epic 20x combo?! After a few minutes you can play the game and after 1-2 hours you get to know more tricks and are able to get quite impressive scores.\n\nThe game features classic 8-bit arcade graphics style and urban music floating between trance, hip-hop and dubstep (no vocals).\n\nIs it fun? Yes it is. You want to win the level. You want to land the combo. You want to beat your friends' score online (there are leaderboards). The graphics is retro-cool (but at times too simplistic and repetitive) and the music creates right skateboarding mood. At the same time it is a little annoying, especially after multiple failures. Despite easy controls I tend to mix up the keys in the heat of the moment. Music is good, but it just runs in the background, isn't related to levels or your activity/performance. Some levels are repetive, but the in-game achievements vary from level to level. There are multiple themes including city, port and junkyard. Some are better than others, for example in port the lack of detail on the floor makes it difficult to estimate your current speed. There are some bugs. The game crashed for me once.\n\nIt is a nice little game definitely worth getting in some bundle. Depending on how much you like arcade games you will have 5-20 hours of fun until it gets a little boring.\n\nGRAPHICS: 6/10\nAUDIO: 7/10\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10","November 18, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Crash and you have to restart the level. Essentially the game plays like a runner-style game with your character constantly moving forward, although the high level of precision needed for the later levels almost makes it feel like a rhythm game. Secondary to beating each level, you can focus on getting high scores and beating challenges for each level, such as scoring a certain combo or getting all the collectibles.\n\nOlliOlli has a simple but unique control scheme where you perform tricks by holding and releasing the left control stick and pressing A to speed up and stick landings while your character continually moves forward. It definitely took me some time to get used to the fact that pressing A does not make jump while wiggling the control stick does but, once I got a hang of it, I found that this type of control offers up a lot of freedom and works quite well.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed OlliOlli's gameplay a lot. It's a fast-paced steep challenge that I enjoyed as a fan of precision platforming\n\nArt Direction\n\nWhile I enjoyed the distinctness of OlliOlli's five worlds, Urban, Junkyard, Port, Base (soviet Russia), and Neon (retro-future Tokyo), and the crisp clean menus, I found the simple pixel graphics of OlliOlli during actual gameplay to be somewhat lackluster. They aren't bad but they also didn't stick with me and it was occasionally hard to distinguish what was purely an obstacle and what I may be able to grind, which was problematic.\n\nSound Design\n\nOlliOlli is yet another indie title with a fantastic soundtrack. The music seems to take influence from a number of sources and has elements of electronic, jazz, and hip-hop. It's upbeat, catchy, and kept me going as I crashed over and over again.\n\nThe sound effects are fine but much less memorable.\n\nOverview\n\nOlliOlli is a fun runner-style sidescrolling game with a steep challenge that features a unique control scheme and a great soundtrack. You don't need to care for real life skateboarding at all to enjoy this one. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high precision sidescroller to test their skills.","June 6","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Originally developed for the PS Vita by Roll7 – the windows port up-scales the game whilst offering a similar experience. But does it grind past its contemporaries or face-plant into failure?\n\nThe games primary feature is a single player career mode. This is split across 5 distinct areas each divided into 5 courses. Your tasked with completing each course to unlock the next with increasing difficulty as you progress.\nThere are also a list of 5 objectives within each course, and if completed you unlock a 'Pro' variation of the same course. Each run is fairly short and can be successfully completed within a few minutes.\n\nTo supplement this once you've unlocked a course, they can then be revisited as skating 'spots', allowing you to compete on a score board, ranking players across the globe.\nThe final mode is a challenge variant called 'Daily Grind' which challenges the player to grind the entirety of a run. You can practice as many times as you want but you can only compete once. Your score is also ranked, however this resets with a new course every day.\n\nAlthough OlliOlli is a fairly compact game – the polish and refinement to the gameplay and mechanics makes it easy to jump in and out of. Its highly satisfying to pull off a series of tricks and slide down a rail to 100% a course, and although it can be frustrating when your stuck on a run at times, its easy to step away for a few hours and pick up where you left off later. There is also the option to skip through the levels.\n\nThe gradual increase in difficulty is the perfect means to encourage players to perfect their timing. It also encourages the revisit of past levels, as new skills are picked up that will allow previously impossible objectives to be overcome. The game can feel intimidating at first but through familiarising yourself with the tutorials and the 'tricktionary' the player can steadily progresses through the game – never becoming too hard or too easy.\n\nAlthough the game is primarily single player there is a thrill with trying to out-do players on the scoreboards, and its easy to go back to a run that you've had much success and find you've been out done. The daily grind is also another great incentive to try boast you timing and trick combinations.\n\nThe games biggest weakness is perhaps its controls, as a handheld port – the instant response of controller buttons is required. A keyboard can hinder the players timing and weakens the core mechanics of the game. There were also occasions where the keys would not register a move resulting in a sloppy landing or bail. However a controller solved all these problems. On the rare occasion the game suffered from glitches that allowed us to grind through obstacles or bail on a perfect landing.\n\nAlthough there isn't anything particularly impressive about the aesthetics of the game the art style is very charming. Particularly the animated background environments, and the skater himself, who has unique animations for each trick which can be viewed within the 'tricktionary'. However the contrast between the slow background and fast character can sometimes be disorientating, drawing focus away from the speed of the foreground.\n\nOlliOlli has a subtle electronic score which really suits the retro feel of the game. Although you hear the same tracks multiple times, they can come in at just the right moment to spur you on to victory.\n\nThe game manages to avoid feeling repetitive through remaining a challenge. Rather than testing the patient of the player, there is the ability to restart at any point in a run and progressively improve over an individual course. OlliOlli is a great example of when less is more,  but with a sequel announced for next year promising to expand on its successes, we can't wait to get back on ours board.\n\n\nVideo Review at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPhFlNsKTbo&list=UUxz-iPSjsZAsGhFY7zLfi9g","November 26, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blurr82/recommended/274250/","blurr82","blurr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blurr82/","268 products in account","The Skateboarding game we deserve.\n\nDetailed yet simple control scheme weighing importance to timing while remaining fair and not *very* dexterity heavy. An immense emphasis on the joystick offers a myriad of tricks to try out for players but I've only been able to try out a handfull of them by the time I even finished all the levels. Trying out more tricks makes sense because your score depends on what trick you perform but given the dexterity requirement, it's gonna take more than a hand full of tries to remember and make use of them in the game. That is my only complaint but then again, I can only spare so much time for gaming these days, that's just me.\n\nThat is paired with terrific levels designed to offer the most glorious skateboarding experience. Seriously, don't watch a walkthrough to see how the game is, this is something you must experience, it's a sham there is no demo available. Some of the levels gave this sense of euphoria which very few platformers(I played) have managed to offer and that my friend, is the mark of a great platformer.\n\nNot to mention, an amazing sound track to which I've lost myself listening to during gameplay and it is in no way a bad thing. On the contrary, I bumped up the music volume and turned down the in-game sound effects for a more engaging experience. I'm pretty sure I would not have gone back to playing and finishing it by the time I did if it were not for the sound track. It's that good and really enhances the experience.\n\nI haven't played THPS but always wanted to play a skateboarding game and boy am I satisfied. It's worth mentioning that I loved this so much I bought it on PS Vita as well and played through most of it again :) I'm certainly looking forward to more of Roll7's works, already pre-ordered NOT A HERO and it certainly looks promising.\n\nIt's pretty evident that I am recommending this excellent skateboarding game and it is something you should try and not just watch or read. Go ahead and buy (full price or half price or whatever) and if you think you're not up for the dexterity challenge, try it out at least and be your own judge.\n","May 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinheim3/recommended/274250/","vinheim3","Prinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinheim3/","352 products in account","Already beat the game fully on vita, but had to buy it again because of how quality and polished it is. The basic premise is that it's a runner game similar to Bit.Trip runner except you have a wide variety of tricks you can pull off the ground and a variety of grinds you can pull off on rails you find on the stage.\n\nThe game has a strong focus on timing as you gain maximum speed by pressing a button just as you land on the ground or on a rail for a perfect landing and harder stages have huge gaps after a series of rails that require you to perfect land on one, off it and perfect land onto another.\n\nThe trick/grind system can also be compared to moves in ARPGs like DMC. There is a wide variety of them and in order to build up a good score, you have to use a variety of each throughout the stage.\n\nIn order to unlock stages, you just have to beat the previous, but there are optional objectives in each one that you can shoot for for 100% completion. Usually there's 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for the whole stage, 1 for achieving at least a certain high score for a combo, and the other 3 involve a variety of objects like collecting hard to reach collectibles in the stage, reaching high places in the stage which requires a set of perfect grinds, pulling off a certain move or a combination of trick/grind, restrictions like not pushing for more speed on ground, no grinding, etc. They're all fun to get.\n\nWhen you've beaten the initial 25 stages which will take you a hell of a long time especially starting out, there are 25 additional harder stages. After that, there is rad mode where you have to beat all 50 stages with only perfect landings, and while you can get used to it, some stages are incredibly brutal because some gaps seem only passable if you slow down and not perfect land to hit a closer platform before a huge gap.\n\nThere is a lot to do in this small, high skill ceiling game, and if you like runner games like Bit.Trip runner, I would reccomend this ♥♥♥♥ with the force of a thousand suns. The aesthetics are varied and simple enough to focus on gameplay, and the music is beautiful and fitting that you'll have no problems with it while you 100% it.\n\nI'd give it at least an 8 out of 10, and it probably deserves higher than that.","July 26, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However it can be a bit challenging in the later stages. To make up for it's shortness, there are daily grinds (like daily challenges in spelunky) and a massive online leaderboard that always makes you think "I can do better than that" or "I can do one more spin in the air on that one jump to get x more points".

Also this game has controller support (I used Xbox One Controller) the game is extremely fun if you can learn how to play, but it does have a tutorial so you can learn how to do tricks, land, and grind! Of which is a nice feature. The menus/HUD are also wonderful, they have a cool Metro feeling to them, of which I feel anyone can like, I have to say, this game is one of my favorite skating games, other than Tony Hawks, of which this game does remind me of, but instead it is in a 2D world. I love the art style, of the game, as it is simplistic, also the size of the game is very compact, for the amount of things stored in the game, I am proud of the Developers for fitting so much into such a little game.\n\nConsThis is the part where I abuse a game I have just played... The game seems to just have re-occurring maps on different stages, say the first stage, it has rails and stairs, throughout the levels on each stage, of which is a bit weird, as you are trying to improve score, so why wouldn't you give the player a different map per level instead of stage, I know they may take some time to make, but it would add a lot more variation. As I said before I used a controller as this game is easier to play with one, but say I didn't run the tutorial, I would have no clue about the controls, as in settings it says nothing, about controller controls\n\nOverall reviewThis game is unique, I have never played something like it, and the style is brilliant, the maps are ok, but improvements could be made, The controls may be hard to learn, but when you learn to play the game it is brilliant, I have saw videos, and a friend of mine said he enjoyed playing it also, I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys pixelated, skating games, and also could go under the Indie genre, but I feel the developers have done a wonderful job!\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): Roll7, General Arcade\nPublisher(s): Devolver Digital\nPlatform(s): Windows, SteamOS, Mac\nRelease Date: July 22nd 2014\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 16","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/274250/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","OlliOlli is a good example of a clever game idea executed poorly. The concept is simple: you control a skateboarder through various 2d levels and perform tricks based off of jumps and rails, racking up points through carefully executed combos and landings. The controls are fairly straightforward and the levels aren’t too hard to pick up….at least until later on when the difficulty curve goes through a sudden spike.\n\nIn the last two areas of the game the developers seemed to want to punish the player as much as possible by requiring absolute perfection on every single jump and grind. This would be alright by me except the timing for a perfect landing or grind seems to differentiate between parts of a level and hitting the directional or landing button before contact at a certain pixel distance will net a different result when it should be exactly the same every time. This made the second level of the final area absolutely impossible for me and earlier parts extremely difficult to pass.\n\nIt doesn’t help that for the hard levels, the developers thought putting the most brutal part near the beginning was a good idea. Forcing the player to die over and over again before they even make it 10 seconds into the level is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ IMO and just results in a lot of frustration for when you finally get past it and then die another few seconds later, only to return to struggling with that first 10 seconds. Finally, I had stability issues with the game whenever my connection to steam servers wasn’t so good and it would crash to desktop several times.\n\nI won’t be getting the sequel to this one unless the engine and level design get a serious overhaul.\n","August 24, 2015","false","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fun you derive from this game is by creating a smooth flow throughout a level. Obstacles and incorrect timing are what interrupt the flow in a 3d game. In a 2D game, you'll find it's more often the confusing controls and what you can't see emerging from the right side of the screen that will interrupt your flow, and thus, your fun.\n\nThe primary problem is that it has a very strange control layout that doesn't quite translate from Tony Hawk's 3D world well enough to a 2D world. I wish jumping was just bound to a single button, instead of having you pull back on the left stick of the controller to "charge" a jump (which is more time consuming - which, in a reaction based game like this, can be killer).

Too many levels feature insta-death obstacles almost right at the start of the stage, which is as much fun as being thrown three live grenades and being asked to judge which one weighs the least.\n\nAs the game goes on, more and more levels become reliant on grinding your whole way through, which quickly becomes tiresome and very same-y. Said same levels often REQUIRE that you're playing perfectly, otherwise you will move too slow and not be able to make a gap. The second level of the last world requires dozens of perfect grinds. If you fail almost any of them, you have to restart.\n\nI'm assuming, in part, that the reason why there is so much grinding is because you are unable to Manual between tricks, If the game was more flatland/street scape then the opportunities for combos would be greatly lessened. But you know what else stops your combo meter? Lamely falling into a gigantic pit full of ♥♥♥♥ing spikes. Nothing de-hypes you quite like pulling off fiften perfect grinds in a row to look like a chump because you only landed the Salad Grind on top of the neon dinosaur, but you didn't land it "Perfect", so now you're dead.\n\nWhat I desperately want in this game is a level where I can ♥♥♥♥ around and practice without flying into hells ♥♥♥♥ing teeth every twenty seconds.

First of all, the trick list seems incomplete, a lot of the movement of the left stick just end up doing ollies, and having to let the stick go back to neutral position feels like a really unnecessary step. Secondly, the most important thing to keep a run going is perfect landings, and all my video gaming instincts lead me to try hitting the landing button at the point of impact with the ground. However, it seems you have to hit the button quite a bit of time BEFORE you land, and HOLD IT until the point of landing. This just feels really unintuitive and breaks the flow of play.\n\n\nI don't understand how anyone can get several hours out of this.

Comparing this to meat boy is just a joke, the buttons aren't even responsive half the time on the Neon Tokyo levels, and some early stages have harder levels than later stages. There is no point in progression in this game, and although it can be fun for a short time, the price is kind of silly. Free skating would be nice, the fact that you fall down once and have to start from the beginning makes it boring. I've beat Super Meat Boy, so rage games don't get to me, but this game is just way too simple.

I swear after a mere 90 mins of ingame time I had to force close the game THREE TIMES because it froze. It still freezes on me all the time.\n\nAlso I think the controls suffer from the same problem of EA's Skate series of spamming the joystick to pull off tricks.\nIt may be just my controller (although I doubt it as I use the same 360 controller for all my single player games that allow it) but the controls feel unresponsive, especially doing 180 spins, which are maped to the Left and Right bumpers. Which sucks, IMO the bumpers are terrible buttons but OlliOlli has the gamepad controls LOCKED (not the keyboard controls, you can remap those) so you can't change them to something more comfortable like the triggers, which in this game go unused.","November 16, 2014","false","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It is fun. However, it has some serious flaws that make it a terribly annoying game to play.\n\n1 = The game is actually broken. You'll just get a black screen of death if you don't disable Steam overlay. I know it's a small problem, but they've released a game that DOESN'T WORK and then people pay for it. This should be illegal, no matter how easy the fix is.\n\n2 = The controls are unresponsive. You push the buttons to do a certain trick, and you just ollie. You want to do a spin trick, and do EXACTLY what you're supposed to do, and yet you don't spin. It's really annoying to just keep doing ollies and flying through the air doing absolutely nothing, just because the game sucks at reading your controller. The game is built to use a controller, and yet they don't work properly.\n\n3 = Sometimes the game breaks your computer. I've had a couple of times now where it will do the old NES thing where the screen freezes and makes a hum. It's also worse than normal crashes, because you can't force quit. You have to manually power down your computer.... I haven't had to do that in years...\n\n4 = There are times when your skater crashes for no good reason. Like, I'll flick the stick to jump, and he doesn't jump, he just crashes... And no, I don't suck at the game, I've almost beaten everything in this, and yet I still have these stupid things happening, which shouldn't even be possible. Like, I can't even replicate this if I'm trying to. It's just a flat out bug that happens often, and ruins the game.\n\n5 = The whole game is a pretty good pace, good achievments that are fun to get, except for the very last one... rad mode... It's incredibly frustrating, and takes an extremely long time. It's not even fun. You have to do every level over again, but flawlessly. I'm decent at the game, and I can play one level for half an hour before I get it flawless. It makes the game not even worth playing, and I honestly don't even want to play it anymore, even though there's only this one achievement left. Terrible design.\n\nIt could be a fun little game, and even if you look past the brokeness and crashings, the controls are still very unresponsive, making the game terribly annoying rather than fun.\n\nEDIT: As I play more, the non-responsive controls just get worse and worse. There are parts in levels that just will not accept a jump command. You'll flick the stick to jump, way before the edge, and the guy will just stop crouching (which means it KNOWS you released the stick), and yet he won't jump. So you fall and crash and have to start over. Get to that spot again, same thing happens. I'm playing a level right now that has TWO spots like this, in the same level... It's honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, which is too bad, because it's a great concept.","January 9, 2015","false","24.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game seems like it's supposed to be a twitch control game, but the controls just don't feel right. When I make or miss a trick, I honestly can't tell what I was doing differently. The sound effects are great. The music is annoying after two listens. The animations are great. The graphics are good, but could use a little more contrast between background and gamplay objects. Overall this is a great concept, but it is really brought down by mediocre control implementation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/274250/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","Leave it to Devolver to take another great, simple concept, with run-away potential and screw it up. The controls in this game are so stupidly done it almost seems as if they made a bet with the staff to see who could create the most counter-intuitive operations possible for a fast-paced action/sports game. Last Devolver game I buy. After Hotline Miami I said the same thing and I honestly didnt even see that this was Devolver when I bought it on sale. When I saw the logo pop up when I started the game I said "&$#@, cant believe I missed that".\n\nSince they wanted to rely so heavily on the analog sticks (which I totally approve) they shouldve never made a requirement of using "A" to land every single trick. Since "A" is also used to pump for speed it should only be used for transitioning between rails...if even that. Setting up for tricks and activating them didnt need to be dependant on 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, etc rotations and then releasing when using the D-pad is much more precise and you can get a longer trick list if you incorporate the diagonals as a defined direction.\n\nThyeve made blasting out tricks between grinds unecessarily difficult...even on the first levels. The tutorial will tell you to grind everything because that wil give you more speed. Except for when it doesnt and it stops you dead, causes you to fall, and you have to restart your run. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb\n\nAnyway, trick execution is abnormally stupid. And I know how this happens. One person came up with the control scheme. It felt natural to them and they implemented it (this is someone who was just mediocre at the original Tony Hawk games and was mad that their friends were able to score higher than them). The rest of the staff thought that since the game itself wouldnt really be challenging or fun, they could just roll with the control scheme being counter-intuitive and that would suffice for a game that was well thought out. Using "A" to land is so wildly stupid that I cant even fathom how that stayed in for the final version. First of all, landing your tricks in real life is totally dependant on your prior execution. They couldve easily done one of two things to incorprate a skill/timing based landing function. Either use "down" on the analog stick or make your landing dependant on your execution. Too little speed and you may land wobbly, too much and you may not be able to set up for the next execution. Their levels are laid out perfectly for the latter.\n\nIts amazing how well Devolver is getting at taking something that is different, fresh, and has tons of potential and just smashing it into pieces and then taking a hot steaming dump right on top of it. Thank god I only paid $6 for this. Uninstalled!\n\nIf anyone is hell bent on getting this game please respond here first and I'll put up even more reasons why you should save your money. I think I accidentally encouraged one friend to get it so now I have to buy them a game to replace this piece of crap\n\n1/10 - Because music isnt bad and the idea WAS great.","January 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Fast restarting, and it is overall fairly easy (no rage quitting for me so far)\n\nCons:\n1. It is sometimes hard to tell what is the background and what is interactable - this really matters since you will lose unfairly due to these issues\n2.

Definitely looking forward to OlliOlli 2.\n\nThe Good:\nThis game has both the charm and challenge of the old Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, distilled down into a 2D sidescroller / platformer. Moment-to-moment gameplay is absolutely solid. Aside from a handful of cases (due to unfriendly camerawork), all failures are truly your own, making success that much more gratifying. The controls are pretty unconventional, but are by no means bad. Once you get comfortable with them, pulling off elaborate combos is incredibly satisfying. There's definitely at least 10 hours of wonderfully crafted content aside from the eternal leaderboard climb & daily challenges.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nThe first thing that is likely to irk new players is the controls. There are very few analogues for players to draw from, and the gameplay is pretty unforgiving, which results in a fairly frustrating introduction if you elect to skip the tutorial. The camera is fairly static, centered on the player at all times, leading to some frustrating conflicts with the level design. In the junkyard stage especially, you'll be pitched against obstacles that you will have to have anticipated in advance because the camera placement does not offer you enough information to act before it is too late. This results in a fair bit of trial and error based play as you get a better feel for the levels, which is pretty poor design. Although all stages have a distinct visual style, the minimalist mechanics force their design to feel very same-y. The largest difference between stages is increasing obstacle density and slimming the margin for error, which works OK, but leaves the overal experience feel somewhat bland.\n\nThe Ugly:\nFairly bug-ridden. Not to the point where it's unplayable, but if you're not completely taken with the game early on, it'll be frustrating enough for this to sit in your library relatively untouched.","December 2, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a Tony Hawk and Skate veteran, having played all nine of the Tony Hawk games and the first two Skate games.  Skating games are some of my favorite games i've ever played, I grew up with them.  That being said, I was really excited to hear of a new skating game on the scene by the name of OlliOlli.\n\nHowever, what I finally got was the worst dissapointment i've ever seen.  The games controls are complete crap, with the game requiring you to jump thru hoops just to do extremely simple things.  The most egregious of these was the fact that I have to press the down button , AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME (WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE TIMING IN THIS GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD) JUST TO LAND A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OLLIE.  Now what exactly does this mean?  Well, that means you can have executed the most beutiful million point combo you've ever done, be real proud of yourself, but not press the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down button properly and fall on your ♥♥♥, losing all your points.\n\nThe jumps themselves are imprecise as hell, and the game has too many bugs to be playable.  I couldn't pass multiple objectives because bugs in the game prevented me from doing so.\n\nI could go on for pages about why this game is so bad, but I believe you get my drift here.  All skateboarding game fans STAY AWAY!  In fact, everyone should probably steer clear of this turd.","November 27, 2014","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't even think I will ever write one, but this game is too amazing to not do it. I've played it around 10h now and it was definitly worth all the money. I can recommend it strongly to anyone who is either interested in skill-games, skating and/or has played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater back in the days. Something about the feel is very similar.\n\n\n+ Great overall feeling (with controller)\n+ The spot and level design is very dynamic, multi-faceted and balanced. You never feel treated unfair, even though you suck 1000000 times at the same ♥♥♥♥.\n+ Sound effects are perfectly suited to the game dynamics\n+ I sometimes feels like I can just close my eyes and play the slides through by sound.\n+ The atmosphere totally soaks one in. Time and space fade into each other so there is only OlliOlli left in the universe.\n+ Lots of motivation behind the daily grinds.\n\n- Sometimes (when triggering fast) the controller sensivity doesn't react properly to the landings and I fail the tricks (mostly at the same spots over and over again). Is it only my controller?\n- Somehow I still don't 100% get how to achieve these extreme highscores. When I do a lot of combinations there is no significant difference in points (sometimes even worse) to when I just use whatever flips and slides to go through the level. Most likely I am just stupid, but still there should have been a better explaination of what makes scores go high.\n- Editor would have been nice. Maybe even a MOD-Kit to implement own graphics, obstacles, mutators, etc.\n\nTo say that clear: The negative points are in no comparison to the positive ones, just didn't want to miss them out.\n\nI highly recommend that game!","August 4, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda like a 2D Jet Set Radio. There's way less emphasis on ollying and grinding seems to be the key feature, this is pretty much all you do in the later levels. The camera angle is way too high, it's hard to see what's below you 80% of the time. You're going at high speed, you ollie and then you roll the dice whether it's something you can grind on or if it's something you need to press A to land. This is especially annoying when you're chaining together a combo and the game screws you over.\n\nOne thing that bothers me the most is that it feels kinda clunky, it might be something you have to get used to, but it throws me off every time. Every trick you do your feet have to be on your board first. Heelflip >land on board >land trick, laserflip >land on board >land trick etc. The speed that you go added with the pixel art also doesn't help as it's hard to tell if you're on the board and/or if you're close to the ground.\n\nIt's also got good things going for it. Chaining together combos perfectly is really satisfying, when you screw up you can press select to instantly restart giving it a "just one more go" kinda feel. There are quite a few tricks too, the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining some of it but you can do a lot of crazy stuff. I also like that you got to "press A" to land your moves, while it can be frustrating it's also to the games benefit as it feels really good when you land something complicated perfectly.\n\nOverall I recommend it, but buy it knowing that there are a few issues that need to be fixed.","August 29, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're into other skating games (Tony Hawk) or side-scrolling platformers, then this may be a game for you.\n\nThe controls, while a bit counter-intuitive at first, become second nature quickly, and they are tight and snappy, as any good fast-paced platformer should have. Very rarely does a death feel like the game's fault, and this is one of the core strengths of the game.\n\nAs well, the level design seems well-planned and intelligent, forcing players into situations where they have to adapt using only the small control set they have. It just feels, I dunno, smart.\n\nThere's a lot of replay value to this game, too. Besides the Daily Grind (a daily course, as the name suggests), there are many optional objectives throughout single-player.\n\nThe music, above all, is to be recommended. Not only is all of it good, or at least listenable, it seems to fit the vibe of the game very well, contributing to the overall feel.\n\nVisual style is very minimalistic, which is sort of good in a game like this: everything stands out distinctly, grind rails are obviously not obstacles, stuff like that. It also keeps a relatively clean, neutral palette, and this is soothing to the eyes, at least for me.\n\nOverall, if I had to put it on a 10 scale, I'd go 8. I'd like to see more games like this in the future. Play it, if you haven't already.","September 13, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, it turns out to be a fun little ride while it lasts. It lacks the diversity of Skate or Die and the fluidity of Thrilla's Surfari, and most virtual skaters won't bother to figuratively catch 'em all like they would in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or Skate, because ultimately it does feel more like a running game successor than a skateboarding game.\n\nhttp://zbronpsn.blogspot.com/2014/08/steam-quickies-1.html","August 25, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kinda like a 2D Jet Set Radio. There's way less emphasis on ollying and grinding seems to be the key feature, this is pretty much all you do in the later levels. The camera angle is way too high, it's hard to see what's below you 80% of the time. You're going at high speed, you ollie and then you roll the dice whether it's something you can grind on or if it's something you need to press A to land. This is especially annoying when you're chaining together a combo and the game screws you over.\n\nOne thing that bothers me the most is that it feels kinda clunky, it might be something you have to get used to, but it throws me off every time. Every trick you do your feet have to be on your board first. Heelflip >land on board >land trick, laserflip >land on board >land trick etc. The speed that you go added with the pixel art also doesn't help as it's hard to tell if you're on the board and/or if you're close to the ground.\n\nIt's also got good things going for it. Chaining together combos perfectly is really satisfying, when you screw up you can press select to instantly restart giving it a "just one more go" kinda feel. There are quite a few tricks too, the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining some of it but you can do a lot of crazy stuff. I also like that you got to "press A" to land your moves, while it can be frustrating it's also to the games benefit as it feels really good when you land something complicated perfectly.\n\nOverall I recommend it, but buy it knowing that there are a few issues that need to be fixed.","August 29, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't like the landing system but I get why it is in there. It’s nice to see a game that rewards clean play, but I wish the controls felt more intuitive and were less picky about pressing ONLY THE EXACT DIRECTION when it also recommends a joystick. Something about bailing a grind when I am mashing a direction on the controller just because it was a little off axis gets very annoying. The worst part is that there is a really addicting game in here, like Hotline Miami, but the controls just aren’t as tight. Smoother spins, better key bindings (spin + special grind on the same key are no good), less picky controls (it is designed for the 360 controller after all) and this game would ACTUALLY earn its spot among the greats.

I'm a Tony Hawk and Skate veteran, having played all nine of the Tony Hawk games and the first two Skate games.  Skating games are some of my favorite games i've ever played, I grew up with them.  That being said, I was really excited to hear of a new skating game on the scene by the name of OlliOlli.\n\nHowever, what I finally got was the worst dissapointment i've ever seen.  The games controls are complete crap, with the game requiring you to jump thru hoops just to do extremely simple things.  The most egregious of these was the fact that I have to press the down button , AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME (WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE TIMING IN THIS GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD) JUST TO LAND A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OLLIE.  Now what exactly does this mean?  Well, that means you can have executed the most beutiful million point combo you've ever done, be real proud of yourself, but not press the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down button properly and fall on your ♥♥♥, losing all your points.\n\nThe jumps themselves are imprecise as hell, and the game has too many bugs to be playable.  I couldn't pass multiple objectives because bugs in the game prevented me from doing so.\n\nI could go on for pages about why this game is so bad, but I believe you get my drift here.

I'm a Tony Hawk and Skate veteran, having played all nine of the Tony Hawk games and the first two Skate games.  Skating games are some of my favorite games i've ever played, I grew up with them.  That being said, I was really excited to hear of a new skating game on the scene by the name of OlliOlli.\n\nHowever, what I finally got was the worst dissapointment i've ever seen.  The games controls are complete crap, with the game requiring you to jump thru hoops just to do extremely simple things.  The most egregious of these was the fact that I have to press the down button , AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME (WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE TIMING IN THIS GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BAD) JUST TO LAND A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OLLIE.  Now what exactly does this mean?  Well, that means you can have executed the most beutiful million point combo you've ever done, be real proud of yourself, but not press the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down button properly and fall on your ♥♥♥, losing all your points.\n\nThe jumps themselves are imprecise as hell, and the game has too many bugs to be playable.  I couldn't pass multiple objectives because bugs in the game prevented me from doing so.\n\nI could go on for pages about why this game is so bad, but I believe you get my drift here.  All skateboarding game fans STAY AWAY!  In fact, everyone should probably steer clear of this turd.","November 27, 2014","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other causes of crashes include holding a stick in a direction too long, flicking too fast (also often doesn't read the movement), falling through the ground (something that also happens every so often), and sometimes, getting an achievement. Speaking of achievements. you never know when you get them because the game requires you to turn off the steam window completely to work at all.

I love how it makes you time your landing for that extra challenge.\n\nThe menus can be a bit clunky but nothing unmanageable.\n\nMy biggest disappointment is the lack of Steam Cloud support. As a multi-platform game, I expect to be able to play on whatever platform I have in front of me. Sadly, my save data is stuck on one machine so I can't play Olli Olli as often as I would like. First world problems, huh.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this for Tony Hawks fans.

If you get easily frustrated from dying and restarting, then this game won't appeal to you.\n\nI love the music in this game, it's a great little sound track. The movement is fluid and getting a good run feels wonderfully cathartic.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about where my fun with this game stops. I don't mind a frustrating game but it has to be me that made the mistake, not the game. Too often, I had to restart because my skater glitched on a certain part of the track or near the end of a rail or just as he passed an obstacle. I was equally unimpressed when to stick a landing perfectly requires good timing but all too often it felt random as to how soon I needed to press the landing button...but that could just be me.\n\nSpeaking of landing buttons, herein lies one of my most frustrating problems with this game: the controls. When trick modifier and spin are the same button and I want to jump > spin > land with a modified grinding trick, all that happens is I keep spinning because I didn't leave enough of a pause between letting go and pressing the button.\nNext, if you want to jump, you have to press the trick input. It works but it would have felt better if there was a separate button for jumping, tricks and landing.\n\nLastly, I wanted to mention the level design. While the levels made good obstacle courses, I found it difficult to keep track of my skater on the final stage as a lot of the colours blur in together. I also had a problem with the Junkyard stage as most things were brown and all too often I wouldn't see an obstacle before it was too late.\n\nAll in all, I did have fun with this game but with a mixture of problems between controls and frustrating level design, I'll be designating this game to the bottom of my pile of games that I won't be playing again. Just one last objective before I complete it :)","May 2, 2015","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You’re not going to want to fall on your face either, as that will mean the end of your run. It’s up to you to groove and flip your way each course at breakneck speed without smashing your skull and getting sent back to the starting gate. Think Bit Trip Runner meets Tony Hawk.

I would have loved a more strait forward system with the face buttons being used for performing tricks rather than the Left Stick ala fighting game quarter circles (what?).\n\nVerdictThe game is fun take on the skateboarding plus auto runner genres. It has pretty awesome music, reasonably reponsive controls and a semi-complex trick system in which you use the left stick to perform tricks. In the end this game is not for me due the trick control scheme being used. The whole quarter cirlce movements for tricks feels overly complex for such a simple action.

It's an arcade-styled game that focuses on stringing together combos of skateboard tricks to grab the high score, and knockout different objectives. Levels become progressively more challenging, as do the objectives. There are several game modes including a "Daily Grind" to compete for global high scores each day, and multiple versions of each level that can be unlocked by completing all that levels objectives. There's no lack of content, for sure. The game play is entertaining and challenging - landing a long combo of crazy tricks perfectly is so satisfying, and ♥♥♥♥ing up can be terribly frustrating. Personally, I find the frustration and fun to be equally balanced in a way that makes the game addicting, but in short bursts. It's the kind of game I play for half an hour at a time because of a spontaneous desire to beat a high score or try one of the Daily Grinds. The only two negatives I can come up with are the keyboard controls are a kinda wonky (although the game clearly states it was designed for controller play) and the price tag is a little steep. But overall, I'd recommend OlliOlli.\n","May 21, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll pretty much play any skateboarding game since the EA skate games aren't on PC (thanks EA) but I was pleasantly surprised by how great the controls of Olli Olli are. The tricks feel very similar to their real life counterparts. For example, kickflips in real life are a flick off of your backside front of the nose, and in olli olli it's a flick to the right on the analog stick (which would be your backside if you ride goofy).\n\nThat and the variety of tricks are what keep me coming back. The courses are fun, but if feels a lot less like skating in the later levels. The first world is still my favorite.\n\nThe one possible con I've had so far is in the quality of the port. The game occasionally will have a runtime error and die on me for no real reason, and it's the only game I play that does it. But when it works, which is usually, it's a great game.\n","June 28, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's a few things I liked and didn't like.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n+The music is stylish and fits the game. -- The music really puts you in the mood and fits the graphical style of the game as well.\n\n+The controls are tight. -- Despite the learning curve, this game has some good controls and it's really satisfying to be rushing through a level [equivalent to the old sonic days!] and making your perfect landings.\n\n+The levels are the perfect size. -- This is definitely a perfect game to just sit down and play a few minutes here and there in between a busy day. The levels are broken up and focus more on getting high scores and achievements, so it does offer some replayability there if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n- The learning curve -- bit of a learning curve to get into it. While there is a very capable tutorial to mitigate this, this was still a bit of a hurdle.\n\nI definitely recommend you give this a try.","October 7, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would have loved a more strait forward system with the face buttons being used for performing tricks rather than the Left Stick ala fighting game quarter circles (what?).\n\nVerdictThe game is fun take on the skateboarding plus auto runner genres. It has pretty awesome music, reasonably reponsive controls and a semi-complex trick system in which you use the left stick to perform tricks. In the end this game is not for me due the trick control scheme being used. The whole quarter cirlce movements for tricks feels overly complex for such a simple action. Sadly I can't recommend this game due to the trick control system, while it has its audience it's not for me.","December 24, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an arcade-styled game that focuses on stringing together combos of skateboard tricks to grab the high score, and knockout different objectives. Levels become progressively more challenging, as do the objectives. There are several game modes including a "Daily Grind" to compete for global high scores each day, and multiple versions of each level that can be unlocked by completing all that levels objectives. There's no lack of content, for sure. The game play is entertaining and challenging - landing a long combo of crazy tricks perfectly is so satisfying, and ♥♥♥♥ing up can be terribly frustrating. Personally, I find the frustration and fun to be equally balanced in a way that makes the game addicting, but in short bursts. It's the kind of game I play for half an hour at a time because of a spontaneous desire to beat a high score or try one of the Daily Grinds. The only two negatives I can come up with are the keyboard controls are a kinda wonky (although the game clearly states it was designed for controller play) and the price tag is a little steep. But overall, I'd recommend OlliOlli.\n","May 21, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll pretty much play any skateboarding game since the EA skate games aren't on PC (thanks EA) but I was pleasantly surprised by how great the controls of Olli Olli are. The tricks feel very similar to their real life counterparts. For example, kickflips in real life are a flick off of your backside front of the nose, and in olli olli it's a flick to the right on the analog stick (which would be your backside if you ride goofy).\n\nThat and the variety of tricks are what keep me coming back. The courses are fun, but if feels a lot less like skating in the later levels. The first world is still my favorite.\n\nThe one possible con I've had so far is in the quality of the port. The game occasionally will have a runtime error and die on me for no real reason, and it's the only game I play that does it. But when it works, which is usually, it's a great game.\n","June 28, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then I laughed at myself because I relized I've been telling myself that exsact same thing for the last 30 min. The only reson I was able to get myself to stop was because I felt like I needed to write this review.\n\nThis game is very much a rage game. After every death I had, I felt a pit of anger in my stomach as I restarted the level, which quickly turned into motivation as I was grinding off rails.\n\nWhat I found most supprising was the fact that this was one of the only games in a long time that I found engaging enough to play without listening to a youtube video in the background.\n\nMy one problum with the game is that it feels like it take just slightly more time than comfertable to restart. It only takes like 2 secounds, but that can be a long time if you have some anger you need to defuse quickly.\n\nI will end by saying this game is not for everyone.

Being a big fan of 'simple-to-play-difficult-to-master' types of games, OlliOlli looked to be right up my alley. After trying many many times to control the character with keyboard or gamepad, I just couldn't get the hang of it. There are two things holding me back: 1) Viewing or anticipating what's coming next, 2) Timing.\n\nYes this is a timing game but if I can't see what's coming next I cannot anticipate when to jump. The game forces you to memorize and replay, rather than stick to reflexes and hand/eye control. I wish the camera was zoomed out 10-20%. Also the controls are pretty brutal when it comes to succesfully landing a grind, rotation, or landing. I wish it was just a tad more forgiving as crash landing a 10 trick run is mostly due to missing it by a nanosecond. For some this is just right, for me it's too harsh.","May 15","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
