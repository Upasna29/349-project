Not a fun open map like the game makers made it sound like. It also is not fun like dangerous hunts (COD style hunts).\nThis game is not for the person looking for an open map hunting expierience and is also not for the perosn wanting to play a dangerous hunts style game.\n0/10 starts.\n\n","December 31, 2014","false","12.9"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Deers were bugged out running into trees and getting stuck. The vehicles you only drive for a short period of time collecting flags/game cameras you don't actually use them to hunt. I only seen what 6 rifles able to purchase? not many at all plus you can't even add anything to them other then like one attatchment. I say overall this game is pretty bad compared to cabela's big game hunter","June 20, 2014","false","1.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The grafics are nice but there is no real hunting aspect to it. No calls, no stands and the gun selection could have more. If you’re looking to just go kill then this is the game, they will point you to the trophy. With games like Skyrim and GTA out there I wish they could make us a well-rounded hunting sim.","May 1, 2014","true","11.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

It's a terrible port, but once you get it loaded it is....mediocre at best. I don't know if the hit detection is too precise or too inaccurate, but either way you need to plan shots out. Also, don't just pick the gun you like the range of, you have to get a SPECIFIC gun in order to kill a SPECFIC creature set at a SPECIFIC distance so that you get a good trophy.

It's all the more heart breaking because at the start of the story his pet gets upset at him and runs away, forcing our protagonist to go searching for his dear friend.\n\nBravo. 11/10","February 15, 2014","true","5.5"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","8","22","5","0"
