You select from a list of characters and racing along various tracks, collecting power-ups to knock the other opponents off the track. There are 16 characters to select (some are unlockable) along with a bunch of power-ups to choose from. BlazeRush really excells in it's smooth controls and addictive gameplay. I wouldn't have expected this game to be as much as fun but it is awesome. BlazeRush features a full single player campaign and multiplayer. The online multiplayer works flawlessly as well and playing it with friends is outstanding. You battle constantly and the game allows for some amazing moments to happen, due to the fast pace of the races. There are three main game modes: Race (a traditional lap race), King of the Hill (Whoever stays in first the longest wins), and the cream of the crop - Death Race. Death Race is when you are speeding down the track, fighting other racers and avoiding a giant death machine. Whoever is the last to die, wins. If you'd like to see more on BlazeRush or see it in action, refer to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xMVB3gVoy8&list=UU4sgVJ3_gffatIN2x34TR2A","October 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","39","48","0","0"

The regular races where you need to finish first and try not to get destroyed by the enemy drivers, king of the hill where you try to stay in the lead for 50 seconds and a deathmatch where there's a steam roller behind you and you try to be the final person alive, a time trial mode where you need to finish a lap in a certain amount of time and there's a boss battle in the final mission where you need to use the weapons you used in the game to destroy the "Boss".\n\nEach of these events are very chaotic and they are incredibly difficult so don't expect to breeze through all the events. The enemy AI is violent and every chance they get they will take you out and trust me you need to play dirty to win.\n\nThe soundtrack is really great as well and is awesome to listen to when you are playing this game.\n\nThe graphics are alright for the most part, and I love the cell shaded look for the tracks.\n\nThe track designs range from mediocre to pretty good. Each track has certain points where you can jump out of the track if you use boosters, but those parts are marked on the map, but it's still sometimes frustrating.\n\nNow for the bad things for the game:\n\nThe one thing I hated was the fact that when you die you are set back so far back that there is almost no point in competing and the only solution is to restart.\n\nThe controls if you are using a keyboard takes a lot of time getting used to and I highly HIGHLY recommend using a controller.\n\nThe difficulty comes off as really difficult even in the early stages and not to mention the final act in the volcano planet has a massive difficulty spike and the final boss is quite tough, so be prepared for a challenge.\n\nThe camera is atrocious, it only follows the leading car at all times so if you are too far behind and too far ahead you will have to use the map to navigate the entire map.\n\nOverall BlazeRush is a really fun game and it's pretty difficult as well, while I don't think it's worth the full price, it's worth it if it's in a bundle or on a discount.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Worth checking out\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 23","true","8.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/302710/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The racing genre has retained its popularity after many years, but nowadays most titles offer the regular recipe of driving from a realistic perspective, using behind the car, cockpit, or "first-person" views. Even so, there are still those who prefer isometric experiences that hark back to the early days of the games industry.BlazeRush is an example of such a modernized experience, as developer Targem Games wants to offer an isometric racing game that's fun, fast, and balanced with a wide array of abilities and bonuses, not to mention varied vehicles with advantages and disadvantages.Even if most racing games nowadays abandon any semblance of a story, BlazeRush still has a single-player campaign that offers a bit of background on the game's universe, its characters, and more. It doesn't take itself seriously, thankfully, and just uses a bit of reasoning to promote a more eco-friendly message, not to mention one against evil corporations.Of course, one of the most important things in BlazeRush is the gameplay. The action takes place on different circuits across multiple environments. You race against a different number of opponents each time and the goal is to ensure you score trophies, which then unlock new stages and events.The actual racing mechanics feel pretty good, but it's important to note that you can only control your vehicle with the analog stick on the controller or the keyboard keys. There's no acceleration or braking, so it might take some time to get used to BlazeRush.Things get a bit more complex as you progress through the campaign, as the circuits are filled with portions that don't have any guard rails, not to mention tight corners and ramps that, when taken with extra speed, can propel you outside the track's bounds.Besides the intense racing experience, the game also features different weapons and speed bonuses that drop onto the circuit from above in a chaotic manner. The weapons range from a minigun to a sawblade launcher, a guided missile, a goo ball that can slow your ride, and much more.The game also drops behind the leader crates with speed bonuses. These range from a lengthy but moderate speed increase to rocket tubes that provide short but powerful boosts, fans that work when you don't make sudden turns, and other such things.In terms of race types, there are quite a few interesting ones. Of course, as always, there are lap-based events where crossing the finish line first is the only thing that matters. There are also King of the Hill-type races where you need to stay in front of the pack for a total of 50 seconds. The most hectic, however, is the Death Race type, in which a giant steamroller barrels down the track towards the competing cars.Many crazy trophies are awarded at the end of the race for all sorts of feats you manage during the actual event. From seizing or losing victory in the final meters to unleashing crazy weapons and perfect boosts, they are rewarded with hilarious mentions.Vehicle variety is pretty solid, with each car/ship boasting three core stats, in the form of mass, acceleration, and handling.While BlazeRush manages to deliver a solid racing experience, it does get a bit frustrating when you're stuck in the back of the pack, as the game teleports you in order to keep up with others. This can get confusing quite fast. It also doesn't do that good of a job when it comes to highlighting your own vehicle. If the cars are grouped up and the same model is used by an AI, you can easily lose sight of your ride.BlazeRush looks decent but it's clear that Targem emphasizes framerate over pretty graphics. The game maintains a really fast framerate at all times, no matter how hectic the action might get. The cars and the tracks also look pretty good but the surrounding environments aren't that impressive.The soundtrack is instrumental only and features quite a bit of dubstep, house, or techno tracks. It matches the action on the screen quite well, so you'll certainly enjoy it.BlazeRush is a really fun isometric arcade racing experience that manages to deliver explosive action, imaginative weapons, and balanced speed boosts to create an addictive flow","January 23, 2015","true","14.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","5"

Some have better physics or realistic tracks, some have more versatile and adaptable camera angles, and some have better soundtracks.\n\nBut “BlazeRush” has a remarkable combination of variety of tracks, outrageous quantity of awards (and a great points system), and just LOTS of quick, repeatable fun with a wide choice of cars to make every race as different as one might wish. I don’t know about multiplayer yet, but I suspect that’s where “BlazeRush” really shines. But what I love? The really cool achievements, a third of which are cumulative. This type of short race game can become a bit tedious, but with so much variety as to cars, weapons, tracks, physics (such as different planets), this won’t happen any time soon. Currently I have about a dozen tracks that I’ve managed to unlock that I haven’t had time to even examine yet. And numerous untried cars as well.\n\nAs a player with a “bad” left hand, I generally have to be cautious when I buy any driving game (especially expensive ones.) No problem here, except for hand fatigue, as with any controller (or keyboard) game requiring both hands to play. The controls work very well, even when they’re not meant to (as in certain types of tracks or deliberate cool physics gimmicks.) The menus are simple, yet adequate and seem to be anything a player might ask for. Graphics aren’t exactly Earth-shaking, but are in no way lacking. Really, my only issue so far is that the camera seems to follow the lead cars, and a trailing driver may find themself off the screen entirely. (But unlikely for more than a few seconds.) A car leaving the track entirely will find themselves returned, but at a small loss to position.\n\nI’ll make every attempt to come back when I have more to say, but if you have REMARKABLY little to spend (for a few more days, at least), I think most people will be very happy adding “BlazeRush” to their collection of FUN OTT racing games.\n\nThank you.","January 1","true","1.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/302710/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Local co-op, check. Local co-op + can play online, check. Immersive and exciting game, check. Blaze rush is an action racing thriller designed to test your Mario Kart capabilities from an angled top down view. For something so simple, the game is ensured to keep you coming back to play again and again.\n\nBlazeRush is a violent racing game with extremely simplistic racing controls. There is no specific button to break as acceleration is achieved by moving the left joystick in the direction you'd like to go. There is an arrow drawn to indicate which way you are pointing the joystick. Three main attributes are given to the vehicles which are mass, acceleration, and handle-ability. The three are self explanatory but depending on how you like to play (dangerous vs pre-cautious) will determine which vehicle you choose. Each vehicle is made with a different purpose.  Some are tank like and slow, but are heavy and hard to knock around. Some are hover vehicles and are quite fast, but fly easily when they get hit. The hover vehicles feel like the dominant ones to me but I have noticed online four wheelers are the go to choice. Once you choose a vehicle, it's time to choose a race type. In King of the Hill, the winning player simply has to hold the lead. Deathmatch requires you to be first again however there is a giant steam rolling chasing behind you. Fail to keep up or stay ahead and you'll soon be squashed. This game mode is the best one in my opinion as it's last person standing. The last game mode is racing, where obviously the goal is to come first at the end of doing a set amount of laps. Players are able to choose game type and map when starting a game and after completing a game. This sort of UI keeps everything running smooth jumping from event to event.\n\nPlaying local co-op mixed in with a few people from online adds another dimension to the game AI's couldn't do. It is extremely funny to come across different play styles of gamers that race online. None the less though, I've seen the AI's take some crazy risks that I would consider absurd. Usually, they play it safe by toeing the line but I've caught a few AI's trying to jump ramps and even over turns to beat me. There aren't numerous power ups like Mario Kart but the essential ones feel there. There are two main power up types, nitro based and weapon based. Nitro based are different as some will provide quick acceleration for a short period of time while some are gradual acceleration over a longer period of time. Weapons come in the form of bioacid that slows the player down, a Star Wars looking plate dish push force, machine gun that fires numerous times, a homing missile that slowly closes in on the target in front of you, and a saw blade that spins vehicles out of control. Power up drops are consistent throughout events.\n\nGraphics and design are completely suitable to the atmosphere and game play surrounding BlazeRush. The tires bounce appropriately and the collisions feel excellent. Only complaint is when turning into someone at the start, it doesn't feel as though you can steer them off course by pushing them. It does work when the game picks up and the speeds are different but can feel awkward when first starting a race. Explosions are well done and re spawn graphics and times are excellent. There is even a horn that sounds in deathmatch when the steam roller begins it's speed tirade. Sounds are graphics deliver exactly what they are meant to bring, excitement and suspense when spinning out of control.\n\nI would highly recommend this game on everyone's library, for a good sale price of course :). For the full price I bought four copies of the games, so may not be a bad idea to wait. The fact that you can play local co-op and play online simply shows these guys care. Even if you don't have a buddy to play with, the single player campaign will satisfy your one player needs before jumping online to cause some havoc. Everything seems like it was done right here and done with proper attention and care.\n\nFor future development perhaps add more weapons and game modes? Maybe even add something that disrupts the terrain? There are some cool maps that were designed, would be nice to maybe integrate them with the attacks.\n\n\n\nIndie Rating : 8.8/10\n\n\nRATING : 7.65/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B+	Overall 	B\n\nScreenShots\nDifferent game modes and screen before playing the next race.

The player with a blue circle around them is being transported closer to the group as he is too far back and the other guy who has fire coming out of his engine, well he got blown up while the other guy is speeding away with nitro\n\nWhat career mode looks like\n\n6 player online madness\n\nThere were 3 in my party and 3 others already playing a game in which we jumped in\n\nSmall obstructions or gaps will appear in some levels\n\nSeriously fix the track","June 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonder/recommended/302710/","bonder","Bonder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonder/","2204 products in account","I have a lot of these "mini racers" or "top down racers" now, both combat (Burning Cars, Death Rally) and non-combat (Bang Bang Racing, MiniMotor EVO, Little Racers Street, Real World Racing), and while I have only gotten into a few of them, I think I have seen enough of Blazerush to say that it's the best one on Steam.\n\n\nThe controls feel spot-on from the moment you begin, and they even feel pretty good with the keyboard. Works well with Xbox360 controller, does not work with directinput gamepad. Acceleration with the 360 controller is "push in the direction to move" instead of say a throttle trigger or button, which felt odd at first, but I quickly grew to like it.\n\nThere are a lot of cars to choose from, all with a cool sort of Micromachines-meets-MadMax type of style. They have only 3 attributes each (acceleration, mass, and handling) but some feel different based on their wheel config (two or 4 wheels, tracked, hover, etc).\nThere seems to be plenty of tracks to unlock, with quite a few different themes, but maybe too many of them have the same "wasteland" feel to them.  I know it's supposed to be that way, but it actually makes some of the tracks too similar. Amazon and the snow ones are nice standouts.\n\nThe main drawback to the game as I have seen (only a few hours played so far) is the lack of upgrades & customization for the vehicles - there are none. No skins, no engine or weapon upgrades to buy, no garage to manage, the only thing to do in this game is pick a car and race. Not a big deal but it is a bit one-dimensional.\n\nThe game could definitely use more weapons as well,  so far have autogun, saw, missle, slime, & sonic; perhaps I haven't unlocked them all yet, but I havent seen any others in any screenshots.\nIn quite a few ways this game reminded me of Cel Damage, with the wild comebacks and last-second heroics, or knowing you were blasted off the track to oblivion but getting in that last perfectly-aimed kill as you fall down a cliff. It could have taken another page from Cel Damage by including more weapons, and my number one request would be a mode where you choose exactly which powerups are available in a given skirmish race. In other words, maybe you feel like all rocket boosters and buzz saws, so you could make it so only those populate in that race.\n\nThe game runs at like 300 frames per second, which ran too hot for my gpu, but it has it's own FPS limiter in the options*, so I won't have to remember to change my fps limit manually on my gpu every time I play. Nice!\n*for some reason when I limit the game to 120 fps, it runs at 111 fps. When I had used my gpu's limiter, I ran at 90 fps and it ran 90, idk why the in-game limiter runs different but it doesnt matter much).\n\nThe one time I went to play multiplayer, it was a lot of fun but only one round was going on, with about 6-8 people playing. It was a little bit laggy but very fun.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy this game, and the mix of challenge vs casual fun seems about right. A good choice if you are looking for a top down mini racer, even without a sale price.","February 15, 2015","true","11.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I used to play Rock'N Roll Racing and Radical Psycho Machines back on the SNES. This is the same style game and it is still a blast to play.\n\nGameplay: I use an 360 controller. You can pick up and play right away. Controls are easy and response is great. After that you just race and blast the other drivers. There are different game modes, so far I love the race with the giant spiked roller that crushes you if you fall behind.\n\nGraphics: nothing crazy realistic but it is not a realistic kind of game. They look just fine and work well for this arcade style game.\n\nMusic: I'm a bit biased here as I loved Rock'N Roll Racing back in the day and part of that was the great tunes. I don't really notice the music in this game. I will generally mute it and run a play list of classic songs that sound good on the road.\n\nMultiplayer: There is online play but not many games available. I think this game thrives on local play.

Quite possibly, this game is the best of it's kind in the genre.\n\nYou can play up to 8 players or bots and there's 16 different vehicles to choose from, each with their unique abilities and stats. There is also a Career Mode where you play the different game modes against bots in different difficulties to earn medals, awards and you can even unlock new vehicles.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThere's multiple fun gamemodes such as Death Match, Normal Lap Race and King of The Hill. There's also a good amount of modifiers like Power Ups and Speed Boosts which are a ton of fun too.\n\nNow, the time I've spent playing this game so far is the most fun I've ever had with a multiplayer arcade game since my early childhood! It's chaotic, fast and action-packed gameplay keeps you hooked, especially if you play with your friends. When playing with my friends we find ourselves continously gagging with laughter during every match we played. The amount of hilarious wipeouts and tricks you can pull off is awesome and the biggest selling point of the game for me.\n\n\nCons:\n\nI don't think there are any cons at all to be honest. None that I have found.\n\n\nI strongly recommend this game for you gamers that are looking for a really fun experience with freinds. And if you're a fan of top down kart racing games, this is a must buy!

The car models and tracks are detailed and nicely stylised, while the explosions and smoke effects are just stunning. I feel very immersed in VR and it worked perfectly first time and without any tinkering.\n\nThe controls, physics and handling have clearly been refined a lot during development as they are spot on. The music is OK, but could do with a bit more variety. The tracks are fine but I would like to see some more creative designs and / or a level editor in the future.\n\nMultiplayer is great but there doesn't seem to be too many people playing online at the moment. I've only managed to play online twice (probably 20 odd races in total) but everything was smooth and incredibly addictive.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone with a DK2 as it is a fantastic experience in VR and the developer deserves a lot of praise and support for their efforts!","January 3, 2015","true","10.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/302710/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionBlazeRush is a third-person perspective, arcade racer that combines simple controls with brilliant physics resulting in one hell of a good time. This is the type of game that you may look at and ignore, or you obtain it somehow and let it sit in your library. Well let me just say that BlazeRush is worth your time and money, here's why.\n\nGameplayBlazeRush is a primarily single-stick controlled game with power-ups. Think of Mario Kart but at a fixed camera angle and without any real complex driving mechanics whatsoever. Simply point the controller stick in the direction you wish to go, and your vehicle will go in that direction (also indicated by an arrow at the front of the vehicle). I'll say it now that this game requires a controller for precision; I would not recommend using KB+M for it. Now, you may not be into that sort of thing, that's fine. However, neither am I, yet this game managed to actually capture my attention on multiple occasions.\n\nPower-ups\nThanks to power-ups, it turns a pretty standard game into one hell of an explosive, speed-fest. From rocket boosts, to actual (semi) heat-seeking rockets, racing and combat collide in a desperate struggle for first-place. Just as power-ups make Mario Kart highly entertaining, power-ups are absolutely amazing in BlazeRush. The system for obtaining them is also a bit unique. Items simply fall from the sky at random, and people can drive into them to collect them. They fall a lot more frequently for the people further behind the leaders but leaders can continue to collect items that they may need in the future to maintain that lead.\n\nCatch-up\nNow due to the fixed camera angle, obviously some cars may fall too far behind and then no longer be visible. As a result, there is an automatic catch-up system in the game. Fall too far behind and the game will automatically move you close enough to the rest of the racers without giving you any advantages. The system here feels fluid and balanced and never takes away from the flow of the game.\n\nVehicles\nEach type of vehicle has their own strengths and weaknesses. Tank-type vehicles will do excellently on cornering, but drifting is horrible on them, and their top speed is pretty limited. Racing-type vehicles are great at speed in all aspects, and can drift, but their handling is pretty weak and can easily be pushed out of the stage with various weapons. Flying-type vehicles are a bit balanced in most aspects but don't expect them to shine in any particular aspect.\n\nCampaign\nThe campaign is one of the best ways to actually get into this game. Levels progress in difficulty slowly, introducing you to different environments, weapons, vehicles and power-ups. The AI provides a healthy challenge while not being too over-the-top or rage inducing.\n\nVisualsThe graphics of BlazeRush are well designed and attractive, combining a semi-cartoony look with over-the-top explosions for an insanely fun experience.\n\nAudioVehicle sounds, weapons, power-ups and other elements of the game sound very good and really give the right effect at the right time. The soundtrack is fairly well varied and entertaining. For an arcade game such as this, it felt right at home.\n\nSummary & ConclusionI didn't expect much from BlazeRush but after playing it on so many occasions I have to admit it is quite fun and addicting. It's even more so playing with other people, but the campaign is highly challenging and worth playing too. I'm quite impressed that this game has captivated my interest this much and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes arcade racers in general.\n\n8/10 - Friendships will be destroyed this day\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The graphics are nice and, once I got used to the odd scheme, the controls work well. But it never felt exciting to race. There's no sensation of speed, and the catch up mechanic to keep everyone in the race creates a disincentive to put in any real effort until the last section of the final lap. Possibly fun if you have IRL friends to play with, but even then it'd likely only be entertaining in very short bursts.","February 5, 2015","false","2.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","2"

You can either play offline with bots or even splitscreen with up to four friends. Or play online multiplayer with 8 others around the world! This game brings back the true arcade racing experience but still feels very unique. This reminds me a lot of Rock n' Roll Racing. Where you and 3 other racers battle it out to achieve victory. There's 3 gamemodes on BlazeRush; Race, which you go around the track and fight your way to first place. King of The Hill, where the winner is the person who's stayed in first place the longest (50 seconds). And last but not least, Death Race, where you and others fight to be the last alive, while a giant combiner is behind the track destroying anyone who is in last place.\nThe game runs very smooth. My PC specs are not relatively made for gaming, but I get no frame loss. Even when there's 8 people shooting each other with rockets in a chaotic manner.\nOne of the cons I found is the lack of people actually playing the game online. Which is a total let down because this game will never get old when it comes to playing with friends and sharing some laughs. I just can't seem to find anyone online.\nI hope more people buy this game. For such a cheap price of $10. This game is definitely worth it!","November 17, 2014","true","42.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's a fast-action party racing game, mixed equally between Micromachines and Rock'n'roll racing. Did I just mention two of the most beloved fun racing games of the 90' ?\n\nYou race on about 15-20 tracks using different weapons and boost to slow down your opponents. There is a single player mode, but it's not where Blazerush shines. It's by pluging 4 controllers (or up to 8 if you're playing online) than the real fun begins. There are 3 race modes : Race, King of the hill and Death race. Race is a classical, not so interesting mode. In King of the hill, as you might guess, you need to stay first a givin amount of time to win. The best mode in my opinion is Death race, where you're chased by a giant tank that will destroy you if you linger to much behind. You're forced to go forward, but being too much forward leaves you at the mercy of your opponents.\n\nThere are 16 vehicles available with different statistics (Top speed is the same for everyone) : Acceleration, weight, control. You will find 5-6 different weapons et 3 types of boosts. One good point is that each enhancement is displayed on the car, which permits you to see immediatly if your opponent has a dangerous weapon without looking at the HUD.\n\nPros\nGood controls\nA variety of vehicles, but quite balanced\nMany weapons, but no mario blue shell. Each weapon is deadly, but you can react to them.\nEasy to join a game : Plug a controller, press start, your car appears immediatly.\nDecent netcode for online games\nFUN !\nCons\nNot enough players online...\nSince we bought that game in january, we play almost every lunch break. it's a really underrated game.

The balance is just right to reward skill but to also allow a little luck to pop in now and then.  The game supports both single-player and mutli-player.  And it does not short change the single-player mode as it contains many maps/levels and includes a final boss battle.\n\nThe controls are slick and the motion could be described as having exaggerated physics.  Note that some people in the reviews here have complained about the controls as the car moves in the direction you point your controller which is not standard in overhead race games.  It took me a few races to get used to it and then it felt quite natural.  Another popular complaint from reviewers is that when your car falls too far behind or goes off the track, the game advances your car to the end of the pack.  Some do not like this "catch up" feature but I find this feature keeps the race exciting.\n\nThere are three race modes -- normal, leader of the pack, and out run the grinder.  Leader of the pack requires a racer to be in the front for a total of 50 seconds.  Out running the grinder is my favorite as it involves a giant grinding machine chasing the racers.  This mode will keep you on the edge of your seat as an unstoppable monster nips at your bumper.  All three race modes have random power-ups that fall onto the track such as weapons and speed boosts.  The speeds boosts though only fall to the car not in first place thus once again causing exciting lead changes in this game.\n\nGet this game if you enjoy the fun of back-and-forth battle-oriented races.

The multiplayer is extremely fun (up to 8 players online at once!) , with regular races, king of the hill (trying to stay in the lead the longest) and death races (keep up with the group or the grinder will destroy you! )  We played while on vent, and were just laughing and yelling the entire time.  The only thing that you have to adjust to is the perspective from which you race - instead of looking at your car from behind, you get a track side view and steer based on that.  If someone falls behind it bumps them forward so the camera doesn't have to zoom out too much.    There are random buffs that drop - and literally drop - (boosts or weapons) to help you catch up or stay ahead. What's really awesome is that you can play online multiplayer, while also having multiple people playing from the same machine.  Just plug in more remotes!  And you don't even have to worry about split screen - because everyone that is racing (whether they're looking at the same screen as you or not) sees the same thing.     I have NOT tried playing with the keyboard, nor would I recommend it, as I do with all racing games.","October 31, 2014","true","34.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There's no sense of speed or momentum. You just simply point the analog stick in the direction you want to go (there are no separate buttons for accelerating and braking). Also, the horrible catch up mechanic ruins the competitiveness of the game. There's no point in trying to lead the race until the last section of the final lap.

This is such a fun and simple game. The controls are really easy to learn, since you only have to steer, shoot, and use a nitro boost. The gameplay isn't exactly the most original in the world, but it takes all of your favorite tabletop racing games from the past and adds a ton of polish, solid controls, and plenty of fun modes to choose from.\n\nIf you have ever played Mashed (Drive to Survive), Micro Machines, Rock n' Roll Racing, RC Pro AM, or anything similar, then you will feel right at home. Using an Oculus Rift with this is so good it gives you an advantage, since you can look around the track to see upcoming turns and threats more easily. When playing in VR, it makes you feel like you are playing with remote control cars and sitting right next to the track. VR doesn't have to be in first person, and this is an awesome example of how anything can work with it.\n\nMy only gripe is the compatibility with Oculus Rift is a tad clunky to configure. You have to set the Oculus Rift to "Extended Mode" in your settings and set your headset as "primary display" in your Windows display setting. Once you do that you will be good to go. Definitely pick this up if you get a chance, this game is a blast to play online and it even supports local multiplayer.","June 14, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The main goal in BlazeRush is to get 1st place like in most racing games. Yet, the main focus (and the fun) of the game relies entirely on the destruction of your opponents. All players share the same camera view and the player field is forced to be in this area of view, which leads to a always dense player field with nonstop action. If you fall behind too much, then you will be always teleported to the end of the current camera view. You can reach place 1 from the last place in seconds and the other way around. This way no one can be lapped, but this could be a no-go for any serious die-hard racer. It was a good design decision in my opinion, because it allows the game to shine with its main focus and strength: the battles. And yeah, you will yell, you will curse and you will laugh like a devil.\n\nCurrently there are 3 gamemodes:\n1.) Death Race: All players fight for their survival while being hunted by a huge steamroller. The last survivor will get the most points and the first victim the least. This will go on for several rounds, until someone has reached a fixed number of score points.\n\n2.) King of the Hill: Only the leading player will gain one point per second. Whoever gains 50 points at first will win. You will respawn, if you die.\n\n3.) Race: 3 laps, first one will win. You will respawn, if you die.\n\n\nPro:\nvery easy and simple controls [keyboard: you navigate your vehicle left and right with your arrow keys/controller: you navigate your vehicle via holding the analog stick in the desired direction (some people don't like it, but I find it even better than the keyboard navigation)]\nnonstop action\ngreat party game\n16 unique vehicles\nvehicles are pretty balanced, all have their pros and cons\nthe vehicle transformations are great\ngood visual effects\nfitting music\nright amount and variety of PowerUps, not too less and not too many\nfunny achievements and ingame medals\nAI isn't as good as human players, but does a great job and provides fun\ndouble fun with friends\n4 player local coop\nyou can join online multiplayer tournaments up to 8 players with your 4 local players!\nonline multiplayer runs smoothly in general\nyou can hop in already running matches and simply replace a bot\nvote function for the next map and gamemode\ntons of evil attacks, evil laughter, WTF-moments and boom boom\neven a failure can be so enjoyable\n\nNeutral:\nthe visual effects can be excessive for sensible eyes\nplayer colour is defined by the order of connecting people [host is always red, the second connected player is always green and so on]\n\nContra:\nyou can easily loose the overview from time to time in 8 player matches\nonly 3 gamemodes [2 more would be appropriate for more variety]\nonly 6 (correct me if I'm wrong) maps [3-5 more would be appropriate for more variety]\nsteam workshop support would be a great addition to solve the kinda low variety problem\n\nConclusion:\nBlazeRush can be a pretty good party game, if you have friends around. It's really easy to learn and it's so much fun to wreck someone in the right moment. Victory or failure doesn't matter that much, it's enough to hear your friend yelling, when you kick him/her off the the track, to conjure a evil smile into your face. You can even take your friends into online matches to double the fun. This game could be a straight 9 or 10 out of 10, but the small map and gamemode variety harms the overall great impression a lot, because it ruins longer gaming sessions, if you have to see the same tracks again and again (it's still fun though). What a pity! Nevertheless really recommendable.\n\n7/10\n\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

I actually enjoyed it more than Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed.\n\nBasically you are racing through all these sweet-looking places, with 3-7 other cars, while frantically collecting weapon and boost powerups and mowing down everyone in your way.\n\n1 of the key mechanics of the game, that I've never thought I would enjoy, but I actually really do, is that you are never ever truly safe in front. Boost powerups would be constantly be dropped for the trailing racers, and if you fall back too much/get destroyed, you would be automatically be teleported forward a bit after a few seconds.\n\nSo this translates into such a chaotic mess of a race in which you have to gun down the guy in front and evade that heat-seeking missile with quick zig-zags and body-block the car directly behind you and nudge the car beside you into the cliffs and oh ♥♥♥♥ you just run into your own bouncing saw it's crazy.\n\nGraphics are good. Physics are good. Hell, even the AI is good, knowing precisely when and where to shoot you so that you're chucked down into the abyss as you round that corner. I actually enjoy watching AI racing against each other, which is a first in racing games for me.\n\nThe single-player career mode is quite meaty, in which you are introduced to new game modes/weapons/boosts stage by stage, which I clock at about 25 hours to finish due to the trophy system. Then there's the party mode, in which you can play multiplayer locally vs human/bots, or online. Unfortunately there are too few actual players at the moment, which is a shame, since I really enjoyed the local multiplayer.\n\nAnyway, if you end up getting it, the first thing you should do is go into Options and change the Video -> Camera tracks -> Local Players only. Trust me, it's better this way.\n\nTLDR: Blazerush > Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed.

Add in medals and challenges for difficult maneuvers, and it's addicting.  Good stuff.","January 20, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a pretty a good collection of VR titles both on Steam and on Oculus Home and I keep coming back to this one.  Ignore the playtime here as I play exclusively on Oculus Home thanks to the generosity of the developers who provided an OH key.\n\nAt first blush it might appear to be a cute 3rd person racing game like Toybox Turbos but the more I play this, the more I am blown away.  It wasn't until I played the online multiplayer and then went back to single player that I realized how good the AI really is. Actually I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best AI implementations I've ever seen in a video game!\n\nThe graphics are great, the VR implementation and camera works surprisingly well.  Above all the game play is surprising deep and the selection of the right vehicle for the right track and game mode is fairly important although with skill you can use different vehicles for different styes of game play.  Even this is not a complicated process and will just come to you as you progress.\n\nOverall, especially for the price point, I would consider this a 'must have' VR title.  Now if someone * ahem cough cough * would release a first person perspective I would truly be in VR heaven !!","May 10","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing missing are car upgrades, but there's more than enough characters to choose from. Also a load of new race modes like king of the hill and my all time favourite race mode in any racing game: Death Race where racers strive to score 15 points while constantly chased by  a spiked steamroller of death. With 5 points awarded for being the last one to survive the madness that ensues trying to stay alive is just epic. King of the hill is a similarly chaos-filled adrenaline rush trying to be the first to stay in the lead for 50 seconds.\n\nBrilliant aracde-fun racer with the added bonus of 4-player local multi-player!

This game actually takes a fair amount of skill.\n✓ Extremely well-polished graphics. The art style is somewhere between Awesomenauts and 1950's comix.\n✓ Physics are just cartoony enough to add to the fun, but realistic enough that it doesn't feel like the game is cheating.\n\nLinux Pros:\n✓ Excellent controller support. Looking forward to seeing this coming to Steam Machines.\n✓ Well-adapted to Linux. Didn't have to do anything special to get this to run "out of the box."\n✓ Didn't experience any performance issues under Linux, not that this game is overly graphics-intensive.\n\nOther Pros:\n✓ Kid-friendly (mileage may vary online)\n\nThis isn't your typical racing game. It's really only a racing game on the surface; most of the gameplay is centered around pushing your opponents off the track with machine guns, flying saw blades, and explosives. Watching your opponent who was in first place blow up and get pushed to dead last is an immensely satisfying experience.\n\n[More to come]","February 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's all up to luck, especially when the camera doesn't show the track in front of you so you have to pretty much guess what will be next (unless you know the track by heart).\nYou'll get even more annoyed when you are in the lead and got shot by undodgeable ammo and then boom, back to last standing. Hell, you can't even be in the lead for long, cause there are tons of nitros on the map so the bots will easily takeover.\nHow more annoying it could get?\nOh, wait, I thought the game had DK2 support. It does, but only for Windows users. Wow.\nI've played it 2.5h so far and I won't be playing anymore - I want to play video games to relax, not to be annoyed when after being in the lead for the whole race you get shot and out of the track. I wish I could get a refund.","January 10, 2015","false","2.3"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

The camera keeps zooming in and out depending on where YOU are.  It keep trying to keep the entire group of racers in view so if they are far apart between 1st place and 8th place, the camera zooms out, and it's hard to see at that point, especially if you are #8.\n\n2. Since the game wants to keep all 8 cars in view, and can only zoom out so much, it has this mechanic in which it bubble warp your car up if it falls too much behind.  This reminds me of a very old racing game called Motoroader back on the TurboGrafx 16, except the mechanic works there as there is no zooming in and out randomly on the screen.  And sometimes if you are turning a corner when it happen it just bounce you off the track all together.\n\n3. The controls on the keyboard and on the game pad is totally different.\nKeyboard - you use left and right to turn the car like most racing game\nGamepad - your car Go towards the Direction you are Pointing to, which I don't like at all.  Wish there is a way to make it more like the keyboard controls.\n\n4. Can't remap the controls\n\n5. Power pickups gets knocked away if you already have one picked up and unused.  Which is great for the cars up front but horrible for the cars in the back.  it's hard enough to pickup anything when there is nothing since the cars infront of you grabbed them from you, but even if they can't use it, they still pushes them out of the way so you can't keep up in the same lines as them and hope to pick up the items.  Maybe make it so the cars that can't pick up anything just runs thru the power-ups instead of hitting them and knocking them away.\n\n","October 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 17 of 45 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","17","45","0","1"

The mechanics constantly and incessantly interfere with your ability to drive. The developers have mistaken annoyance for viable gameplay, this wont hold anyone's attention for long. There are much better and cheaper examples of this kind of game.\n\nI saw the word "accessable" touted around in the marketing materials for this game. The truth is that there is extremely little to this game and what there is is overly simple and unapologetically repetitive.\n\nSure it has that "can't stop playing" vibe... for about an hour, then the gameply becomes mindnumbing and you realize that you're executing the exact same meaningless actions over and over again and no matter how prettily it's been dressed up they cant hide how quickly this piece of fluff loses it's appeal.\n\nIt is offensively mediocre and feels like a made for profit game.","October 30, 2014","false","5.8"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","7","25","0","0"

I'm so impressed!\n\nThe VR support is superb, right from the get-go, it's dynamic and immersive. A few times I found myself flying through an over-track sign, but I suspect I was probably too close to the head tracking unit - you want to be sat back about 6ft with this for best effect! (Controller recommended therefore!) Having the ability to chose where you look on the track is an amazing benefit (and experience!), as when playing in non-VR, you sometimes find your FOV a bit limiting when you're leading the pack. Being able to sit forward a bit or look around other cars for the best view of your own car and/or the track is just bonkers. Not to mention the machine gun fire and rockets flying around :D\n\nEven in non-VR on a SteamOS (Read: Ubuntu with Steam on it) machine it runs flawlessly - A lowly Intel Pentium G620 and an AMD R7 250 (1GB) is more than sufficient to play this at decent frame rates at 1080p - which looks beautiful on my TV!\n\nGreat job Devs!","April 9, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got fairly solid gameplay for its type, about 4 different racing modes. Definitely feels like a micro machines game, in a really good way.\n\nLike any kart racer, the game can be chaotic, and when it doesn't go your way, it can be very frustrating. When it does go your way, you feel awesome pulling out of the explosions unscathed. The game has a good balance of this and a skillful player can get through most challenges, though sometimes it can feel as if your opponents are snatching all the powerups.\n\nThe strength of this game is the death tractor races, which periodically eliminate the racer in last over several rounds. You can have a lot of fun boosting just out of the tractor's reach, and timing your shots perfectly to put an opponent behind you for the one moment the tractor appears.\n\nHowever, the other game modes were not fun for me. In one game mode, you must be the leader for 50 seconds. Seems fair, right? But for some reason, in this mode, it always seems like one AI is a lot harder than the others, and pulls ahead quickly. Then you can never reach him because your stuck behind the other ones who all seem out to stop you from winning. The only way to win this mode is to get ahead immediately and dodge all their shots.\n\nAll in all, its a fun, short, kart racing game. If you're interested, this game will deliver for you.","March 11, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The camera view is perfect for most of the time. (Just a few moment when the crusher drives through your head. And the odd moment when you cant view your car ahead) However the game play is very addictive and the car models are nicely detailed.\nOne of the few games in VR where I can spend a significant amount of time being comfortable and having fun without any sort of Rift Sickness pending.\nGreat work.","January 17, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
