"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/206420/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Saint's Row IVDeveloper: Volition\nPublisher: Deep Silver\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nIn the first thirty minutes of Saints Row IV, you’ll shot your way through a military base before disarming a nuclear bomb in flight, which wins the hearts of the nation and the presidency of the United States. You’ll sign off on a cure for cancer or end world hunger, and fend off an alien attack with a turret gun on the White House lawn. It’s immediately clear that Saints Row has finally abandoned any of the pretence at gritty underworld realism that was so at odds with the slapstick of previous games in the series. This is the game that finally provides an appropriate thematic context for Saints Row’s mechanics, one that sees the Steelport Saints emerge from Grand Theft Auto’s shadow once and for all.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nIn Saints Row IV, you once again take on the role of the leader of the Saints, a now globally recognised gang. The good times don’t last long though, as humanity’s worst fears are realised when an evil alien race known as the Zin invades Earth. You and the other members of the Saints are held hostage in a simulated version of Steelport. With the help of your hacker friends Kinzie and Matt, and combat backup from the rest of the crew - including Vice President Keith David - you must disrupt the system enough to break free and hopefully save the human race.\n\nThe game plays much the same as Saints Row: The Third. You control a customizable Boss of the Saints through a variety of missions and tasks in the simulation in an attempt to disrupt it and do some damage, enough to save your crew and escape. Ultimately culminating with a final showdown against the Emperor of the Zin Empire, you will meet some new faces along the way and even some from past games in the series (Sorry, not spoiling it for you)!\n\nThe main features of Saints Row IV are the superpowers. As you progress the story, you'll unlock several overpowered abilities that are designed to help you in your quest to dominate the simulation. Super Sprint allows you to travel faster than any car ever could, and combined with Super Jump you can clear multiple city blocks in a matter of seconds. You have a limited stamina bar, but it isn’t long before it becomes irrelevant. At that point you can leap around to your heart’s content. You also get access to telekinesis, elemental energy blasts, and even a Super Stomp which, when fully upgraded, hits with the power of a nuke, clearing an entire block! These powers are a fresh new addition that can be used for even more zany antics around the Steelport simulation.\n\nYour menu is where you'll be spending your hard earned cash (cache) and clusters to upgrade your abilities and superpowers. Honestly, you will spend several hours just jumping around the simulation collecting these clusters. Since the platforming is so good, it almost becomes a compulsion to head straight towards a cluster when you see it.\n\nThe main story is where Saints Row IV shines. The writing is superb, although you will definitely want to have played at least some of Saints Row: The Third to appreciate a lot of the jokes. The game is filled with laugh out loud moments, not only from the dialogue, but even just from the missions you find yourself taking on. Each of your crew members has their own loyalty mission, which grants them superpowers of their own upon completion. These are the big side missions that are worth doing, while other quests in the game aren’t really necessary unless you’re going for all of the achievement. The main missions alone will take you a decent amount of time, perhaps around 10-15 hours, and to complete everything in the game will take up to around 20-25 hours, especially if you want to get Gold rating in all challenges.\n\nThe Matrix came out 16 years ago, and only semi-recently did I even get to see all of the films. It’s getting to the stage that movies get to when you hear your friends saying “What do you mean you’ve never seen The Matrix!?”, and then say to themselves “...oh I’m getting old”. However, as one of the most important films in its genre, you can forgive Saints Row IV for making quite so many references to it, which after finally watching the films myself stood out like a sore thumb.  Everything from “finding an exit”, down to diving into the very bodies of enemies and destroying them from within gets a mention. Heck, the whole simulation idea is straight out of the Matrix.\n\nThe combat still holds up well too. In addition to all the well-known weaponry from the previous game, you have access to all kinds of new flashy alien tech. The Dubstep Gun, The Singularity Gun and the Inflato-Ray are some of the most amusing, and most satisfying things to use in any recent video game. Mayhem missions return, where you cause as much damage as possible in the time allotted. Insurance Fraud has you literally playing in traffic to generate money. Instead of car racing, you will be racing using your super jump and super sprint. You can hack shops in a minigame which is a slightly altered and more infuriating version of Pipeline. These side activities provide a distraction from the main quest line, but none of them are particularly worth spending too much time on unless you are a completionist.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nAlthough it is a simulation, you will be familiar with Steelport if you played the previous game. The landscape is much the same, with most of the old locations in the same place. It is noticeably different though, with a liberal scattering of alien hardware, and a lack of sky and water.\n\nI had mixed feelings on the way the game looks. I wasn’t a big fan of the dark and gloomy visuals of the simulation, but they eventually grew on me. The way every texture shimmers every now and then as the simulation occasionally slows up is actually pretty cool.\n\nOverall the game looks very nice. Some of the billboards and signs scattered thoughout are surprisingly detailed, not to mention hilarious. The cars still look as great as ever, and you can still customize them any way you choose. Though with access to the superpowers, you will probably not being using any vehicles as your main mode of transportation.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nBoasting a massive soundtrack featuring over 100 different tracks, Saints Row IV has your musical needs covered as you drive your stolen vehicles around the Steelport simulation. You can find a full list online easily. There's something for everyone, as the soundtrack covers some very broad tastes in music, even classical.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nFor me the game hovered around 40-50FPS even when it seemed like the entire screen was exploding, or when I was running at hundreds of miles per hour through city streets leaving a trail of destruction in my wake. The only time it occasionally hitched was during an autosave, but it was barely noticeable. I didn't have any other issues at all. The game has full controller support, and can be enjoyed using a controller or mouse/keyboard. It's easy to play using either one.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nOverall Saints Row IV is a marvellously enjoyable game, while still suffering from a few of the complaints that the series has always had. The main quests are great, and although the side missions are not painful to play, they don’t quite pack the same punch. If you played and enjoyed Saints Row The Third, then picking up this sequel is a must. Equally if you’re looking for a game that lets you run around as a badass with special powers.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/RumGX_dVcIA\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","75.2"," 863 of 940 people (92%) found this review helpful 194 people found this review funny","92","863","940","194","7"

What? Oh, right.\n- Yes, there are many sports played at a professional level in the game. What NOW? Seriously? SIGH. FINE.\n- No, this game contains no Protoss, because copyright is a real thing. WHAT? OH, FOR THE...WELL, WHAT EVEN IS A 'PRO' THEN? Wait, what? That's ALL? I'm starting again.\n\nGood stuff about the game:\n- This is easily, by far, without any doubt or exception, the funniest game I own. Although SR3 comes in a close second. 'Comes'. Heh.\n- More customisability than (so-called) Real Life. Not even joking. Unless you consider that Real Life includes this game - then that just confuses the issue. So don't do that.\n- Easily the best music of the series, and possibly 'any game ever'. In my opinion, at least.\n- The gameplay consists of one main storyline and a whole bunch of mini games. I like this.\n- KEITH DAVID. In general.\n- STILL more realistic than most of the GTA series.\n- Okay, that last one probably isn't true.\n- Probably.\n- Boys can wear dresses, and girls can wear pants. That's one step up from most games. If you care about that kind of thing. Which I don't. But you might.\n- If you're insane like me, and try NOT to kill pedestrians/civs, then this game will allow you to do so guilt-free (because of the storyline).\n- It's not Day One: Garry's Incident, because who needs that? Still, this is true of most games, I suppose.\n- The boob physics are okay.\n- Carnival psychics are not okay, not in my book.\n- THE MURDER KING RETURNS! No, not Genki. Although, him too.\n- I hate it when I can actually achieve my goals in life because I don't get distracted, and this game is excellent in that regard.\n- This game will never expect you to listen to Nickleback, or Creed.\n- It won't talk about how (insert TV show) is the greatest thing ever made, even though said show is clearly just a rehash of a short film, or comic, or feature film, or a brand of canned tuna, or whatever.\n- The game doesn't send a message to your friends on social media everytime you turn left, or jump. I am looking directly at you, PeopleVilleFarmSocietyPetCandyLand.\n\nCons:\n- Yes, most of the Saints Row are ex-cons. What? Oh. English, eh? It's weird.\n\nNot-so-great-stuff about the game:\n- There's no Burt Reynolds.\n- Some people may not like the fact that vehicles become redundant after the first half-hour. I didn't really care.\n- The gameplay consists of one main storyline and a whole bunch of mini games. Some may not like this.\n- I couldn't find the 'Feel Boss - 5$' guy ANYWHERE. I had this whole storyline in my head where the Saints worked undercover for a secret organisation, and the Feel Boss guy was their handler, and I...probably could have kept that info inside of my head. Oh well, no doubt I will delete it before I post the review. I'm sure I will remember, because my memory is top notch.\n- Not enough Mighty Boosh references. Unlike my reviews.\n- No Old Gregg.\n- See? Mighty Boosh reference. BAM!\n- You can't kill Dex.\n- Aussies will be reminded about their Nanny Government every time they want to Co-op. And who needs that?\n- Not enough Frank Welker (I hope the 3 of you that just got that found it really funny/apt. The rest of you can ignore this comment).\n- There are escort missions. But they involve actual 'escorts', so I gave this one a free pass.\n- That last one was a blatant lie, I just really wanted to use that gag.\n- There's STILL no Burt Reynolds. I cannot overstate this enough.\n\nYeah, that's a big deal for some people. Horses for courses, and ponies for - um - something that rhymes with ponies. Stonies? Oh, I quit.\n\nJUST BUY THE DAMN GAME, OKAY?","April 16, 2015","true","106.6"," 293 of 337 people (87%) found this review helpful 291 people found this review funny","87","293","337","291","10"

Well, sort of. Fans of the first 3 Saints games may be in for a bit of a surprise, that is either going to impress them, or send them into a fit of rage. While other Saints games have been no stranger to going way out into left field, the 4th entry into this series seems to push the envelope even further. So far in fact that it seems like a completely new genre entry into the series. I'm sure by now you know the gist of the game. The gist is that you are no longer tied the laws of normal physics. Why? You progressively and eventually achieve becoming a mother #$%@ing superhero! Oh, and did I mention you are also the President of the United States? Yeah, from just a gangbanger, to a man in tights! Or whwtaever you want to wear to be honest.\n\n\nSaints Row completely flips the script of previous Saints games, and has you now instead of fighting rival gangs, taking on a legion of aliens bent on destroying everything you care about. You'll meet familiar faces from the past, and run and gun or jump (over buildings mind you) and pound the ground with a bevy of your closest friends from the Saints universe. And Keith David too!\n\nYeah, you can run at lightning speeds, jump long distances, use telekinetic powers, and a lot more. The melee fighting is a lot better, but still a little lacking. However, punches go hard this time, so it's a lot more satisfying. Like punching a car, and seeing it knocked back quite a distance. You still get guns and other weapons (and LOTS of skins for them). And the way the game flows in combat, you'll find yourself mixing it up with all assortments of moves. Mainly due to limited ammo, and a meter for combat superpowers. This way you're not just spamming one thing over and over again. This makes for some fast and furious action, and I love it!\n\nAs far as traveling goes, you do get vehicles. But with how fast you can move in the game, they almost feel like an afterthought. That is of course for aerial vehicles, which can still be useful. This being because while you can jump super high, or launch yourself very far, and even glide long distances, you still never get the ability to fly.\n\nAs for the lack of interest in using vehicles which most people find not necessary, the game features the ability to listen to your favorite radio stations usually found in the vehicles, now outside of the vehicles at any time. And this my friends, is quite the dream. The soundtrack has some choice tunes, featuring a wide assortment of genres, and throwback classics. I was floored when I ran into a pack of alien enemies, and "The Touch" by Stan Bush started playing. It made me feel...well...It made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥! The cheesy 80's centric music blaring while I'm zooming in and out of these enemies, using super powers, and feeling like a god. I loved every minute of that. And it was purely by chance. Just some good timing is all.\n\nBut not to worry, Saints IV makes good use of scripted badassery, with some fantastic main story missions that are well played out, so it's not all by chance. The story is cheesy goodness dripping with gooey satisfaction. It's never at any moment meant to be taken seriously, and for that I am thankful. This is a game with 1 focus in mind. Having some of the most balls to the wall fun imaginable.\n\nThe game however seems like it is over too soon. And honestly, there is not much in terms of challenge. The post game stuff will just leaving you typing up any loose ends for achievements and other odds and ends, but you will pretty much have all side missions complete by the end, and in a short time. So this leaves any post game missions down to any expansion packs we may get for the game. But regardless of length, you will enjoy every minute of it gun toting superheroes with political ties is your sort of thing :D\n\n\nPros\n- Varied and satisfying gameplay\n- Wonderfully scripted main story missions\n- Fantastic soundtrack\n- Radio stations can be listened to on foot (and in the air!)\n- Feel like a complete badass!\n\nCons\n- Game is too short\n- Easy gameplay","November 25, 2013","true","51.0"," 904 of 1,123 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","904","1","0","23"

If before we had a bunch of crazed fools trying to destroy a city, why not an entire game made just for that? Even though the game is made up of stupidty and ridiculousness, Saints Row is actually a good game.\nI haven't played the previous releases, and as I don't really follow nor base my opinion on Gameplay videos and other people's reviews, I won't comment on what I do not know.\nEither way, Deep Silver is known for releasing games filled with bugs and are only sorted months after released; And yes, the game sometimes bugs out and one does not know what is going on. - I went through it myself, even playing only several months after it's launch. However they weren't game-breaking bugs and never had to restart a mission, nor spend any time shouting and screaming annoyed at the game.\n\n● Graphical wise, they are not really up-to-date nor can they really be compared to some of the previous generation's titles; but I actually like the game's graphical style! Granted I'm not usually one to care and totally base my opinion on a game's graphics. Graphics do NOT make a game good, okey? Okey!\n● I enjoyed the Story, even thought I didn't understand it fully (and I still think Deep Silver could actually ship games with Portuguese Language possibility..). I really liked the humour part, really different from what I'm used to with games like GTA, which ended up becoming something quite serious, aiming for extreme reality.\n●Regarding the Characters, I found them to be quite charismatic. I found them to be actual supports to a good narrative and not simply prop-adresses there just to be used - like in many other games.\nThere were times in which I wish I had played Saints Row: The Third (and I confess it's on my "To-Play List"..). I found the ending to be quite interesting and I am most certainly hoping for yet another Sequel to the story.\n[SPOILER ALERT!!!! - SERIOUSLY!] I really LOVED that I ended up with the bad guy's head on my bare hands!\n● The gameplay style of the game is also quite nice - plenty of features that are not really common on other games I've played - especially in certain Main Missions, such as Rescue, Text-Adventure, 2D Platforming and even Stealth!\nSeriously.. there were times in which I thought to myself "Oh no they didn't!"; Because there are so many surreal things happening that we have to think to ourselves what goes in the mind of someone that thinks about this sort of things.\nBeing fully CO-OP capable is also one of the outstanding features I'd like to talk about. It's certainly way more amusing to play with a friend than alone\n● Not to mention the Soundtrack - it gets to a point of having someone singing "Baby don't hurt me!", out loud at your ears and .. yeah - that's Saints Row for you! One gets to see the real side of the people you play with!\n● And yes, before anyone steps forward and shouts that the game is "Too easy" and "Handhelds you" by giving you tons of power and bonuses in the first 20 minutes of the game - and the fact that you can pretty much wreck most enemies during the entire game's duration - some levels are actually tough to get through, especially if one isn't the best player around, or doesn't have help of a friend.\n\nHonestly, I had to honor this game and distinguish it from all the other games I've played in the past. And even though I know plenty of people will disagree with me with the following Score I'll award it with - I'll only give you one advice: Play with a friend. Hopefully a goofy one! Then return to me and tell me what you thought about it now. - I have never laughed so hard at a game before, and I'll even go further and claim I prefer this "GTA Clone" to the actual GTA - but hey, I'll be the first one to admit they are two different games now.\n\nSaints Row IV is certainly one of the best games I've played in my life.\n★★★★★★★★★☆ 9/10","January 17, 2014","true","80.0"," 254 of 296 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","254","296","0","9"

After quickly becoming the president, aliens take over the planet and lock everyone away in their own virtual world. The city is the same city from Saints Row: The Third, but now since its a virtual world, its always night and everything has neon lights like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. It plays the same as previous Saints Row games or any over the shoulder shooter, but with a big new addition, super powers. It might be the same town, but you play it completely different. Why steal a car and drive, when you can run faster than any car and super jump up tall buildings to wall jump even higher. You won't spend time on the streets, but on top of buildings as well. You'll even get magical powers like telekinesis, fireballs and ice to dispatch enemies. These spells replace the throwing items like grenades. Each spell has a cool down, but its infinite.\n\nTo start, you're the same character from previous games, which is to say yourself. Your own customized character that I created a drunken 80s rock star with a mustache and a gritty accent. You can even chose Nolan North as a voice. The entire crew from the previous game is back and you'll need to save them from their own virtual Hells. This is where the game pulls from the past history of the franchise and puts a nightmarish spin on them. You'll get to hear some of the franchise's greatest cameos like Neil Patrick Harris and Mila Kunis. Not to mention Kyle David plays himself as the Vice President.\n\nThe game walks the line between over the top comedy and action with great gameplay. Comedy games never really hit home for me, but this one managed to strike a chord. The humor isn't like the sexual comedy of Saints Row: The Third. Instead, there's some excellent parody of other games, like a Metal Gear Solid mission, complete with box crawling and shooting 2 lights when 1 bullet would take out a guard. Even movie parodies like a Ghostbusters 2 giant energy drink can fighting a giant statue. The entire game is its own version of the Matrix movie. You get rescued like Neo, into the real world on a spaceship where you're free to hop into the virtual version of Steelport or romance some of your crew. Its all part of the comedy. The licensed 90s music really heightens the experience and really clinches some of the moments. Climbing a rocket headed for space, you'll hear Aerosmith's "I don't wanna miss a thing." Visiting a club full of blow up dolls, you'll hear "Insane in the Membrane" from Cypress Hill.\n\nIts not just visual gags and parody. The dialog is another strong point.  I think that because the characters are less distracting and gimmicky, the dialog stands out that much more. Your crew feels believable, while still making fun of one another and themselves. I felt they're still a big crazy family / street gang / presidential cabinet.\n\nThe story missions offer a diverse array of activities. You won't just be fighting and shooting. As an example, you'll first hop in a car to get to a location. Then fight your way through corridors, fly a spaceship, man a turret, walk around in a giant suit of power armor and finally face a boss. The game really keeps it fresh doing things unique for the story missions that you won't find out in the open world.\n\nIn the open world there is a lot of side quest fluff that you can complete to control more of the city. Things like street races, assassinations, vehicle theft, super jump accuracy, and a fight club to name a few. You can liberating areas from aliens by taking out three points and then a central point in the middle. You can get more cash by owning businesses around town. Instead of buying these, you participate in puzzle mini games. You get a specific amount of pieces, then place them on a grid of 5x5 and connect the left entry point to the right entry point. Fail and the police come. When you own businesses, the money accumulates and you collect it by going into your phone / PDA. I am happy that you don't have to go to each location to collect the cash.\n\nSince this is an open world game, you'll be doing a lot of the same things over and over again, but in different areas. The game raises the difficulty with each success that you have. You start out facing mere aliens, but then it soon escalates into orbs that shield the aliens, hover bikes and even portals that need to be closed before new waves of enemies come in.\n\nCommitting a crime will get the police called on you. There seem to be four tiers of police that come. To get your wanted level to go down, just hide from them until it cools down. The cops aren't the only ones after you. With such super powers, the police felt irrelevant. Fighting dozens of aliens, I'd notice one cop trying to get me. Its just another enemy to face I guess.\n\nFor the most part, enemies can be quickly dispatched with guns, melee or magical powers, but the bosses are quite the challenge. These bosses are big agile creatures called agents that have force fields. To disable these shields, you need to use a super power and then shoot them. The shield regenerates of course. Sounds easy doesn't it? Well they adapt quickly, move out of range, leap tall buildings, throw cars and shoot red laser orbs at you. When you're hit, you rag doll, but the game has a recover button that puts you back on your feet again without wasting time. Other bosses do the same and you can fight them across entire city blocks. There are easier bosses in story missions, but those bosses feel more like part of the silliness and not part of the challenge.\n\nThe super powers can be upgraded by touching conduits. For the most part, the conduits are blue lights on top of buildings. Some are in walls you need to freeze or in the ground you'll need to pound. Its just an extra thing to collect and the rewards are nice, but its nothing you're forced to do. When you get each super power, the game loads up a training program to properly teach you how to use it. These are pretty basic and quick.\n\nOn top of super powers, you have abilities, perks that unlock when you level up from experience. You buy the perks with money and its things like dead pedestrians leave health, 25% more ammo capacity, take less damage from small arms fire and much more. Its all just something to spend your oodles of money on. If that wasn't enough you can visit gun shops to upgrade your arsenal. There are even unique upgrades like explosive pistol ammo and acid bullets. Its all a silly joy to play. Then during the story missions, you find alien weapons like a dub step gun and a bouncing laser.\n\nThis is a fun game. Fun to watch, fun to hear, fun to play. The story missions stand out from the rest as enjoyable. While I did get tired of the open world fluff, I'd still stop in the middle of a mission to liberate a part of the city. They were fun diversions, even the puzzles to buy or own the stores could have been their own game. The superpowers made the good gameplay even deeper. I'm shocked that the developer could fit all those powers onto a controller!","January 18, 2015","true","11.5"," 106 of 115 people (92%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","92","106","115","14","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/recommended/206420/","Jay720","720","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jay720/","199 products in account","Saints Row IV is a culmination of what happens when you combine stellar gameplay and design, with over-the-top antics and crazy missions. There are so many things developer Volition did right that make Saints Row IV such an enjoyable, replayable adventure, however outlandish or warped its turns take along the way.\n\nIn the first few hours of my playthrough of Saints Row IV, I became the President of the US, cured cancer, was captured by aliens called Zin, saw the Earth blow up, ate pancakes for breakfast and stubbed my toe. While all of this may sound so cliché, Saints Row IV then opens itself up to a plethora of player customization, ridiculous weapons and over-powered weapons. Saints Row IV was designed to be destroyed, but these basics are just a small amount of what it has to offer.\n\nAfter leaving the '50s re-enactment of Steelport, you return to a simulation of the city that has been overrun by Zin. As soon as you enter Steelport, you are introduced to clusters. Clusters are the 'super-power currency' to Saints Row IV. Collect enough of these, and you can upgrade and beef up abilities such as Super Sprint, Blast, and Telekinesis. The latter all have elemental variants, from the fundamental 'Fire' and 'Freeze', to bigger and better things like 'Explosion' and 'Mind Control'. These new attack methods can be used at any time inside the simulation, and are what make Saints Row IV a new experience to fans of the Open World genre.\n\nSteelport's map is dotted with collectibles and minigames. One of my personal favourite minigames was Professor Genki's Mind Over Murder game, which was hilariously silly and stupid, but so enjoyable. I especially loved the game-show-style commentary incorporated in it, with two hosts discussing how I played as I went along. There are also Audio Logs that contain fragments of peoples' past and Zinyak statues to destroy.\n\nAlthough Saints Row IV is mainly about the constant alien bloodshed in the wake of the apocalypse, the Saints' story is one I will remember. Behind the impudent facade a lot of the characters portray is a level of caring, they want to help their friends and they all care for each other. No matter what obstacles they overcome, the Saints have the power to pull through. This isn't to say there won't be falling outs, but for the majority of the main missions, I never felt like I was uninterested.\n\nSide quests, on the other hand, were Saints Row IV's downfall. I saw them as 'time fillers', to make the game appear longer, and to give you a little incentive for when you finish at the end. Sometimes, I was happy to take on Matt Miller's boring missions, only so I could receive the Mind Control reward at the end. I'm so glad the side quests were optional, because if the story was as bland and monotonous as these, I would have put down my controller and not picked it up again. Most of the side quests were what you would sort of expect. While you were asked to do things from different people, it was always the same 'Go here, blow stuff up, come back.' style of side quests you would expect. This isn't to say that blowing the stuff up wasn't fun, it's just the way they were instigated showed no sign of distinction between them.\n\nSaints Row IV presents itself as an in-your-face, balls-to-the-wall style game that doesn't back down on anything it delivers. But that doesn't mean you can't spend quality time making countless changes to how you look. There are so many different customization options at the Image As Designed plastic surgery, I spent about three hours deciding between a wide-eyed Elder Scrolls Argonian-like man with a female voice, or a purple hulk with blue hair and a Cockney accent. I finally settled for something simpler and human-looking, with a thick British accent. I felt compelled to keep it, even though I knew I could make something better. Something about the original character you create stays with you, and sometimes I didn't even want to change my outfit in fear of 'losing' my character's personality.\n\nOverall, Saints Row IV is an over-the-top, blasé third-person adventure, complete with aliens and an impeccable story. Saints Row IV is outrageous, but under its whole bad-♥♥♥ guise lies a wonderfully constructed joy to play. It is entertaining, stupid, and just plain fun. Volition sure knows how to give players a good time.","November 1, 2014","true","22.6"," 170 of 204 people (83%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","83","170","204","35","2"

It has evolved from a simple GTA clone into a bizarre exploration of game tropes and a rampant power fantasy set against a vaguely GTA inspired background. If you're like me and you love mobility and highly emergent gameplay you'll enjoy the hell out of SRIV. Super speed, super jump, air dash, backflip suplex, taser SMG, nuclear ground pound, beam katana, car punt, simply being naked, lighting yourself on fire, and money hailstorm are all real abilities in this game and all perfectly usable in combat. The number of possible strategic combinations is mind-boggling. And not once during the whole experience does it stop being fun.\n\nThe only things that could possibly be called a downside to SRIV are the rift missions, where you enter a neon-punk void and a robotic orb snarks at you while you struggle to complete seemingly simple tasks. By toughing them out, though, you can add even more potent abilities to your arsenal, such as water walking, immunity to fire, and the ability to shrug off an explosion like it's nothing, so they're worth the mild discomfort.\n\nIn short, this game is worth twice what they're charging for it and more besides.

Saints Row IV takes the all the batshit insane parts of SR:TT and amps up the crazy to 11. This game is designed with the purpose of being silly fun.\n\nTwo great things about this game are the solid writing and good soundtrack, things sorely missing from Saints Row: The Third and present in other previous installments. The plot of this game, despite being overblown and ridiculous has good character writing and a good sense of wit behind it.\n\nSaints Row IV takes place in a simulation of Steelport, the city of Saints Row: The Third. While a lot of assets have been reused in SRIV there are plenty of tweaks to the map which make it feel new enough to not just be a rehash of the previous game. The same philosophy applies to the gameplay, which takes the same core of SR:TT but adds superpowers. Superpowers dramatically switch up the gameplay from an open world sandbox in the vein of GTA to one more in the vein of Prototype and inFamous.\n\nDid I mention the customisation? There is extensive customisation in this game in items such as cars, weapons, clothes and the player character themselves. Now while this customisation isn't as intricate or in detail as SR2 it's a marked improvement over SR:TT.\n\nIf Saints Row 2 is one of the greatest open world games ever made and Saints Row: The Third is a cynically produced title that attempted to cash in on what made SR2 popular but completely missed the point then Saints Row IV is someone in between the two. The devs decided to take the insane aspects from Saints Row: The Third and run with them and magniy it to an insane degree but it has the things that made Saints Row 2 great but in a different setting.\n\nI can easily recommend this to anyone who likes fun in their games.","June 22, 2014","true","44.5"," 92 of 114 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","92","114","0","0"

While the core formula of accepting missions from NPCs, completing Diversions, taking territory and causing as much mayhem as possible remains the same, the inclusion of new super powers and abilities elevates the experience to a higher degree of madcap fun. The story of the game’s development is well known, starting out as DLC for Saints Row The Third until Volition determined that a much bigger game was possible. And this is most certainly a big game. Those concerned that Saints Row IV is nothing more than a glorified expansion can put their fears to rest. This is, hands down, the best game in the Saints Row franchise.\nSet an indeterminable amount of time after Cyrus Temple was kicked out of Steelport, the Third Street Saints are once again thrust into battle against S.T.A.G. after Cyrus acquires a nuclear rocket and intends to blow up Washington D.C. and blame it on the international celebrity gang. Led by MI-6 agent Asha Odekar, the Boss, Shaundi, Kinzie, Matt Miller and Pierce are able to defeat Cyrus, but not before he launches the weapon. After disarming the nuke in a wonderfully dramatic fashion, the Boss is awarded the prestigious honor of becoming the President of the United States.\nThe leadership is short lived due to an invasion by the Zin Empire, lead by the eloquent and Jane Austen-loving Emperor Zinyak. After the Presidential cabinet and a significant amount of Earth’s population are captured, the Boss is thrown into a Matrix-style simulation of Steelport. With the assistance of Kinzie and the Third Street Saints, the Boss begins a campaign to free humanity from the Zin, both in and out of the simulation.\nIn a great number of ways, Saints Row IV plays quite similarly to Saints Row The Third. You’ll wander around the large city completing story missions, a massive laundry list of Diversions retooled for the new game, character specific side quests, and upgrade character and Homie abilities all in the name of freeing humans from Zinyak’s rule.\nCombat continues to entertain with a large assortment of weapons guaranteed to cause as much destruction as possible. The game’s biggest addition is the large suite of upgradeable superpowers that shakes the Saints Row gameplay experience to its very core. Because Steelport is a stand-in for the Matrix, there are rules to the system that can be bent and, thanks to Kinzie, broken. One might think that the ability to run faster than a speeding pimpmobile and jump tall bordellos in a single bound would be enough to break the game. Not so! These powers instead bring the game to a new level of fun and insanity.\nPowers make for more enriching and diverse combat scenarios. Why duck behind low walls or move in and out of cover when you can jump ten feet into the air, land on a roof and pick off targets from above? Need to increase the distance between you and a group of foes? Super sprint down the street and lick your wounds before heading back in the fray. Knock enemies down harder than a case of donkey beer with a ground stomp. With these powers, combat becomes a completely opened ended affair. While shooting enemies can be fun on its own, mixing gunfire with Freeze Blast, Telekinesis and Mind Control can result in a great deal of creative brutality. Having these options is especially useful when you max out your Wanted meter, as the Zin are relentless in their attempts at killing you.\nIf there’s a downside to the implementation of super powers, its that they render vehicles spectacularly pointless, so much so that the fun dips slightly when a mission puts you in the driver’s seat.\nCreating a game within a virtual Steelport provides a unique and astonishingly well realized visual aesthetic. The city, shrouded in a light red tinge, is given a futuristic facelift. Because the city is a computer simulation, you can’t go very far without seeing elements of the computer software, with bits of code that run underneath wall textures and varying degrees of artifacting on vehicles, NPCs and the game world itself. In one mission the city buildings and NPCs warp and degrade in many different ways and in another, textures are replaced by colored ASCII code. All this is done at the drop of the hat and without any stress on the game’s integrity. It really is an impressive technical feat.\nWhere the game shines brightest is in the mission design. A virtual setting allows Volition to not concern themselves with developing scenarios confined to a real, if cartoony, world. I want to emphasize that many, MANY, of the mission types you’ll find here represent some of the most inspiring pieces of game design for both the franchise and the open world genre. By the end of the game, Saints Row IV will have served not only as an homage to the entire franchise but also to the last twenty years in gaming.\nI really enjoyed my time with Saints Row IV, far more than the previous two games. I found its story to be genuinely engrossing as it involves much more than eliminating street gangs and taking out the leader of an international crime syndicate. Saints Row IV is a long game as well, taking me close to fourteen hours to finish. I’m already planning on playing through the game again to see what effect a different choice has on the result of one particular mission. With surprises around every corner, Saints Row IV stands head and shoulders above previous games in the series and is a shining jewel in the open world genre.","April 17, 2014","true","175.0"," 62 of 80 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","62","80","2","0"

Yes. Is this a game that is worth paying retail for? No. This game was originally supposed to be just an expansion DLC for Saint's Row: The Third. Then someone said, "With all the work we are putting in, we should charge three times as much." And Saint's Row IV was born. Don't get me wrong....the game is quite enjoyable and has a fair amount of content to keep you busy for a while. But it is very clear this game was not meant to be a stand-alone product, and that shows in the details (polish, bugs, etc). Then we get to the DLC....the real issue here. This company has a history of nickel & diming their customers to death with tons of small DLC packs. Pay 3 dollars for new outfits. Pay 2 dollars for a new skin for your guns. Pay 7 bucks for a new set of generic missions that are no different than the already-included missions. Or my personal favorite...pay 10 bucks for a "Season Pass" that, in any other game, would entitle you to ALL the DLC that will be released for the game. Except in this game, it doesn't do that. The name is completely misleading, and entitles you to 2 of the larger DLC packs, one of which has yet to be released. You STILL get nickel & dimed for everything else. Sure, you'll discover this if you read the fine print. But it's this spirit of "Let's milk our customers" that really leaves a bad taste in your mouth when playing games by this company. It isn't anything new, but keep in mind that they are leaving elements of this game out with the intention of getting MORE money from you at a later date. I, for one, will not be purchasing games from this company again.

With the superpowers we now have the game is a bit too over-the-top. Also, there's no real new area here as the city of Steelport remained the same. It looks a bit different due to the alien invasion (actually, the huge alien ship in the air looks stunning and is pretty cool), but the areas remained the same.\n\nSo, in essence, Volition only added a new storyline which now sees our favourite gang pitted against the invading forces of an alien race. And the battle mainly takes place in a Steelport which is not a real city but the virtual reality version of an already destroyed place. So, as a nod to Matrix we, just like Neo, can easily do in this world whatever we want. With the superhuman abilities we can run up on the sides of buildings, can leap forward to great distances and following a charged-up jump we can glide in the air for a long time. This gameplay is similar to the one we had in Prototype so those of you who liked that franchise will see that this one plays pretty familiar.\n\nThe downside this approach brings with itself is the fact that as you unlock fast running pretty early own there's no real point in driving any car in the game as getting from point A to point B is much easier by running, jumping and gliding instead of using any vehicles. In fact, later on running right next to people or cars make these fly away due to the sheer force of your fast speed so to a certain degree getting into a car while running is a bit difficult.\n\nHowever, if you think about it Volition could not have gone in any other direction. After all, in The Third we already kicked the arses of the rival gangs of Steelport and even fought the government's so-called STAG programme. So, taking one step forward was obvious towards aliens. And the jokes and hilarious moments including some excellent cameos of famous people (Keith David, Roddy Piper, Neil Patrick Harris) are still there.\n\nAnd this was always the real deal for me: how funny this franchise was, how silly the missions were and how great dialogues the Saints had. When completing the story and the game's many side missions I clocked around the same number of hours I did with The Third. For me, the 4th installment of the Saints did deliver and I think Volition did a great job once again.","May 29, 2014","true","32.6"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","47","60","0","5"

I don't want to spoil too much but after a parody of Apocalypse Now follows a parody of Armagedon with Aerosmith's "Don't want to miss a thing" and a Alien Invasion by the most sophisticated Alien either, he even quotes Shakespear and MacBeth, being voiced by J. B. Blanc (who played Dr. Barry Goodman on Breaking Bad and is otherwise known from a lot of games and animes like Naruto, World or Warcraft or as the voice of Bane in Arkham Origins)\n\nThe big criticism this game has seen was the fact that the side quests are always the same mini games: jump up a tower, destroy everything in a tank, run a track like sonic or load up a virus by killing a ton of enemies and while it's true that this gets repetitive after a while, i have to saw with all the superpowers and crazy weapons at your desposal it doesn't get boring, you can always bring a new gun weapon and experience a fight new.\n\nThe main story missions truly shine as they are a parody of various games. Stealth is made look like a joke in a parody of Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, later you encounter "Saints of Rage". You ride a motorcycle to cyberspace, get into a text adventure where you have to find your way through multiple choice answers and do some quick time events.\n\nThe Voice acting is again awesome with Keith David acting as a politican and in one of his last big projects the late great Rowdy Roddy Piper plays himself, having Keith David here too of course leads to a recreation of the classic movie The Live.\n\nThe weapons and superpowers you have, you are a super hero in this game with extreme powers, you can shoot fireballs,  hover cars in the air only to shoot them at opponents or run faster than light speed. While that makes cars obsolete you can still use cars and tune them in the rim store shop.\n\nThe Music is alos great again with various radio stations and a ton of licenced songs, like in SR3 you can make your own mixtape but you can't import your own music.\n\nI played it several times now, in co-op it's even better and a ton of fun.

After failing to defeat them, you find yourself in the Matrix and you must learn to use this to your advantage to stop the alien invasion.\nSaints Row IV plays just like Saints Row: The Third. But early in the game, you start picking up data clusters and taking down the Wardens of the simulation, allowing you to unlock special abilities. You will be able to be as fast as a car or to jump like Spider-Man, later you will be also able to glide around.\nThere are a lot of movie and videogame parodies in the game such as They Live, The Matrix, Inception, Mass Effect 2, Mortal Kombat, Metal Gear Solid, Streets Of Rage, Riddick and many many more.\nThere is a wide range of things you will do in story missions. There are lots of throwbacks to Saints Row 1,2, and 3 throughout the game. You also have a space ship very similar to Mass Effect where you can chat with the crew and romance everyone. So, the story will never become boring.\nActivities have taken a big change, instead of a pass or fail system, it is now bronze, silver and gold. You will also unlock more powers, perks for powers, costumes and weapons through beating activities.\nThere's a lot of new stuff like a telekinetic Professor Genki competition, platforming rifts, speed rifts.\nSaints Row IV has nearly all of the original character voices from the first 3 games. There is also again a big music selection. A great selection of dance, hip hop, 90s and more you can listen from the in-game radio stations.\nThe graphics are nearly the same as in Saints Row: The Third.\nOverall I think Saints Row IV is also a fantastic game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deviancy/recommended/206420/","Deviancy","Gone Gone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deviancy/","4 products in account","The first Saints Row game was nothing more than a cheap knock off, I liked the 80's metal soundtrack in the game but that was all it had going for it.  The second game is when things got entertaining, they just started to parodize the whole gang thing a lot more and poke fun at some relevant societal topics.  But the third game is when Volition really started to have fun poking fun at how weird the real world was.  Saints Row: The Third wasn't only fun to play but the way it poked fun at the reality tv craze, and Stag was obviously a jab at how Bush handled the war on terror, and it was all done in a very National Lampoon way which was amusing.  Well Saints Row IV, it merely picks up where they left off in three and takes even mroe jabs at a lot of the absurd things in the US, and it pays homage to so many things from the 80's you'll lose count.  There's the level that totally pays homage to They Live and a Christmas Story (briefly), and then there's tons of weapons from 80's classics like Robocop, Aliens, and GI Joe.  And the christmas expansion, the first level is basically a re-creation of the old studio lot where they shot Jaws, Gremlins, and numerous other classics.   But towards the end when it pays homage to the animated Transformers film, and even uses the Stan Bush song from the film, that was just a golden moment in the game.\n\nBut I'm praising the satire and how they paid homage to so many great films and cartoons and not talking about the gameplay.  Gameplay wise the game is pretty fun and the super powers the player can use in the viritual world add a whole new level of gameplay to the franchise since in earlier games, the player had to rely on vehicles to get anywhere fast and always rely on guns or grenades, but in the 4th game the player could still go the gun and grenade route or freeze people or turn them into gold or use telekenisis and throw them into the sky.  In short, the game allows players to just go crazy when it comes to taking out pedestrians and the aliens.  The controls are as smooth as the third game, which I'm thankful for since Saints Row 2 for the PC, the driving controls were just horrible.  If one enjoys open world games where they can just go crazy, this game should please them.  But I highly recommend getting the Game of the Century version, or at the very least the base game and the christmas expansion pack.  While I adore Volition's sense of humor when it comes ot the SR franchise, Enter the Dominatrix gets a little too corny, while the Christmas expansion is hands down a far better expansion pack.  I don't recommend playing any of the expansions until after finishing the main game though since the expansions will spoil a few things otherwise.\n\nHowever, while I think the game is highly entertaining and totally worth dropping 10-20 on, it does have its flaws and they're the same exact flaws the third game had.\n\n1. The game doesn't have the cool drug and booze thing from the second game, I found it highly amusing how the character could get drunk or stoned in the second game and was sad to see them ditch the ability to do that in the third and fourth.  To be fair, it could have been because some countries ban games with drug content, like Australia.\n\n2. The really cool interior locations like the mall in Saints Row 2 added a lot of fun to the game, it was a blast to ♥♥♥♥ off the security guards and then just cause tons of trouble.  But Saints Row 3 and 4 just don't have any of those types of interior locations, which is a shame.\n\n3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsed/recommended/206420/","tsed","TSED","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsed/","298 products in account","I was introduced to Saint's Row via The Third.  I didn't really know what to expect, except for perhaps "kind of really dumb" and "dress up doll 9000."  I was very wrong, and it was fantastic.  Fantastic!\n\nSaint's Row IV has a number of gameplay improvements over SR3 - the super powers, obviously, allow you to get to wherever you want rather quickly.  The weapons are diverse and there are reasons to use almost all of them (except for the things that compete with the black hole generator, because seriously why would you ever use anything else?).\n\nUnfortunately, these gameplay improvements are minor, and not all of them are improvements.  The collection thing in SR3 was completely ignorable but in SR4 it's a key gameplay component.  It's also annoying and often completely destroys the pacing of missions or distractions as you go "oh hey I've gone through this area before a lot but I missed that one, time to completely ignore the alien hordes and get that one."  There's no quick way to get across the city - you can roll your eyes at 3 loading screens, or walk (super-sprint).  Yawn.  What a time sink.\n\nThe real problem comes from the writing, however.  Saint's Row 3 was incredibly over the top, and I was really excited because I expected the same level of ridiculous with the added caveat of "alien technology lets us get away with even MORE!"  That did not happen.  I am just projecting here, but the whole "President of the USA" thing sounded like a great way to canvas the city and do those little distractions; you know, get 'support.'  Nope.  You just kill some terrorists in the tutorial and land (literally) in the President's chair.  No build up whatsoever.  Heck, they even gave you super powers in an SR3 DLC mission, which would've been perfect for explaining it here, but nope!  No mention of that.  It's all just virtual reality, which really detracts from it.\n\nSR3 first-mission-spoiler: you dive through the windshield of an oncoming plane, mid-air.  Friggin'.  Righteous.  It does tone down from there, but it ramps it back up after you get your bearings.  About the most over-the-top thing you do in SR4 is [tutorial mission], which is still not as awesome as SR3's, and from there everything just relies on the "ooo superpowers and alien technology!" to be "silly."\n\nWhat's more, the actual writing is nowhere near as satisfying.  SR3 was legitimately hilarious.  SR4 was just a long string of references with almost nothing original in it.  A few of the parodies did emit a brief chuckle, but for the most part I was rolling my eyes like the literary snob I am.  SR3 had a genuine feeling of progress as you defeat the disparate rival gangs; SR4 just has "aliens ooo bad."\n\nThis one is unlikely to matter to anyone else, so I won't waste much time on it: I liked SR3's soundtrack more than 4's.  I ignore the rap anyway, so that's that, but the electronica station seemed to transform into the dubstep station.  I could actually turn to about half of the stations in 3 and listen to them, but only one was anywhere near listenable in 4 ("Gen X") and even it got annoying at times.  My custom playlist only had about 6 songs in 4, which got... tiring.  I recommend you look the two soundtracks up and compare, if you care at all.\n\nPlus, and this is a major gameplay complaint: with the addition of so much air time, WHY CAN'T YOU ATTACK WHILE IN THE AIR?  You can use 3 of your superpowers up there, but two of them only hit targets on the ground, and the third is horribly inaccurate.  Plus, you know, cooldowns.  There's an achievement for traversing the city without touching the ground once, which tells you how important aeronautics are in the game... yet you can't aim your guns while up there?  Ughhhh.\n\nI wanted to like this game.  I really did.  I remember thinking that the SR3 engine would be amazing for a superhero game, and then SR4 came along and said "yo, be a superhero!"  It promised everything I could dream of... but didn't deliver any of it.  The city has only minor tweaks from SR3 (and most of them are textures, like stop signs saying "OBEY") and the same engine is in place.  The writing is derivative and uninspired in comparison.  You miss out on a ton of features in the game (left over from SR3) because your super powers are just better at whatever it is - no rush of banking tight corners perfectly on a motorcycle, no thrill of racing up the oncoming traffic lane (because you just blow cars out of your way automatically), no close calls from getting too much negative attention (because you can just blow everything up no problem, and then once you get too much attention the aliens BACK OFF AUTOMATICALLY after a tedious miniboss fight).\n\nTL;DR play Saint's Row 3, not Saint's Row 4.","January 6, 2014","false","34.2"," 335 of 561 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","335","561","0","11"

While that game features improved controls and playability, in terms of everything else it was a step back. Steelport isn't half the city Stilwater was, the atmosphere was sorely lacking, the jokes weren't as funny, and the story & characters weren't nearly as well-written.\n\nSaints Row 4...well, it takes all of SR3's bad qualities and makes them even worse. The idea of having superpowers in an open-world game is always appealing, even though the results rarely satisfy. SR4 grabs elements from a number of these games and doesn't really do anything interesting with them. The Boss runs and jumps across roof-tops to collect orbs, he/she occasionally engages in time-trials, and somethings they just blow a lot of things up. It's the same content that has been done before and better in other games.\n\nWhat makes a superhero game interesting is when powers lead to new obstacles. Take Prototype for example. The military is always on the lookout for Alex Mercer, and whenever he uses his powers they will bring as much firepower in as possible to bring him down. Despite being able to destroy tanks and helicopters easily, eventually the player is so overwhelmed they have to get away. Limitations are important, they make the player think. Where SR4 fails is that using and abusing powers isn't punished or forces players to get creative. There are occasional missions where no powers are available, but those are just dull. Furthermore the mission design never graduates beyond "kill all this stuff" or "protect a thing". In Crackdown the player is tasked with eliminating various crime bosses, and numerous approaches are available to them(front door, roof-tops, explosives, sniping, etc). SR4 doesn't consider these forward-thinking ideas, so most of the game is spent wasting time on meaningless content.\n\nAlso unfortunate is everything we took for granted in previous Saints Row titles no longer matters. Numerous vehicles are available, but it's faster just to run & glide around, dozens of weapons can be collected, but it's easier just to kill everything with superpowers or the black hole gun. Most unfortunate of all is that despite being an open-world game, SR4 loses almost all of the random-ness that usually happens. What I mean is the game is too focused, it's too centered on the player being a totally awesome practically invincible boss. In previous SR games there were those little moments like a car accidentally running over the ho you're trying to rescue. Yes it's frustrating, but it's also funny, and even endearing. It's a city, things tend to go wrong.\n\nI'll sum up the rest of the negatives in a list.\n-The jokes are even worse than SR3's.\n-Weak radio stations\n-Steelport is still a lousy city\n-Unnecessary QTEs and button-mashing segments\n-Too many characters with largely uninteresting stories (who wrote SR2? Get that guy back, he was great)\n-A lot of "mission-briefing" cutscenes, which don't add anything to the game.\n\nAll in all, Saints Row 4 isn't outwardly terrible. It's not like some games where you play them for 10 minutes and realize they absolutely suck and quit. I put 20+ hours into this game. It's definitely playable, there is fun to be had, but it just isn't in any way memorable or worthy of praise. It benefits from having SR3 as a base and not much else. For the next game I'd rather Volition did a reboot, a prequel, or hell, just put out a PC port of SR2 that isn't total garbage. Whatever they do, I hope it doesn't involve superpowers, aliens, virtual worlds, or mission after mission of killing thousands of things so a thing will happen.\n\nIn short, SR4 is a missed opportunity and a massive disappointment, but that's just my opinion.","August 25, 2014","false","24.6"," 135 of 219 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","135","219","5","16"

It's graphically the same. Even the characters are exactly the same. The last part is a bit obvious of course, since it's a sequel, but still, it would've been nice if they mixed things up. You know, different city, different characters, things like that.\n\nInstead Volition took the easy way out. That doesn't mean Saints Row IV can't be fun, because it can be but I'm sure it will give you that 'been there, done that' feeling, too.\n\nThere are plenty of side activities to be done though. It's in no way a small game. It's big, You could play for 25 hours and you still wouldn't have finished it 100%. No, content wise this game is amazing.\nIt's just that the city isn't worth exploring anymore, especially since you've seen it all in the third game. But it wasn't worth exploring in the first place. There are (almost) no awesome landmarks or anything. It feels like a city but... a regular, simple one. Nothing like the cities of the Grand Theft Auto games, which are epic in scale.\n\nSaints Row IV, for me, is enjoyable and disappointing at the same time.\nHowever, if I had to choose one of those two terms 'disappointing' would be my first choice. Let's hope a possible sequel will give us a better, newer and more fun experience.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","September 21, 2013","true","12.4"," 75 of 116 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","75","116","0","2"

The jokes / gags just weren't on par, and while some of the classic scenes were drug out yet again for a quick laugh it still just wasn't where I expected the sequel to be. The super powers were all basically ripped straight from Prototype, in which they were all implimented much better. Get it for a sale and you'll have a good time with it, but as a huge fan of the Saints Row franchise I felt like this one was rushed out, repetitive, and had all the hallmarks of a studio cash grab.

I played a good amount of SR:TT and loved the game thoroughly. I then decided to pool my funds together and buy this game.\n\nI LOVE IT GOD JUST YES TAKE IT TAKE MY MONEY DLC YOU SAY I'LL TAKE IT ALL\n\nWhat this game did right:\n\n+ Yippee skippy, super powers! The super powers in this game are fun as hell to use and I like all of 'em a lot. Telekinesis? Sign me up. Super Stomp? Sign me up. The ability to curbstomp any battle easily? Sure.\n\n+ Liked how SR:TT played? You'll feel right at home. Same Steelport, and barring super powers the gun game stays the same, which is satisfying. Driving stayed the same too, so don't worry about sloppy turning on vehicles that didn't have it already.\n\n+ Updated everything. You'll find some pretty nice special effects, a slightly nicer HUD, oh my god a radial wheel for your weapons and an all new suite of weapons and that good ole' Saints Row chatter that's amusing AND mildly psychopathic.\n\n+ A boat of references from the older games. You'll find the DLC costumes from SR:TT in the clothing stores and some older vehicles make a return, you end up resurrecting the tortured existances of your enemies (Like Maero, Tanya and dear Christ Julius is that you) to fight for you like slaves and you even get to fight yourself twice later in the game. Oh whoops spoilers godda-\n\n+ Nolan North is a voice option. NOLAN NORTH. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS SITUATION GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW SO I CAN TELL YOU HOW GOOD THIS IS TO FINALLY\n\nWhat this game did wrong:\n\n- No new world. Sure, the Earth kinda sorta got into a pickle what with it being in thousands of molten pieces floating around in space, but at least planetary travel would've been better than Steelport with no Saints in it and always night time.\n\n- Wierd bugs. I don't know about anyone else, but if SR IV bugs up it tends to cry loudly in the corner and throw things at me when I try to ignore it. Like crashing and then trying to restart and doing that in a loop for eternity until I restart Steam. It also freezes up on start if you did something wrong, so unless you can shaft it with certainty it will lock up your computer and make it difficult to close.\n\n- Surprisingly, the super powers. Monster trucks? Alright. New VTOL clones? Sure. Super Sprint and Super Jump? Trumps LITERALLY all of them. Ok, maybe you'll need the VTOL for quick air travel and it helps that you're instantly warped into the vehicle now if you call it in, but the Glide upgrades for the Super Jump make this point null and void. You even shove cars out of the way using Super Sprint, and I don't see any normal Torch or Solar doing that any time soon.\n\nVERDICT:\nSaints Row IV is a good game that manages to fit comfortably with me between the "so edgy I could cut myself on the box" Saints Row 2 and the "Look at me carrying a big purple floppy dongle while doing a mission drugged and in the nude smacking Europeans in the face with it" Saints Row: The Third. For a game that started out as DLC for SR:TT, I would happily take this game over that DLC any day. TL;DR 10/10 buy it right now and experience it for yourself.","September 25, 2014","true","23.5"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

The gameplay is like InFAMOUS with those superpowers, combined with the original sandbox Saints Row formula, it makes for a good combination. I still have not finished the game at the time of this writing, but I'm 8 hours in with 30% game completion, so this game might take a while to beat if you're looking for collectibles and amassing upgrades for your character.\n\nStory is like one of those movies where you fight off aliens, and you're not only the Gang Leader of the Third Street Saints, but also the President of the United States, how awesome is that? The game's story is also expanded through the DLC, adding characters that didn't make the cut in the game. This game also has this Mass Effect-style dialogue system at certain points of the game, but don't quote me on that since I never played Mass Effect. Character development is pretty good, so not all of the characters will come up unestablished, though you'll might have to play the predecessors or read more about the characters to know how they started. Celebrities like Keith David (Foley in MW2, The Arbiter in Halo, Julius Caesar in SR of course) make an appearance in the game.\n\nI'm impressed about how Volition crammed so much content in one package, buying this with the Ultimate Franchise pack is a great deal, shoutout to my bro Andi Rain for hooking me up with a great deal. Coop is awesome and you should definitely have a friend with you to make the game better.\n\nIf you're interested, Andi Rain has made some interesting videos on the game, feel free to check them out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AndiCRIMSON","October 28, 2014","true","59.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","15","19","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/os74/recommended/206420/","os74","Ctrl-Alt-Del-U","http://steamcommunity.com/id/os74/","40 products in account","Wow I actually made this review long (and I might add to it over time). It might contain some minor spoilers, nothing that'd ruin the experience though I don't think.\nThis game feels more like a wacky mod for Saints Row 3 than anything, and it's hard to look at it any other way. Let me break this down.\n\nThe graphics.\nI had to turn those down quite a lot to get the game to run well on my system so I can't judge those, I will mention that a lot of assets (cars, pedestrians...) are the same as in SR3, which I guess could be called lazy but I didn't find them bad looking so why not use them in a newer game.\nI appreciate the option to reskin guns, adds some variety. On the other hand the character customisation system seems to have actually become WORSE, with the colour selection even worse than in SR3 and some pieces of clothes causing minor glitches (some tops combined with the Arm Warmers will cause your wrists to float in the air disconnected from your body), plus the selection of clothes is rather limited. Overall customising my character didn't feel nearly as fun as it did in the previous game, partly because 80% of the time my character is glowing cyan so I can't see much of her anyway.\n\nThe sound.\nThe voice acting is alright, sometimes the subtitles don't match what my character is actually saying but it's not the worst. It's a little weird that Female 1 voice reuses a lot of her lines from SR3 but they're re-recorded, not sure why they didn't keep the original lines or come up with new ones, but again, no big deal.\nThe soundtrack is significantly weaker in my opinion. I do like some songs, but the number was much higher in the previous game.\n\nThe gameplay.\nMost of the time you have superpowers which basically render every other means of transportation obsolete. I often realised I no longer even perceive that I'm in a city with cars and people, it feels more like a huge sandbox for superjumps, wallruns and other things that may sound like a lot of fun, but basing the whole game around them is just not something I can appreciate. I liked how SR3 felt like an action movie, whereas SR4 feels more like a shoddy Spiderman spinoff movie of sorts. Didn't hit home with me.\nThe game has a ton of minigames in the form of activities or certain missions, often thrusting you into an alternative reality where your superpowers don't work and you're often forced to use terrible guns, not to mention things like restoring health work differently in the different dimensions. It gets confusing at times.\nSome activities are nipple-twistingly boring and/or annoying and/or difficult while some are insultingly easy.\nEvery chase in the simulation builds up to a miniboss fight which as soon as you've got some upgrades means this: dragonball the thing, shoot it twice, jump into its belly and engage in some keyboard smashing QTE hogwash. Sometimes the pace it requires you to spam keys at is physically impossible to achieve unless you suffer from a rare type of controllable convulsions so you have to do it several times before it works. Who thought this was fun?\n\nThe story.\nIt's a blatant Matrix ripoff. I guess we call that "paying homage" these days but really, it's a Matrix ripoff. The main storyline was just a little too short and straightforward for my taste (and full of plotholes, hell, even the premise itself is fundamentally flawed, but let's just go with it). The humour feels a lot more tryhard and tongue-in-cheek than in the previous game, but it's not unbearable.\nMost of the side missions are just sets of several activities to do, so if you want to finish all the missions, that means doing 100% city takeover gameplay. Which you probably have to do anyway to have the upgrades necessary to even survive the main missions, which can get difficult at times. Most of the game just feels like a grindfest. A grindfest I'm really not too keen on going through again, so consider that a thumbs down for replay value.\n\nThe conclusion.\nI'd say SRIV is inferior to its prequel in nearly every way, although I can imagine the changes in gameplay might actually appeal to a different sort of gamer than I am. Even if I wouldn't go as far as to call it a bad game, it simply didn't get me as invested and immersed in it as SR3 did.\nIf you've played SR3 and can't decide whether to get this, just ask yourself: "What was SR3 missing?" and if your answer is "Bloody platforming", go for it.\nI'd sure recommend waiting for a discount though, the base price is really steep for what you get.\n\nTL;DR\nNot as good as SR3. Too expensive. And I never thought I'd say this about anything, but: Too silly.\n\n(edited on 15/08/21 after playing the game some more)","June 29, 2015","false","76.3"," 65 of 111 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","65","111","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/206420/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSaints Row IV is an Open World Action world, which a delightful mix of humor and drama, the game starts out playing as a third person shooter, and then switches over to feeling like you're playing a super hero game.\nI've actually been putting off writing this review because I've been having so much fun playing through the game a second time. That should speak volumes for itself.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  "Greetings Mr./Ms. President your immediate attention is needed regarding the problems of ruling the entire United Sates." *Zap zap zap*"*Gasp* who are you?" We are the Zin and we come in peace. "Really? you just killed three of our secret agents and ruined the press conference"  psych! *pew pew pew*\nI don't want to give anything away specific about the story, simply put your crew has been abducted by aliens and it's your job to save them and bring down Zinyak to save the human race. The story is full of humor, I found myself laughing aloud at the countless references and the ways these characters interacted with each other.\n\nGame Play: As you play through the game you unlock various "super powers", from sprinting, to running, to firing ice, telekinesis, or ground stomp. The super powers flow seamlessly with the story, and genuinely make game play pleasurable to experience.\nIn addition to super powers, you also have various weapons that you can use, my personal favorite was the energy-sword (of course), but you had guns, hand to hand combat, laser guns, regular guns, rocket launchers, and many alien weapons that get unlocked as you play through the game.\n\nAchievements: The achievements on this game are broken down into four categories: 1) Main story achievements. 2) doing all the things, and probably missed the first time through achievements. 3) DLC achievements. 4) Broken achievement\n1) As the title implies most of the main story achievements you get just by playing through, you will get close to 10-15 achievements just playing through. 2) The achievements I ended up missing were a few grinding achievements that I could do at the end of the game, in addition to doing the side missions AFTER the last boss... so I need to play through the whole game again. (normally this would be immensely annoying for me, but this game is definitely fun a second time through) 3) You need to buy the DLC, and I don't own it at the moment.  4) I'm highlighting this because if you want to get 100% for this game, it is impossible at this time (2/6/2015) because one achievement requires you to connect to saintsrow.com, and there was a recent shut down for the provider of that service, so you can no longer upload a character from in the game (or log on within the Saints Row IV Client, for that matter). I was able to successful log into my saints row account and upload a character on 09/27/15.\n\nPrice:  The standalone version without any DLC is priced at $19.99, that is a fair price based on the amount of time I've personally put into the game, and this is a game that can be replayed and enjoyed again, If you already know you like the saints row series, you should probably go for a Game of the Century Edition, or Ultimate Franchise Pack. As always, waiting for a sale is most beneficial to your pocket book, but this game is totally worth every dollar.\n\nConclusion: This game is going on my top list for favorite games I've played, I've also learned how to identify some qualities in games that I tend to really enjoy playing, from playing Saints Row IV. To quickly recap, The story was hilarious, and entertaining, the game play was excellent, The achievements were great except for the broken achievement, the price is fair.\nThis game appeals to most people, but especially people who enjoy open world games. I should add one comment regarding tech requirements, the game came out in 2013, so it was rough on my personal computer, I tried troubleshooting, but in the end just kept playing, even though the game crashed occasionally. ----Still love the game.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update January 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Saints Row IV: How the Saints Save Christmas\nEdit/Update February 26, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Saints Row IV - Enter The Dominatrix\nEdit/Update April 17, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Saints Row: The Third\n\nEdit/Update September 27, 2015:\nBroken achievement fixed.","January 6, 2015","true","89.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/206420/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Note: I got paid to write for reviews4views website.\nSaints Row IV is more insane,looney, and absurd than its last installment from the weapons, super powers,vertical exploration and story. The Saints are the only ones left of the human race to stop their species from being completely annihilated. Being divided and separated as prisoners of multiple alien ships you as the leader are tasked on bringing them back together for the final confrontation.\n\nProgression\n+Multiple parts to a quest (better integration with narrative)\n+Switch between real life and simulation missions\n-Main missions can get repetitive\n\nThere is multiple times where you will wake up from the simulation in order to do main missions that are important in order to confront the alien leader. The missions somewhat repeat since you are ultimately saving crew members over and over, but they tend to change up the narrative and the weapons available when doing so.\n\nQuests can have multiple parts to them, depending on how the scenario develops, which flows better with the narrative. Making quests integrated better with the narrative was one of the main goals of the company since the third saints row game.\n\nSide-Missions\n+Great variety of rewards (weapons)\n\nThe side missions offer a great variety of rewards from beating the objectives. Generally to get the rewards you will have to talk to your crew once you complete the list of quests they have for you. Not all rewards need to be claimed through the crew in order to obtain them especially the ones you get through stimulated instructions and customization quests.\n\nThe variety of gameplay is still strong here and very much like the last saints row, except a bit more geared towards superpowers in this installment. Each power has its own challenges you can find throughout the city whether its racing super fast paced checkpoints or using your telekinesis to throw people,cars, and objects through flashy points in a race against the clock.\n\nSimulation - World Design\n+Vertical Exploration\n-Same steelport as Saints Row 3\n\nLocating them is the hard part - the simulation which is the main component of the game and where the free roam is at. It’s basically the map of steelport with some aesthetic changes, if you were looking forward to a brand new environment then you will be sorely disappointed. The only thing really added to steelport was more vertical exploration (aka) the actual beacon towers you can climb up and activate.\n\nFree Roam\n+Super powers make exploration feel fresh\n-Vehicles and their customization becomes pointless\n\nFree roam feels different in this game due to the super powers you gain. The super speed and ability to jump high really make traveling feel completely different and somewhat fun. This however ruins the point of traveling with vehicles and makes them nothing but background decoration and weapons to use in confrontations with their occasional use in side missions. Unfortunately making the vehicle customization pointless to even bother with besides gaining respect that’s not really worth the time investment into it.\n\nSuper Powers\n+Powers offer new ways to combat enemies\n+Elements are ways to change outcome of powers\n\nThe superpowers take a bit of exploration in order to really build up power in them since you are required to get the data packets scattered around the city. Don’t worry though by no means are they hard to find you can even do a mission that gives you the location of all of them on the mini-map. The superpowers have a decent amount of customization you can do to each power.\nThe elements change the outcome of powers, which results in 16 possible combinations of different abilities. For example adding explosion element to stomp will allow you to make huge area of effect chain explosions occur. Putting mind manipulation on your powers will also you to bend enemies to your will.\n\nGear\nThe weapons like the previous game have a great variety and come in all sorts of looney fun. Especially the weapons in the special category that are around 12 of those. The weapons have two ammo types, being cooldown and reload. This is especially good for players who normally deplete alot of their ammo since they can switch to a cooldown weapon that they don’t have ammo capacity for, or they can simply upgrade the capacity for weapons they do hold it.\n\nCustomization\n+Vehicle Customization\n+Homie Customization\n\nVehicles can still be customized from increasing durability, turning, and speed attributes to the paint job with body rigging. The cars are saved in your garage once you are done with your customization job, though it would be nice to be able to re-organize the list of vehicles in your garage. You can get rid of vehicles from the garage and keep solely the ones you want but there is no seeming way to actually change the order.\n\nCollectibles\n+Good variety (Drug Package, Money Pallet, Sex Doll, Photo Op)\n\nThere are 80 collectibles scattered throughout the city, in which appear as random events you can participate in or collect. They are a great way to earn some cash in-between missions while you are free roaming. Though the only reward collecting them all is the 10% increase in game completion for the save.\n\nPhone\n+Ability to call backup (vehicles,homies)\n+Collecting money simplified\n\nThe ability to call backup is very helpful when you are in dangerous situations. Especially useful since it pauses the game essentially for you to start the call, not dieing when navigating menus is always a nice thing afterall. You can recruit up to 3 homies to help you at once, but once you hit the max it will not allow you to attempt to recruit anymore at the time. You also need to run to your homie to revive him so he can continue to help the homies.\n\nCollecting money has been simplified to the point where you just need to open your phone and click on the icon to retrieve your earnings from all the places you tookover. Not having to go to a business or crib to collect money is a real welcome change.\n\nConclusion\nSaints Row IV is a pretty good game despite its flaws and drawbacks as a result for reusing not only the same city but introducing super powers that undercut the fun of customizing vehicles and trying to steal awesome looking sports cars from pedestrians.","March 18, 2015","true","31.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Saints Row 3 was an absolute masterpiece. My advice is to buy everything for SR3, play through it twice and if you're still aching for more, then go ahead and pick up 4. This game was supposed to be a DLC for the previous game, but the company who made it went under and this was marketed as a full sequel... Only it isn't. It's a hackney'd moneygrab that chared full retail for something that should have been released for $15.\n\nIf you can get this and all of it's DLC crap for $10 or less, then I say go for it. Otherwise, just wait a few more months and get it for what it's worth.\n\nIf you haven't played Saint's Row 3, then by all means buy that instead. It's one of the best game experiences I've had in over a decade and it's a shame that it's greatness will likely never be repeated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/recommended/206420/","Crazher","Crazher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/","3275 products in account","This will contain NO spoilers (except those seen in the SR4 videos/screenshots here on Steam, aka aliens and superpowers).\n\n"Haters gonna hate" and all that. Despite the harsh, and mostly unjust criticism (SR4 is not a DLC), this game brings a lot to the Saints Row table. If you at all enjoyed SR2/SR3 for either the story or the gameplay (ignoring how poorly the third-party contractor that ported SR2 to the PC did), you will definitely be in for a treat with this game.\n\nSaints Row 4 is NOT a DLC-sized game, in any sense of the word, the DLC SR3 was supposed to have (called Enter the Dominatrix (ETD)) is becoming a DLC for SR4, not SR4 itself. ETD is scheduled as being part of the Season Pass for SR4. It simply makes more sense that it is put into SR4 rather than SR3 as well, because the story of it all fits much better. The only sense of simulation seen in SR3 was seen at the nuke plant.. And  I would make more comparisons as to why, but that would be spoiling either SR3 or SR4 story.\n\nThe story adds a great, although admittably odd, turn of events in the Saints' story - An alien invasion, and the Boss' newfound superpowers (realism went out the door in SR3 anyway, do not deny it). Despite how farfetched this sounds, the story does have all the classic Saints Row moments with either vulgar or downright crude humor, it offers the same back and forth between the characters as previously seen in the series. You are still fighting gangs in Steelport, but also quite often aliens, of course. The story has been met with very hesitant views and closed eyes, but I would like to be one to say that I enjoyed the story. I do not know if I am just more open to an alien invasion as part of the Saints' story, or if I do not know what makes a good story, but I had a lot of fun with it. Additionally, it wraps up a lot of loose ends in the Saints Row continuum, ranging from SR1 to SR3's stories, and  it opens up a lot of possibility for future DLC.\n\nOf course, there is also the usual mayhem that follows the Saints; Genki has got some new plans, there are new tools of mass destruction, heck, even new vehicles of mass destruction, some activities make a return in SR4, with some new ones as well. Oh, and on top of that, can you imagine what kind of carnage you can bring to Steelport with superpowers?\n\nThe biggest downside to the game, in my point of view, is that its set in the same old Steelport, with some changes. The game does use alternate areas quite a lot (for missions), which brings you around to old places (think SR1 or SR2) or new places that are outside of Steelport, but you always return to Steelport after your mission is done, which does get a bit lackluster if you played over a hundred hours of SR3 as well.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I was not at all disappointed at all, and can with certainty say that most reviews are done by bandwagon people clinging on to the whole "SR4 is a DLC thing". I am very excited to see what they can come up with in regards to DLC missions/stories. There are so many hilarious and interesting possibilities to be put into the series, especially with how the story played out in the end (no spoilers)!","August 27, 2013","true","143.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","11","13","8","2"

This game is so over the top and throws just about every crazy idea out there to entertain you, and it all comes together and works.\n\n+ Given the nature of the game with its over the top antics, the writing is surprising excellent. On more than one occasion I was laughing at how witty the dialogue was and the different scenarios that game puts you in.\n\n+ The main missions are well thought and varied. In addition the loyalty missions you can accomplish for your crew mates are equally refreshing and varied.\n\n+ Lots of different activities to do in the game. From causing mayhem, to platform jumping to racing, the game has no shortages of things to do.\n\n+ Lots of collectables that are easy to find that upgrade  your superpowers to be even more powerful. There are plenty of things to upgrade your character, so that by the time you are finished with the game you are practically a walking death tank.\n\n+ Insane amount of customization for your character.\n\n+ Superpowers are really fun to use.\n\n+ Graphics are beautiful.\n\n+ Roddy Roddy Piper\n\n+Cheesy music that just adds to certain scenes making it more memorable\n\n+ Creative DLC\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- If you played Saints Row 3 then the city should be familiar to you because its exactly the same.  I think its a bit cheap when a sequel to an open world game uses the exact same layout as the previous game.\n\n- The 'side quests' in this game is nothing more than standard activities you can do throughout the world. The only good thing is that you can complete these activities before a NPC gives it to you.\n\n- I experienced a few bugs and glitches.  It didn't ruin the overall experience but they were noticeable.\n\n- Some of the achievements will require some grinding.\n\n- DLC although creative, was a bit on the short side.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nA game thats all about having fun at your own pace.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/206420/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","At its best, Saints Row IV is a love letter to the franchise. At its worst, the game is just a copy and paste of Saints Row The Third with aliens and superpowers.\n\nSuperpowers! Blast, Telekinesis, Stomp (each with varying elements like Freeze or Fire), Super Jump, Super Sprint (previewed in SR3 The Trouble With Clones DLC) and several more form the core of the game play, and are the primary attraction. Why take a car when you can run faster than a car? Is that building in your way? Jump over it. Too tall to jump over it? Not to worry: you can wall-run! Need to take out that group of enemies? Sure, you can use guns; but why not drop into the middle of them and stomp your foot once to send them flying? Much easier! The catch is that the superpowers do make the game generally easy (the Superhero Fight Club activities being the frustrating exception).\n\nThe story of Saints Row IV is, of course, completely over-the-top. But that's not out of place in a Saints Row game. Rescuing members of your crew requires visiting a simulation of that homie's worst nightmare. There are some fantastic nostalgia trips (you even revisit some of the original Saints Row game) and funny satire (no game or movie is exempt, not even Metal Gear or Mass Effect). Much of it is accompanied by a great selection of songs; shooting up a Genki challenge with a certain character (long thought dead) while “The Boys are Back” was hilarious. While not every character from the franchise appears, all the major ones do.\n\nThe downside is that Saints Row IV is, at its heart, a copy-and-paste of Saints Row The Third. Steelport is virtually unchanged; the city map is exactly the same. Activities are exactly the same; Tank Mayhem, for instance, is the same activity with an alien Zin tank instead of an Abrams tank. The planes and aerial vehicles are reskinned SR3 models; they fly and function exactly the same. Hijacking cars is even still a thing; the in-game explanation makes sense, but doesn't hide anything else. With superpowers, cars are a waste anyway. Weapons are unique and fun; but if you've played Red Faction: Armageddon, more than a few will be familiar (Volition developed both games). There's a lot more, but you get the idea.\n\nIf you're looking for originality and uniqueness, you won't find it Saints Row IV (outside of the superpower implementation, which is superb). If you're looking for a game that is simply a blast to play – one that will make you laugh far more than it will make you scream in frustration – then absolutely get this game. In a time when all forms of entertainment are getting more serious, the absurdity of Saints Row IV is an absolute breath of fresh air.\n\nOn DLC:\nAs with so many games today, there is too much DLC. At least the Game of the Century Edition includes everything.","October 23, 2015","true","71.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

As if Saints Row: The Third (SR:TT or SR3) didn't ramp up the over-the-top nature of the series, SR4 takes it to another level on the absurdity, ridiculousness, insanity, humor, parodies, jokes, punchlines, crassness, wittiness + fun. SR4 tries to out-do it in numerous ways - and in many ways, SR4 succeeds in doing just exactly that.\n\nAfter the crazy events from SR3, The Leader of The Saints has now become The President Of The United States. After this + putting Keith David (who plays himself!) in the Cabinet, an alien named Zinyak (who is fantastic + often hilarious, I might add) invades Earth + enslaves everybody into a Simulation World similar to The Matrix. To break free of this, The Saints are on a ship (which reminds me of the Normandy from Mass Effect series) and they try to fight the battle in both the Simulation + Real World to free themselves from this insanity. As if SR3 wasn't ridiculous enough, this here takes things here in SR4 to another level. With also tons of references to events, characters + whatnot from previous SR games - this game also is a Love Letter from Volition that written is directly to their fans that have stuck with them since its inception.\n\nFor SR4, you can forget what you know from SR3 about gameplay. This isn't as much of a GTA-style 3rd-person action game where you do most of your moving around the gameworld by driving vehicles - especially when you're in the simulation-world. While you can still do those things in the simulation world + in the "real world", most of the time (which'll be spent in the Simulation World) SR4 takes this to the Prototype series + super-hero side of things. Once you're in the simulation-world, you can run up walls, run around the game-world ultra-fast, knock cars over, jump wicked high - which is a lot of fun + a new way to run around a SR game-world. You can even switch the radio station of the game, while you're not even in a car!\n\nFor parodies, jokes, punchlines + anything humor-related - knowing your pop culture from music to video games certainly helps. The humor never ends, as it take stabs at Mass Effect series, BioWare games (Romance mechanics), 50's classic TV shows (such as Leave It To Beaver), video games (there are Mortal Kombat references, for starters), entering pop culture icons playing themselves (Roddy Piper + Keith David), breaking the 4th wall entirely, twerking + so many other things that I don't know where to begin here. If one joke doesn't hit you, it'll be too late b/c the next one will likely have already hit you, leaving you likely in hysterics.\n\nThe only thing SR4 really has going against it here is re-used assets. This feels more like a classic-style big-sized expansion-pack - which stands alone, in this case (since you don't need to own any game to run this here). The game-world from SR3 was reused + might feel overly familiar to players - even though it has been modified, re-tweaked, reworked, reskinned, revamped + remixed. Sure, there are some new areas - but most of the time, you'll be in the huge Simulation World.\n\nWhen it's all said + done - after spending around 27 hours with SR4, this game has delivered lots of laughs, fun, insanity, wittiness, jokes, action, nonsense, fun & "I can't believe the game went there" moments. SR4 might not have the freshness that SR3 had with its actual game-world (since Steelport from SR3 was reused + remixed here for SR4) - but even that can't stop this game from being fun to play + a barrel of laughs. SR4 still manages to deliver so much fun, comedy, jokes + the new super-powers direction - that it's impossible to not enjoy what is here. So many games take themselves so seriously these days, but SR series always seems to be that breath of fresh air gaming needs every time that another one comes around. Not many game series are as over-the-top, funny + as ridiculous as Saints Row - yet Volition manages to keep delivering that every time out, knocking it right out of the park. If that isn't enough of the icing on the cake, here's the cherry on top - fans who have loved the previous SR game, this game is a Love Letter from Volition that is most definitely for you.\n\nFinal Grade = B.","August 5, 2014","true","27.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

However I started with the second game and was amazed at an actual fantastic story about gang violence and the ups and downs of the crime life. It was fantastic with great fun gameplay and exciting mission variety. The third was a turn in the direction of nonsensical sillyness. The fourth continues on this trend much to some chagrines, I personally think its refreshing. I love a game that knows its not taking itself seriously and is just meant to be fun and over the top. The funny thing is this is the best "super power" game out there. This game is fantastic and even better with the fully drop in drop out coop with a friend. You can play every second of this game all the missions everything with a friend. Its a fantastic coop experiance. If you and your friend like screwing around in a virtual world THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! This game is pure rediculous fun. Its a game where the devs did not forget to make their game fun.

My favorite parts of the game are the characters, story, the fun of blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, and the amusing weapons. I'm talking to you Singularity Gun and Dubstep Gun. Other than that...\n\nThe game feels recycled 70% of the time because you'll be running around the same city of Steelport and doing the same activities with super power twists. The super powers are both good and bad. It's good because you get to wreck stuff like you're Superman, and be able to run around the city like you never could in SR3. It's bad because it made certain mechanics pointless. Why would I even bother driving a car or drive a jet? I can run faster and jump higher. Why do I need to call my homies? I can blow everything away with my fire blast. Enemy AI is still stupid and the 'new' enemies are just reskins from SR3. Character wardrobes feature is fairly limited. Old clothes and tattoos return, but there are only few new ones. It feels like a rip-off they locked away some of the costumes as paid DLCs.\n\nSaints Row 4 is an over-glorified expansion pack for Saints Row the Third. Aside from its funny story, great characters, and fun factor, as a whole, the game is not worth buying at full price. It's a great game for 20 dollars and despite what I said in the second paragraph, the game is still good and very fun to play.

Its an open world game where u play as the president of 'Merica. An alien race known as the Zin invade Earth and eventually blow up Earth killing 7 billion people and you and ur crew of 5-10 must go to a simulation of Steelport and apparently isthe only way to kill the leader, Zinyak.\nThere are tons of stuff to do in this game. Its kinda like Skyrim but its set in the modern times. As you make progress in a Simlated City, you will get super powers like jumping higher than Mario and running faster than Sonic. You can also gain powers like shooting a blast of ice, fire, farts and money. Steelport is a huge world as there are certain objectives like take control of Hotspots, Flashpoints and Towers which affect Zin and other enemies. There are also store that must be hacked before purchasing whatever they have. There are stores like Tatoos, Guns & ammo, Clothes and Garages. There is also something called Data Clusters scattered literally everywhere you see. These Data Clusters are used to upgrade your Super Powers. Speaking of Upgrading, you can upgrade yourself like Weapons, Health, even your Gang like their health and weapons. There are even i guess you can call them mini-games since you have a time limit to get a certain amount of cache (not cash). Like big games like Grand Theft Auto V and Skyrim, Saints Row 4 is a glitchy game which is no suprise.\nI give this game 9 out of 10 because there is a lof of buildings but yet you cant even enter many of them.

Some of the following may not apply if you play this at a sane rate.\n\nA huge amount of how you feel about SR4 is probably going to relate to how you felt about SR3, because not-really-a-spoiler: your open world is 99% Steelport again. (There are minor changes.) Even being given extra time after the implosion of former publisher THQ, this game was clearly originally an expansion, and some parts of it really show that corner-cutting when you play through it. On the plus side, though - some of the reuse is done in actual clever ways, and this is where I come to my huge divide about the game: the gameplay gets really, really tired at times, but the writing is pretty sharp.\n\nThis game was a pretty clear sendoff/love letter to the franchise, going as far back as SR1 and a whole lot of nods to the earlier titles the further you go along. In fact, probably the entire back half of the game* is winking fanservice to SR1/2 and the stuff that 3 dropped a lot of. Let me point out: none of it is what I'd call "half-♥♥♥♥♥", either. They seriously got the original VAs from these games to replay their roles, made entire mini-arcs for them, and added optional content to the point of letting you recruit some deep cut characters. Or, if you buy the "complete" edition with DLCs - just plain cut characters.\n\nI could go on and make a huge list of the ups and downs of this, but basically, do you want to run around a virtual world as a superpowered god, causing mayhem and comedy in your wake? That's this game. It's a superpowered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.\n\nI will give one handy tip, though: upgrade the alien weapons, no matter whether you like them or not. You're going to be stuck with them on more than one mission. Don't get shafted like I was and enter some of the late-game stuff with level 0 guns doing piddly damage.\n\n(Side-note: if you're like me and really dig sites like The Cutting Room Floor and exploration of dummied-out/cut/scrapped content from games, you really owe it to yourself to buy the Enter the Dominatrix DLC, which is basically an extended look at what the original scope of this game was going to be when it was just an SR3 expansion, complete with commentary.)\n\n* Note: back half of the game also consists of a lot of stellar burns on Mass Effect.","January 29, 2015","true","33.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

People complain about it not being DLC to saints row 3, If this was DLC to saints row 3, it would have to be one of the biggest DLC's to any game I've ever seen, Let's just take a look at all the new features to this game.\n\nNew Weapons, New Characters, More New types of enemies than in the previous games, 65 Power Upgrades, Multiple new Homies, More Body Customization, More Weapon Upgrades, 111 Weapon Skins, More Vehicals, More Vehical Customization, 1600 Collectiables, New Activities, Brings back Johnny Gat, Brings Back SR2 Shaundi, Has Keith David voice both himself and Julius, Has the upgrade system from Saints Row 2 and it Takes you back to Stillwater to please older fans.\n\nPeople who complain about this basically being a saints row 3 DLC or that it's nothing much more than Saints row 3 are just wrong, plain and simple.\n\nStorywise, Yes it's a ♥♥♥♥ take right from the very start. And I can understand people feeling like this was a bad way to continue on from the last few games. However, I'm a huge fan myself of games that involve alot of comedic relief so I didn't find anything wrong with it personally. As a saints row story, It's not dedicated to the last few games, But as a standalone game, the story is amazing, hilarious, intense and just downright insane. You don't see that in many triple A games nowadays so this definately pleased me.\n\nThe Replayability is Great as always with the Saints Row Games, I've just completed my second playthrough and am currently working through a third one.\n\nAnother issue people found with this game is that Cars are pointless because you now have super powers. My thoughts on this are, At the start of the game, you don't have access to many super power upgrades and to even buy them, you have to slowly collect clusters one by one to then purchase them. You also have the option to purchase unlimited Nitro boost for vehicals and with the added extra vehical customization I mentioned earlier, Driving cars is still alot of fun in this game and I still use them quite a bit during my gameplay.\n\nI'm just rambling on here so I'll finish this up. This game has its flaws, but they are highly overshadowed by the amazing expirience of the game itself. Without a doubt or any second thought, This is my Top game of 2013.\n\n10/10","February 14, 2014","true","73.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This time after saving the world, stopping a nuke from taking out Washington, DC, becoming President of the United States and creating One Nation, Under Yourself comes the latest installment in the franchise, An Alien Invasion. Captured by the ruthless alien leader intent on breaking you down, you must navigate through an elaborate simulation, tearing it down piece by piece as you fight to reclaim your freedom, and restore the Saint's and the Oval Office back under your control.\n\nVisually, Saints Row IV looks sharper as a sequel, the story is interesting, though a little "Out of this world", (sorry, I couldn't help it) The controls are similar to Saint's Row: The Third, but I think the AI is a little smarter this time around. Headshots take a lot of enemies down in one go, but the aliens might take a shot or two, and they will try to outflank you. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, as it is a lot like the GTA Series, but with it's own unique flair.

It did. Some people got really upset that it changed its overall tone from violent, somewhat dark gangster/crime stories to a very loony and lighthearted tale, but I personally believe that it was for the better.\n\nSaints Row has become something very different. The weirdness is cranked so far that the knob is now broken, yet this Saints Row has the most character development I've ever seen in the series. The game makes callbacks to previous titles, and isn't afraid to give more depth to the characters' motivations and their concerns.\n\nGameplay wise, it's fun but it gets tired after you unlock enough powers and abilities to make any gunfight a cinch. Thankfully, the characters and dialogue are interesting enough to keep things going. If you like serious games, this isn't for you. If you like crazy, hilarious fun, this is most likely up your alley.","April 16, 2014","true","19.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

All I can say is "Grand Theft Auto" wish it could be this silly, stupid, and unserious. Its just so bizzarre and different from its older games and is absolutely entertaining and long lasting. It combines both the gangster elements and put into an anti alien-heroism story of funny and idiotic proporations of you being the President of the World on crack. The overall music soundtrack of this game is just awesome, and the just the overall gameplay and story parodies of characters are all so whacky that you will love it all. Its very fun with a co-op partner and just being stupid and stir some crazy is what makes the game hilarious, its not meant to be taken seriously like GTA is. Apart from the fun gameplay, many objectives and activities of the game will get pretty repetiitive  real quick after awhile.

A sandbox with a delinquent hero on my command.\nJust like with FPS and generally games with lots of violence, Saints Row much like Grand Theft Auto didn't appeal to my eye, until I was offered me the fourth installment of the series as a gift. And oh boy, wasn't it a pleasant surprise.\nI love to blow stuff up, and I sure as hell love to do it to those who want to claim Earth, so this was the first step. Slowly but steady, the stunning character renders just won me with their realistic expressions, their lines always keeping me entertained, and it doesn't end there. I'll try to keep this short, I promise.\n\nExcellent story concept? Check. Doesn't matter if it's far-fetched and not one with the real world, it still makes sense as a concept.\n\nSatisfying combat action? Check. Causing mayhem is a piece of cake and with a plethora of weapons and upgrades, beating enemies up is never a tedious task in this game. I'd say the mayhem trigger system is the same as Jak II, yet the combat here is way easier, but I should probably not carry on with comparing the game. I did see Jason Rubin somewhere around the credits though... ;P\nOh, and the vehicles were all really cool. While not being a fan of them in general, the ones in the game were so fun to drive. Oh how I love to perform stunts while driving like a lunatic in a simulation, haha.\n\nStunning graphics and awesome characters? Damn yeah check. Ascending from a street gang leader to the President of a country sounds so unreal that ends up sounding awesome. In a video game, that is. But the concoction of this category's elements was clearly too delicious for words. How could I not love playing as the supposed President of the USA who pretty much looks like an Australian hippie? Haha, but seriously, Obama, Bush, Clinton, and those before them, I wonder if they ever had to go through similar tasks?\nThe voice acting was flawless as well, my jaw dropped as I witnessed the credits! Let's not forget the references, MGS, various internetic memes, oldschool game tokens and easter eggs and so many more which were a real source of humour for the whole game.\nVirtual Steelport looks lovely too, and with all the glitches it's just plain hilarious. As one progresses into the game and crushes the simulated world, it all gets so much more interesting. The character uniforms are eye-candy too, just look at all that purple and the fleur-de-lis badge. Makes me appreciate purple as a colour, really.\n\nKickass music? Epicly huge CHECK! Not only was the game's soundtrack itself spot-on, but the radio song choices were also ever so upbeat and cheerful! I discovered many new songs to smash the replay button for, as well as have fun in town in my own way. Even my DJ-wannabe self came back to life temporarily. XD\n\nLook at me saying I'll keep this short. Oh well...\ntldr, THIS, WAS, AWESOME! So many good feelings, so many good thoughts, I just feel like I had one of the best parties in my life after finishing this game. I had fun in every single second of it. If you're into this kind of games, you've already got this game and most likely beat it since it's nearly 2 years since it came out too lol. If you're not, then I still recommend it to you, since it's still a beautiful experience. The Saints Row franchise has earned another eager fan.\n\nAnd by the way, if you're reading this Edo, you're a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome friend, and thanks for giving me this game. Can't wait to blow ♥♥♥♥ up with you again. Like the President did with his old bud Johnny Gat. Also thanks for bugging me all winter long to do so in the first place.","March 1, 2015","true","67.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/recommended/206420/","partialbiscuit","marciN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/partialbiscuit/","981 products in account","Just to make things clear, I want to point out that I wasn’t a huge fun of Saint’s Row The Third, even more so, I hated it. I didn’t liked what Volition did with Saint’s Row franchise. Even though i didn’t like previous installment of SR, I have decided to pick up this game and review it.\n\nI wasn’t expecting gangster-type Saint’s Row when I bought this but I had a big expectations from this game and I have got to say I wasn’t disappointed. Firstly, you start the game as a president of the United States which is a clever idea and it got me thinking, what are they going to come up with next year, will you be playing as God? anyway let’s get to the point. You start the game as a president and of course Aliens invaded the Earth and then destroyed it, yes, you read this well, Aliens have destroyed our planet, just like that. Only some gang members have survived including, Pierce, Shaundi, Johny Gat and others, so now it is your mission to get out of the simulation and defeat Zinyak( Leader of the Aliens).\n\nFor some reason Zinyak, doesn’t want to kill you, in fact he transforms you into this simulation(clear spoof of Matrix) and what is funny is the fact that he allows you to have superpowers and i have got to say superpowers are the most fun thing to have in the game. Instead of travelling by car you can just run around or fly around which is extremely convenient and fun but there are also some problems that I have with them. If you have ability to fly and super sprint through the town you won’t be using cars, AT ALL which is a shame because the developers have improved vehicle customization and with your superpowers these improved aspects of customization are useless.\n\n\nLet’s get to the story, I actually really liked it. It was funny, full of sexual jokes and some great references from the other Saint’s Row games. Even at one point you get to visit Stillwater and fight some bosses from previous games. Although I did had some problems with side missions, some of them were ok, especially the Super Homie missions, but others were repetitive, ”go to point a, fight some aliens and then go to point B” type of missions but I had to complete them because I really wanted to get my hands on Dubstep Gun, Black Hole Gun and other really hilarious ones. As for the story, I don’t want to spoil anything but I really hated the last boss fight with Zinyak. It was cheap and frustrating, I expected something more… fun I might say but overall the story was hilarious.\n\nFurthermore, I did had some fun playing minigames although some of them weren’t as good as other. In my opinion the best minigames are Insurance Fraud(of course) and Mech Mayhem. Text Adventures were fun as well. Other minigames were…well…acceptable.\n\nLastly, Saint’s Row 4 offers us a decent but hilarious story, good character customization and of course superpowers. You will definitely have a lot of fun with this game especially if you could convince your friend to play it with you. But I’m a bit sad that the car customization is pretty much useless just because your superpowers, It would be better if the developers gave you the superpowers after you finish the game or after 50% completion, but this is just my opinion. Besides, If you didn’t liked the previous Saint’s Row, you should really give it a try and If you are a huge fan of Saint’s Row 1 and 2, you might be a bit disappointed by the lack of seriousness.","March 9, 2014","true","24.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I enjoyed it, but want more! :)\nAs a parody it is really good. Humor, epic, pathos - everything's here as before.\nBut when you've done all side missions (those with dry boring briefings) and collectibles, world seems empty and pointless to stay, besides with the only one type of enemies.\nCompared to The Third it's not better or worse, just different.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/recommended/206420/","AngryBoz68","AngryBoz68","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/","377 products in account","A very fun and unusual game.\n\nSaints Row IV incorporates the best features from SR3 but also enhances many of the most lacking elements of it's predecessor.  It does appear however that the game engine and graphics had changed very little or not at all, which may disappoint those wanting a significant upgrade to the visuals.  The game does look decent on the PC but does seem to be a bit behind other recent titles.\n\nI did not think that Volition would be able to go even more "over the top" than they did with SR3, but they somehow managed to do so, and in a way that fits the game very well.  At no point did it seem that the humor in the story was forced or placed for the sake being there.\n\nThe campaign is very well scripted and dialoged.  I did particularly like the banter between the various members of the Saints.  The game has a great antagonist in the alien overload Zinyak who has a witty English accent and a very Bond-esque villain personality.  The game also finds a lot of ways to include throwbacks to the previous titles in the series, which should please those who have played those games.\n\nThe main theme behind the game borrows heavily from some favorite Sci-Fi action films like the Matrix (1999) and They Live (1988).  Most of the gameplay is in a very Matrix-like virtual city of Steelport where the player has to free other captured friends and attempt to break out of the simulation via hacking and disrupting.  Much like the Matrix, you spend a lot of time switching between a real-life ship and the virtual city of Steelport, and super powers are learned in the virtual world as the player learns more about how to master and disrupt the virtual environment.  There is a TON of missions and side activities to keep the player busy and many of the familiar side activities from SR3 make a comeback with some fun twists (though Snatch and Escort missions are omitted this time, YAY!)\n\nBiggest complaint I would see is in the super powers that the player gets in the simulated Steelport.  While they are great fun and add a very interesting element to the gameplay, the powers will render the automobiles and many of the weapons obsolete.  The gameplay with superpowers in the open world does greatly resemble that of games like Prototype, Crackdown and inFamous, so the game does feel more like a really good super hero simulator or Matrix game rather than a GTA style crime game.  The player will also find the game not too challenging with upgrade super powers, but the great writing, over-the-top gameplay and humor makes up for the lack of challenge.\n\nOverall the game continues to shamelessly build on the over-the-top gameplay that SR3 did and further distance itself from GTA and earlier Saints Row titles.  The result turned into something rather unique and it seems that Volition has become rather adept at creating a very fun and zany game that does not take itself too seriously.  If you liked the direction that SR3 took with the series then you will probably enjoy this game as much as I did.","October 14, 2013","true","53.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

Except this time you are now the President of the United States.\n\nYou are abducted by aliens and put into a simulation, which you must escape. In the simulation you gain superpowers. From the ability to jump great distances, to freezing enemies, there is a lot of powers at your disposal. As well as the superpowers, you gain a whole ton of wacky weapons, such as the dubstep gun or anal probe.\n\nThe gameplay is a ton of fun, and the ability to play with a friend makes it so much better. There is a huge amount of side missions/activities to keep you busy as you roam around the simulation.\n\nThe game originally started out as a DLC for Saints Row the Third. But it feels absolutely nothing like one. The main campaign is around 15-20 hours long, and there is a ton of extra content to keep you busy as you play. The developers stated they scraped most of the original DLC version of the game, to instead make this a full retail release. And it is just like any other. In fact, it provides more content than most $60 titles these days.\nPeople also criticised the fact it uses the same map as SR3. These people are idiots. Don't listen to them. Many games do this, and no one ♥♥♥♥♥es then. It's just another silly reason to write this game off as a DLC.\n\nA possible downside to the game is that superpowers make using vehicles seem a bit pointless, especially late game. But all of that customisation is there for those who still wish to use it. Also, with the missions in which you exit the simulation, movement can be a bit of a drag as you run at normal speeds again. Luckily the missions are not very long, and the feeling of being slower wears off quickly.\n\nOverall an amazing game. Possibly my favourite Saints Row. I especially recommend this to people who love 2-player co-op games.","March 22, 2014","true","53.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It's a well put together game that can keep you occupied for hours, even days even you like freeroaming.\n\nthe flaws of this game in my opinion is how they've layed the powers out, the speed and jump power in particular. I think they're very over powered and leave you with no reason for using cars since you can go faster than cars and jump really high, getting around the island is far too quick and easy, whats more, without needing to use cars theres not much point in customizing cars. I think the speed and jump system needs to be lowered down and limited alot more, atleast add it to the game further on, because these are the first powers you get so the game gets easy far too quickly and spoils alot of the free roaming adrenaline (if you know what I mean).\n\nhaving power limitation would be alot more helpful too, I know that things can have a cooldown, which are not that long after upgrading it, but having a power bar (like a mana bar kind of thing) would be nice too, including it to only be restored from killing drops just like health.\n\noverall it's a great game and I would recommend it, I would also recommend playing on a hard difficulty since it's a little too easy and overpowered quite quickly in.","April 17, 2014","true","32.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's a ton to collect, a huge amount of side missions and just the references that are layed out throughout the game to other games are hilarious.\n\nMy recommendation: If you have a sense of humour and just want to mess around, buy it.

In fact, my friend and I had a super hero battle for about an hour and playing telekensis catch with people. The game is a lot more fun than i thought it would be. I have had a few glitches on it but you can easily quit the mission and go back to it. I love character customization and this game has one of the best.

You'll kill him but you won't be able to stop him from launching a nuke at washington. Boss climbs on top of the nuke and does what he does best. The game then goes forward to the future where the BOSS is now president of the United States.  As the crew makes it to the White Crib, an alien invasion hits the boss and captures everyone. Then they are proceeded to be put into a simulator where the game begins and all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe gameplay is not just like any other third person shooter in the series but since the game takes place in a simulation all hell breaks loose. You will not only run around in this openworld sandbox game but you'll gain superhuman abilities to fight the aliens. You'll get reminded of prototype with these sort of powers such as glyding or leaping at buildings and using guns out of all sorts. One favorite is the dubstep gun or the shrink ray. There are so many new variety of weapons to choose from. Aside from that there are scattered quests and objectives you can do to level up yourself. You can do alot of customization on your character and steal and ride cars but lets face it. Cars are useless when you have power.\n\n\nThe game didn't revolutionize anything in the openworld sandbox genre nor did it level the game's graphic by updating the engine. Cars are useless in the beginning and some of the quests sets could be done better. The outrageous badly written story that is funny, really well picked music, and the hilarious jokes involved in this game makes up for it. The game is downright fun and the weapons are fun as well. With the sale and all dlcs this is a must have title if you want to kill some time with shennenigans\n\n\n\n\n\nVidoe Review -http://youtu.be/by1G4IaFjng\n+ Really fun to play, openworld superhero type of game\n+ new costumes, quests, guns etc\n+ Outrageous story, very funny and parodies of pop culture, games, movies, etc. If you don't get it you need to go out more.\n+superhero type gameplay\n+ Music selections that fits the game\n+Playing with friends in coop quests\n+Dubstep Gun\n\n-Can get repeititve because of recycled quests seen in previous SR games\n-uses the saints row 3 engine so feels like a giant dlc. Good for people who ran saints row 2 previously and want to run with what they have, bad if you own a powerhouse of a pc and can't really utilize its power to max potential.\n- cars become absoutlely useless early in the game because you get POWERS! why drive when you can fly and smash.\n- Powers is easily earned, but can get repetitive collecting orbs","August 7, 2014","true","15.8"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","17"

Saints Row 4 is lacking so much in both story and game features that made the previous games, even SR the Third, compelling, interesting and fun.  Many other people have said much the same before, though, and so much better and more thoroughly so I'll just keep this fairly brief.\n\nSR4 feels like a mere retrospective, a fond looking-back at the glory days of the series, lots of "Hey, yeah, remember when THAT happened?  That was cool." callbacks.  As much as I admire Volition, I feel sad that they've basically painted Saints Row into a corner with no way back to the heart and soul of its early days.\n\nTotally coincidentally, the one thing I discovered that SR4 is totally GREAT for is allowing me to re-experience that heady super-hero "feel" that I've been missing since NCsoft shut down City of Heroes.  The super-jumping alone gives me flashbacks to CoH like crazy, and that's really really hard to object to.

The game I've been waiting for ever since I didn't like the Matrix games!  Saints Row IV takes you on an epic journey from President to alien slave to superhero!\n\nSaints Row IV is a violent good time.  While I have not played coop mode, single-player mode is awesome.  I like the super powers a lot.  The first two are exactly like the movement powers you may have seen in the Prototype games, super speed and high jumps.  Later powers get more combat oriented, and most of the upgrades are useful.\n\nThere are a lot of hilarious antics going on around you, and the music is sometimes enough to make you laugh.  Think South Park style humor then Matrix style fight-the-man resistance (starring you, the former "The Man") with a bunch of other crazy little aspects.\n\nThere are some glitches.  You can get stuck very easily early in the game if you jump on some simple boxes.  It upset me a lot because it meant I had to replay the most boring part of the game: the intro.  That said, if you try not to jump around too much there, the later levels let you jump as much as you like.  Also, I experienced some friendly AI characters going crazy and trying to kill me... no real explanation.  I guess that's alright. Just more cannon fodder for my plasma pistol.\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid 5/5.  It's as fun as a game could be.  It doesn't take things seriously, but it gives you enough story to care about what you're trying to accomplish.  It had great visuals, that SR3 art style we all love, and tons of video game cliches.","August 22, 2013","true","62.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeroLimeGuy/recommended/206420/","NeroLimeGuy","Sedra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeroLimeGuy/","175 products in account","I'm going to get kind of long-winded into this review, and i'm not too good with intros, so here's the short version.\nShould you buy this game? Yeah.\nIs it worth full price? No.\nNow, let me elaborate.\n\nSaint's Row IV is a direct sequel to the third, What's new? You're the president! Does that make a huge effect on the plot? Not past the first 2 missions, it doesn't!\n\nWhat else? You have superpowers! Aaaand they suck, let me get into that now.\nFirst, Saint's Row III had superpowers a la "The Trouble With Clones", it was awesome. Why? You had this, please excuse my use of this overused phrase... "Epic" scene in which you, now filled with superpowers, are racing to save your friends whilst dramatic music is playing. That was awesome! However, in SRIV, you have superpowers since some of the first missions, the novelty wears off really fast, especially when your only form of movement is pretty much Super Speed and Super Jump. Yes, you can upgrade the jump to a glide. No, it doesn't make it any more novel.\n\nNext point, The particular story of this game is FULL of plotholes. Here are a few examples.\n•Zinyak has wiped any trace of the Saints from Steelport. Doesn't stop you from buying Saint's clothing, including one that has "Saints" and "Steelport" on it.\n•Something happening in the virtual world can definitely make an alien mothership go boom.\n•If Zinyak can spy over you and toy with the Simulation as much as he wants, why not just remove any chance you have against him?\n•Image as Designed has been renamed to "Imagined as Edges". the IAD logo is still seen on the menus, and inside, characters still refer to it as Image as Designed.\n•I'm sorry, i can't get over this, THEY ♥♥♥♥ING RETCONNED JOHNNY GAT'S DEATH\n\nNext point: This game. Runs. Terribly.\nOh sure, pass off some of the glitches as the Simulation's fault. They're still there. Distorted bodies and stretchy textures. Just look at my screenshots. This game apparently crashes waaaaaaaaaay more than SRIII. though it only happened twice for me.\n\nAlso, something i should add, there are several collectables in orbs you need to break with a later power.\nThe collectable hitbox is too big for the orb. You can just grab it through it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIt pretty much runs the same way as SRIII, but that's not what i'm getting at.\nInstead, i'll talk about the gameplay elements.\n\nRemember that awesome side mission in SRIII where you did nothing but buy stores? No? well, a good portion (And by that i mean about 75%) of the side missions are based around activities. They don't even have any story, like in SRIII, it's just "Talk to me, do activities. Return.",  It gets boring after 2 missions, and yet 75% of the side missions are exactly this. It doesn't help that there are about 6 different iiterations of Mayhem.\n\nThe game is short. Like, really short. It took me 2 days to beat it, although, to be fair, i did fall asleep whilst the game was still open. Only today did i 100% it, which is... strangely dissatisfying, You don't feel like you've conquered the world, you feel like you've flown around for 3 hours collecting blue clouds.\n\nCars are essentially useless now, your first superpower is to run faster than them. Need i say more?\n\nOkay, here's everyone's main gripe with this game. Volition got laaaaazy.\nThe game takes place in a simulation of Steelport. They removed a few buildings and added some towers, but that's all they changed. There's also a point where you have to play through the plane from SR3, but in reverse.\nThe explanation? This was originally DLC for SR3. But that's still no excuse.\n\nThere were several moments of the game i enjoyed, some of the gags, obviously, because it's Saint's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Row. But the other thing i liked was weapon costumes, which gave you several options for what you want your weapons to look like. Don't like MAC-10s? Turn them into laser pistols. Don't like an M16? turn it into an LMG. Don't like a rocket launcher? TURN IT INTO A POTATO CANNON!\n\nThe game seems to have an equal amount of feats and failures, but in the end, i enjoyed it. About the same i had with SR3. I think it's about time i wrapped up the review.\n\nDid i enjoy this game? Yes.\nDid i enjoy it more than SR3? Maybe.\nWould i replay it? Prehaps, given time.\nDo i reccomend you buy this game for it's current price of $20? No. Get it on sale, that's what i did.\nLong story short, The game is fun, i reccomend you buy either this or SR3, but if you already own SR3, then only get this on sale.","February 17, 2015","true","74.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Games in the Saints Row franchise have all had some sort of deep customization. Players can create exact replicas of themselves, or even turn into whatever they desire. Although in this addition to the series, we are not left disappointed. The possibilities are endless. Would you like to go around shooting people with Dual Wielded SMGs? You can do that!  Want to shoot up a store with Han Solo's signature blaster? You can do that too! Whatever you sick little mind can come up with; you can do it.\n\nGameplay:\nLooking back at Saints Row: The Third, you'll definitely notice how many of the activities have reappeared. Some of your favorites such as Tank Mayhem and Insurance Fraud. Although, in this addition to the franchise, the activities have gotten far more challenging; giving the player a harder time and not making the game drift away so quickly. For example, when you're ragdolling your character around the city in Insurance Fraud, you'll need to gain a certain amount of money to either earn Bronze, Silver, or Gold!\n\nCity Upgrades:\nIf you've played any of the other Saints Row games, you've probably noticed the lack of aerial combat. That has changed completely in Saints Row IV. When the developers added the VTOL hover-jets and rocket cycles, it just makes the game feel that much more entertaining. We've also seen improvements on the vertical areas of Stilwater, it's far easier to throw yourself off the top of a building to a quick and easy death. That is, only if you don't have your superpowers activated ;)\n\nRemoval of Importance:\nRemember in the previous Saints Row games when you had to earn "respect" from your crew and gang? They've removed that and simply changed it's name to XP. While this makes sense due to the scenerios and there only being about nine humans technically alive. It still makes the game feel a little less like the classic "Saints Row" style game.\n\nCars and Music:\nBasically since this game takes place almost entirely inside a computer simulation, you can do some pretty awesome things. One of them being that you can hijack a car and then "upload" it into your virtual garage. Later on, you can simply "download" it to wherever you may be on the map. It's pretty much the same as the cars, but now you can play music wherever you may be. Yes, you read that correctly. You don't even need to be in a car! This adds a whole new level of excitement to the game, and makes it much more enjoyable.\n\nOverall:\nOverall, this game was fun to play through and gave me plenty of time driving around and killing ferocious aliens.

Liike running up building and jumping from rooftop to rooftop.\n\nThen you got the weapons the most iconic gun in the SR4 arsenal to me is the Dubstep Gun :D, its a pretty dam fun gun to use, there is dlc to give you a remixed dubstep gun which you can change the song on it which then always changes how the gun acts.\n\nThe Story So far has been awesome, a great ride (still going as i write this) has never been a dull moment in this game even just roaming around collectables and hacking all the shops can be made very very fun ^-^\n\nThe DLC content also looks and sounds good, more mission, costumes, clothing, weapons all that good stuff with even more to come!\n\nA must buy even at full price, if you on the fence then just try it at a friends house or whenever they do another free weekend.","January 21, 2014","true","41.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Games in the Saints Row franchise have all had some sort of deep customization. Players can create exact replicas of themselves, or even turn into whatever they desire. Although in this addition to the series, we are not left disappointed. The possibilities are endless. Would you like to go around shooting people with Dual Wielded SMGs? You can do that!  Want to shoot up a store with Han Solo's signature blaster? You can do that too! Whatever you sick little mind can come up with; you can do it.\n\nGameplay:\nLooking back at Saints Row: The Third, you'll definitely notice how many of the activities have reappeared. Some of your favorites such as Tank Mayhem and Insurance Fraud. Although, in this addition to the franchise, the activities have gotten far more challenging; giving the player a harder time and not making the game drift away so quickly. For example, when you're ragdolling your character around the city in Insurance Fraud, you'll need to gain a certain amount of money to either earn Bronze, Silver, or Gold!\n\nCity Upgrades:\nIf you've played any of the other Saints Row games, you've probably noticed the lack of aerial combat. That has changed completely in Saints Row IV. When the developers added the VTOL hover-jets and rocket cycles, it just makes the game feel that much more entertaining. We've also seen improvements on the vertical areas of Stilwater, it's far easier to throw yourself off the top of a building to a quick and easy death. That is, only if you don't have your superpowers activated ;)\n\nRemoval of Importance:\nRemember in the previous Saints Row games when you had to earn "respect" from your crew and gang? They've removed that and simply changed it's name to XP. While this makes sense due to the scenerios and there only being about nine humans technically alive. It still makes the game feel a little less like the classic "Saints Row" style game.\n\nCars and Music:\nBasically since this game takes place almost entirely inside a computer simulation, you can do some pretty awesome things. One of them being that you can hijack a car and then "upload" it into your virtual garage. Later on, you can simply "download" it to wherever you may be on the map. It's pretty much the same as the cars, but now you can play music wherever you may be. Yes, you read that correctly. You don't even need to be in a car! This adds a whole new level of excitement to the game, and makes it much more enjoyable.\n\nOverall:\nOverall, this game was fun to play through and gave me plenty of time driving around and killing ferocious aliens. Although it kind of seems like a let down, it feels just like a large expansion to Saints Row: The Third. I still recommend it, as it has a unique story and will give you many laughs along the way!","November 24, 2014","true","19.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The first game was widely written off as a GTA knock-off, and to be fair it mostly was. However, there were hints at greatness even then, from lightning you could summon with your cell phone to a voodoo priest that could revive dead allies as zombies. Having been there since the very beginning, it did my heart good to see the overwhelming positive reaction to The Third, and Volition has struck while the iron is hot with Saints Row IV. The project started as standalone DLC when the company was owned by THQ, and has now morphed into a full retail release. Many have been asking, is this worth the full price point knowing that? Yes.

The story is insane.. and sometimes that's not good. After Saints Row: The Third, it was obvious that Saints Row would not be serious anymore.. and that's fine.. but a lot of stuff in the story just doesn't make sense and can't be looked past. How could someone who has literally murdered 1000's of people (a lot of them innocent) become president? The super powers are the biggest thing for me though. Yes in Saints Row IV you now have super powers.. awesome right? Not really. When you first get powers and start using them, it is in fact pretty awesome.. then it soon wears off and you realize how overpowered you really are. There is also basically NO need for cars.. since you can super speed run faster than them and also you can fly. After the first few hours I literally never used a car again. The game is still fun for screwing around with when you're bored though, but I would only recommend it to people who wanna do that. I'm going to say click "recommoned" because I wouldn't not recommend it.. but I'm going to rate it 6.5/10.","September 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/206420/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""Mr Anderson, welcome back"\n\nThe latest game in the Saints Row series has gone through a lot before we got to play it ourselves. Originally intended as a DLC for Saints Row: The Third, it was expanded far beyond that, and then the original Publishers for the series, THQ, went bust and this was picked up by Deep Silver. This could have been a very different game, but rather than consider what might have been, I'm here to let you know what we did get. So on to the review.\n\nStory\nThe game opens up with a mission where you and your crew need to stop an old enemy from attacking the US with nuclear weapons. Once you have obviously succeeded at this, you then spend several years as the President of the United States before Earth is attacked by aliens. After failing to fight back, you find yourself in the Matrix, and must learn to use this to your advantage so you can stop the alien leader and save the planet. That is all in the first hour, and only gets even crazier as you get further in the game. Its just a little over the top, but they had to outdo the previous game somehow. Saints Row has become all about having a crazy story, and Volition didn't want to disappoint.\n\nPresentation\nIn these aspects, the game has changed little from the previous release. Everything still looks pretty much the same, other than a few effects showing off the fact that you spend most of the game in a simulation, such as pixelization of surroundings, and the occasional glitched character (don't worry, they are meant to be messed up). The voice acting is just as good as the previous game as well, with the characters sounding as they did the last time you spent taking on enemies of the Row. Sound effects don't appear to have changed either. All of it makes it obvious that while it might have gone far beyond the original plans, this was going to be a DLC for an older game.\n\nNow, the soundtrack at least has seen some additions, but also the loss of some older stations. The metal of The Blood is no more along with the loss of WDDT and Kabron. It instead has Mad Decent for your rap needs and Four 20 with a mix of reggae and dub. Fortunately, if you share my taste in music and listen to The Mix, you will still be satisfied by the quality of the music even if we can't sing The Final Countdown. Looking at the full selection of songs, it might not be as good as it was in Saints Row 2, but the playlist available in this game is still impressive. A nice little feature they also included is the ability to play music outside of a vehicle. Very happy with that, as you may not spend much time putting up with wheels.\n\nControls\nAnother place where there have been few changes, the controls have gotten away with only a few minor tweaks to take into account the powers you have access to. Grenades have been removed so they had somewhere to map the powers, and taunts as well as recruiting and dismissing gang members now require you to hold as those keys are also used to toggle your powers. Everything else still works as it did in Saints Row: The Third.\n\nGameplay\nNow, here is where all the changes will be found. To start with, it plays just like Saints Row: The Third. Get a car, drive around, etc. But early in the game,you start picking up data clusters and taking down the Wardens of the simulation, allowing you to unlock special abilities. Running around as fast as a car and jumping like Spider-Man, then later then gliding around as if you were that guy in Prototype. Suddenly, you have little reason to even bother with a car. Not only can you cover more ground outside of one, you won't find most of the clusters needed to upgrade your powers without hopping around the rooftops to collect them. This very quickly makes most vehicles a waste of time outside of missions and moving around your useless homies.\n\nWait, did I just call your homies useless? Why, yes, I did. Sadly, when you move around like a demented grasshopper and can shoot fireballs or make earthquakes, some guy with a pistol won't cut it, and they can't even follow you most of the time. I hate it, but you just won't call them up for help, but only because an achievement will unlock after spending enough time with a few of them. Some of the more important homies will eventually gain their own powers by doing certain side missions, but even they are rarely needed on your various quests.\n\nWhile the changes to the game have made both vehicles and your gang unneeded, the missions themselves continue to be highly enjoyable. From flying through the sky as you chase your current target to giving the smackdown to brutish aliens, the most important part of the game does the job and keeps you busy until you reach the end of the game. You have a significant number of main missions to work on, as well as all the side missions to unlock enhanced homies, extra powers, new weapons and even a new costume or two. Getting everything out of the way will take many hours of fun.\n\nLifespan\nEven after completing the main story, there is still enough to do to keep you busy for a while after the credits roll. Each of the takeover activities now has different ranks, allowing you to try for a Gold on each of them. As well as that, you can also work of completing the Challenges, but running around, jumping as much as you can, and wiping out hundreds of aliens in as many ways as possible. And even after you have done all of these and gotten a 100% save, you have the option of doing it all with a friend.\n\nAs you can see, this game is great, though not without a few flaws. Still, it is easily worth a purchase. I can't deny it was money well spent.\n\n8 / 10","January 29, 2014","true","36.9"," 29 of 53 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","29","53","0","0"

Solid, funny writing (parody galore), over the top action as you would expect from a Saints Row game. If you like the humour from last game, you won't be dissapointed. The super power gameplay mechanic plays pretty well but this game feels like it should have been an expansion rather than a full release (hence only buy it when it's on sale). The mechanic is expanded from what they had with 'Trouble with Clones' DLC from Saints Row 3 so if you enjoyed that, you'll definitely like this.\n\nFairly short game. I fnished all main story, loyalty missions, side missions and all collectibles except for the data clusters (super power upgrade currency) in about 20 hours. Plenty of padding with the side missions which is basically a set of activities. If you are not really a completionist, you can probably blitz through the main story and loyalty missions (worth doing) pretty quickly.\n\nTechnical side, no problems or game breaking bug encountered during my playthrough.

Shazbot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowJello/","900 products in account","Field        Rating        Comments                Graphics        8.0        Graphically, this isn't all that much of a step up from the last entry. While they aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination, they leave a little bit to be desired considering it's the same engine, same city, and mostly the same characters and vehicles.                Soundtrack        7.5        The music on the radio stations, while not bad, leaves a lot to be desired. After the amazing soundtracks of Saints Row: The Third and Saints Row 2, I feel as if we should have expected more from this one. All-in-all though, still a pretty good, not so bad soundtrack.                Sound Effects        8.5        The sound effects throughout the game range from disappointing to absolutely perfect. A lot of the lower tier weapons (mostly the ones you are more likely to find in the real world) lack any kind of real umph, making them feel weaker than I feel they were intended to be. The more creative weapons, however, generally get me excited at the very thought of pulling them out. There is no joy like unleashing the power of the Dubstep Cannon.                Story        9.0        As Saints Row has shown with its previous installment, it pulls no punches as far as going as ridiculous as they can possibly go. As the newly elected President, it is your job to save the world from an oncoming alien invasion, getting abducted and sent into a Matrix-like simulation of the city from the third game. The main difference is that, since it is no longer grounded by the rules of reality, you can now develop superpowers as you progress through the game's story and side missions. While remaining silly and over the top throughout, Saints Row IV still manages to keep you attached to the characters, keeping small quirks and emotional moments right where they need to be. The only major complaint that I had with this story is when you do reach the end of the game, the ending boss fight leaves a lot to be desired, and the bad guy is not in the game nearly as much as he should be.                Overall        8.25        While I'll admit I was a little bit disappointed to see that this game took place in the same city as the last game, the new abilities really gave the game a face lift for me. It still packs the hilarious punch of the last game and provides you with something all together new to do. If you're looking for a game like Grand Theft Auto or the first three Saints Row games, honestly, I'd keep looking, but if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a more Prototype-like experience, I would highly recommend this one.\n\nYou can skip on most of the DLC though, it's mostly pretty disappointing.","February 20, 2015","true","42.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is definitely an end to 3 when you've basically completed all the missions -- I don't know if the same thing happens in 4 or not. There's a lot of room to play in the first 50 hours.

While different from its predecessors, in that it goes “matrix” on you, it still has all the outlandish carnage and comedy of its forbearers all wrapped in a polished gameplay experience. For those achievement/item collecting ♥♥♥♥♥s out there, this game provides plenty of opportunities to fulfill such desires. Although some activities can feel repetitive, the sheer ridiculousness of most situations still makes it an enjoyable experience. The backstories of each character are hilarious and fun to discover. The occasional flash-backs to various iconic video game styles is also a nice touch. Achieving 100% control of Steelport and completing the campaign will leave you feeling accomplished but also a tad bit sad, driving you to start a brand new game as an entirely different character altogether. My only negative with the PC version is the extremely poor multiplayer matchmaking. If you do not have friends that play the game it is almost impossible to find somebody to play with through steam matchmaking. Despite this, one can find people to play with through the forums. Overall Saints Row IV is one of my favorite games of the past year.","March 6, 2014","true","66.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The storyline is competely over-the-top and makes so many references to popular culture that would be far too numerous for me to mention here. Imagine yourself being put as the main protagonist as you save the world from an alien invasion. But instead of a tired cliche, you get suprisingly well-defined controls for running, driving, fighting, shooting and exploring this world that doesn't take itself too seriously.

What you don't know is all the crazy referential jokes included in that as well. Saints Row IV Is a complete and total ride, and it was so much fun from start to finish. Let me break this down for you:\nStory: 9/10\nAs a sci fi nerd, I enjoyed the hell out of the story. Yes, it is a bit barebones, just you become president, aliens attack and abduct you and your crew, then blow up the earth, and you want revenge. Simple right? Well, sort of. The main villian Zinyak really makes you hate him by the final confrontation. He takes over the radio, changes things in the simulation, and belittles you to the very end. Just another one of those villians you love to hate. All the main characters in your crew are back from the last one and beyond, and all have much to say. There are these loyalty missions where you usually do unfinished buisness from their personal nightmare while giving them superpowers as well. Every single one was a lot of fun, and I don't regret any of them. Overall, the story is crazy and fun as well as quite good, but not perfect, but worth every second I put into it.\n\nGraphics/Sound: Graphics 7/10 Sound 10/10\nNormally I wouldn't split these, but it really needed to be done in this case. The graphics are alright. Beyond the amazing sci fi night scenery of Steelport, the graphics aren't too much to write home about. The sound however is what kills it. Although, to be more specific, the music. The radio is much better in this game. AI woul refuse to listen to anything but the 80s channel, and beat dudes up to saftey dance, and it was so good! Plus theres killing people in a mech suit to "You've Got The Touch", and so much more. The music is great!\n\nOverall: 9/10\n","December 17, 2013","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Solid, funny writing (parody galore), over the top action as you would expect from a Saints Row game. If you like the humour from last game, you won't be dissapointed. The super power gameplay mechanic plays pretty well but this game feels like it should have been an expansion rather than a full release (hence only buy it when it's on sale). The mechanic is expanded from what they had with 'Trouble with Clones' DLC from Saints Row 3 so if you enjoyed that, you'll definitely like this.\n\nFairly short game. I fnished all main story, loyalty missions, side missions and all collectibles except for the data clusters (super power upgrade currency) in about 20 hours. Plenty of padding with the side missions which is basically a set of activities. If you are not really a completionist, you can probably blitz through the main story and loyalty missions (worth doing) pretty quickly.\n\nTechnical side, no problems or game breaking bug encountered during my playthrough. I think it only crashed once.","December 14, 2013","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ups and Downs all around. Here is the plot\n\nAfter years of fighting gangs, the Saints become celebrities. Next they become special ops soldiers and take down a Terrorist: Cyrus who was the old former leader of the STAG. The Saints take him down and also disarm the bomb that could have wiped out America itself. The Boss (You) becomes president after the operation. Out of the blue an alien race drops into earth and takes all the humans into capsules in their ship. They are placed in a simulation living there nightmare. Will the saints save the world?\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nThe Gameplay is pretty fun. The superpowers are a cool addon giving you some fun fights with your enemy aliens and also helps you travel a bit more faster than usual. There is superpower upgrades that will give you powers such as blasting fire or freezing your foes. The problem about this is well.. The vehicles and some weapons are useless. Pistols are useless after you gain some skill and firepower with your Powers and vehicles are pretty much just there. There is some fun vehicles and the planes are still useful but there is no good use to the vehicles when you have fast running and jumping. Its not all that fun to use cars when you could just fly. The boss battles are entertaining though. Specially the huge Can that you have to fight. There is a good difficulty in the game that doesn't put a lot of difficulty spikes when playing which is always annoying. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay rather that it is fun but it is not something you could play again and again. Maybe 2-4 times you could replay this game but the Story is short. You can take about 8 hours of gametime just finishing the campaign. Its decent.\n\nSound and Music:\n\nSounds: 7.5/10\nMusic: 7/10\n\nThe sounds in this game are very refined and not bad quality. It also has the amazing dubstep gun that will never get old because it is sooo much fun! The sounds overall is good but the gun sounds are very weak. Good voice acting too!\n\nThe music is decent. There is some radios that isn't really something you would listen too all day but there ok. The music soundtrack for the game is good. The Armagaddon reference and parody with the Aerosmiths: Don't wanna miss a thing and some other songs are also there which references other media (Even What is love is there)\n\nOverall some good sound and music for the ears.\n\nStory: 7.8/10\n\nThe story is OK. It is not some great revenge story or some a fun alien movie. The thing that makes it great is the characters and dialouge, They are funny! It also mocks Mass Effects with the relationship system and some love-love scenes. There is nothing else to say but the Villian is brilliant. The story is feels a little to short though\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\n\n+Fun Characters\n+Fun Gameplay\n\n- Too short\n- Inefficient weapons as you progress\n- Very Useless vehicles as you progress\n- You being the President is not expanded. You only feel like a President for like 5 minutes","June 22, 2014","true","41.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While they aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination, they leave a little bit to be desired considering it's the same engine, same city, and mostly the same characters and vehicles.                Soundtrack        7.5        The music on the radio stations, while not bad, leaves a lot to be desired. After the amazing soundtracks of Saints Row: The Third and Saints Row 2, I feel as if we should have expected more from this one. All-in-all though, still a pretty good, not so bad soundtrack.                Sound Effects        8.5        The sound effects throughout the game range from disappointing to absolutely perfect. A lot of the lower tier weapons (mostly the ones you are more likely to find in the real world) lack any kind of real umph, making them feel weaker than I feel they were intended to be. The more creative weapons, however, generally get me excited at the very thought of pulling them out. There is no joy like unleashing the power of the Dubstep Cannon.                Story        9.0        As Saints Row has shown with its previous installment, it pulls no punches as far as going as ridiculous as they can possibly go. As the newly elected President, it is your job to save the world from an oncoming alien invasion, getting abducted and sent into a Matrix-like simulation of the city from the third game. The main difference is that, since it is no longer grounded by the rules of reality, you can now develop superpowers as you progress through the game's story and side missions. While remaining silly and over the top throughout, Saints Row IV still manages to keep you attached to the characters, keeping small quirks and emotional moments right where they need to be. The only major complaint that I had with this story is when you do reach the end of the game, the ending boss fight leaves a lot to be desired, and the bad guy is not in the game nearly as much as he should be.                Overall        8.25        While I'll admit I was a little bit disappointed to see that this game took place in the same city as the last game, the new abilities really gave the game a face lift for me. It still packs the hilarious punch of the last game and provides you with something all together new to do. If you're looking for a game like Grand Theft Auto or the first three Saints Row games, honestly, I'd keep looking, but if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a more Prototype-like experience, I would highly recommend this one.\n\nYou can skip on most of the DLC though, it's mostly pretty disappointing.","February 20, 2015","true","42.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The main difference is that, since it is no longer grounded by the rules of reality, you can now develop superpowers as you progress through the game's story and side missions. While remaining silly and over the top throughout, Saints Row IV still manages to keep you attached to the characters, keeping small quirks and emotional moments right where they need to be. The only major complaint that I had with this story is when you do reach the end of the game, the ending boss fight leaves a lot to be desired, and the bad guy is not in the game nearly as much as he should be.                Overall        8.25        While I'll admit I was a little bit disappointed to see that this game took place in the same city as the last game, the new abilities really gave the game a face lift for me. It still packs the hilarious punch of the last game and provides you with something all together new to do. If you're looking for a game like Grand Theft Auto or the first three Saints Row games, honestly, I'd keep looking, but if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a more Prototype-like experience, I would highly recommend this one.\n\nYou can skip on most of the DLC though, it's mostly pretty disappointing.","February 20, 2015","true","42.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ups and Downs all around. Here is the plot\n\nAfter years of fighting gangs, the Saints become celebrities. Next they become special ops soldiers and take down a Terrorist: Cyrus who was the old former leader of the STAG. The Saints take him down and also disarm the bomb that could have wiped out America itself. The Boss (You) becomes president after the operation. Out of the blue an alien race drops into earth and takes all the humans into capsules in their ship. They are placed in a simulation living there nightmare. Will the saints save the world?\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nThe Gameplay is pretty fun. The superpowers are a cool addon giving you some fun fights with your enemy aliens and also helps you travel a bit more faster than usual. There is superpower upgrades that will give you powers such as blasting fire or freezing your foes. The problem about this is well.. The vehicles and some weapons are useless. Pistols are useless after you gain some skill and firepower with your Powers and vehicles are pretty much just there. There is some fun vehicles and the planes are still useful but there is no good use to the vehicles when you have fast running and jumping. Its not all that fun to use cars when you could just fly. The boss battles are entertaining though. Specially the huge Can that you have to fight. There is a good difficulty in the game that doesn't put a lot of difficulty spikes when playing which is always annoying. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay rather that it is fun but it is not something you could play again and again. Maybe 2-4 times you could replay this game but the Story is short. You can take about 8 hours of gametime just finishing the campaign. Its decent.\n\nSound and Music:\n\nSounds: 7.5/10\nMusic: 7/10\n\nThe sounds in this game are very refined and not bad quality. It also has the amazing dubstep gun that will never get old because it is sooo much fun! The sounds overall is good but the gun sounds are very weak. Good voice acting too!\n\nThe music is decent. There is some radios that isn't really something you would listen too all day but there ok. The music soundtrack for the game is good. The Armagaddon reference and parody with the Aerosmiths: Don't wanna miss a thing and some other songs are also there which references other media (Even What is love is there)\n\nOverall some good sound and music for the ears.\n\nStory: 7.8/10\n\nThe story is OK. It is not some great revenge story or some a fun alien movie. The thing that makes it great is the characters and dialouge, They are funny! It also mocks Mass Effects with the relationship system and some love-love scenes. There is nothing else to say but the Villian is brilliant. The story is feels a little to short though\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\n\n+Fun Characters\n+Fun Gameplay\n\n- Too short\n- Inefficient weapons as you progress\n- Very Useless vehicles as you progress\n- You being the President is not expanded. You only feel like a President for like 5 minutes","June 22, 2014","true","41.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What you don't know is all the crazy referential jokes included in that as well. Saints Row IV Is a complete and total ride, and it was so much fun from start to finish. Let me break this down for you:\nStory: 9/10\nAs a sci fi nerd, I enjoyed the hell out of the story. Yes, it is a bit barebones, just you become president, aliens attack and abduct you and your crew, then blow up the earth, and you want revenge. Simple right? Well, sort of. The main villian Zinyak really makes you hate him by the final confrontation. He takes over the radio, changes things in the simulation, and belittles you to the very end. Just another one of those villians you love to hate. All the main characters in your crew are back from the last one and beyond, and all have much to say. There are these loyalty missions where you usually do unfinished buisness from their personal nightmare while giving them superpowers as well. Every single one was a lot of fun, and I don't regret any of them. Overall, the story is crazy and fun as well as quite good, but not perfect, but worth every second I put into it.\n\nGraphics/Sound: Graphics 7/10 Sound 10/10\nNormally I wouldn't split these, but it really needed to be done in this case. The graphics are alright. Beyond the amazing sci fi night scenery of Steelport, the graphics aren't too much to write home about. The sound however is what kills it. Although, to be more specific, the music. The radio is much better in this game. AI woul refuse to listen to anything but the 80s channel, and beat dudes up to saftey dance, and it was so good! Plus theres killing people in a mech suit to "You've Got The Touch", and so much more. The music is great!\n\nOverall: 9/10\n","December 17, 2013","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well Saint's Row IV might be something you wouldn't expect it to be.\n\nLet's get down to it,We all saw this coming eventually becuase of the sucsessful sales of SR3 and i guess the fact that alot of us wanted this sequal to happen.So Saints Row IV first takes place in Afghanistan or some ♥♥♥♥ where you start figthing terrorists or some ♥♥♥♥ and then nutrulize a nuke that was heading to Washington or some ♥♥♥♥..Basicly the beginning was epic,That already deserves credit. So the game continues as you're the president of the US which sadly dosen't really continue on with the game since you and your luitenants are abducted  by aliens so the story of great precidency dosen't really last long enough to be something you could care about. As you're abducted by the Zin alien race empire or whatever you enter the simulation which you progress in it and eventually get new super powers,Save your "Homies" from thier simulation and then take the figth to Zinyak. With interesting story that feels really dramatic when it comes to saving the human race and re meeting Johhny gat,Nastolgic throwbacks from Saints Row 1 and 2,Movie,Game and even internet refrences makes the story all so much better than the previous game.\n\nAlot of the main missions are considered mostly fun both with dialouge and objectives.A mission with a parody of Streets of rage,Text adventures,Death mechs and much more. However the side missions which you would mostly complete for many upgrades can get repedetive since they mostly concentrate on activities and assasinations and such,But it's well worth the upgrades and the esier way to 100% the game.\n\nWhen it comes to the legth of the game,I played about more than 20 hours on the campaign which includes the sidequests and some of the challanges in it.Death tag and cat and mouse distracting side activities that you can do with your co op partner can make it alot more playable and will make you spend more time into the game,With a ton of upgrades to spend money on and clothing of such you will always have something to shop for.\n\nAlot of people say that the game lacks originality,For example the matrix when it comes to the simulation,Mass effect and in the case of the powers,Prototype. However regardless this game still feels fun.When it comes to replay value this game dosen't stand tall since the missions aren't exactly as likeable as they are in  Saint's Row The Third most of the time but playing trough the game with more than one co op partner should help you pull it out.\n\nThis game isn't exactly "AMAZING" but think of it this way,It's better than Saint's Row The Third in many ways which suprisingly includes the storyline and writing,For a game that was meant to be a DLC,This is worth no more than 45 dollars max.I would recommend buying this on the next sale or such but this is still worth your money.\n\nI'd give this game a 8/10.\n","August 29, 2013","true","86.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Solid, funny writing (parody galore), over the top action as you would expect from a Saints Row game. If you like the humour from last game, you won't be dissapointed. The super power gameplay mechanic plays pretty well but this game feels like it should have been an expansion rather than a full release (hence only buy it when it's on sale). The mechanic is expanded from what they had with 'Trouble with Clones' DLC from Saints Row 3 so if you enjoyed that, you'll definitely like this.\n\nFairly short game. I fnished all main story, loyalty missions, side missions and all collectibles except for the data clusters (super power upgrade currency) in about 20 hours. Plenty of padding with the side missions which is basically a set of activities. If you are not really a completionist, you can probably blitz through the main story and loyalty missions (worth doing) pretty quickly.\n\nTechnical side, no problems or game breaking bug encountered during my playthrough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownedbysanta/recommended/206420/","ownedbysanta","Santa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownedbysanta/","139 products in account","Thoughts on this game are so mixed.\n\nI'll start with the bad here. First, if you think SR3 was a pretty big step away from the concept of Saint's Row, this game just slaps the very franchise right in the face. It's no longer about gangs and owning the city and the beautiful things that made up Saint's Row 1 and 2. Extremely disappointing that they continued to back away from that concept. Second, the map is just a retextured steelport from SR3, pretty much detail for detail. I realized that 1 and 2 reused Stillwater, but 2 still expanded the map and improved it a bit. The same is not at all true for 4, which is also disappointing and a little boring. As I think others have said, the map could have just been a mod for 3. Third, the game starts by assuming which way you finished SR3, which is lame. As the game goes on, it just creates random needless holes regarding the same topic. Senseless and stupid.  Finally, I thought some missions, particularly a certain Keith David mission, get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out there that I feel like I need to be doing so some serious drugs to make sense of what's going on.\n\nHowever, despite all these complaints, this is still honestly a great game. Just not a great Saint's Row game. Do yourself a favor and come into this expecting a whole new game, not SR. You'll get alot more fun out of it that way. The superpowers are a fun twist that I didn't expect myself to like. The soundtrack was very well chosen for this game, more so than 1-3 in my opinion. Loyalty missions are fun and creative. All charcters, new and old, are fun to call in and hard to pick favorites. The massive amount of references, mostly sci-fi stuff, is great to hear and fun to catch. More than anything, I think this game really makes you feel pretty badass, and that's always awesome, or at least for me.\n\nReally, this game comes up to be a bad good game that is useful for senseless fun and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which isn't always a bad thing. If you can get over that this isn't Saint's Row aside from the charcters, this is probably worth your time.","November 16, 2014","true","35.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/206420/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Being the fourth in the series, Saints Row 4 has a rich backstory and large cast of characters that are constantly referenced throughout the game. I only played parts 3 and 4, so I recognized about 3/4 of the characters in the game.  For those unfamiliar, the Saints Row franchise seems to be a parody of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, but I can’t say for sure, since I haven’t played any of the GTA games.\n\nShort recap of Saints Row the Third (the previous game):\nThe Third Street Saints (a street gang) have become world famous pop culture icons despite being a bunch of criminals. They have their own TV shows, sports drink, and people want to grow up to be like them. Unfortunately, a large and powerful crime Syndicate has come to town to destroy the Saints and take over the city. And that’s not all. The US Military (or some kind of military unit) has been dispatched to deal with the Saints as well, with access to some very high tech equipment.\n\nIn Saints Row 4, after saving the world from the villains in SR3, the Boss of the Saints (you) has been elected President of the United States. Things are going great up until an alien invasion devastates the planet and kidnaps a bunch of humans to be locked in a computer simulation (basically the Matrix). You discover that by causing mayhem and absorbing “code” in the simulation, you can acquire super powers such as super running speed, super jumping , and later on, energy blasts/telekinesis/super stomps. These abilities, mixed with an arsenal of weapons (human and alien) can be used to trash the game world and try to bring the whole system down. Most of Saints Row 4 takes place in the computer simulation, but there are segments where you’re in the “real world” as well. In the real world you can interact with rescued team members (with a romance system) and pilot an alien space ship around.\n\nLike its predecessors, Saints Row 4 is a third person shooter with a large city you can walk, drive, or fly through. Weapons are bought and upgraded in gun shops found all over the city along with clothing stores (for character customization) and car shops. The city is filled with various activities and missions that you can start by just walking up and pressing a key. These include Mayhem (Blow up as much as you can with the weapons given to you in a time limit), Racing, and Insurance Fraud (you ragdoll around being hit by cars to rack up a huge medical bill). With the addition of super powers, there’s a lot more variety than in the previous games, but it really makes cars and even planes obsolete since you can run/super jump faster than any vehicle.\n\nThere are also a large number of collectibles in the game such as data clusters (used to upgrade your powers) and Audio Logs, which are short recorded messages giving you backstory. I thought it would be impossible to collect them all for the Steam achievement but on my second playthrough it looks like I might actually do it. This is because your game map is much more detailed than I realized, and after a particular upgrade, you will be able to see all the collectibles on your map (kind of like the Batman Arkham games but without puzzles blocking you). By the way I should probably note that the achievements in SR4 are for a single playthrough. You can’t play through the game 10 times and think everything will add up to the achievement goal. For example you actually have to kill 1000 aliens with your superpowers in one playthrough. This means grinding is necessary on a few of the achievements.\n\nPros:\n+A lot of humor in the game with its over the top story and characters. The game is definitely a parody with silly names and crazy missions.\n+A lot of variety in gameplay. There’s everything from side scrolling 2-D fighting, to tank/mech battles, to fighting Godzilla size monsters. Remember that the game world is a computer simulation so they can do just about anything they want.\n+The story is decent and the game is pretty long so you should get your money’s worth. It also has a co-op mode which I haven’t tried. It seems to be its own save file though, independent of your single player campaign.\n\nCons:\n-You’ll notice that there is a lot of repetition in the game despite the variety of activities you can take part in. Most of the side quests are the same (Do a series of mini-games). You can bypass them of course, but you’d miss out on unlocking upgrades to your superpowers.\n-Some of the Steam achievements seem like they would take forever to complete such as “complete ALL challenges” (challenges are like in game achievements). No doubt I could do them eventually, but it would take an extra 50 hours of gameplay. And remember it needs to be in a single playthrough. Also, a bunch of achievements are for the game’s DLCs which I don’t own.\n\nOverall, the game is worth playing if you can get your hands on it. Steam had a free weekend a while back and I know a couple people who finished the game during the 3 days. The price hasn’t quite dropped to “bargain bin” level though it’s on sale occasionally. I’ve heard some people say the game is like a DLC for Saints Row the Third, and I can see what they mean. The graphics are nearly identical (as far as I can remember) and both have the same gameplay feel (except with super powers). If you liked Grand Theft Auto / Sleeping Dogs type games but wished you weren’t restrained by the limitations of reality, give Saints Row 4 a try.\n","October 7, 2014","true","57.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you were a fan of saints row the thrid,and liked its humor entrance into the franchise, then you know what you are about to walk into. But if you like the old classic saints row, then back away now, since this game changes everything.\n\nStarting out with modern day saints row, you soon enter a simulation of your nightmare. You then are focused on getting out of there and saving your saints crew, and destoring zinyak and the aliens. Vehicles like cars, or tanks are not the best thing ever in this game since you are running at the speed of light, takes away that fact of using vehicles.\n\nThe weapons of saints row 4 are fun and funny to mess with, although the dubstep gun maybe a little to over hyped. But with the customization this game has for its weapons, you will not be disappointed what so ever. From skins and upgrades, to wacky dlc's that add extra crazy stuff to the game. The character creation and buying clothing is much like saints row the thrid but there is a twist now you must hack the stores, since they were shutdown by zinyak.\n\nAll and all this game is a great game to mess around with. I played with a couple of friends and it was a blast for co-op fun, the story although is not serously but still enjoyable. If you have not yet to pick up this game, i recommened this game,since it was one of 2013's hits!","December 29, 2013","true","68.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyAlligator/recommended/206420/","ProbablyAlligator","Probably Alligator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyAlligator/","295 products in account","I've heard SR described as “GTA that doesn't take itself seriously”. I haven't played the previous installments, but if the 4th is any indication, the description is pretty accurate: it's an open world game where you run, drive and fly to participate in various activities that more often than not end up with you being chased by the police – or the setting's local equivalent of it.\n\nIn SR4 we assume the role of the president of the United States, who is a superhero at the same time. The game shows exactly how serious it's going to be with an opening sequence where the player character kills a bunch of terrorists, jumps on top of a nuclear warhead, detonates it mid-flight to end up jumping down to the ground and landing right on the presidental chair in the Oval Office. Soon after that the alien invasion begins, and we end up trapped in a computer simulation with all the other humans while our real bodies are locked in red containers full of life supporting fluids. We're soon taught how to bend the rules of the simulation which effectively gives us superpowers, allowing us to fight the oppressors. Sounds familiar?\n\nWhile the Matrix is easily the most prevalent inspiration for the game, it draws ideas from tons of other works of popular culture, to the point where I'm not sure whether it's meant as a parody or a tribute. One mission will have you crawl through a level disguised as a cardboard box (with the appropiate Metal Gear Solid sound effects), in the other you are put in a 2d side-scrolling beat-em-up, with mechanics about as sophisticated as Franko had (anyone still remember it?). About every other story quest mocks or refers to something, but I haven't found it annoying or obnoxious at any point. The main storyline is quite fun, funny and enjoyable; the only thing that I can pick on in this game is... everything else.\n\nIt seems to me that Saints Row IV would be a much better game if it was a bit smaller and more focused. It gives you a massive amount of options to upgrade and customize your cars, which seems like a good thing, except that with your superpowers you run much faster than any vehicle drives, making them pretty much useless. You get a pretty impressive arsenal of weapons, ranging from typical pistols, shotguns and rifles to goofy, (and actually quite hilarious) stuff like a rectal probe, dubstep gun, a black hole generator or a strangely familiar Laser Sword. Almost all of them can be upgraded in weapon stores, but the game is easy enough to beat it entirely with a ♥♥♥♥♥ bat (I didn't actually try, but I did beat a few combat-focused side missions equipped with nothing else but the aforementioned sex toy). The game features a Homies system, where you can either recruit your gangmembers from the street or call them from your phone to join you in battle, but it never seemed necessary, with the superpowers giving you so powerful AoE attacks that 3 NPC shooting their guns look mildly amusing at best. The game gives you a lot of mechanics to use and play with, but it doesn't really capitalize on any of them. It even allows customizable skins on your weapons (presumably to have a potential to crank up some DLC money), which I enabled at the beginning of the game but never even noticed them in my 21 hours of playing it.\n\nThe game has a lot of features that see little to no use in it, yet it fills your time with dozens of similar, repetitive minigames, ranging from quite enjoyable (like hacking stores in form of a classic “plumber” game) to straight up annoying (like ragdolling through the streets trying to hurt yourself as much as possible, that being a lot less fun than it possibly sounds like). It seems like for the amount of content and mechanics that the game has, the side missions could be a bit more elaborate and original, rather than being a combination of 10 or so minigames over and over again – to the point where the reasoning of your questgivers literally becomes “I don't want to waste my breath, just go blow ♥♥♥♥ up, okay?” at some point.\n\nApart from missions we get the expected open world goodies like collectibles scattered all across the city, a chance to (re)play the minigames that the side quests require you to do, extremely high structures to climb, and of course countless excuses for mayhem and havoc that we all know and love. All that acompanied by 8-ish radio stations, which we can thankfully listen to also when on foot, which is quite useful in a game where cars are mostly decorative. I found the music quite okay, ranging from rock, reggae to some heavier techno. There was nothing like the absurd talk show station you may have liked in GTA, the only ersatz being a clearly stoned announcer in the dubstep-y station. Still, nothing to complain about.\n\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed my time with Saints Row IV. While I do think that the huge part of the game is mediocre at best and it'll be better off without it, the main story is pretty solid and quite fun. Being the completionist that I am I couldn't ignore all the sidequests, even after I decided that they're bad and I don't like them, but I can easily recommend picking the game up just to play the story quests. It's nothing special, ambitious or worth replaying, but it does have its memorable moments that still make me giggle inside when I think about them. I'd advise to not bother with sidequests to much, since the rewards for them are negligible at best and their gameplay isn't very fun itself, but the main storyline should give you about 8 hours of fun. A pretty fun game for those evenings when you don't feel like doing anything constructive and want to lay back and relax with something that'll make you smile and rapidly exhale through your nose every now and again.","January 15","true","21.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's some problems with quest activation/auto-path thing.\nSecond, there's a way to get some "overdone" activities, like store hacking, when playing co-op. Got a screenshot of 35/34. Not really affecting the gameplay but still.\nThird, most of new activities - rift, blazing - are boring. Subjective, but for me they are.\nFourth, super-powers. They look fun in the beginning. But then you realize - you don't need vehicles! You're fine with running for the whole game.\nFifth, "clusters". Oh my god, there's like 2k+ on the map and you need them to buy super-power upgrades. PLUS..\n..Sixth, "challenges" are now unlocking new stuff. So it's not a optional thing now, you HAVE to beat them all to get all the stuff unlocked and one of the challenges is to get 2.4k of clusters. Nuff said.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game, all the flaws i described above are kinda subjective.\nI guess it's worth 7/10.

There's some problems with quest activation/auto-path thing.\nSecond, there's a way to get some "overdone" activities, like store hacking, when playing co-op. Got a screenshot of 35/34. Not really affecting the gameplay but still.\nThird, most of new activities - rift, blazing - are boring. Subjective, but for me they are.\nFourth, super-powers. They look fun in the beginning. But then you realize - you don't need vehicles! You're fine with running for the whole game.\nFifth, "clusters". Oh my god, there's like 2k+ on the map and you need them to buy super-power upgrades. PLUS..\n..Sixth, "challenges" are now unlocking new stuff. So it's not a optional thing now, you HAVE to beat them all to get all the stuff unlocked and one of the challenges is to get 2.4k of clusters. Nuff said.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game, all the flaws i described above are kinda subjective.\nI guess it's worth 7/10. If you liked SR3 - that's your choice.\n","November 11, 2014","true","28.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I don't want to spoil too much but after a parody of Apocalypse Now follows a parody of Armagedon with Aerosmith's "Don't want to miss a thing" and a Alien Invasion by the most sophisticated Alien either, he even quotes Shakespear and MacBeth, being voiced by J. B. Blanc (who played Dr. Barry Goodman on Breaking Bad and is otherwise known from a lot of games and animes like Naruto, World or Warcraft or as the voice of Bane in Arkham Origins)\n\nThe big criticism this game has seen was the fact that the side quests are always the same mini games: jump up a tower, destroy everything in a tank, run a track like sonic or load up a virus by killing a ton of enemies and while it's true that this gets repetitive after a while, i have to saw with all the superpowers and crazy weapons at your desposal it doesn't get boring, you can always bring a new gun weapon and experience a fight new.\n\nThe main story missions truly shine as they are a parody of various games. Stealth is made look like a joke in a parody of Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, later you encounter "Saints of Rage". You ride a motorcycle to cyberspace, get into a text adventure where you have to find your way through multiple choice answers and do some quick time events.\n\nThe Voice acting is again awesome with Keith David acting as a politican and in one of his last big projects the late great Rowdy Roddy Piper plays himself, having Keith David here too of course leads to a recreation of the classic movie The Live.\n\nThe weapons and superpowers you have, you are a super hero in this game with extreme powers, you can shoot fireballs, hover cars in the air only to shoot them at opponents or run faster than light speed. While that makes cars obsolete you can still use cars and tune them in the rim store shop.\n\nThe Music is alos great again with various radio stations and a ton of licenced songs, like in SR3 you can make your own mixtape but you can't import your own music.\n\nI played it several times now, in co-op it's even better and a ton of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirstrobey/recommended/206420/","sirstrobey","Stroberry <SteelSeries>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirstrobey/","54 products in account","The first Saints Row game was nothing more than a cheap knock off, I liked the 80's metal soundtrack in the game but that was all it had going for it. The second game is when things got entertaining, they just started to parodize the whole gang thing a lot more and poke fun at some relevant societal topics. But the third game is when Volition really started to have fun poking fun at how weird the real world was. Saints Row: The Third wasn't only fun to play but the way it poked fun at the reality tv craze, and Stag was obviously a jab at how Bush handled the war on terror, and it was all done in a very National Lampoon way which was amusing. Well Saints Row IV, it merely picks up where they left off in three and takes even mroe jabs at a lot of the absurd things in the US, and it pays homage to so many things from the 80's you'll lose count. There's the level that totally pays homage to They Live and a Christmas Story (briefly), and then there's tons of weapons from 80's classics like Robocop, Aliens, and GI Joe. And the christmas expansion, the first level is basically a re-creation of the old studio lot where they shot Jaws, Gremlins, and numerous other classics. But towards the end when it pays homage to the animated Transformers film, and even uses the Stan Bush song from the film, that was just a golden moment in the game.\n\nBut I'm praising the satire and how they paid homage to so many great films and cartoons and not talking about the gameplay. Gameplay wise the game is pretty fun and the super powers the player can use in the viritual world add a whole new level of gameplay to the franchise since in earlier games, the player had to rely on vehicles to get anywhere fast and always rely on guns or grenades, but in the 4th game the player could still go the gun and grenade route or freeze people or turn them into gold or use telekenisis and throw them into the sky. In short, the game allows players to just go crazy when it comes to taking out pedestrians and the aliens. The controls are as smooth as the third game, which I'm thankful for since Saints Row 2 for the PC, the driving controls were just horrible. If one enjoys open world games where they can just go crazy, this game should please them. But I highly recommend getting the Game of the Century version, or at the very least the base game and the christmas expansion pack. While I adore Volition's sense of humor when it comes ot the SR franchise, Enter the Dominatrix gets a little too corny, while the Christmas expansion is hands down a far better expansion pack. I don't recommend playing any of the expansions until after finishing the main game though since the expansions will spoil a few things otherwise.\n\nHowever, while I think the game is highly entertaining and totally worth dropping 10-20 on, it does have its flaws and they're the same exact flaws the third game had.\n\n1. The game doesn't have the cool drug and booze thing from the second game, I found it highly amusing how the character could get drunk or stoned in the second game and was sad to see them ditch the ability to do that in the third and fourth. To be fair, it could have been because some countries ban games with drug content, like Australia.\n\n2. The really cool interior locations like the mall in Saints Row 2 added a lot of fun to the game, it was a blast to ♥♥♥♥ off the security guards and then just cause tons of trouble. But Saints Row 3 and 4 just don't have any of those types of interior locations, which is a shame.\n\n3. The player can still play in the water in three and four but it doesn't take long to notice the water isn't used by any of the npc's like in the 2nd game. There aren't any npc's jet ski'ing or driving boats or anything like that, the water is just lifeless.\n\nIf Saints Row 5 brings back just 1 or 2 of those three things, I'll love it to pieces.\n","December 13, 2015","true","42.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It isn't that easy to find games where women aren't obejcts, where men don't have to be beefy to be called man and where being gay is not a reason for jokes. SR4, as nonsense, bizarre, ludicrous and offensive as it is, avoids stereotypes and community/group/race/gender specific jokes better than many before and after it!\n\nThe title follows the leader of the Third Street Saints as he/she becomes president of the United States. Within the first minutes of gameplay an alien invasion takes place and thus starts the greatest masterpiece in sandbox history. In the simulation where the alien overlord emprisoned you and your friends, you have access to super powers, vehicles -- which you can spawn from almost anywhere --, ships, a large variety of the coolest weapons ever and the possibility to be whoever you want. No, literally. You want to be a beefy guy? Go for it! Want to be a sexy babe? You can do that! Or perhaps you'd like to be a transgender sparkly green alien filled with tattoos? Yes, perfectly possible! In addition to that, the developers did the sexy-powerful female role right with characters like Shaundi, Asha and [surprisingly] Kinzie, who are complex enough to be labeled anything but "that girl with the big ♥♥♥♥". And although there are jokes regarding homosexuality, they are so lighthearted and one of many other possibly offensive jokes, it's actually silly not to laugh. Surprising as it may be, the story is actually very consistent, easy to follow and understand. It's that kind of game that makes sense in its own nonsense!\n\nGameplay-wise, it's difficult to find any flaws. The open world offers a large amount of activities and several ways to have fun with your super powers. Character, vehicle and weapon customization is also a big part of the experience, allowing for one of the greatest immersion experiences I've ever had. The controller support works perfectly fine and also offers double axis inversion, something I'm always afraid I won't find on AAA titles -- most of which only allow for Y axis inversion. If I can point anything bad about SR4 is that the developers have messed up the connection to their official community website, making an achievment impossible to get without achievments editors and preventing the players from saving their characters, sharing them with others and playing with theirs, possibly one of the coolest features in the game.\n\nPros\nImmersive and inclusive experience\nDeep character customization, allowing for almost anything imaginable\nDeep vehicle customization\nGreat sandbox experience with tons of content\nSmooth and easy to master gameplay\nFunny, very consistent and understandable nonsense\nComplex, realistic and sometimes relatable character archetypes\nGreat radio and mixtape systems with a large variety of great licensed songs\nDLCs are mostly cosmetic\nCons:\nOfficial servers to share characters and photos not available (have been this way for months, maybe more than a year and developers just say they're "working on it")\nMultiplayer is somewhat lacking and with only two repetitive PvP modes\nThe idea of DLC might not appeal to everyone\nIf you're looking for a great, immersive and inclusive sandbox experience, Saints Row IV is the way to go! The "Game of the Century" edition is particularly worth on a sales off since it adds a larger variety of cosmetics and two awesome series of missions that also add more cosmetics, vehicles and weapons.","May 4, 2015","true","41.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

On one hand, many newcomers to the series and some older fans enjoyed the over-the-top style that that game possessed. On the other hand, many longtime fans were left disappointed. The story had little consistency, Steelport was smaller than the more diverse Stilwater, and the humour, while hilarious at first, wore itself thin and became very predictable. While I enjoyed both Saints Row 2 and it's successor, I did understand while many fans were so disappointed with SR:TT and were hesistant about the fourth entry, which was originally intended as a DLC. Well, Saints Row IV arrived months ago, and with the current sale going on (or future sales), some of you may wonder whether this game is worth the asking price, and the answer depends on your taste.\nThe game, like it's predecessor, focuses on over-the-top action and hilarious weapons. I'll start with the story, which is ...interesting. . Without going into too much detail, your character becomes the President, fights aliens, and gets dropped into a Matrix-like simulation. The first few hours are a good indication for the rest of the game. The writing is much better, and actually made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions (not that Saints Row the Third didn't). However, a lot of it relies on references to games/movies like Metal Gear Solid, the Matrix, and Zero Dark Thirty. While these do offer some good chuckles. they also underline a big problem with the game: it's unoriginal. Rather than actually provide commentary or put interesting twists on these references, it merely admits the existence of them.\nThis unoriginality carries over to the gameplay, too. The game gives you superhuman abilities that are eerily similar to those that are featured in Crackdown and Prototype. While these powers are undeniably fun, the fact that they're carried over from other franchises means that these powers don't mesh well with existing mechanics. Saints Row started out with a large focus on jacking vechicles, but I didn't do that more than a handful of times in this game. Why enter a car when you can run faster than it from the beginning? Still, it's hard to deny the joy that these powers bring to the game. You're also given other powers, such as buffs, telekenesis, etc., and they compliment the gunplay very well, which is good, because the gunplay is underdeveloped. There's no cover system, so you'll have to just awkwardly crouch behind crates and buldings. While this was disappointing, I was able to look past this because the combat was so much fun. The weapons, like the Dubstep gun and the Abduction gun (both are very self-explanatory), make otherwise-stale gameplay fresh, although they do feel a bit out of place when offset by the gray and bleak Steelport. Yeah, Steelport is back, and somehow it's become more lifeless. The game is set in perpetual darkness, and you can't change the time of day until you finish the game. While the ability to change the tone of the game is very cool, I felt that the game would have been much more enjoyable if we were given these abilities upfront, and could unlock the effects as we progressed through the game. Overall, there's not much more to say about the gameplay, other than it's fun. Messy fun, but fun none-the-less.\nThe game boasts higher production values than any of the others in the series. This is apparent by the soundtrack, which features a good mix of memorable hits, modern tracks, and a few guilty pleasures. The visuals, however, feel outdated, and the game looks somewhat bleak with the black color pallet. The game runs very well, only crashing once, so I could look past the visual limits of the game.\nAll in all, Saints Row IV succeeds despite it's flaws. It's unoriginal, it's messy, and it shouldn't work. But it does. The game is undeniably fun, and if you're OK with a shallow yet entertaining game, this is definately a wise investment.\n","January 1, 2014","true","36.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Well...it goes a bit like this. You're are now the president of The United States Of America and your job is to look after your people (obviously). While in the start of the game Aliens come down from the skies and take a lot of humans with them back to their ship. You are on of these captured people and as the president you lead to rebel forces of Earth to fight against Zinyak (the alien).

The super powers that you\nunlock and have access to in a DLC portion of\nSaints Row: The Third are now a core component\nof Saints Row IV, to the point where the powers\nactually break the game with your access to them\n24/7.\n\nSummer-Rain has been playing Saints Row IV with\nyou in your room on her computer while you joined\nher on your laptop, when she pauses and turns\nround to face you after spending a lengthy amount\nof time in the game trying to take down the tyranny\nof Zinyak.\n\n"What's wrong?"

Just finished the game and now I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life! LOL Well, I'm completely in love about Saints Row franchise. I started with the third one, and of course the fourh became the priority of my wishlist right after. Saints Row IV has basically the same gameplay of its predecessor, but with some new, fun and useful elements: superpowers. This kinda eliminates the need of using cars or aircrafts, but you still can use them anyway. The storyline evolves surprises and elements that has flashbacks about the 3 other Saints Row games, with jokes and past stories about the characters that will make you want to play the other games if you didn't. The Genki Bowl activities are specially funnier (they used to annoy me a little on the third one). Again, the game is full of surprises and scenes that make you laugh many times. For me, this franchise is the best one I'll ever play in my life, because I never had so much fun in a game like I had with this one. I love the songs, the characters, the story, everything.\n\nOBS: I REALLY recommend playing at least Saints Row: The Third before playing this one because of the storyline, gameplay and also for the better understanding of some jokes.","August 16, 2014","true","43.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","8"

And at first, dazzle me it did indeed. It seemed like there was underlying plot by Zinyak to 'break' the main character's will, since he himself says he can't wait to do it. Putting you in a simulation where the Earth is destroyed seemed to me a good way to do that. Then when you get power armor that just happens to have the exact same powers you hacked into the simulation earlier... I thought it was screaming twist ending. I thought the whole plot was Zinyak trying to break the President of the United State's Will so that he could easily conquer the planet, pretending it to be softpower tactics and earning some points with his government.\n\nInstead, the ending is he just says screw it I'll kill you. Then you pull out his head, rule over the Zin, and dance. 0/10 Storytelling, at best misleading, at worst monstrously rediculous. Don't get me wrong, it's funny, just not a good story.\n[/spoilers]\n\nOkay, so the story didn't dazzle, in all hindsight it seems it just wasn't what they were trying to go for.\nHow was the gameplay? Except for Shaundi's storyline mission, pretty decent. Matt Miller, while loathed, made me truly believe this was a game in love with other games. This game does vary from others I have played, with enough constant variety to keep you interested until the very end.\n7/10, While none of the gameplay is at all original (granted, hard to do these days), they manage well enough to acually truly entertain you for one linear playthrough. And throughout the story, it has some of the better superhero gameplay I've played in a while. However, if you try to steer off the story, you'll find that while there is some variety of minigames, they are merely lesser versions of alternative games and highly repetetive and quickly menotenous.\n\n\ntldr; All in all it's not necessarily a bad game. The problem is that the best gameplay is following the storyline, otherwise the copy-paste repetitiveness of the character missions are likely to bore you, and for me the storyline was poorly written. This seems to be a game to buy, and only play through the story for the lols, and then dump it.\n\nSuper tldr; If you consider the current pricetag worth 12 hours (your story miles may vary) of linear but mostly entertaining gameplay and comedy, go ahead. Otherwise steer clear.","January 20, 2014","false","33.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

Suddenly, alians from outside of space entered the bar.\n\n"Where is the one you call Jihnny Gat," said the alin, "we wish to speak with him."\nJohnny Git kicked over his barstool and said, "Here I am, come over here and get some of me."\n"We do not want to fight you," the alean ejaculated, "only to talk."\n\nGinnie Gat dodged the aliean seamen and pulled out his shotgun, shouting "I'm not gonna fight you, I'm gonna kick your a*s."\n\nJannie Gat fired at the elian and the ilian was ded. He then tossed what was left of his smoking beer at the corpse to make it smell better and gave his cigar to the bartender to drink because he did not have any money left after undertipping a hooker. Jiggy Gat walked outside to see alans everywhere killing people.\n\n"F*ck alieans, I hate aleans, I want to go home," Jig said.\nSo Jinny went home and masterdebated about freedom with president Boss over the phone. Once Jinnis had finished and cleaned up, he said,\n"My name is Jinnie Get, and I don't pay for phone sex."\n\nBreaking the phone in two with his thirteen inch d*ck, Jimmy narrowly avoided the 60$ charge for his masterdebating session.\n"Damn, I'm good," Jim said.\n\nJon's window shattered as an alien laser struck a neighboring building.

They crowded around him asking his d*ck for autographs.\n"F*ck off." the d*ck said as it broke one man's arm.\n\nNow that Jib's p*nis had frightened the fans away, he used it like a pogo stick and jumped to New Orleans where the aleians had made hurricanes attack the city. While he was there he spotted a black man named Kanyo.\n\n"Yo wassup n*gga George Bush don' care about black people," Kanyo said.\nJimbo put his d*ck in the confused man's ear and it whispered, "Boss is the president now. And he's black."\n\nAnd that is the story of how New Orleans discovered that The Boss had won the presidential race.","January 11","true","9.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","7","11","13","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ObeyGames/recommended/206420/","ObeyGames","Tilted2g","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ObeyGames/","181 products in account","The Saints are back! Well, sort of. Fans of the first 3 Saints games may be in for a bit of a surprise, that is either going to impress them, or send them into a fit of rage. While other Saints games have been no stranger to going way out into left field, the 4th entry into this series seems to push the envelope even further. So far in fact that it seems like a completely new genre entry into the series. I'm sure by now you know the gist of the game. The gist is that you are no longer tied the laws of normal physics. Why? You progressively and eventually achieve becoming a mother #$%@ing superhero! Oh, and did I mention you are also the President of the United States? Yeah, from just a gangbanger, to a man in tights! Or whwtaever you want to wear to be honest.\n\n\nSaints Row completely flips the script of previous Saints games, and has you now instead of fighting rival gangs, taking on a legion of aliens bent on destroying everything you care about. You'll meet familiar faces from the past, and run and gun or jump (over buildings mind you) and pound the ground with a bevy of your closest friends from the Saints universe. And Keith David too!\n\nYeah, you can run at lightning speeds, jump long distances, use telekinetic powers, and a lot more. The melee fighting is a lot better, but still a little lacking. However, punches go hard this time, so it's a lot more satisfying. Like punching a car, and seeing it knocked back quite a distance. You still get guns and other weapons (and LOTS of skins for them). And the way the game flows in combat, you'll find yourself mixing it up with all assortments of moves. Mainly due to limited ammo, and a meter for combat superpowers. This way you're not just spamming one thing over and over again. This makes for some fast and furious action, and I love it!\n\nAs far as traveling goes, you do get vehicles. But with how fast you can move in the game, they almost feel like an afterthought. That is of course for aerial vehicles, which can still be useful. This being because while you can jump super high, or launch yourself very far, and even glide long distances, you still never get the ability to fly.\n\nAs for the lack of interest in using vehicles which most people find not necessary, the game features the ability to listen to your favorite radio stations usually found in the vehicles, now outside of the vehicles at any time. And this my friends, is quite the dream. The soundtrack has some choice tunes, featuring a wide assortment of genres, and throwback classics. I was floored when I ran into a pack of alien enemies, and "The Touch" by Stan Bush started playing. It made me feel...well...It made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥! The cheesy 80's centric music blaring while I'm zooming in and out of these enemies, using super powers, and feeling like a god. I loved every minute of that. And it was purely by chance. Just some good timing is all.\n\nBut not to worry, Saints IV makes good use of scripted badassery, with some fantastic main story missions that are well played out, so it's not all by chance. The story is cheesy goodness dripping with gooey satisfaction. It's never at any moment meant to be taken seriously, and for that I am thankful. This is a game with 1 focus in mind. Having some of the most balls to the wall fun imaginable.\n\nThe game however seems like it is over too soon. And honestly, there is not much in terms of challenge. The post game stuff will just leaving you typing up any loose ends for achievements and other odds and ends, but you will pretty much have all side missions complete by the end, and in a short time. So this leaves any post game missions down to any expansion packs we may get for the game. But regardless of length, you will enjoy every minute of it gun toting superheroes with political ties is your sort of thing :D\n\n\nPros\n- Varied and satisfying gameplay\n- Wonderfully scripted main story missions\n- Fantastic soundtrack\n- Radio stations can be listened to on foot (and in the air!)\n- Feel like a complete badass!\n\nCons\n- Game is too short\n- Easy gameplay","January 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The game was entertaining, but even after purchasing the Enter the Dominatrix DLC I have amassed only 27hrs of game time.\nYou can't attribute it entirely to the super powers and ease of travel. I think there was just less to do, less story, fewer missions, less incentive to get certain achievements.\n\nI don't think SR IV is the game it could have been. For a sandbox action game, 27 hours doesn't cut it. 45 minutes of addditional game play in the form of DLC doesn't cut it.\n\nI wanted more out of this, Volition. SR3 is one of my favourite games, SR IV is a poor successor.\n\nTL;DR: if you're OK with blowing things up with fun powers for under 30hrs, then this is what you want. If you were expecting a grand step forward from SR3 and a sequel that would sratch the itch that game left on your soul? Give this a pass.

This game is what GTA strives to be.\n\nI bought the franchise for like, 15 bucks. After 5 minutes of saints 3, i knew i stumbled upon gold. I've had friends recommend 4 for a long time, but i figured since it was so underpriced it would turn out to be an inferior half ♥♥♥♥♥ open world game. It's not. I understand now why so many user reviews are hard pressed to describe this game, because honestly, i am too. "The best super man game never made" sums it up pretty well, but it really is so much more. If I were to sum it up in a sentance too, it wouldnt sound much different. More like 'The best Matrix game never made'.\n\n♥♥♥♥, I really wanted to turn this into a descriptive review of my favorite GTA style open world 3rd person action/adventure game i've ever played, so I guess I'll just leave it at that and let you fall in love with it on your own terms, because tags like 'Open World' 'Action' 'Comedy' 'Co op' 'Sandbox' don't even begin to scratch the surface.\n\nIn a nutshell though: if rockstar had followed up san andreas with a game half as good as saints 3, there would be no place on the market for gta 4 and 5; and there isn't. Forget 5 if you havent bought it already: Grab Saints.","January 27, 2015","true","61.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

At face value they seem cool, but over time I started feeling like the game experience was shallow because of them. Giant, unlimited explosions that killed everything around me made every gun in the game useless. Super-dashing took away any need to steal a car and make it my own with a custom paint job and meticulous body upgrades. Super-jumping took away the amazing feeling of stealing a plane or helicopter and parachuting out of an emergency landing. For every instant-gratification super power that emerged, it took away from a previous good feeling I had playing Saints Row 3.\n\nIt's a good game so I have to recommend it, but I feel a little sad because instead of getting "more" of what I used to love, I got a different dish than what I was expecting.","January 19, 2015","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like a masterful puzzle full of tiny enjoyable puzzles.  I would recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of shooters, puzzle games, and good, dirty, over-the-top fun.  I could not stop playing and I mean that in a literal sense.  I ate through the entire story-line in three days.\n\nI will also say this is a skillful use of past content with a nice inject of fresh content.  A few cosmetic changes here and there and it's pretty much the same map as SR:III.  They way it's done feels right with the storyline and gives a odd sense of nostalgia.  Most of the mini-games are new due to the fact they include the use of super powers which are a blast to use.  Then there are the backstories and trips down memory lane artful packaged to give the player a serious case of the feels, a good laugh, and a metric ton of ♥♥♥-kicking fun.\n\nYou should have this game in your library.

However, if you are of the school thinking this is some sort of serious open world crime game -cough gta cough- You will be dissapointed and wondering what the hell you just signed on for.   I myself, love the zany so I absolutely love what I have played so far.\nthe Pros:  it's fun, explodey, crude and general mayhem at it's best. There are alot of activities to do and plenty of them to keep you distracted for hours.\n\nthe cons: This port from console is a bit easy if you ask me. Certain mechanics, when transferred to mouse become second nature, vs fighting with a controller as the challenge. (the sprint challenges for example, with a controller would pose a bit more challenge than someone who has much more control via a mouse) my partner and I got gold on the hard ones on the first run through on most of them, if not the first, then the second.\n\nThere are a few...bugs? that I noticed that make the game a bit um...broken in the player's favor, but it's questionable if it was on purpose or not. As we are basically in a broken version of the matrix.  I discovered, to my absolute mirth, that during a fraud mission, I could send my character careening and cartwheeling clear across town, racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fall. My mate topped my 350k by hitting 510k ..the bum!  But when the challenge hits gold at 1.6m, and you can easily accomplish this, it makes you wonder where the challenge is.\n\nNow...mind you , storyline wise we have not progressed very far, as the darn cookie crumb activities keep distracting us! oh look a mayhem!!   So I am hoping it will get a bit tougher.\n\nOverall, this game is a fantastic "I've had a crappy day and need to unwind with random chaos and take my frustrations out in explosive form on pixels." type of game. It's what I've always considered the franchise. Fun, whacky, and over the top.  If you lack a sense of humor for the rediculous, go play GTA. (ps, yes, I play that too, not bashing it!) if you enjoy laughing your butt off at the crazy crap you can do inside a virtual world, give this game a shot.\n\n8/10 pending further play into storyline         it may be easy,(so far) but it's still a blast!","January 19, 2015","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd fully recommend the single player game just don't get your hopes up if you're looking to play with friends. 8/10.","December 7, 2014","true","63.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/recommended/206420/","strider_rider","Strider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/","105 products in account","Saints Row IV adds a lot of chaos and confusion to the series, including a song of the same title. I was introduced to the series via Saints Row: The Third which I thought already pretty far fetched yet plausible to some degree, somehow this game does that while never ceasing to amaze me how far these boundaries get pushed. Story's pretty amazing yet it makes a lot of sense somehow. Lots of old characters get brought in without breaking paradoxes, brings a lot of character background with them through audio logs. Some text based RPG style adventures left around the simulation that tells Zinyak's history with sassy remarks which are pretty cool.\n\nGameplay starts off very similarly to it's predecessors, then comes in the super powers through an alien simulation and everything is amazing once we're past that. Mobility in the game is great because even though you can run/jump at superhuman speeds, using a vehicle is much more convenient and possibly faster sometimes. Also loves how the game integrates optional activities into side quests which tie in to territory control so you do not have to entirely go out of your way to do any of these activities to gain control. Activities such as insurance fraud from the older games are more plausible thanks to the simulation.\n\nWas kind of disappointed by the lack of cutscenes that occur within the simulation because that's where you see your character all dolled up with your crew instead of the generic space uniforms. Loyalty missions also did not have any cutscenes whatsoever, which would have made the game more interesting and laid out. Overall pretty good game though, seeing as this is my longest review as of now. In short, if you loved SR:TT, why would you not buy this game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makemebad/recommended/206420/","makemebad","Gilby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makemebad/","352 products in account","First off, the game is not terrible.\n\nThat being said, having been a huge fan of Saints Row: The Third, my expectations where sky high going into Saints Row IV.\n\nThe story of the game is even more over the top than previous Saints Row titles, though, the same can be said for a lot of the other aspects of the game. To sum it up, the story was entertaining enough, however, I don't think anyone ever played a Saints Row game for the story, so I concider this more a positive bi-factor.\n\nThe gameplay, now the gameplay in SR4 adds a lot variety, the introduction of super powers allows for even more rampage and destruction than ever before. With Blast powers, Telekinesis, Super jump and sprint, your character becomes a big ball of destruction goodness.\n\nHowever, while super powers is a lot of fun to play around with, I feel it also takes a lot away from the game. The game is INCREDIBLY easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Activities from previous SR games, like "Insurance Fraud" devolves into super jumping, clicking the mouse-button to ragdoll, and just cartwheeling all over the map at mach speed, trying to hit as much ♥♥♥♥ as possible.  "Mayhem", where you're supposed to destroy as much ♥♥♥♥ as you can with weapons provided, absolutely no point when you can just super sprint on the sidewalks and take out pedestrians, trash cans, streetlight etc. and doing this you will rack up a combo x100 times quick then you would just shooting stuff or using blast powers.\n\nThis is only a few examples, but I think they illustrate some of the problems super powers brings to the game, and how game breaking they can be. Another smaller thing, is that your superpowers eliminates the need for veichles, planes, choppers etc. Why the hell would you use a car when you can super sprint way faster, and take out anything in your path doing so?\nI have no answer, which is why stuff like getting cool veichles, upgrading them etc. is just not a big part of the game anymore.\n\nNew weapons and new types of custimzations are fun, but they end up playing second fiddle to the blast, stomp and telekinesis powers, that for the most just destroys everything. I will say that weapons like the 'Murica gun and Dubstep gun can be pretty hillarious to use and combined with super powers lets just take out enemies faster and easier than ever.\n\nSome of the newer activies/sidequests are also ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, the "into the rift" ones (think thats what they're called) where you jump in a tube collecting stuff, or the ones you use telekinesis to throw colored balls into rings with matching colors are just dreadful, a lot of the other activites aren't good either but these are the ones i remember hating the most.\n\nAs far as the missions goes, if you're like me and will just ♥♥♥♥ around doing activities in the map, at least the fun ones, you'll find that once you go to do loyalty quests, you'll have gotten most of them already. If you take away the quests that are just clearing flash points and completeting activities, the game is very short.\n\nSo why would I recommend this game? I pre-ordered this on steam, but I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it at full price, this is definetly one of those "pick it up at 75% in a steam sale" titles, and if you enjoy the type of game the SR franchise is, you probably will get your moneys worth (assuming you buy it on sale). If you have a friend to play it with, the experience is much more enjoyable in my opinion. Also set friendly fire to full damage for added enjoyment.","February 26, 2014","true","46.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story continues from SR3, where the Leader of the Third Street Saints has gained enough popularity to become President. While the aspect of being US President is quicky diminished by an alien attack, it doesn't hurt the ridicolously over-the-top, hilarious and fun narrative. The most drastic change for franchise long-timers is that your avatar now has superpowers. This is easily the best thing about the game, despite that it destorys the point of driving cars in a franchise that was previously known as a GTA clone. The open-world is arguably less interesting than what it was in SR3, but the side content is addicting, fun, sometimes crazy, and worth it. Add in a co-op campaign option, and mind=blown.

I can do absolutely anything I want in the game-... From jumping across the islands or by running into cars and turning them into flames - causing them to explode. The music in-game is fantastic! The atmosphere as soon as you start is fabulous and the overall combat system is exactly how I remember the Saints Row series being like!\n\n- The guns are unique, alongside the general customerization that is possible! Loads of colours, shapes of guns, even different models of sizes and types for a specific gun slot! It's overall fantastic!\n- The vehicles are generic, however the customerization again is excellant, being able to add body mods / colours / nos / a page of 50+ rims / it's grand!\n- The plastic surgery part of the game which allows you to change; gender, race, facial features, bodily features, hair, skin, you name it! ^ I love being able to swap and change, going from a pink haired gym obsessive 6ft black guy, to a 5 ft round black guy with anime green hair and a beard! You name it, the possibilities are vast!\n- The choice of doing main missions or side missions is grand! Without the main missions you can spend hours running around doing as you please! - So far I have 15 or so hours in Saints Row IV yet I have done around 10 main missions and the rest have been just from side quests and shooting bad guys!\n\nI love the 80s music on certain radio stations and I also love the ability to add your own custom music <- however you'll need to follow a guide online and it takes ages!\n\nOther than that, the only downfall... Saints Row IV offers a great experience to existing or new fans...\n\nBeing able to choose colourful clothes, or guns or cars... To people running around with giant monkey or cat masks... To men in gimp costumes... To energy drink cans shooting you with machine guns -... Toilets with guns... Spongey limbs and even having the same NPC spawned 20 times over with some deformity... It all adds into an amazing, unexpected, funny game, full of colour and diverse choice. I totally recommend it!\nPS: I have taken a number of screenshots on Saints Row IV - 80 + to be precise, so go through them and definitely get the game :D!!!!","April 20, 2015","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On the serious note you have Sleeping dogs and Watch Dogs. In the middle you have GTA where the overall tone is serious but throws quite a few comedic relief characters at you. Then you have Saints Row where it just throws ridiculous situations and mechanics at you that its just crazy. With that being said you can not even call this a GTA clone anymore as the only thing tat it has in common with the former is the 3rd person action genre. Saints Row is full of activities, comedy, one liners, aliens and TONS of collectables. Throw in some super powers and you think this game would be epic., they are fun and all but some of them make other gameplay mechanics we are use to obselete. Driving now becomes useless since you can fly and super run faster then driving, this basically just turns cars into objects to ram into while running to knock out of the way or to use as weapons to throw at enemies. With this i felt like i missed a great portion of the awesome soundtrack, from what i rarely got to hear it was great selection.\nWhile the story of aliens invading earth and putting you into a "Matrix" like simulator is insane, it does offer a lot of comedic moments. From the first mission of straddling a nuclear warhead to fighting alongside Rodney Piper, it has alot of LOL moments and pop culture references. Unfortunately towards the climax I felt the story lost its steam and just wanted it to end as it was just too cliche at that point. While I did not do all the side mission i did end up with completing 39/45 available missions and completed the game in a shy over 11 hours making this very short for a AAA release. And speaking of it being a AAA release, it does not feel like it at all, it feels like this was suppose to be a DLC for SR3 and they just decided to put a little more work into it to squeak by with a stand alone release. But still if your a fan of the series its worth a play at a good sale price, which seems to happen quite often.\n\nVerdict: BUY IT CHEAP[/b]","June 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Put in Saints Row the Third, Mass Effect (any part will do, but 2 is best), The Matrix, Tron, Independence Day, and a liberal amount of dubsteb. Hit blend and the result should be Saints Row IV. It could be classified as superhero game, like Prototype and Infamous, but there still is a strong emphesis on weaponplay and all sorts of shenanigans completely unrelated to superpowers. It is an open world action adventure games with excellent voice acting and supreme musical timing.

It's more of the same silliness from SR3 (which I loved) but taken up a further notch with a Matrix style artificial reality, new superhero powers and an alien invasion to fight.\n\nI've seen some complaints that it keeps the same engine as SR3 but it really still looks pretty good and the new powers provide a genuine change in play style. The devs play around a lot with deliberate graphical glitches and sillyness which also helps any minor graphics issues get overlooked.\n\nOn a personal note I'd probably have got this earlier and paid more for it if the devs weren't so relentless in the huge amount of paid for DLC that they ALWAYS churn out in the months after release. Still, they're all out now and come boxed with Game of the Century Edition.

The gameplay is very smooth and action pack with many skills you can use. This game has a very high level of customization ranging from clothing(3 tertiary colors), character and weaponary. The quests are highly enjoyable but a bit repetitve in the sense of alot of killing(which most people actually like).  The humor and 'wtf' moments in this game is so hilarious and random that it will give you a guranteed chuckle and the dialogue is also exceptionally well voiced. The storyline is also very fast pased but don't worry there is alot of side quests and game modes within the simulation with also 2 additional dlc.

Super jump, super sprint and a host of other abilities turn ordinary enemy encounters and travelling into much more enjoyable experiences than they otherwise normally would be. As well as this the general gunplay is quite satisfying, but unfortunately the driving is the weakest aspect (although this becomes irrelevant very early into the game, as your super powers make using traditional vehicles uneccessary, save for certain scripted sections).\n\nStory: The game is consistently well written, with witty dialogue from most minor and major characters, an interesting narrative and many humorous moments.\n\nGraphics: The city is very much a replica of Steelport from Saints Row: The Third, but some unique visual effects make it seem unique. This visual design also extends to the characters and weapons, which are pseudo-realistic in design, with lots of detail and character.\n\nSound: The game's soundtrack is very good, with lots of exciting songs that make the gameplay more thrilling and enjoyable. The voice acting is also very good, with characters portraying many subtleties through their intonations and general dialogues.\n\nRe-playability: There are literally over a thousand various collectables scattered throughout the world, an abundance of activities to complete, many character progressions to earn and buy, and much more.

The story continues from SR3, where the Leader of the Third Street Saints has gained enough popularity to become President. While the aspect of being US President is quicky diminished by an alien attack, it doesn't hurt the ridicolously over-the-top, hilarious and fun narrative. The most drastic change for franchise long-timers is that your avatar now has superpowers. This is easily the best thing about the game, despite that it destorys the point of driving cars in a franchise that was previously known as a GTA clone. The open-world is arguably less interesting than what it was in SR3, but the side content is addicting, fun, sometimes crazy, and worth it. Add in a co-op campaign option, and mind=blown. This game is fun in it's rawest state. 9/10\n\n(The Game has a free weekend, I totally recommend trying it out!

NO! thats because this game takes the average game, and SMOOSHES it down the drain.\nthe game has infinite posabilities as well. do you feel like blowing up a group of dancing hot dogs using super fireballs? well, you can! you can do practicaly anything you want. it's that big.\nnow here we are. no, in no way is this game worse because of the recycled city. think about this for a second. after sr2, imagine if volition recycled the city of stilwater AGAIN. sr3 would have been a dreadful hit. everyone would be hating on it because of the reused town. so, volition made a new city. and people hated them. but, imagine if volition had used the city for all the SR games. this game would have gotten nowhere sales-wise. i am glad that the steelport town was used again for this game. no joke.\nfinally, are the superpowers worth the extra money? yes. they bring a whole new element of gameplay to an already existing genre. the endless hours of fun seen in other SR games are made better with these powers, because it allows more freedom, more quickly, and more gameplay, more smoothly.\nthe story had been improved as well. instead of the silly sex jokes constintly used in the third game, this game uses well-written humor to its advantage. i grew attached to zinyak, the evil alien, due to his constant enjoyable cutscenes and speeches.\n\nthis game improves over saints row the third in almost every aspect. the gameplay is smoother, the characters are more customisable (with a new feature that allows for change of pitch), the story is more involved, the humor is smart, and the game has so much to offer.\nso is it the best in the series? in my opinion, yes. before you storm me and destroy me, remember the order i have played the sr series in: SR3, SR4, SR2 (still finishing), and soon, SR. i am currently prefering it over SR2 because i find the missions and cutscenes a lot more exciting and open-eyed, with inclusion of licensed music and motion capture.\n\nthis game is not only my favourite of the year, but has to be one of the best i have ever played, along the lines of the legend of zelda - majoras mask, and the elder scrolls V - skyrim.\n\ni give this title: 10/10","November 27, 2013","true","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story isn't as consistently, jaw-droppingly inspired in its absurd escalations as SR3, but the game plays way better. As a counterpoint to GTA 5, which was the deathknell of the open-world crime game by way of being mired in its conventions and weirdly vicious approach to everything, SR4 is the deathknell by way of showing the absolute limits of what you can do with the formula. What I mean is, within the first hour you get superpowers that let you jump really high, run really fast, and basically fly. Combined, all three of these make stealing in a car, driving around and committing crimes seem antiquated and ridiculous. It's faster and more satisfying to super-run through cars, super jump across rooftops, and fly.\n\nIt is hard to talk about what happens in the game without giving away huge spoilers, but let's just say that its entire tone is a very knowing sense of the word "badical." It takes itself very seriously, even when the things it is taking seriously are how totally badass it was that you just climbed a really tall tower and got to the top, or how a confrontation with the alien overlord starts with you, the President of the United States, jumping out of the huge 8-barrel POTUS-branded AA cannon that is stationed on the White House lawn, and running at the crashed alien scout you just shot down, jumping at the front window and shooting it out with a pistol and immediately engaging in a Rowdy Roddy Piper/Keith David "They Live"-esque brawl with said overlord.\n\nAnyone who takes it seriously and makes a character that looks remotely realistic is absolutely playing the game completely wrong and seems to have missed the pitch slider on the voices. The game is basically Your Fricking Ridiculous Power Fantasy: The Game, and is designed around both exceeding your wildest expectations while also subverting them. If there is one thing that the game is willing to critique, it is itself; its existence, your desire to play it, and the video game industry as a whole. It's never condescending when it does this, and comes across as the wet fever dream of a designer at the end of their life, transcribed via dying breaths, and developed as a celebratory eulogy to everything that once was. Its comments are made with a light touch, even when the game itself is so intent on destroying the world and starting over.\n\nGreat game.","July 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I never really enjoyed the driving in SR3 and still don't ~really~ enjoy it here, but it's become a moot point, and it's so much fun to just run and glide and jump through the city. Having the guns on top of the powers really mean that there's no way to get bored with combat, either, which was nice.\n\nEverything ws put into this game, and while I definitely didn't enjoy the minigames/activites all the time, there were so many different types that I never was bored for more than a minute, until it ws no longer necessary to finish an activity and then you never really had to do more of that one again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/206420/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Saint’s Row 4 is a GTA-themed sci-fi superhero sandbox game.\n\nYes, really.\n\nChock full of pop-culture references, jokes, crude humor, parodies of other intellectual properties, and general silliness, this game is a farce wrapped up in a superhero sandbox/sci-fi/GTA theme. The game does not take itself seriously at all, and yet, has remarkably high production values; the characters are fully voice acted, Keith David is your vice president, and you can eventually recruit Santa and Mrs. Claus as sidekicks.\n\nThe main attraction of this game is its over the top ridiculousness. The game starts out with your character breaking into a nuclear weapons facility to stop an insane general from launching a nuclear weapon and destroying Washington DC, and it only goes downhill from there. The protagonist is a sociopathic street-thug-♥♥♥-actor-♥♥♥-politician, who puts his ex-street thug friends in charge of the country.\n\nAnd that’s just the first chapter. After that, aliens invade, everyone gets abducted and stuck into simulations of their worst nightmares – the protagonist gets stuck in a cheerful 50s-themed world – and eventually the protagonist breaks out, breaks into a GTA-themed simulation, and then frees all his friends from similarly ridiculous nightmare scenarios based on everything from fighting a gigantic can of soda to a 2D-beat-em-up to an old-school wireframe video game world. The protagonist gains superpowers over the course of the game, allowing him to completely turn the GTA-themed sandbox on its head, largely ignoring vehicles in favor of running around with super-speed and super-jumps and super-gliding, running up the sides of buildings and bouncing around the city.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is often fairly mediocre; it mostly plays like an over-the-shoulder 3rd person shooter. And yet, the sheer ridiculousness of the scenarios, the constant comedic banter between the protagonist, his teammates, and the enemy, and the general lack of the game taking itself seriously somehow combine to make the game a generally enjoyable experience. The game is at its worst when you are slogging your way through waves of rather uninteresting enemies, but fortunately the protagonist is generally so overpowered after a while that apart from a few missions where you have limited weapons, you can pretty much crush them easily. The actual sandbox aspect of the game is fairly weak; there are a bunch of missions which more or less serve as practice for various bits of the game, as well as challenges which push your ability to complete tasks with various superpowers or weapons or vehicles to the limit, but on the whole most of these are fairly inoffensive, and they aren’t repetitive enough to be annoying.\n\nSo, is it good?\n\nI’d say on the whole that it was an enjoyable experience; while the gameplay may not have been the best, the sheer chutzpah of the game actually made it pretty fun, and you never knew what ridiculous task you’d be up to next. The game does its best to make you feel powerful, and the game is, in the end, a power fantasy, an ego trip, and a comedy all wrapped up into one. It doesn’t take itself seriously, and neither should you, but on the whole, it was well worth it.\n","October 21, 2015","true","72.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This works for them very well and surprisingly, they deliver an exciting superhero game with a compelling, if at times ridiculous, story.\n\nFans of the Saints Row series will really enjoy the callbacks 4 makes to previous games (especially 2 and 3) but new players may be a little confused.

It's more of the same silliness from SR3 (which I loved) but taken up a further notch with a Matrix style artificial reality, new superhero powers and an alien invasion to fight.\n\nI've seen some complaints that it keeps the same engine as SR3 but it really still looks pretty good and the new powers provide a genuine change in play style. The devs play around a lot with deliberate graphical glitches and sillyness which also helps any minor graphics issues get overlooked.\n\nOn a personal note I'd probably have got this earlier and paid more for it if the devs weren't so relentless in the huge amount of paid for DLC that they ALWAYS churn out in the months after release.

However, if you are of the school thinking this is some sort of serious open world crime game -cough gta cough- You will be dissapointed and wondering what the hell you just signed on for.   I myself, love the zany so I absolutely love what I have played so far.\nthe Pros:  it's fun, explodey, crude and general mayhem at it's best. There are alot of activities to do and plenty of them to keep you distracted for hours.\n\nthe cons: This port from console is a bit easy if you ask me. Certain mechanics, when transferred to mouse become second nature, vs fighting with a controller as the challenge. (the sprint challenges for example, with a controller would pose a bit more challenge than someone who has much more control via a mouse) my partner and I got gold on the hard ones on the first run through on most of them, if not the first, then the second.\n\nThere are a few...bugs? that I noticed that make the game a bit um...broken in the player's favor, but it's questionable if it was on purpose or not. As we are basically in a broken version of the matrix.  I discovered, to my absolute mirth, that during a fraud mission, I could send my character careening and cartwheeling clear across town, racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fall. My mate topped my 350k by hitting 510k ..the bum!  But when the challenge hits gold at 1.6m, and you can easily accomplish this, it makes you wonder where the challenge is.\n\nNow...mind you , storyline wise we have not progressed very far, as the darn cookie crumb activities keep distracting us! oh look a mayhem!!   So I am hoping it will get a bit tougher.\n\nOverall, this game is a fantastic "I've had a crappy day and need to unwind with random chaos and take my frustrations out in explosive form on pixels." type of game. It's what I've always considered the franchise. Fun, whacky, and over the top.  If you lack a sense of humor for the rediculous, go play GTA. (ps, yes, I play that too, not bashing it!) if you enjoy laughing your butt off at the crazy crap you can do inside a virtual world, give this game a shot.\n\n8/10 pending further play into storyline         it may be easy,(so far) but it's still a blast!","January 19, 2015","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Super-jumping took away the amazing feeling of stealing a plane or helicopter and parachuting out of an emergency landing.

In reality, though, this game is perhaps the most amazing super-villain simulator ever.\n\nFrom the amazingly over-the-top story to the incredible selection of songs, which reminds me of what I loved about the last GTA I really loved, Vice City, it gets so much right that even where it goes wrong I'm willing to forgive it.\n\nThe only sandbox I've had as much fun in recently was Just Cause 2 which says a lot.\n\nGet it.","September 15, 2013","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's right, this time around you get superpowers.  It's a bit jarring if you've been following the series up to this point, but I cannot deny that it is FUN.\n\nIt's a little sad that cars are mostly useless in this game, especially given how easy it is to store, customize, and summon any vehicle this time around, but at the same time the various obscene superpowers you get are absolutely awesome.  There are sections where you can't use your superpowers, and honestly I think the game could use more. There are even text adventure and 2d side-scrolling beat-em-up sections!  This is not a bad thing, an adds some pleasant variety to the gaming experience.\n\nThe plot of the game is... interesting, much like any Saints Row game.  The villain is improbable and hateable, and the setup is... ridiculous. The plot also has a LOT of callbacks, references, and even new takes on elements from previous Saints Row games, all handled pretty well.  So that's nice.\n\nThere is one crappy element to the plot which I won't spoil, but it sort of puts a little damper on the whole thing, at least for me.  Not enough to make it un-fun, but... well if the Volition guys don't follow up on the plot somehow, I'mma be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","August 25, 2013","true","106.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't played the previous installments of the franchise, and started straight into SR/IV which convinced me mainly because of the attributes that caused a many other fans headache: the added superpowers.\n\nAs a former veteran of the good old (and unfortunately also gone) MMORPGame City of Heroes/Villains (Superhero creation), I was looking for something that would fill the fun void that was caused when NCSoft shut down the game's servers and the Super Heroes and Villains soared into the evening sky for their last time.\n\nBut back to this game here:\n\nThe main thing you gotta know about Saints Row is that: it can't be taken seriously, yet you can't just classify it into just one game genre either: It's part 3rd-view-shooter, it's part adventure game, it's part exploration, and a whole fistful of fun if you're into character customization and generelly hilarious fun whatever the hell you decide to get up to.\n\nYou are able to collect a whole arsenal of all sorts of exotic weapons, out of which the "Dubstep Gun" will be the most memorable one, trust me. You can achieve them by completing missions, mini-side-tasks, races, platform challenges, collecting in-game stuff, and next to weapons, you'll also earn more character customization add-ons. (You always wanted to go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your characters, making them look as wacky as possible? - This is YOUR game here, trust me!)\n\nOnce completed, you'll always be tempted to go back in again from time to time, just to wreck some havoc in the in-game city. It's like a real life anti-stress solution! ;)\n\nSo, that were my 2 cents about the game here... hope you'll have fun!","May 23, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makemebad/recommended/206420/","makemebad","Gilby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makemebad/","352 products in account","First off, the game is not terrible.\n\nThat being said, having been a huge fan of Saints Row: The Third, my expectations where sky high going into Saints Row IV.\n\nThe story of the game is even more over the top than previous Saints Row titles, though, the same can be said for a lot of the other aspects of the game. To sum it up, the story was entertaining enough, however, I don't think anyone ever played a Saints Row game for the story, so I concider this more a positive bi-factor.\n\nThe gameplay, now the gameplay in SR4 adds a lot variety, the introduction of super powers allows for even more rampage and destruction than ever before. With Blast powers, Telekinesis, Super jump and sprint, your character becomes a big ball of destruction goodness.\n\nHowever, while super powers is a lot of fun to play around with, I feel it also takes a lot away from the game. The game is INCREDIBLY easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Activities from previous SR games, like "Insurance Fraud" devolves into super jumping, clicking the mouse-button to ragdoll, and just cartwheeling all over the map at mach speed, trying to hit as much ♥♥♥♥ as possible.  "Mayhem", where you're supposed to destroy as much ♥♥♥♥ as you can with weapons provided, absolutely no point when you can just super sprint on the sidewalks and take out pedestrians, trash cans, streetlight etc. and doing this you will rack up a combo x100 times quick then you would just shooting stuff or using blast powers.\n\nThis is only a few examples, but I think they illustrate some of the problems super powers brings to the game, and how game breaking they can be. Another smaller thing, is that your superpowers eliminates the need for veichles, planes, choppers etc. Why the hell would you use a car when you can super sprint way faster, and take out anything in your path doing so?\nI have no answer, which is why stuff like getting cool veichles, upgrading them etc. is just not a big part of the game anymore.\n\nNew weapons and new types of custimzations are fun, but they end up playing second fiddle to the blast, stomp and telekinesis powers, that for the most just destroys everything. I will say that weapons like the 'Murica gun and Dubstep gun can be pretty hillarious to use and combined with super powers lets just take out enemies faster and easier than ever.\n\nSome of the newer activies/sidequests are also ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, the "into the rift" ones (think thats what they're called) where you jump in a tube collecting stuff, or the ones you use telekinesis to throw colored balls into rings with matching colors are just dreadful, a lot of the other activites aren't good either but these are the ones i remember hating the most.\n\nAs far as the missions goes, if you're like me and will just ♥♥♥♥ around doing activities in the map, at least the fun ones, you'll find that once you go to do loyalty quests, you'll have gotten most of them already. If you take away the quests that are just clearing flash points and completeting activities, the game is very short.\n\nSo why would I recommend this game? I pre-ordered this on steam, but I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it at full price, this is definetly one of those "pick it up at 75% in a steam sale" titles, and if you enjoy the type of game the SR franchise is, you probably will get your moneys worth (assuming you buy it on sale). If you have a friend to play it with, the experience is much more enjoyable in my opinion. Also set friendly fire to full damage for added enjoyment.","February 26, 2014","true","46.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story continues from SR3, where the Leader of the Third Street Saints has gained enough popularity to become President. While the aspect of being US President is quicky diminished by an alien attack, it doesn't hurt the ridicolously over-the-top, hilarious and fun narrative. The most drastic change for franchise long-timers is that your avatar now has superpowers. This is easily the best thing about the game, despite that it destorys the point of driving cars in a franchise that was previously known as a GTA clone. The open-world is arguably less interesting than what it was in SR3, but the side content is addicting, fun, sometimes crazy, and worth it. Add in a co-op campaign option, and mind=blown. This game is fun in it's rawest state. 9/10\n\n(The Game has a free weekend, I totally recommend trying it out!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/206420/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Saint’s Row 4 is a GTA-themed sci-fi superhero sandbox game.\n\nYes, really.\n\nChock full of pop-culture references, jokes, crude humor, parodies of other intellectual properties, and general silliness, this game is a farce wrapped up in a superhero sandbox/sci-fi/GTA theme. The game does not take itself seriously at all, and yet, has remarkably high production values; the characters are fully voice acted, Keith David is your vice president, and you can eventually recruit Santa and Mrs. Claus as sidekicks.\n\nThe main attraction of this game is its over the top ridiculousness. The game starts out with your character breaking into a nuclear weapons facility to stop an insane general from launching a nuclear weapon and destroying Washington DC, and it only goes downhill from there. The protagonist is a sociopathic street-thug-♥♥♥-actor-♥♥♥-politician, who puts his ex-street thug friends in charge of the country.\n\nAnd that’s just the first chapter. After that, aliens invade, everyone gets abducted and stuck into simulations of their worst nightmares – the protagonist gets stuck in a cheerful 50s-themed world – and eventually the protagonist breaks out, breaks into a GTA-themed simulation, and then frees all his friends from similarly ridiculous nightmare scenarios based on everything from fighting a gigantic can of soda to a 2D-beat-em-up to an old-school wireframe video game world. The protagonist gains superpowers over the course of the game, allowing him to completely turn the GTA-themed sandbox on its head, largely ignoring vehicles in favor of running around with super-speed and super-jumps and super-gliding, running up the sides of buildings and bouncing around the city.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is often fairly mediocre; it mostly plays like an over-the-shoulder 3rd person shooter. And yet, the sheer ridiculousness of the scenarios, the constant comedic banter between the protagonist, his teammates, and the enemy, and the general lack of the game taking itself seriously somehow combine to make the game a generally enjoyable experience. The game is at its worst when you are slogging your way through waves of rather uninteresting enemies, but fortunately the protagonist is generally so overpowered after a while that apart from a few missions where you have limited weapons, you can pretty much crush them easily. The actual sandbox aspect of the game is fairly weak; there are a bunch of missions which more or less serve as practice for various bits of the game, as well as challenges which push your ability to complete tasks with various superpowers or weapons or vehicles to the limit, but on the whole most of these are fairly inoffensive, and they aren’t repetitive enough to be annoying.\n\nSo, is it good?\n\nI’d say on the whole that it was an enjoyable experience; while the gameplay may not have been the best, the sheer chutzpah of the game actually made it pretty fun, and you never knew what ridiculous task you’d be up to next. The game does its best to make you feel powerful, and the game is, in the end, a power fantasy, an ego trip, and a comedy all wrapped up into one. It doesn’t take itself seriously, and neither should you, but on the whole, it was well worth it.\n","October 21, 2015","true","72.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you loved the Trouble with Clones DLC from Saints Row the Third (which was awesome, btw), this game will absolutely cater to that, and I love it.\n\nThis game will no doubt feel "cheap" how they decided to reuse Steelport in its entirety. And because of that, the whole game basically feels like a giant DLC for SR3. But that shouldn't detract you from getting it. There's still a ton that went into the game. And really, how often did you get to appreciate the city from their roofs in SR3?\n\nRegarding the story - if the Matrix were made as an adult comedy game, I'm pretty sure this game would be the result. The game parodies a good number of things, such as Metal Gear Solid, but by far the most prominent is the Matrix universe. Just the fact that the game introduces aliens in the first few minutes should be an indication as to how silly this game is. And they take it seriously, too (sorta)! It's all in good fun. I particularly like the ending to the Enter the Dominatrix DLC. It's a bit annoying that you can't redo main story missions. Hence if you got the bad ending, you're stuck with it. One complaint about the game is how ALL of the side missions have some introductory two-line speech about how doing the mission will help break the simulation. It doesn't. Why even include those lines? Heck you can even do those activities before the side missions are given to you, which skips the dialogue altogether.\n\nHalf the game is mini-games; the other half... is collecting collectibles. For real, there are about a thousand data clusters to collect, and trying to grab them all is one heck of a time sink. Fortunately it's fun using super powers, so it's not completely bad. Just don't do it all in one go to maintain your sanity.\n\nIn a game where it's faster and safer to outpace a car on foot, it's odd that carjacking still exists, and is even required for some side missions, but I can't really complain, as it does help slow things down to make you appreciate how nice it is to go all Neo.\n\nFor the most part the scenery is nice. It's Steelport, but with altered street signs, some new alien structures, and annoying video interference that just has to remind you every 30 seconds of the world that you're in. The perma-red skies irritate the hell out of me, as it does in all games that do that, but you can change the colors once you beat it. I really wish you could change these sooner, and get rid of the interference thing altogether.\n\nOne feature that isn't outright stated is that you can turn the radio on at most times during gameplay using the < or > keys. It's a lot better than listening to silence, and they have some good radio stations. I admit I rather enjoyed the 80s Mix. Nothing like hurling fireballs and flying around to "What is Love?"\n\nSaints Row 4 has a lot of good points. SR3 had a much more involved story and as a whole SR3 was a tighter, focused experience. SR4 ends up feeling like a giant game of mini-games. But hey, they're both good fun!","April 25, 2014","true","109.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All those things are top notch, no doubt about it. What I loved especially was the exploration of each character in turn - getting see and tear up their worst nightmares, including that of the Boss herself. I also found the push-one-button Romance system to have more depth than any of the other "mature" Romance quests in other games. Push X and the Boss has a heart-to-heart with the crew member, whether it's just asking to ♥♥♥♥, or actually talking about what that other character has meant to her. It provides genuine character growth, and I love it.\n\nThere are also ♥♥♥♥♥ bats and Dubstep and such, but those things are already understood to be really ♥♥♥♥ing fun.","November 15, 2013","true","147.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Although, I'm not a fan of the direction they took saints row. The superpowers are fun at first, but overall they diminish the whole experience. There's nothing wrong with having to drive around the city to get where you are going. With the superpowers, I don't think I set foot in a car once. And the superpowers shortened the game considerably.\n\nWith this said, this was still a good game. You can tell they put a lot of work into it, and at times I was laughing my ♥♥♥ off - just not as often as I was in saints row 3.\n\nI can always depend on saints row to provide a fun co-op experience, but I really hope they take the game back to basics and focus on funny rather than ridiculous. I know they are trying to separate themselves from gta, but they can do it via parody and comedy rather than crazy gameplay physics.\n\nIdeally, the next installment will have the basic nature of saints row 2 with the comedy and parody of saints row 3.\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

contiamo il  Saints Row: Gat out of Hell, spin-off della serie allora SAINTS ROW4 è  l'ultimo capitolo principale.Doveva essere un DLC\espansione di Saints Row3 ma la sua grandezza ha permesso alla Volition di creare un nuovo capitolo.In questo nuovo capitolo i nostri eroi hanno fatto passi da gigante ancora una volta,questa volta però hanno puntato alla casa bianca,il nostro  personaggio infatti sarà il presidente degli stati uniti.....Un presidente abbastanza bravo da come si dice nel gioco,avendo risanato il debito pubblico.Comunque questa carica presidenziale viene messa in gioco da un invasione aliena la quale cattura tutta la nostra gang  alla quale si sono uniti Asha una spia del M16 e Benjamin King  incontrato nel primo Saints Row è  il leader dei Vice Kings eliminati in Saints Row2.\nOvviamente l'umanità  viene sconfitta è  quasi tutta la nostra gang viene  portata sulla nave madre e messi tutti in criostasi.Questa criostasi consiste nel far immergere le persone in un mondo virtuale basato sugli incubi delle varie persone,il nostro personaggio sarà intrappolato negli anni 50 in un mondo dove non si possono dire le parolacce.Da qui in avanti si comincerà a combattere gli alieni ed i loro mondi virtuali,infatti con l'aiuto di Kinzie saremmo inseriti in una stellport virtuale.\nGraficamente parlando il gioco cambia di poco anche se si nota ovviamente una  pulizia generare della qualità,il frame rate è più stabile anche se ho notato che durante le "cut-scene" queste non vanno mai oltre i 30 frame.La personalizzazione del personaggio rimane alta come quella vista in Saints Row 3,abbiamo la possibilità di impostare il personaggio creato in precedenza  se lo abbiamo salvato nel sito nella Volition,ma non si possono importare i salvataggi,rendendo le scelte fate nel terzo capitolo,praticamente inutili.\nCome gameplay Saints Row 4 cambia molto,completando  il passaggio iniziato con il terzo capitolo.Saints Row 4 essendo ambientato in una simulazione  ci permette di possedere dei super poteri,con questi super poteri possiamo volare,correre più velocemente o saltare,oltre a questi poteri abbiamo anche la possibilità  di possedere dei poteri da combattimento,che si dividono in potere di congelare le persone,oppure darle fuoco,potere della telecinesi per afferrare oggetti e nemici,potere della pedata per far volare i nemici ed  il potere dei fulmini.Ovviamente questi poteri possono  hanno una base di upgrade,quelli normali si possono migliorare con i soldi che si ricavano grazie alle varie missioni secondarie,mentre quelli da combattimento grazie ai vari Cluster che si trovano in giro per la mappa ed i quali sono veramente tantissimi.\nLe missioni secondarie di Saints Row4 si dividono in missioni di lealtà verso i nostri  compagni,un po come nella serie Mass Effect le quali missioni si suddividono in varie faccende  introno alla mappa,come ad esempio sconfiggere truppe ZIN oppure hackerare un negozio di armi\vestiti ecc..Nel gioco sono presenti anche varie missioni da svolgere in co-op con un amico,il gioco offre una buona tracklist,migliore di quella presente in Saints Row3,con la possibilità di ascoltarla anche fuori dalla macchina,comunque la guida delle auto è stata peggiorata anche se in questo capitolo passa in secondo piano rimane  comunque una cosa frustrante soprattetto perché abbiamo delle missioni in qui dovremmo guidare per forza delle auto,mentre  veicoli aerei sono rimasti invariati.l gioco offre fuori dalla simulazione la possibilità di avere una storia romantica,prevalentemente solo sesso,senza sudare come nella serie Mass Effect.\nCome si può notare il gioco prende moltissimi citati,citati che vengono prevalentemente da film\canzoni oppure videogiochi.Come film abbiamo principalmente MATRIX,ma anche BREAKING BAD soprattutto per la frase che il  nostro protagonista dice "I'm the one who knocks" e Game of Thrones,dal lato musicale abbiamo Stan Bush con the Power,What is love.Mentre per quanto riguarda i videogiochi possiamo trovare in prevalenza Mass Effect per l'ambientazione ma anche per certi nemici che ricordano i Razziatori,Duke Nuke per quanto riguardano i veicoli degli alieni,Deus Ex,Mortal Kombat,Portotype o Infamous.\nIn conclusione Saints Row 4 è un gioco magnifico,criticato da molti per il suo lato meno serio è più fancazzista,ma a sto punto meglio cosi per il semplice fatto che con questo Saints Row,la Volition ha dimostrato di avere materiale ed idee a sufficienza per non  rimanere monotoni nel gameplay.Per me Saints Row 4 batte di gran lunga GTA 5 per quanto riguarda  il divertimento complessivo,anche se ovviamente  ha ancora da imparare  nel fatto di creare una storia decente o quanto meno affascinante e lunga.","April 8,

This is a lot more fast paced and a lot less challenging.  It still has the humor of Saints Row but with a little more sex jokes and a lot more cussing, so if you aren't into that kind of humor than you might not enjoy this game.  The gameplay is very different from other SR games.  In this game taking cover is completely useless and your best strategy is to run circles around your enemies with your super sprint and use your sprint takedowns.  Yeah remember those sprint takedowns that were useless in Saints Row The Third?  Yeah, they are overpowered as hell now.  Guns are horrible in most cases so upgrading your guns is a huge waste of money.  This game is really easy as long as you aren't acting really stupid during combat.  The superpowers are definitely the best part about the game.  My favorite thing to do is to climb the towers using the superpowers.  Overall, it is a fun game but is not similar to the older games in any way and is not very challenging.  If you are looking for fun I would recommend this game.","February 16, 2015","true","35.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The way I see it, it appears as a super-powered sandbox game with a higher grade of technology. The game follows a somewhat strong storyline and has some interesting side missions, unlike Saints Row: The Third, where there were no more missions after the story was complete.\n\nFocusing more on the weapons, it seems that Deep Silver Volition went a little bit overboard with the humor of some of the weapons, mainly centering the Dubstep Gun, the Inflato-Ray, and the Plunger Gun. I disliked the Inflato-Ray and the Plunger Gun, but the Dubstep Gun was interesting. To be honest, I kind of wished that DSV (Deep Silver Volition) named the remaining weapons (SMGs, Rifles, Shotguns, etc.) like Saints Row: The Third. I felt I was playing at a more realistic level in those games, and when it came to Saints Row 4, you get names like the "Quickshot Pistol" or the "Pump-Action Shotgun". Not saying that's bad, just a little vague.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the game was using former villains as my sidekicks in intense battles like taking out flashpoints or taking down wardens. I loved making rival combinations like Benjamin King and Tanya, Fun Shaundi and DJ Veteran Child, Cyrus Temple and Kinzie (my FAVORITE xDD), but you get what I mean. I also loved the homie conversations that ensued between them as well, but to be honest, I was upset about one thing: I learned on YouTube that unused content included Phillipe Loren of the Syndicate as a homie. If you "spend quality time with Gat", you and Gat encounter a super powered Phillipe Loren to battle. Unlike other enemies like Tanya, Cyrus Temple, and DJ Veteran Child, Loren was not added as a homie. I was disappointed about this because the video I watched also included unused conversations. Which brings me to my final thought on homies. It would have been cool to earn Zinyak himself as a homie, but it would also be unusual for Zinyak to be battling his own army.\n\nLooking at the super power aspect, I thought it wass okay, but what DSV was missing was a way to turn it off. Don't get me wrong, I love blazing across the streets, sending cars into the sky, but sometimes I just wanted to walk around and surprise attack someone by casually running past them.\n\nOverall, I thought the game was pretty well made. In my opinion, the game deserves a 8.5/10","January 26","true","83.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coming off of a smashing success in Saints Row 2 and 3, fans of the franchise were used to gangs, shootouts, and other stuff that is more fun than generic aliens. Simply said, this game goes down fast and hard. It is NOT worth 17 dollars, I got it for free using AMD games with gold for my gpu. The plot is generic, and I can not force myself to try to progress in this game any farther.

The game is just epic fun and has insane weapons; one of the melee weapons.. is a huge like alien butt probe and its like wtfff?! But my favorite of the melee weps. so far is the tentacle, it's fairly stong and hilarious when u thwack people and they go flying!\n\nThe game's music for everything is awesome, and the objectives around the map are quite fun. The game is like GTA but you can run crazy fast and jump high as a skyscraper. Once you start getting powers early-game you become insanely strong and your survivalability goes through the roof. You can just run away from stuff to reload / recharge your guns or just run away till people aren't trying to kill you. I'd def suggest getting the game if its on sale, I didn't buy any dlc but looks like theres a lot; but u have a tonn of customization options even without the dlc, which is a rare thing in this day an age lol.\n\n10/10 EPIC FUN GAME\n\n100/10 When you make the Dubstep gun explosive","October 21, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The way I see it, it appears as a super-powered sandbox game with a higher grade of technology. The game follows a somewhat strong storyline and has some interesting side missions, unlike Saints Row: The Third, where there were no more missions after the story was complete.\n\nFocusing more on the weapons, it seems that Deep Silver Volition went a little bit overboard with the humor of some of the weapons, mainly centering the Dubstep Gun, the Inflato-Ray, and the Plunger Gun. I disliked the Inflato-Ray and the Plunger Gun, but the Dubstep Gun was interesting. To be honest, I kind of wished that DSV (Deep Silver Volition) named the remaining weapons (SMGs, Rifles, Shotguns, etc.) like Saints Row: The Third. I felt I was playing at a more realistic level in those games, and when it came to Saints Row 4, you get names like the "Quickshot Pistol" or the "Pump-Action Shotgun". Not saying that's bad, just a little vague.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the game was using former villains as my sidekicks in intense battles like taking out flashpoints or taking down wardens. I loved making rival combinations like Benjamin King and Tanya, Fun Shaundi and DJ Veteran Child, Cyrus Temple and Kinzie (my FAVORITE xDD), but you get what I mean. I also loved the homie conversations that ensued between them as well, but to be honest, I was upset about one thing: I learned on YouTube that unused content included Phillipe Loren of the Syndicate as a homie. If you "spend quality time with Gat", you and Gat encounter a super powered Phillipe Loren to battle. Unlike other enemies like Tanya, Cyrus Temple, and DJ Veteran Child, Loren was not added as a homie. I was disappointed about this because the video I watched also included unused conversations. Which brings me to my final thought on homies. It would have been cool to earn Zinyak himself as a homie, but it would also be unusual for Zinyak to be battling his own army.\n\nLooking at the super power aspect, I thought it wass okay, but what DSV was missing was a way to turn it off. Don't get me wrong, I love blazing across the streets, sending cars into the sky, but sometimes I just wanted to walk around and surprise attack someone by casually running past them.\n\nOverall, I thought the game was pretty well made. In my opinion, the game deserves a 8.5/10","January 26","true","83.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First of all, I'd give this a 8/10. This game is very good and worth the money but I have a few complaints. Now before any of this i want to say two things, first, this is my opinion and mine only and second, I know the game is supposed to be funny and not serious. Alright, starting it off with customization. Now don't get me wrong, this game has TONS of customization but I feel like I've always had things missing. Some of those things are serious glasses,certain hair styles, etc.. Second, this game is very different from the rest of the saints row series considering the aliens and powers and such. In my opinion, the game does get a bit boring using your powers only. It makes cars and other vehicles feel like a waste of programming. All in all I miss being able to have no powers without the cheat. Anywhosers I doubt anyone will read farther than this so I'm going to end it here.

The difference is that this is a continued story and somewhat new style of gameplay where the player has "cheats" (superpowers).\n\nThe superpowers, to me, are a huge step back as it completely throws out much of the core gameplay from the previous games. In this game, you have the ability to fly, use telekinesis, run super fast, etc. There is no use for any vehicles since they have become obsolete and inefficient; running and flying can get you to or away from the fight much quicker. The physics have gone berzerk (not intentionally) in the game as well with many enemies clipping or glitching all over the place into buildings and cars flying. Guns, for the most part, are the same and do not seem to be overpowering or underpowered. The story is fine but is confusing if you are not on top of the previous games' stories. There is no more "pad" where all your homies stay, it's just you and your friends in a spaceship with no real function.\n\nAside from that, there are some weird co-op bugs that are incredibly annoying.\n\nThe game has the comedy but not the best parts of the previous game.\n\nObligatory Score: 6/10\n\nReview jumps from spot to spot so I will probably revise this some time soon.","November 8, 2014","true","41.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First of all, I'd give this a 8/10. This game is very good and worth the money but I have a few complaints. Now before any of this i want to say two things, first, this is my opinion and mine only and second, I know the game is supposed to be funny and not serious. Alright, starting it off with customization. Now don't get me wrong, this game has TONS of customization but I feel like I've always had things missing. Some of those things are serious glasses,certain hair styles, etc.. Second, this game is very different from the rest of the saints row series considering the aliens and powers and such. In my opinion, the game does get a bit boring using your powers only. It makes cars and other vehicles feel like a waste of programming. All in all I miss being able to have no powers without the cheat. Anywhosers I doubt anyone will read farther than this so I'm going to end it here. So yeah, Saints Row 4 is worth it just some minor things that make me a bit upset. Good day!","December 3, 2014","true","143.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Then one rainy day I decided to boot it up and was more than pleasantly surprised with what I discovered. Essentially the movies 'Independence Day' and 'The Matrix' bashed into one action packed escapade, this game is chock-full of witty dialogue, pop culture references, and explosions; lots of explosions. And for those of you who still think this is just another 'Grand Theft Auto' clone, I've got six words for you: you barely drive In this game. It's based much more on pedestrian missions as opposed to car driven ones. There, I said it and I'm glad that I got it off of my chest.\n\nThe best part of the single player campaign in 'Saints Row 4' is how it never grows stale; constantly changing perspectives, situations, characters, and even genre, this game keeps you own your feet and never lets you down. In just a few minutes you'll go from platforming, to 2D side-scrolling beat em' up, to sitting in a turret blasting alien spaceships out of the sky. But the game doesn't stop there, it also adds in super powers to really make things fun and gives you the ability to jump as high as buildings, run faster than the speed of sound, shoot fire out of your palms, and basically any other awesome power you can think of; yep, this game has it all.\n\nI'm so glad that I finally gave 'Saints Row IV' a chance, because this is one of those games that  you sit down to play for an hour and end up beating the whole damn thing. It instantly grabs you with it's balls to the wall attitude, tosses you up against that wall, and then proceeds to give you the thrill ride of a lifetime. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, the cut-scenes don't feel like a chore to watch, it's fast-paced, it's entertaining, it's got sex, it's got cars, it's got guns galore; it's basically the best action movie you've ever seen. Aliens have come to take over the planet, and it's up to the president of the United States to save the day. What else is new.

Now I am addicted to the series, bought Saints Row IV for this reason, and I am not disappointed for doing so, since I love those games so much.\n\nSince I like the storyline of a game, even though that game is a sandbox and is mostly focused on the world and its elements rather than the story itself, I felt a bit sad (spoiler alert) seeing how earth got blown up to pieces, since I got used to the last game where everything was pretty much normal.\nWell, that sentiment left me when I found my super powers, after I upgraded them and I forgot about cars, since that is too mainstream and I start to fly around the city like a maniac, why?

It was my first go on a SR game. After a little less than 35 hours I had completed the game (side missions included), and man, those 40 hours were the bomb. Basically you're caught in a simulation which is controlled by Zinyak, leader of an evil alien empire that unfortunately hates your guts.\n\nSaints Row IV offers you a crazy but fun, well structured storyline and a whole bunch of cool characters. What I liked most was that your companions each have unique and comprehensive storylines. They might sometimes appear a little far-fetched, but it actually felt like the characters had some epth to them. You yourself are playing as The Boss, president of the United States and quite an a**hole. You can choose between a female and a male character and can even change your gender in the gam (yay!). No matter what gender you chose, romance options and dialogues remain the same (yay! again).\n\nAs it's an open world game, you've got lots of small missions to do that include killing aliens and toilets, hacking into stores, running at high speed through the city, throwing yourself in front of cars and destroying the simulation with badass weapons and vehicles. The different cars, bikes, tanks and UFOs are unlocked in missions or simply by stealing them. It's like GTA's crazy brother who doesn't get invited to any family meeting ever because he's just insane. You can get all kinds of interesting weapons too (my fave being the Dubstep Gun), which make killing aliens even more fun.","September 4, 2014","true","33.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And believe it or not, this madness has a story. You are actually a president but unfortunately some aliens appear destroying your house (no surprise, ♥♥♥♥ happens). Then their boss, bigass alien moves you to simulation of the world... which is actually same world as in Saints  Row 3. But this time, you gain superpower. Cars are only used before you learn to super-speed-running and that will be just few minutes into the game (after intro missions). You are getting more superpowers, as you progress, like powerful stomping or telekinesis. To upgrade these powers, you have to fly across the city and collect power lighting things... and you will need to do that A LOT !\n\nThe main story missions usually bring crazy situations and... different games, that creators came up with during some friday night`s weed party - in good way of course. You may find yourself in 2D world of 90`s action shooter or in a... damnit just try that out and be surprised - thats what this game do the best.\n\nOptional quests are not that great. They give you few tasks to do in simulation, like finish a Blazin Activity, climb a tower, kill a toilet... and for reward you get some drunk costume you wont ever use. However, it is still somehow fun :D If you want to finish all optional missions and activities, you will spend most of gameplay in simulated city flying everywhere on map, which can get pretty booring after some time. If you want to complete challenges... well have fun, see you in a month.\n\nOh, this review was made from my Single Player experience, but i guess co-op can be even more fun !\n\n+ MADNESS !\n+ Superpowers !\n+ Co-oP option !\n\n- Flying isnt as much fun, as driving, while cars are actually useless in this game.\n- Map activities are way too easy\n\nWhile SR3 had 9/10 from me, i liked it a bit more, so...\n\n8/10 !","December 11, 2014","true","22.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

An excellent wrap up to the Saints Row main franchise and one of if not the best written comedy games I have ever played. Superpowers are incredibly fun to play around with endlessly and Deep Silver really outdid themselves with the amount of creative, wacky, and downright insane toys and weapons to play around with. Honestly I can't think of a single major criticism for this game, it has everything you could ever want in an open world game, outstanding amount of gameplay and content and limitless ability to do it all.","December 13, 2014","true","52.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This whole superpower abilities are fun, but it makes the guns almost obsolete. The game concept got already semi-old in the third game and this one didn't change in any way, it just has the superpowers added. I hope that the new Saint's Row game will change though. Engine, gameplay, whole concept. Doesn't have to be a revolution, an evolution would be enough.\nSo - this game is really fun. It has an awesome sense of humor, the gameplay is fun and afterall it's also a good game. Nothing revolutionary or extraordinary.","November 11, 2015","true","18.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
