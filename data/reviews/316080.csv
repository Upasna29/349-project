The puzzle mechnic is to pick up and carry a yellow cube (I'm assuming your parcel, you clever developers you) and bring it with you to the exit.\n\nThis is where the game gets interesting, by placing, pushing and pulling your parcel to block lasers and make your way to the exit. It's challenging in a way I want my puzzle games to be. Just enough but you feel satisfaction when you complete a puzzle.\n\nIt seems theres a ton of content already, a puzzle creation toolset, and a work in progress story.\n\nThough the $9.99 price tag may be a bit much for some people to take a blind leap into, however, I think it's worth it. There's not to many well made puzzle games out there.\n\nWith active developers and community input I could see this turning into a real gem of a puzzle game with the endless possibilities with user created content.\n\nHere's my First Look Video of the First World Check it out!

Yes, I am talking about your brain. Your are going to need that, so take it with you when you dive into the fantastic puzzles of parcel. Dark, yet colorful atmosphere allows you to stay as long as you like and after a while game ramps up the difficulty so, that you constantly stay properly challenged.\n\nEvery cleared level feels like a huge victory, althought they might seem a bit intimidating at start.\n\nDataspheres have also proven to be interesting in two ways. Getting them is an additional challenge, and after reading some of them it seems like their content properly justifies the extra effort required to get them. Things that they hint or reveal about parcels dark world are both entertaining and puzzling in their own way.\n\nAll in all this game deserves to be played. For an early access game this seems very well finished and polished, and there is no lack of content!\n\nI warmly recommend!","March 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","24","29","4","0"

There were no videos or reviews up for many hours, and this game seemed perhaps a little steep.. and I've been burned on some of these Indie puzzle games already.  But I took the leap anyhow.\n\n..And I am happy that I did.\n\nThis game is not just great, it is absolutely brilliant.  And a ton of fun to play as well!\n\nYour job is to get past laser beams using the well thought out level designs with your single block in hand.  Along the route from where you start to where you must get to, you'll need to use your block by placing, pulling, or pushing it to block laser beams that obstruct you.  Death is not possible in this game, it simply won't allow you to step into places you can't go.  Sounds simple.  But as the levels quickly get more cleverly designed, you'll need to actually use your brain power for something besides a just a goop of grey matter sitting idle between your ears.\n\nThe brilliance in the game mechanics, well designed levels, fluid controls, and nice graphics makes for one of the most satisfying and fun puzzle games that I have played in years.\n\nOver 120 puzzles already in early access?  And the ability to create your own, share them, and play other players levels as well?  OMG.  Add in the ability to play local co-op on a single computer as I did in the video with my son, and you have yourself a little Indie gem here.  This game is the reason I take chances on "Indie" games.  This game is easily one of the best puzzles games I have ever played.  ...Enough said.\n\nIs it worth your $10 USD?  ...If you really need my answer after reading this far, you might wanna get better at "thinking" if you do buy this game.  You'll need to increase your thinking power if you have to ask me that after reading this review this far or watching my video!  :-)\n\nTo the developers who are Polar Bunny Ltd:  Thank you much for this masterpiece of a game!  I love it and look forward to seeing this game as it develops further and any future games you guys design.  Fantastic job, and well done!","March 27, 2015","true","1.7"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","32","44","6","3"

The next one is magentic and can pull it (but not push), and the third one can only use switches that can block and unblock pathways and those robots with lasers. I haven't gotten to the fourth one yet.\nSo these are different skills, and since the objective is not only to get the box where it needs to go, but all of these toons as well, it can get a little hairy. It is a lot of fun to play together, because you're continuously helping each other out. Most levels have at least two characters, those that have only one are usually quick.\n\nThe mechanics are simple, yet the last level we played took us half an hour - we think we did half of the levels, but the game says we're 25% done.\n\nPush boxes with a friend! I'm sold. Parcel turned out to be a very accessible, very enjoyable brain twister.","August 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

To get a Community Achievement, I just needed a throw-away type of game.  So, I went looking for the cheapest game with Trading Cards and Workshop support that I could find.  That game was "Parcel" (on sale).  I am agog.  Honestly, this is one of the best games I've played.  In concept, it's simple.  Over the course of the game, you unlock six characters (each with a special ability).  You've got to move some subset of those characters (and perhaps pick up a "data sphere" (which give you the storyline) along the way) to their own ending positions.  It's not complex.  But, by the end of the game, it becomes very challenging to do.  In fact, the game makes you wonder about your own intelligence:  I can't count the number of times I got stuck (and confirmed my stuckedness repeatedly in my own head), gone off to view a walkthrough, only to realize I'd missed something simple.  It's embarrassing.  It took me 42.7 hours of very interesting gameplay to finish the game with 100% Achievements.  So, not only do I recommend the game at the ridiculously low price I found it at, I also recommend it at its full list price.\n\nI do have some issues with the game.  Most of them fall in the "wish the UI were a bit different" category.  But, the one gameplay issue I have is that the difficulty progression isn't smooth.  In general, the later levels tend to be harder than the earlier ones.  But, from level to level, the difficulty might oscillate between easy and hard without reason.  Of course, it's very possible that a level I found to be challenging might be easy for someone else (and vice-versa).  So, I'm not sure if that's a gameplay issue or an individual cognition issue.\n\nAnyway, some of my UI change wishlist items are:\n\n- It would be nice if each level kept the level number, level name, and active character's name on screen during play.\n- The use of the above items should be consistent between Achievements, gameplay, and level selection.  Right now, it's a bit confusing knowing what's what because each area refers to objects differently.\n- There needs to be more hand-holding right at the beginning until you realize what you're supposed to do.\n- On a couple of levels, for some reason the lighting bleeds through around the characters and/or their ending point beacons.  It makes it very difficult to see who's who and where they're supposed to go.\n- The "We Don't Need Another Hero" Achievement requires you to NOT even finish the tutorial for one of the characters until after you finish all the levels possible to complete without him.  Yet, the Tutorial level for another character you need before getting that Achievement uses that missing character.\n- The last several Achievements don't pop up when you meet their requirements.  Instead, you have to repeat the "Boss' Room" level a second time to get the pop-ups.\n\nAgain, all of the above are minor and I highly recommend the game.","February 5","true","42.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Its great to see indie developers like this put out a solid product that really captures the passion they put into it. This is the kind of game that really shines with steam broadcasting too, the minor delay not being an obstacle in allowing you and a friend to work together in analyzing and deconstructing each puzzle and having a rewarding time doing it.\n\nI hope Polar Bunny's passion is rewarded with this but I can see this game falling through the cracks for a lot of people.

A great thing about this game is that it provides controller support, so if you have multiple controllers and friends to play with, you can play this game with multiple people (up to 4).\n\nThe number of people that can play is based on the level, but once you unlock the third character, most levels are usually at least 3 players.\n\nNow in terms of enjoyment in the game, it all boils down to this.  Do you enjoy challenging puzzle games?  Do your friends like puzzle games?  Do you enjoy your friends?  Regardless of the answer for the last question, this game is for you, as it can be used as a great griefing engine if you wanna trap them in a 1x1 square surrounded on all sides by laser spiders.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun multiplayer puzzle game at a great price. 10/10","November 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Despite this - as long as there are no major regressions - I can already recommend this. Why? Because the characters really come together.\n\nLike your standard puzzle game, each character has one simple mechanic that is pushed to the limit by each puzzle. However, this game has 4 (or so) of these characters. Individually, with the various laser set-pieces, they can be part of  pretty darn challenging puzzles. Combined, they can be made into extremely hard puzzles... with extremely satisfying solutions. Several of the built in puzzles have brilliant "aha" moments, which is key to a good puzzle game.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid - not a single gameplay glitch. There are a few visual bugs and grammar issues - and as mentioned before, the menus still feel shaky. The worst part of the menus is that a whole set of "special place" levels are hidden behind an extremely unobtrusive button. A "switch space", taking inspiration from Super Meat Boy's light/dark modes would work better, I think.\n\nI've played through a large number of puzzles (I am pleasantly stuck on some of them), yet there are still a lot more to go. I've got 5 hours on the clock with maybe half the puzzles solved.\n\nWhile the editor is clearly unfinished, and filled with usability issues and weird behavior, it "does the job". I wouldn't want to design a level's visuals in it, but hammering out the logic is easy enough and lets you build your own mind bending puzzles, if you feel inspired. (I was)\n\nThe sound effects, visuals and animations are nice. Some of the built in levels look bleached out from overlighting, beyond the pleasant cacphony of neon, but generally everything is both functional and pleasant to look at. There are a couple of visual problems in levels which make them unnecessarily hard to solve, I want to see those fixed before I'd recommend this without the early access tag (unlit squares and visually obstructed squares). The music is nothing to write home about, but it's not offensive and you can mute it.\n\nI bought it for full price, and I'm extremely happy with it. I look forward to solving more, and to horrible people creating insanely hard community levels.\n\nDisclosure: I know the company behind Parcel personally. Still, I wouldn't sacrifice impartiality for any of them. ^_^","April 15, 2015","true","7.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The price for early release is still a rip off so much less inclined to recommend on that alone.","March 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Great graphics, cool characters, neat concept & gimmicks, but the gameplay falls very short. My main complaint about this game is how easy it is to get WAY off track when solving a puzzle. Now keep in mind, you are able to make a "save state" and reload with the backspace key to where you left off if you make a mistake, but the questionable level design allows the player to make a lengthy set of moves, only for it to fail completely when they realize one wrong action completely ruined their meticulous strategy, and they have to start from the beginning anyway. It's not a good feeling, and it severely demotivates the player from wanting to continue. One thing I would suggest instead of having this faulty save state option is to simply take back one move every time the player hits the backspace key (or alternatively press and hold backspace to rewind the play field back to where you want it); that alone could save a ton of headaches and frustration later on in the game.\n\nThat being said though, I still enjoy the core concept this game brought. I like the idea of having all of these characters each with unique abilities that the others don't have, I just wish there was more flexibility with the solutions. In a good puzzle game like Portal 2 there are more often then not multiple solutions and/or routes to approaching a solution. But for this game you are expected to make a very specific and meticulous set of moves from start to finish that would not be too far off from trying to split an atom. I've always hated puzzle games that go this route, and it is NOT good game design.\n\nOverall just an okay game, but it does have potential. It's up to the developers whether or not they feel this game could benefit from making improvements.","December 3, 2015","false","24.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","12","24","2","0"

Do NOT play this if you are not up to deep mental challenges. Most people won't be able to finish even the tutorial. However, if you DO like this kind of brain punishment, you will really enjoy this.\n\nThat said, within that genre, it's a nice game. Graphics are shiny, I bet for some it's "too" colorful, and probably nicer and more detailed than a puzzle game would require, but anyway. Music is ok; it doesn't "shine" but it doesn't need to.\n\nThere are lots and lots of levels, almost all with extra challenges to collect or achieve; again, some of these are crazy hard. That alone means this game will last quite long even for the smartest of the smartest; most people will give up before running out of levels. But if thats not enough for you, there is a level editor with steam workshop integration. Not many games include that amount of content for this price.\n\nI don't enterely agree with the game design, it's too constrained to the one designed solution and it's very easy to get stuck. But I guess that's what was intended, and for that intend, it sure works.\n\n","September 27, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Recommended for people who like puzzle games with a high difficulty and a high tolerance for frustration. Really interesting mechanics, with 6 different characters that unlock as you progress through several stages, each of which will help you deliver a box (the "parcel" to its destination). Yellow guy = carries a box, Red guy = attracts the box, Green Guy = toggles barriers (for the box), Blue guy = swaps characters (and the box), Orange guy = jumps through barriers (including the box), Purple guy = smashes walls (but not the box). You get TONS of levels, tons of bonus levels, and the puzzles are very difficult so you'll get your money's worth based on time. It looks like a dinky little game but it's not (I spent 30 hours). There's also little collectibles throughout the game, which is great, but it's the only little bit of story there is. The cons are the color scheme, which looks like someone turned the constrast and saturation up to maximum, so much that it's hard to see the characters. Also, the 3/4 view at times blocked accessible pathways and made them look inaccessible. There's also a limit on the number of times you can use certain powers, which means that even if you have a fantastic, efficient plan, sometimes you'll be just one swap or jump short and have to start from the beginning, sometimes with an entirely different plan. There's only one "right" solution, and they even set up the characters in such a way that you never have leftover moves. (Like blocking in the only character that can act first, so you waste two swaps just to be able to start). There's no leeway or chance for lateral thinking. Still, the levels that weren't agonizingly frustrating were fun, and overall there were only about 12 of about 80-100 puzzles or so (I'm too lazy to count) that I couldn't finish or needed a hint on. (Also, there's no hint system, which sucks.) There's also an incremental save function which is helpful, but you can't have multiple save points, so if you are overconfident and save too late in your actions, you'll have to restart from the beginning. Annoying.\n\nSo, overall, I enjoyed myself, got about 30 good hours of play. Definitely challenging, maybe even grueling, but I don't entirely regret my purchase. Not for the faint of heart.","February 13","true","48.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
