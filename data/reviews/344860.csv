"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/344860/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","I wasn't sure what to think when I started this game up. The intro combines Ys 2 and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Apparently Rita Repulsa has become a J-RPG villain, and it's up to D!ck the dragon to stop her. Along the way, D!ck is joined by Loops the thief, Fu Mario the sheriff, and Razzle the demon. Before you ask, yes I named these characters myself.  Over the course of six chapters, friends are made, monsters are slaughtered, and heroes...heroes...um...heroes do heroic deeds.\n\nCrystal Story II was conceptualized, designed, programmed,  written, and drawn by one person. He probably also made sandwiches and mixed drinks for the composer and voice-actors. I respect this dude's hustle; the game isn't bad at all either. A lot of what makes CS2 work is in its charm. It'd be easy for me to write up a huge list of J-RPGs and just say "Play all these instead", but CS2 has something special going for it. It's that certain nebulous quality that frustrates reviewers like myself; the kind who think "If this game has this, this, and this, but none of that, then it is awesome."\n\nExploration is handled in a very banal manner. The first five chapters stick to genre conventions. There are dungeons, towns, and more dungeons, and the plot is the mortar that holds these bricks together (or was that vice-versa? Analogies are weird). Unfortunately, there's no real exploration to be done. When you reach a new town, you won't find anyone to talk to (unless they're plot-relevant). The dungeons? They're semi-random and divided into several rooms. The layout changes, but treasures stay the same. It's all very bland and dull but here is why I find it appealing: They're short! We all know what to expect when we enter a dungeon: monsters, treasure, and progress. I look at it like this, CS2 strips out the filter so I can focus on what matters. There's no wandering, no interruptions, no "we should camp here for the night" after walking two blocks. Bing bang boom there it is, fight the dungeon boss, and move on. I'll save the epic 3000 floor dungeons for another time.\n\nThe battle-system is comparable to Grandia. Never played it? Shame on you. Here's the gist of it: Ally and enemy alike are displayed on a time-line, their turn is next when their icon reaches the top. Simple attacks or item usage causes characters to fall maybe 1/3 of the way down the line, while powerful spells can knock them to the bottom. Status effects such as sleep or stun will keep them from moving up. Early on you'll gain a real appreciation for a high speed stat, because you'll be taking multiple turns for every one the monsters get. Also, by piling on status effects you can keep monsters from acting. For most of the game, this probably won't amount to much. However, expect lots of post-game bosses that'll wreck you for 90-120% of your party's HP if you let them get a turn. For the most part, battles stick to JRPG standards: Regular encounters are a cakewalk, story-bosses expect you to pay a little attention, optional fights demand that you know what you're doing.\n\nLeveling up is similar to FF13. There are multiple classes, each with their own abilities and stat-bonuses. Eventually all four characters will learn every ability, and you decide on who nukes and heals, who buffs & nerfs, and who stabs & slices. You'll want to specialize to get the most out of every turn. Also you can accumulate a ton of scrap to strengthen your favorite weapons and accessories. The system is basic, but well-done.\n\nUnlike far too many RPGs, Crystal Story II doesn't have a thousand flowery names for every item, spell, and monster you come across. A Healing Potion isn't called a Diffluebo, the Skeletons aren't Sticzis, and you don't cast Firagrammo, you cast Fire II. There are some out there who might cry foul at this, and make up some junk like "names = world-building". There is a time and a place for all of that, and you'll find neither in this game. This is something that I'm thankful for. It makes for an easier game to just pick up and play, since I don't have to quickscan a FAQ just to remind myself of which healing spell is which.\n\nAs the store page will tell you, CS2 has a handful of minigames:\n-Match three\n-Tower defense\n-Card game\n-Snowboarding\n-Hacking (?!?)\n\nThey're not astonishing in quality, and you'll find better versions in other games (possibly even other JRPGs), but they're amusing diversions. I never fussed with Plants Vs Zombies or any similar game, so learning and subsequently completing the tower defense mini-game was pretty entertaining. I could do without the snowboarding though, blech.\n\nHonestly, I'm shocked that I enjoyed Crystal Story 2 as much as I did. I was so quick to write it off at any moment, but a crapton of those moments came together to form 20+ hours. It doesn't hit the highs of other JRPGs, but it also doesn't have any of the lows. While I didn't get 3 hours of tremendous 1080P CGI cutscenes featuring D!ck the Dragon, I also didn't have to put up with 15+ hours of tortuous nonsense because some guy with spectacular hair and a goofy sword decided to take the scenic route. Aside from one short incident, everyone in your party are bros to the end. There's no shouting matches, and Fu Mario doesn't run away while crying "WHY IS RITA SO MEEEEEAAAAANNNNN?!?"\n\nIf you want a quaint little adventure this is a safe purchase.\nIf you love grinding (and who doesn't?!) this is a very safe purchase.\n\nI wasn't sure what I was looking for when I got this game, but I guess everything worked out.\nYMMV\n\nHoly smokes I never even noticed. The first Crystal Story is included as well. I'll have to give it a go sometime.\n\n\nBTW: What's wrong with saying D!ck? Is it so wrong to be named D!ck? What if I wanted to review Mary Poppins on Steam? I imagine that'd be pretty hard if I can't talk about D!ck Van ♥♥♥♥.","February 10, 2015","true","20.1"," 110 of 122 people (90%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","90","110","122","55","0"

While rarely laugh out loud funny, you'll probably smile a little.\n-Great music\n\nCons\n-The graphics are... less than stellar\n-Dungeons are repetitive and can get dull\n-Nothing new to see here\n\nDon't let the Newgrounds era flash looking graphics throw you off, this game is actually quite a gem. The story is light and fairly predictable, but keeps your interest with quirky characters that do a good job both paying homage to and flipping cliche conventions. While not the most well-rounded around, the main cast is generally likable (Especially Lina, she's adorable and spunky without being overbearing or annoying) and the NPC's form an oddball cast that--while not terribly memorable--serve the purpose of keeping you entertained.\n\nThis is very much a game intended to appeal only to fans of the genre looking for a quick, light revisit to the old JRPG glory days. In that, it delivers wonderfully. Fans of old-school Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest and the like will find all of this wonderfully familiar, and should have absolutely no trouble jumping right in. For some, the 'been there, done that' aspect of it might be a turn off, but for me, it was exactly what I was looking for. A fun, accessible turn-based battle system, and a slightly unconventional level up system (you apply your points directly to learning skills or gaining ability points, rather than it happening automatically, with new paths unlocking once each is complete--it's basically a stripped down version of Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid), combined with the ability to both improve your equipment, and forge new adds much needed depth, and gives the game a spot on balance between easily accessible and customizable.\n\nIt's not breaking any new ground, but it's not really aiming to. If you're looking for a fun look back at the great JRPG's of the past, you could do much worse than this little fling.","February 8, 2015","true","28.3"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","34","37","8","0"

And that's just assuming a low number because I don't know how high my actual playtime is.\n\nCrystal Story II is just a simple, turn-based RPG with a very light-hearted and nonsensical story. Altogether, that's what the game boils down to.\n\nPlay it, however, and you'll find an intriguing battle system with four fully customizable characters and a plethora of equipment to buy and spells to learn.\n\nThe story really isn't anything groundbreaking, but come on, it was orignally a made-for-free flash game. For that standard, the story is far from awful and will actually keep you curious for a good bit.\n\nAccompanying the battle system is an INCREDIBLE soundtrack that seriously blew me away, even on the flash websites. Seriously, this guy needs a medal for his sound design, and you can listen to the whole OST in game once you hear each song once in game.\n\nThere is also voice acting (some, most of the game is told in text), which, while in my opinion quite good in battle, lacks a little professonalism in some of the cutscenes.\n\nWith a wealth of bonus content and games, the original crystal story (so you can see how much the author improved, that's honestly the only reason to play it), and a great package, seriously, jtus get this game and support guys like this. He has wonderful ideas, and even though I don't like paying for games all that much, the SECOND i saw this was available, I bought it.

I bought this game out of boredom mixed with low funds in my Steam wallet, thinking that it would grow repetitive, like most other turn-based strategies I have played, but I thought wrong. With unforgettable characters from both the 1st and 2nd games, a easy to get into story, fun and colorful artwork, a card game, fishing, a defence minigame, cool music which transitions into even cooler music when entering a boss battle, you can play the 1st game right through the main menu, and all for $2.99! If any of these things appeal to you then I would highly recommend you buying this game. The only con I can think of is the heavy required grinding it takes to beat some of the bosses within the game, and the only reason it is a con in my eyes is because it is time consuming and grows somewhat repetitive. Also, if turn-based strategies aren't your cup of tea I wouldn't recommend it to you, because aside from the minigames that is pretty much all this game is.

It was amazing when I played it on newgrounds and it's even better now. Crystal Story 2 is the kind of game which you might consider "casual fan" before realising you've invested hours upon hours of playing it and trying to get everything. It's the type of game that beats all odds and exceeds your expectations.\n\n\nStory: ++++\n\nThe story of Crystal Story 2 isn't anything really unique. You've probably seen it before. Unlikely hero in a strange world finds a party of friends, travels the world and beats the ultimate evil. However, the developer acknowledges this and instead of trying to glorify it, he has fun with it, plays with various cliches and over-used tropes and ends up creating a very entertaining, fun story which...miraculously...even manages to surprise you at various points in the game. I won't give anything away but get ready to laugh, cry and go "Awww" in the most unique "cliche" story you will ever experience.\n\n\nCharacters: ++++\n\nNot much can be said about the characters. They're your usual teen party that saves the world from the evil demon. You have the spiky haired, half-dragon protagonist, the over-excited rogue/thief, the broody emo and the over-emotional teenage girl. Throughout the game, you'll meet other characters as well, some of which were in the original crystal story as well. If you play that first, they're fun to run into and talk to, albeit, somewhat weak in combat.\nAlthough each of the main characters fills a specific anime trope, they all have debt and never feel hollow or uninteresting. Each time you stop in a town, you get to speak with them in the inn and explore their personalities a little more.\nThe game takes itself seriously but not TOO seriously. The characters perfectly reflect this.\n\nHowever, their team dynamic is the real focus here. These characters would be decent at best if solo. But seeing their interactions together is what makes this party so interesting. You can see they developr real relationships and have fun together. Their relationship is better developed than that of many high-budget JRPG parties out there.\n\nThere's also a robot side-kick you unlock after reaching Crystalia, the capital of the world. However, he never leaves Crystalia so he's as good as gone after you leave the place. His purpose is to tell jokes and change the character names. The jokes are puns. Hear at your own risk.\n\n\nGameplay: +++++\n\nThe gameplay is rather typical. Turn based combat, various classes to pick for your characters, explorable environments and a variety of mini-games to play through-out the game. And yet, as simple as that might seem, it actually becomes rather complex and fun once you unlock your second class.\nThe characters get stronger as you play by acquiring SP (skill points) through combat and then spending them. This replaces the typical level system with a much better and way more fun class system. Each class has 5 levels and each level has a pre-set amount of stat spheres you can unlock with SP to make each character stronger. When you reach the final stat sphere, you unlock a secondary level 1 class. This repeats until you max out 2 level 5 classes where you can choose a 3rd level 1 class. This however happens either very late into the game or with a lot of farming so you won't ever be overpowered unless you are ready to grind.\n\nIn addition to the main quests, the game offers a variety of side-quests and mini-games as well. You can collect trading cards in the world and then play a rather addictive card-game at an inn. You can look for loot in fishing ponds. You can do bounty hunts before and after the games final boss. You can participate in various arena battles and get stronger. Or you can just ♥♥♥♥ back and enjoy the music from the inn's jukebox. There's no rush. The game makes it obvious it wants you to have fun and decide for yourself how you want to progress and when.\n\n*(Note: For any fans of the thief class, you should know that stealing in this game is also very rewarding. Some could argue it's actually essential to unlock everything but you can go through the game without worrying about it.)\n\n\nCustomization: +++++\n\nThe game has a very rich customization system.\nYou have a weapon slot and 3 armor slots (which are practically for both armor and accessories). You unlock the armor slots as the game progresses.\nWhile this is straight-forward enough, the real focus of this system is actually in the upgrade system of your equipment. You can upgrade literary everything.\nAll items have levels and stages. Most start at stage 1, level 1. You upgrade their levels using money and scrap metal (which you can either buy, steal or find by killing enemies). Then, you'll be prompted to upgrade their stage using a crystal. So now you have an item stage 2, level 1 and you can upgrade it further.\nThis system is flawlessly designed.  Your items will never feel useless or weak because you can always upgrade them.\n\nIn addition to this, there's also an in-depth crafting system. What this means is that you can use your loot to create even better loot. Essentially, you'll be using it to craft your starting gear into stronger gear. So instead of using 2 slots, one for an MP trinket and another for an HP trinket, you'll combine them into 1 item and free 1 slot.\nOther than equipment, you can also craft items such as potions, elixirs and bombs. This process, however, becomes almost mechanical after a while since you'll never run out of the ingredients required for these items.\n\n\nWorld: +++++\n\nThe world is actually surprisingly large and rich considering the price of the game. You have a variety of towns, dungeons, secret locations etc. and you'll never feel like they're repeating themselves. There's also a lot of end-game dungeons which are practically the climax of the game. Even more so than the final boss. And, of course, there's an extra chapter after the main storyline ends which adds even more to an already surprisingly large game. I honestly can't believe how rich and well-made this RPG is.\nThe overworld is also well designed and feels nostalgic to old school RPGs.\n\nOne thing you might consider a drawback is that the towns feel practically the same. A hand-drawn background of whichever city you're in and a menu with which you can access the inn, the shop etc.\nOnce you reach Crystalia, the inn is replaced by a palace but that's about it.\nThe real difference between them is that later towns have more items available in the stores. However, after a point you won't actually care about that. Eventually you'll return to Crystalia every time since it's the only town that has your robot sidekick in it as well as scrap metal for sale. The arena and the card battles are all the same throughout all towns. The only reason to return to older towns would be to complete the bounty hunts and after that, you'll not be seeing them again.\n\nNot much else can be said about the world. It's vast, it's fun to explore, it feels great to be in it.\n\n\nSoundtrack: +++++\n\nThe soundtrack fits this game perfectly. It has everything. It's reminiscent of the bit era of music but it goes beyond that.\nEach area has a unique track to go with it both in the exploration and in the combat segments. This means that you'll never get bored, hearing the same track over and over again.\nThere's also specific themes that are made solely for the story segments.\n\nIn addition to all this, you can also use the jukebox present in every inn and listen to whichever track you wish (only requirment is that you've progressed far enough in the story).\n\nHonestly, this is the type of effort I wasn't even expecting from a game of this price. The music is practically a selling point in and of itself.\n\n\nAchievements: +++\n\n\nNothing noteworthy here. The achievements aren't anything I looked forward to earning. Most of them practically happen as you play the game. By the end of it, you'll already have most of them and you still w","August 17, 2015","true","38.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Remember that this is my first reveiw, and I haven't finished the game.\n\n\nThe art style is hit or miss, depending on your preferances, but in my opinion it works quite well for the game. The art matches the tone of Crystal Story 2, so I think it works.\n\nThe combat is well crafted, and fun! The enemies have interesting designs, and I actually found it pretty enjoyable. The timer, I guess you would call it, is also interesting. It shows when the enemies/characters can tke an action, and where they are on the timer (it's kind've a scale) can be changed by multiple things-stun for example. I've never seen this mechanic before, so props to the developer! The mutiple debuffs and buffs are fun to use, and some enemies have interesting attack patterns, the Friendly Sprite, for example. It always get's to take action first. On it's first turn, it buffs another monster/itself. Then it's fast enough to get back to the top of the scale, and either buffs another monster (or itself) or attacks.\n\nThe plot is a pretty baic 'save the world' narrative, which I'm fine with. Nothing else to say here.\n\nThe inventory system is well made. It's not a giant overlay of thousands of menus, it's just a few compact menus packed together nicley.  You can equip armor, which I honestly haven't found much of.\n\nThe last thing I'm going to touch on is the class system. It's not your standard clas system. Yes, each character does start out with a base class, but you can get them more classes overtime. That's confusing, I know. So, each charcter has a class. You can click on the class icon and acess this tree-ish menu. You use 'SP' to 'buy' stat upgrades to your character, and also to get spells, that are all on this long line of stat boosts. After you've gotten every stat boost and spell for a given character's class, you can give your chracter a new class. It's a well made mechanic, that I like!\n\n\nOver all, I'll give it a 8.5/10. It's a very good game.\n\n-Zero","February 12, 2015","true","14.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Im kinda sad i bought this on sale, i wish i could have given the developer(s) the full price XD\n9/10","February 16, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

If you do no like Final Fantasy, or others in this genre, then this game is not for you. The game runs smoothly, and the glitches are small, such as dismantling a talisman giving an amethyst instead of a sapphire. The story is present, and not horrible, but able to be skipped. It has a few easter eggs buried in here for those who look, but other than that the story is a basic JRPG one, saving the world from ancient disaster, all that kind of stuff. Playing the original browser game is uneeded to understand the story, although they do make some jokes for those who've played it.\n\nCombat is good, with higher level enemies and bosses needing a fair amount of planning to defeat. Most fights aside from the bosses are able to be avoided, and grinding is not needed until the post-game, if you play your cards right. Plus the battle arena makes grinding coming down to mostly skill. The boss fights are somewhat sub-par to FF standards, but the final boss meets this just fine. For the price, it gives a few hours of enjoyment, plenty of side quest bosses, plus a very challenging post game that really pushes you.\n\nIn terms of tips, the battle area x is great for gaining levels and items post game, plus the stat boost items when using dice. Never use alchemy for equipment other than weapons because you can find those as drops, and use the alchemy deconstruction on the start and last stat boost equipment to rack up as much scrap needed to upgrade weapons as possible. Pray to RNJesus for dice and other rare gear early on, Hold off from buying items in bulk until you get the 25% discount in the water temple, get only what you need until then. The locked blue chests contain rare cards, and the key is hidden in the final level, so don't stress yourself looking how to open it. Save rare items like elixer brews and rocket burst bombs for the final boss fight. Don't be afraid to have a charactor take a different class for a level, as gaining important skills, like buffs, is important since every charactor learns different spells from the same class. Debuffs can fail, and its best to use one with a speedy charactor who can cast them in rapidly to hope one lands on the boss (speedy thief is best for this). Finally, your weapon level decides your ultimate, so you cannot get the achievements for using them until they're level 2 or above, and you unlock the final one at level 4,","February 16, 2015","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art is well drawn, the animation is decent and the gameplay is great.\n\nTurn based combat can be quite the sticky thing, do it wrong and you have a boring game that's annoying to play. Do it right and you've got players enthralled and eager to beat the next boss. Crystal Story II has managed that amazingly well. Speed intergrates smoothly into the play and there's a handy bar to the left displaying when each character has his/her turn.\n\nThe weakest part of the game so far has been the story. It seems to be the old tired and true "return the crystals" routine, although admittedly I am (as of wrting this) only two hours into the game and not entirely sure if that is the main goal here. The plot isn't forced down your throat either, it's their enough to give you a drive in the game and the characters so far are genuinly interesting. It's a nice touch to be able to name them yourself too.\n\nIf you like RPG based games, or just want a fun way to spend some time, definitely try this out.","February 7, 2015","true","14.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Oh my god I am fully erect, and an RPG I love to death no less. I played for about six hours straight before forgetting about the game as it was on NEWGROUNDS, who the hell goes on newgrounds anymore?\n\nCrystal Story II is a final fantasy like RPG created by lan14n on newgrounds with help from a few other people, it got very popular rather quickly, and so Lan14n decided "I could greenlight this on steam and make a bit of money off of this, that'd be very cool" and now it's on steam for three dollars. Is it worth it? Yes.\n\nIf you want to know if you should buy the game play the newgrounds version for a bit, then decide if you'd pay to play this amazing game. I personally bought it because I love Crystal Story and I want to support it anyway I can. Please make a Crystal Story III PLEASE!\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple, it's what you would expect from an RPG. You walk around and do quests and such and sometimes you fight enemies. The combat is also, again, rather simple. You can either attack with your equiped weapon, use a special attack, use an item, or skip your current character's turn. Once you reach a certain level you can change your class, the classes you can change to are the same for each character, they are Slayer, Thief, Elementalist, Guardian, Healer, and Trickster. I will not go over what they do as I have not really experimented with it yet, even in my newgrounds playthrough. But that reminds me. There is also a "skill tree" I put quotes on it as it's not really a skill tree it just contains a bunch of stat boosts that you gain through SP which you get from killing enemies. Once you finish your first skill tree you can then change your class to one of the classes I mentioned before which will have its own skill tree which you need to finish before you can change classes again.\n\nCHARACTER TIME!\nThe main playable characters are: D, Lina, Mari, and Kaz. They do things.\n\nAnyway if this review didn't make you want to buy this game then I guess I failed. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf this review DID make you want to buy this game then I guess I didn't fail.

Its a light casual adventure title about a young dragon who goes off in search of monsters. Theres a decent amount of content. The characters are geniunely adorable and the monsters are downright scary. The music in between cinematics was nosgostic and were light enough to be heard throughout. The voiceovers were really well done. Sometimes simple is better. There are various minigames that youll complete as you move through the areas, a great stat gaining system and good number of characters to player from as you progress through.

This is very clear by the fact it has a card game (nothing like triple triad) with cards you find from dead enemies, turn based fighting etc.\n\nThe game has several fun mini games (Fishing mini game, bejewled rip off and more), amongst grinding out levels (which isnt really needed) and doing story missions which I didnt find very much interest in but I havent finished the game yet.\n\nCrystal Story has a nice sound track and art style. The music is soft but kinda nice, doesnt get too repeditive and is overall not too bad.

Not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, as the story is mainly just for giggles and give you a flimsy reason to play, but the characters are charming enough, and the inclusion of the first game means there is a lot of content to be had.\n\nOf course, the game wouldn't be worth playing through the content, but CSII is a sublime distillation of RPGs and their battle system. There is always decent difficulty, but the challenges posed against you are always fair, and fair warning is almost always given when you may be going in over your head. You can blow through the main campaign rather quickly, but the real attraction here is the sidequests and the variety of boss monsters you get to face. There is a lot of wonderful loot, and the upgrade trees available through leveling are pure freedom, as you can more or less make each character into whatever strange hybrid of classes you like. This is the first RPG in a long time where I actually looked forward to battles, which is an admitted rarity these days.\n\nIf you aren't feeling a classic battle however, there are a handful of well-thought out minigames that break up the potential monotany. All are optional, but they provide a charming time and show just how much love the developer has for this game. There's a charming couple takes on match 3 gameplay just because, and there's a surprisingly thought out card game that you can check out whenever you want. Neither are perfect, but the card game in particular is deceptively intellegent in its execution, but simple enough to pick up. Honestly, if it was to ever be fleshed out more, it could make a decent standalone, though a bit threadbare at the moment.\n\nCrystal Story II is definitely a love letter. Flawed, fun, and evidence of a work of passion, its sense of humor and immense amount of content only began to wear on me around the 50 hour mark, and is a game I plan on finishing to completion somewhere down the road. A great addition to anyone's library to see just how great an indie RPG can be.","April 21, 2015","true","57.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a turn-based battle system where you can choose between attacking with your weapon, using skills, items, and delaying your turn.\nWhen you defeat enemies you get SP and most often items/gold, too. You use this SP to buy permanent stat bonuses for your character from their class "line." It's not a branching tree with different skills to choose or anything like that, it's a simple line with occasionally a choice between one stat boost or another and some skills down the line. Once you finish the first class line  you can choose one of the other 6 class lines for "Level 1." So if you were in the Slayer I line you'd get to choose to start Thief, Trickster, Elementalist, Healer, or Guardian I line. After your second line you go up to the 2nd class line so you'd have a choice between Slayer, Guardian, Healer, Elementalist, Trickster, or Thief II. Rinse and repeat. Keep in mind that you're not likely going to have access to the previous skills of any class for a character if you bypass it. So you might want to choose your classes based on which skills that class will get, but you don't get definitions of the skills until you're committed down that class line.\nDon't worry terribly much about stats, because those can be balanced with wearing certain equipment that you can upgrade with Scrap Metal and gems you come across. Scrap metal can be found in battle, stolen from some enemies, or later on purchased in a shop.\n\nThere's more to the game, but I don't want this review to be too long so in short there's a lot to this simple game. You fight monsters, you focus on how you want your character to level up, you can play minigames, fight bosses, grind all you want, and play through the game at your own pace.","February 23, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a branching tree with different skills to choose or anything like that, it's a simple line with occasionally a choice between one stat boost or another and some skills down the line. Once you finish the first class line  you can choose one of the other 6 class lines for "Level 1." So if you were in the Slayer I line you'd get to choose to start Thief, Trickster, Elementalist, Healer, or Guardian I line. After your second line you go up to the 2nd class line so you'd have a choice between Slayer, Guardian, Healer, Elementalist, Trickster, or Thief II. Rinse and repeat. Keep in mind that you're not likely going to have access to the previous skills of any class for a character if you bypass it. So you might want to choose your classes based on which skills that class will get, but you don't get definitions of the skills until you're committed down that class line.\nDon't worry terribly much about stats, because those can be balanced with wearing certain equipment that you can upgrade with Scrap Metal and gems you come across. Scrap metal can be found in battle, stolen from some enemies, or later on purchased in a shop.\n\nThere's more to the game, but I don't want this review to be too long so in short there's a lot to this simple game. You fight monsters, you focus on how you want your character to level up, you can play minigames, fight bosses, grind all you want, and play through the game at your own pace.","February 23, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It even comes with the first game and there are quite a number of achievements to unlock. So I pretty much recommend it.\n\nSide note: Soundtrack is pretty sweet too.

But the story unfolds in an entertaining, often humorous way, using cliches seemingly by design. This is evidenced by numerous references to other JRPGs of the past like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest and Breath of Fire. Ultimately, it wears the cliche hat proudly and doesn't try to be anything more.\n\nIf you're worried about missing something from the first game, never fear. The game comes complete with the first game included!\n\nThe gameplay style of Crystal Story is standard dungeon-crawling fair, either clicking your destination on the screen or WASDing your way around. Encounters are seen on screen and can be avoided a la Earthbound and Chrono Trigger, which is always a welcome addition. In addition to the main storyline, there are also numerous sidequests, often involving chasing down and taking out a boss monster.\n\nBattles are very fluid and fast-paced in this game. The way it plays out is familiar to anyone who's played a Super NES RPG. On the left side of the screen, you see a meter with every participant on it, rising to the top. Once someone's icon  reaches the top of the meter, they may perform an action. Again, pretty straightforward.\n\nOne of the ways this game excels is the level of character customization. While Crystal Story 1 features a mostly linear leveling system dedicated to investing points into learning new skills, Crystal Story 2's character growth system is almost bafflingly expansive. as you progress, you choose one of six class specializations, which opens up an experience tree. For each step on the tree, you invest an increasing number of experience points (or SP, in this game). These tiles can either be a set stat increase, a new ability, or a choice stat increase, in which you can choose which one of two stats to increase.\n\nThis seems complicated, but it truly isn't. The level up system in the game is incredibly intuitive and allows a ton of customization as you make your numbers go up in general. One minor complaint I have about the system, however, is that maybe it's a little TOO precise. Often it feels like more trouble than it's worth opening up the level up screen in the menu and distributing points. It's a slow and often flow-breaking process.\n\nThe game also boasts mini games such as a Pipe Dreams style lock-picking game, fishing, and a simple puzzle game which is nonetheless fun in and of itself. Even if the puzzle game in question basically comes free on most smart phones these days.\n\nAs for the music? It's fantastic. The tunes are incredibly memorable and really capture the mood of each scene. Even the simple opening title music has a way of sticking in your head sometimes.\n\nThere's not much to say about the graphics. They're fairly simple in a hand-drawn, anime sort of style. Storylines unfold via stillframe cutscenes which won't light the world on fire. That said, the simple style of the graphics makes it incredibly easy to tell where and what everything is at a glance, making the visuals intuitive and easy on the eyes.\n\nThe main storyline of both games are relatively short, but they both have a lot of post-game content to keep you amused.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to this: did I get 3 dollars worth of entertainment out of this? Definitely. It's a straightforward game with old-school JRPG fans in mind. As such, your enjoyment of this will likely depend on how much you like that style of gaming.","March 8, 2015","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is sort of linear for some reason if you do stop playing the game and pick it up, you'll immediately know what you were doing. The combat is simple enough that you'll get the hang of it after the first couple of battles; hell, even the battles themselves are fairly short (except challenges and some bosses) so grinding isn't even a chore.\n\n9/10 would definately play to the end,","July 10, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now the gameplay is fairly nice, nothing seem to be absolutely new here, but the wealth of stuff and how its all weaved into the game is appealing. Their is also humor to the story & game, its easy to see that some elements were taken from other sources, but I don't think its a bad thing, it gives it a bit of a parody style and its amusing, too many games take themselves far too seriously, its nice to see a lighter mooded game like this.","June 29, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may think $2.99 isn't worth it, but trust me the time I deposited into this gaming thinking it wouldn't be satifying was proven wrong, it's worth three bux. For all those who play RPG elemented games, i'd recommend this, and if you're playing this on the internet browser, i'd recommend getting this as well, updates are coming up on this version but not for the BROWSER version i'm afraid.\nOVERALL VERDICT: 8/10\n\nBTW has anyone realised you can port to the first Crystal Story game through the end of the Credit's End?","April 22, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It uses a time based system somewhat similar to child of light that adds obvious flair to a turn based system.\n\nFor the price it provides a lot of content, and if you are dedicated to finishing it, you'll likely spend at least 6 hours completing it, on top of the various sidequests.\n\nStory is not usually something I focus too much on in games but it's obvious that a lot of work has gone into the dynamics between the characters and the main tale.\n\nThe level up system gives you a lot of choices in how you would build your characters, similarly to FF13 you are able to level up your characters on different classes, giving them some versatility.\n\nI would say the RPG elements are somewhat small, giving you some options to play around with but perfect for someone who doesn't want to get bogged down by a lot of complicated systems.\n\nI enjoyed the game, it's very simple to get into and easy to sink a lot of time in.","May 21, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard to care for any of them and the game prefer to push you forward to finish quests, hunt down enemies and level up. A lot of grinding but not as bad as a lot of RPG's (especially J-RPG's).\n\nIn overal, good game and there's a lot to do in it. If Crystal Story 3 ever gets developed I hope they'll consider giving the characters some story development as well.","June 10, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You pick one of (trying to remember the number...) ~6 classes, which each gives different stat bonuses & moves, depending on the character in question. Once you complete the path of ~25 'nodes' you can pick another class to continue on. After completing 2 classes, you then pick from the original group again, except the classes are now Rank 2, and have new stat & skill rewards for the tree.\nAlso, every fifth or so node will give you the choice between 1 of 2 rewards, so you can actually vastly change your party as time goes on - I had one character receiving only Attack & HP boosts to the best of my ability, leaving a slow and powerful guy who's next to impossible to kill; I also made 2 characters focus on All-hitting attacks with high speed, so they can continually barrage the enemies with solid amounts of damage. The 4th character I focused on a range of magic abilities, so that powerful healing and damage could be carried out against more physically-oriented enemies.\n\n\nEnemies roam about on the field map, the standard 'don't want to battle, don't make contact' system; dungeons are broken into squares, with all the enemies per square acting as one unit - you make contact, you fight all the enemies on the screen as one. There's room to exploit this to find certain enemies for items, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nStory-wise it's pretty standard, 'Save the world from a thing, slowly learn more about it' - it nicely frames the gameplay, and has some nice characters; nothing exceptional, but it all tends to work within the game's desired atmosphere. I've only finished one chapter, so it could develop far more than I've seen. I should add that the chapter end wasn't too hard-hitting or notable - indeed, I only noticed because of the achievement popping up!\n\n\nI'm not sure if it would get worse, but it has a few issues regarding simple grinding to break the flow of combat - once you unlock the battle arena you are immediately treated to a fight against several groups of weak enemies that yield a large amount of skill points, crafting parts and money in one go (enough to power through multiple nodes early on); there is no restriction to the number of times you can do this, so with each character having a Hit-All move, this can be quickly rushed through several times, granting far more rewards than it deserves to...were you patient enough this could probably see a person reaching end-game strength within a couple of hours, potentially. Obviously this isn't that bad, just don't do it - or do it,if that's your bag. Some people would probably call this a bonus feature.\n\n\nGraphically it is what it is, nothing really goes against the visual style you see. Some breaks and odd parts in various dungeons, but really nothing bad enough to warrant discrediting the game for it.\n\n\nWaffle waffle etc etc. It will at most be a few £s, and it's definitely worth it if the above sounds acceptable to you - I got it for 99p in a sale, definitely glad I gave it a shot; for me, it rivals a few chart J-RPGs I've bought in the past. It does the genre proud, at a time when it's mostly fading into obscurity.","May 1","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because yes, in fact, Flash games DO make it on the market, like this one. And EBF4. And Machinarium. And GemCraft:CS. Yeah.\n\nAnother neat feature is that it includes the first game packaged with it, so you can have fun with that too (though you can find that online as well).\n\n5/5 will be farming circlets/full armors again.\n(HUGE TIP: check the wiki for known steal tables!
