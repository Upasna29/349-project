Well...I'd like to say that it comes to "coincidence" in this 30-90 minute game...depending on your framerate and untrustworthy, oversensitive camera...\n\nExhibit 1: The island.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691252625\n\nTwo halves of an island separated by a river and a "halo cloud" reminiscent of Death Mountain or Dragon Roost Island?  Nope....definitely never seen that in The Legend of Zelda before....\n\nExhibit 2:  The big pig carrying.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691252389\n\nHave I had to carry pigs before as a task?  Have I had to carry them over my head?  Mmmm....nope....doesn't sound like The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker to me...\n\nOf course, let's not forget some pretty bad sword-combat....which you're better off doing a Hulk Smash to bypass.  (Missing screenshot due to awful frame rate (which only runs at 10 FPS or less as quite a few other reviews have complained about).  As if the awful frame rate was not enough, the camera is probably one of the most sensitive things I have seen since hearing from families who have suffered tragedies.  (Oh, and there is no OPTIONS menu where you can alter the settings to decrease settings to improve performance.  Have fun with that...)\n\nThough this game has a noble purpose in "educating" people about Hawaiian culture, the "Learning" areas are completely optional.  Too many reasons for me to flunk this game.....is there something that takes the cake?   Yes, this is a STUDENT PROJECT!!!\n\n1/10  Free, has achievements, but needs a LOT of work....and may get sued by Nintendo...\n\n(Also, Windwaker is much better than this...even if it was kinda' boring most of the time.)","May 26","false","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This is the first time i have done this so, hopefully i make atleast some sence.\n\nPros\n- Cute art.\n- Nice take on Hawaii culture.\n-- Good story/moral.\n- Cool pigs Except when you break them\n- Short.\n- Music. Cute?\n\nCons\n- Unoptimised for the most part. i experienced frame drops, with a decent PC.\n- Combat is not good. You can walk back and forth switching powers to avoid hits.\n- Some information is not relayed to the player properly, thus leaves you to wander and wonder.\n- Controls are bad, you can stop pressing W and still be walking for up to half a second.\n- Lack of jump makes navigation a pain, if you fall down a ledge, you run around and get back up.\n- Short.\n- Music. Repetetive.\n\nQuestionable design in some, if not most places but all in all, its worth a play  i guess...  , some tips when playing though:\n- To get a coconut you need to power up your smash and smash any tree.\n- Do not drop the pigs if you do not plan to restart that quest\n- You can switch between powers, mid combat. Useful for a boss!\n- Walking is slugish so use the speed (blue) powerup.\n- Smash is useless in most places except for that one coconut quest.","April 26","true","0.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","12","23","7","0"

After reading the reviews about the messed up tutorial, I have to say I was worried when the tutorial came up. The scene was very basic, almost ugly, but I was relieved when I actually got into the game. The character animation was basic, but that's to be expected on such a small game. But what really took the cake for me was the artistic style. It was actually quite enjoyable. The soundtrack is also killer, making this game a good casual game to play. I will definitely play more. I only stopped to write this review!\n\nTL;DR\nPro: Attractive art\nPro: Great Soundtrack\nPro: Educational!\n\nCon: Basic animation\nCon: Some enemy balance issues.","April 26","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Priceless.\n\nThe use of Hawaiian terms is less than subtle. Most games that introduce new terminology do so slowly over time, rather than in your face like this game does.\n\nDespite being open world, the game is exceedingly linear due to enemy stats and character development.\n\n\nAll in all, huge disappointment.","April 28","false","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

Unfortunatly, there are a lot of problems. My main two ones are no jump/climb cliff and poor optimisation. The game looked terrible, and lagged a ton. I do have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, but it definatly runs games better than this. However, if you have a decent PC and just keep in mind this is a FREE indie game, you should definetly give it a try. I personnaly loved the switching abilities on the fly idea, and think it could and should be taken further.\n\nEDIT: Also love the island ;;;))))) Lots of memories from when I was too stupid to play the original and just goofed off on the main island in Windwaker.","April 28","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had just the right balance of exposition and info to gameplay, also.\nMusic - Excellent. Fit the game, without being intrusive, which is what all video game music should strive for.\n\nCons\nCombat - I came to this directly after fumbling around in Dark Souls, and I feel like the combat in this is just as harsh and unforgiving. I wasn't expecting to have to kite in this, and exploit the fact that enemy health doesn't regenerate while you run and eat healing items. Basically every enemy killed me in one or two hits, and in the case of some of the enemies, that would mean having to run across the entire island again to get back to them.\nQuests and map - The quests were a little unclear, and the map was no help at all. Granted, the island is small, and there are only so many places to check for things, but with no indication of even a general area to look in, it had me running around aimlessly until I stumbled upon the thing I was looking for. Also, that the text doesn't change after you get the item is a bit confusing. I'm super ADD and fight with brain fog every day, and by the time I got my coconut I'd already forgotten what I was supposed to do with it. The shrines aren't even on the map, and there's nowhere to get more detailed quest info, like "once you get the coconut, take it to the shrine to _____, which is on the western side of the island". Or something like that.\n\nOverall, for a first game, it's pretty good. The concept, art, and audio are really solid, and while I did have a couple of brief instances where my framerate tanked for no clear reason, it ran well on my system. The combat, as I said, can be challenging, mostly due to controls, which could use some tightening and the option to change mouse sensitivity within the game. I'd also love to see an in-game cursor, I feel like it would help a number of things. The developers seem to be really active, as the game only came out a couple of weeks ago and they've already released a patch to fix some bugs and clarify some things in both the game and the game's menu. I think this is a really promising start for these developers, and I hope Maui turns into a bigger game at some point, because it's really quite lovely!","May 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is unique and colorful, and the music was beautiful.  The premise for the game is also fun and unique.  Please fix!  I really would like to play more of this game!  I would definitely pay for a working version of this.","May 19","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see weird textures, and everything is laggy. The game is still a mess.\n\nSo why is it recommended? Because I'm so psyched for a game about Hawaiian culture. I was expecting something like Never Alone and while it was far from being so polished and nice, there is a lot of potential here that I hope to see realized one day.","May 15","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game is pretty still early. I woould really love it if it wouldn't lag so much. The freeplay is quite limited, thinking I needed to like build a hut or something. Its also I quite simple game.","June 3","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BUT WHEN THE ACTUAL GAME LOADS, IT GETS FAR WORSE. It TANKS down to 5 fps as soon as the level loads in, and the graphics look like Nintendo 64. Congratulations, the most poorly optimized game i have ever seen in my entire life goes to - Maui. The only thing that makes this game worth downloading is the bomb-♥♥♥ desktop icon.\n\nEDIT: On the bright side, at least the developer of this game isn't a money ♥♥♥♥♥","May 29","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
