The movement feels very responsive, and you never feel like the game cheated you out of a life. If you die, it's your fault.\nThe game brings back a lot of mechanics, but does a good job at adding new features and giving you new weapons to keep things fresh.\n\nAlthough the game might follow a few typical game tropes, it is fully aware, and makes fun of it to keep it from being annoying. For example, the slightly hand-holding tutorial has the nerd swearing and annoyed at the fact that it just keeps explaining stuff.\n\nA lot of the jokes are slightly more subtle callbacks to AVGN episodes. Sometimes it can be simpler things like using an "F-bomb" as a weapon, which literally just is a bomb with the letter "F" on it.\n\nYou select the level you want to play using an map screen. You can freely choose which level to try next, and can come back to a level later on if you rage quit it. Each chapter is meant to parody a game or is themed towards some sort of joke from the show. They all look colourful and diverse, so you don't get tired of the levels you're playing.\n\nOverall, I think the game is a lot of fun. If you enjoyed the first game, this is just more of the same, but with a few new and cool features. If you haven't played the first game but are into platformers or difficult games from older consoles like the NES, then you will also enjoy this. It's got potty humor, and is quite immature, but it's just silly fun.\n\nAgain, fans of the Angry Video Game Nerd are the ones who will enjoy the jokes the most, but they can cater to anyone with a similar sense of humour.\nReally fun game!","March 29","true","9.0"," 67 of 91 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","67","91","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torashu/recommended/409660/","Torashu","Torashu™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torashu/","351 products in account","As a long time AVGN fan from way back in '04, this as a game hit all the right notes to me in terms of fan service. While the first game was fun but unfairly hard (Those Death blocks), this one hits ♥♥♥♥in' ridiculous difficulty with it being much more fair. So let's dig into Screw Attack's latest attempt to give the ♥♥♥♥IN' NERD the platformer game he rightfully deserves!\n\nGRAPHICS: The visuals are a lot more shiny here, with more blood this time with gore that you can kick around. Being under the Unity engine, the game is appealing to the eye overall. Some enemies from the first game have returned, but it's not too big a deal. The death blocks have even got a slight tweak to their design, and the backdrops to each world is something to marvel at.\n\nSOUND: The soundtrack sound a HELL of a lot nicer, Specifically "Security Breach", and "Hang Dong '97". Each music track fits with what level you're trekking through, but certain levels pretty much have just a variation of the first song. That's not a bad thing, mind you!\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is where I'm gonna tell you this: Don't you ♥♥♥♥in' DARE start your game at any difficulty that isn't BALLS TO THE WALLS. If you're a GOD DAMN MAN, YOU WILL PLAY IT.\n\nThis game is definitely gotten tuned up better than AVGN 1. Not only are the controls a bit tighter, but you're able to wall jump, punch, and glide your way through the 22 ♥♥♥♥♥in' levels to save the world (So long as you actually went out of your way to find the Nerd Gear, of course.) The Nerd starts out with his trust NES Zapper and quickly gets his Wall-jump Loafers during the middle of the Tutorial. As the game progresses normally, you blow up the Nerd's house and are treated to the World Map.\n\nEach stage has its own visual gimmick, but let me tell you, this game is as unforgiving as the dad you keep kissing ♥♥♥ to, only to never see him smile and say "I love you". No, this game is that dad that'll slap the ♥♥♥♥ outta you, call you a wimpy ♥♥♥♥♥, tell ya to grow up, and stick a cigar on your tongue just for good measure. Death blocks are back again, but not as many as before. That doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ with everything else!\n\nPitfalls, enemies that take more than a few hits to kill, enemies that'll float past barriers to give them a shortcut to James' vital organs, and Bosses that are as big as my ♥♥♥♥ing ego. And lemme tell you, it's a large ego. Oh that's not all! You get insta-death lasers, spikes, sawblades, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of other things. And if you're playing the "BALLS TO THE WALLS" difficulty, you're only given 2 HP that are shown in Roll N' Rock beer bottles. One more hit, and BAM! Chunky Salsa everywhere.\n\nThis game's got plenty of that ol' tried and true Nerd humor, with swears and farts, and even a special guest that everyone who follows ChannelAwesome would recognize as AVGN's Rival. And lemme tell you, It was amazing seeing him there. Let's hope these two get together in more projects, as I happen to enjoy the both of them.\n\nOVERALL: If you're the kinda guy like me, that loves the Nerd enough to haul ♥♥♥ through some of the most difficult platforming you've ever played, and yes, even harder than Ninja Gaiden and Megaman Combined, mixed with fart jokes, Swearing up the ♥♥♥, and absolutely love Platformers...this game is for you. It does the Nerd justice, and it's overly hard enough to where you feel pride welling up when you kick a boss's ♥♥♥ to the moon. It's an amazing experience that'll be worth that $15.","March 30","true","5.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","21","28","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/409660/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","Much, much better this time around. The AVGN game series pays homage to classic games, particularly run-and-guns like Mega Man. It also is packed with watered down versions of some of the worst and nonsensical video game tropes, albeit without making the game a chore to play, as well as AVGN's own non-blocking commentary throughout the game.\n\nThe first game was good, but suffered from overly simplistic controls and its short length. In this one, in lieu of multiple characters, you get direction locking for firing and permanent upgrades based on NES accessories the Nerd donned during various cinematic sequences. (particularly the Nerd vs. Rob the Robot) This really streamlines the overall experience as you don't have to fiddle with awkward character switches and sudden control changes as a result.\n\nAs for its length, it's probably about 1.5x to 2x longer than the original, about equivalent to Mega Man X1-X3. There are 16 full-length levels (individual levels are shorter than in the original), the tutorial level (which is hilariously replayable), 8 miniboss fights in those levels including the tutorial one, and 6 boss-only levels for a total of 23. Your first run will probably last 2-3 hours but speedrunners could cut it to maybe 30-40 minutes or so, menus and cutscenes included.\n\nThe soundtrack is a mix of old and new tracks, but its scope reflects the longer length of this title.\n\nDifficulty...it's almost objectively easier than the original. Hard (Old School) is the new Normal, since that difficulty still gives you kegs. (a secondary that recovers your health) The next difficulty (Hard as Balls) gives you only 2 beers and no kegs, (and nothing that replaces them either) shooting the difficulty of boss fights into the stratosphere.\n\nGAMEPADS: It seems they've added support for non-DirectInput gamepads, like the various SNES controller clones. AVGN 1 did not have this. Good for them for adding this support...it's a lot of fun playing an old-school game with a rigid dpad like NES/SNES had.\n\nLast but not least, the humor and meta-references are surprisingly strong considering how they blew through so much A-material in the first game. The AVGN movie, the "feud" with the Nostalgia Critic, and Board James are the three major untapped wells they drew from and it all came together pretty well. Nostalgia Critic plays a role similar to Break Man/Proto Man in Mega Man 3 (plus his pattern is very similar), though it ultimately goes in a very different direction.\n\nEDIT: One downside worth mentioning is it seems that boss patterns are way more RNG than in the first game. Minibosses and the Area 51 boss are especially RNG. This is somewhat compensated by "easier" high difficulty modes which give you more than 1 health and infinite continues, but it can become very frustrating nonetheless. This is still a minor issue.\n\nNeedless to say, AVGN fans who like run-and-gun platformers should find this one enjoyable.","May 26","true","6.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Okay. Now this game has gone from a perfect 10 to an 11. Now that The Critic is theboss of this game. I hope he is the end boss. Probably will be something insane. But it's nothing the Nerd hasn't seen/been through. (and or handle)\n\nBut. Something tells me that the final battle will be all of the other bosses again. Like in Mega man, and similar to ghosts n goblins with it being all a dream and having to work your way to the end again. Holy shnit if that happens I think I'll flip shnit. God I hope the devs don't read this and actually do it. Oh no. Can you imagine?\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros:\n-The new powerups & upgrades. I like how it uses the Mega man/Metroid like feature and more other game mechanics.\nsuch as the grip loafers with wall jumping. (Haven't done that in a while.)\ngun upgrades like in Contra with with spread shot gun.\n\n-Challenging design and platroms.\n-SMB3 like map. But you get to choose a few paths.

Here's what I've been through.\n\nI played this game for an hour. And I only opened like what? defeated 1 boss and did some levels?\nThis game is really something else.

I just miss the death scenes where the nerd talks shnit of how much he regrets his life being stuck in a shnitty game.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JusticeisDead/recommended/409660/","JusticeisDead","JusticeisDead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JusticeisDead/","98 products in account","AVGN II: ASSimilation made me think about the quality of the first game. The first game, created by Clickteam Fusion 2.5,  is still a love-letter to the games of the NES era, specificially with the likes of Mega Man. However, the first game never seemed to have it's own identity due to the bland textures and unfairly difficult level designs. This sequel, though, improves on every level, and I am glad I pre-ordered it. The new game mechanics including the obtainable upgrades add more versitality to the Nerd, and thus, allows the stages to feature new- and more interesting- obstacles and designs that challenge your timing and coordination. By switching to the Unity Engine, Freakzone Games created a more visually-striking game. The color pallete makes the game stand out, and the retro-style lighting makes the game look beautifully retro. The story is just as lacking as in the first one, and the final boss,   Death Mwauthzyx, returning from the AVGN Movie, feels uninspired as one stage theme is based on the movie 	 . The sound track is just as great as the original, yet there's more variation to the tunes this time around. Overall, AVGN II: ASSimilation does a great job at fine-tuning out the problems of the original and creating a great, replayable, and overall fun experience. If AVGN 3 exists, I will buy it.","May 29","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

For starters, why is there so much lag?! My PC totally meets the system requirements and then some. Theres no reason why a game like this should require a high-end PC to run! At least give people the option to turn off some graphics options like the bloom or something like that! If my PC can run modern FPSs flawlessly there's no reason why an old-school style sidescroller should run like crap!\n\nI love the map system in this game, but if it's going to utilize such a map there should be more stages. They might as well have stuck with the Mega Man style stage select screen in the first one and made the levels longer.\n\nIt's still a good game, I personally liked the first one better, but if you're an AVGN fan as I am, you'll like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealfrezno/recommended/409660/","therealfrezno","FreezingInferno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealfrezno/","381 products in account","Let me be quite clear. I strongly disliked the first AVGN game. I felt it betrayed its retro-themed spirit in favor of emulating a bad game as some sort of "joke", was highly flawed as a masocore experience, and relied far too much on referential AVGN canon humor rather than come up with original humor of its own. Now a sequel's come out, and I must admit that it improves upon many tiny aspects of the game that upset me before, making it far more playable overall. It still, however, falls into several of the same pitfalls that the previous game did.\n\nAs the Angry Video Game Nerd, you run and jump and shoot through 22 short levels, each with their own themes and gimmicks. This is a step up from the last game's Mega Man style approach of 8 longer levels; the brevity means that you're only playing a stage for 5 minutes or so before moving on, and moves things along at a solid clip. This also means that levels can be built around a certain new element; there are autoscrollers, swimming levels, stages with gravity flipping mechanics, and timed platform navigation, to name a few. The myriad and multiple placement of the first game's infamous "death blocks" has been toned down... mostly. Though the levels don't spam their instant death hazards too much, the game just couldn't resist the lure of the death blocks in the end, and there are sections where they get a bit overused.\n\nThe big new mechanics involve making the game more like Mega Man X; almost immediately you get a wall jump upgrade, and five more upgrades can be found hidden in the levels. They're welcome, but honestly don't add much to the game other than minor help on the stages. Beating the game with and without them is virtually identical, and the powers don't help navigation through the stage in any major way. Limited use items found in the game fare a bit better; the keg, which refills your health, is a welcome addition. It makes bosses a bit easier, as most of them give you a keg so you can damage race them. This is espeically apparant with minibosses.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fine, and the presentation is well done, audibly and visually. Some annoying filters are present in certain levels, especially the final one. AVGN references are still here in full force, unfortunately. The game does take strides to add its own humor, but more often than not the gags fell flat for me. The things that are references didn't amuse me terribly, either; though I understood the references, I was not particularly impressed by them. The two most prevalent in the game are the constant re-appearances of another Internet review type, Doug Walker's Nostalgia Critic, and a world themed around 2014's AVGN movie. Mileage may vary on this, so if you loved it in the last game, here's more of it.\n\nIt IS an improvement over the first game in a lot of ways, but in the end thanks to Steam's binary I gave it the thumbs down because I think you can do better with your money. At $15 USD, you're getting about two hours of play time. If you want a superior retro-themed experience, for that cash you can get Shovel Knight, one of the finest retro-esque games to come out in a long time. If you want an old-timey game that pokes fun at♥♥♥♥♥♥ences old video games, Castle In The Darkness is a third of that price, and longer to boot. If you want to see and hear AVGN gags, rent or buy the AVGN movie, or watch the videos on Youtube for free. If you see this on sale for 5 bucks in a year's time and kind of like the AVGN, you may find it worth your time. Otherwise, I'd steer clear and go for something else to get a better bang for your buck.","March 31","false","3.9"," 26 of 62 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","26","62","2","3"

Yet again I think its strictly AVGN fans because most of the jokes you need to watch I think now Cinemassacre in general because theres references to Board James, The AVGN Movie like its to me now not just AVGN its all of Cinemassacre.

Apart from that the gameplay is like the first game (Lots of dying).\n\nGraphics:\nAVGN 2, like the first game uses a classic retro art style but unlike the first game AVGN 2 gets a sort of filter over the game, I can't think of a way to describe it but in my opinion it works well and makes the game look even better. In the end, don't expect AAA graphics, it's a retro styled game.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in AVGNA was fantastic, the soundtrack was easily one of the best parts of the game and in my opinion AVGN 2's soundtrack is even better and a remix of one of the songs from the first game is even used is AVGN 2's soundtrack.\n\nFinal Score:\n9.5/10, It's a fun game with challenge and an amazing soundtrack, if you are a fan of the Nerd I recommend this.","March 30","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you're on easy, you get only 50 to beat the stage in, and trust me, you're gonna need them.  The platforming is old school punishing, requiring perfect timing to get out alive.  Shame the same can be said of the bosses, which can be beaten quite easly (on easy mode, I was able to beat most of them without dying).  The humor is also spot on with the AVGN series, and the conflict with Nostalga Critic is also amusing.\n\nBut there is one BIG flaw in this game.  The game's graphics have a much higher setup than the last game, which will cause lag and low frame rates on anything other than top of the line machines, making many stages more frustrating that challenging due to controls not regestering correctly due to lag.  I think this is probably due to the graphical effect many stages have (water effects, film grain, etc...), meaning that most run of the mill computers cannot handle many stages, and it will be more luck than skill to get you by (which is not how this should be, because when running at the proper frame rate, the controls are solid).  This lag can be much worse if you plan to record gameplay for Let's Play videos.\n\nSo if you have a really good computer made to play high end games, pick it up.  If you have a standard computer system, wait for a patch to fix the lag, and/or some kind of graphics option.","March 29","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Angry Video Game Nerd 2 Assimilation!\n\nSo what's different? Well like all good sequels they've taken everything that was good about the original and expanded upon it.\n\nThere are new power ups that permanantly upgrade the Nerd such as a power glove that lets you smash certain blocks, the ability to slide and a charged shot for your zapper.\n\nThere's a brand new overworld map that let's you choose which order to do stages in and N E R D cartridges to collect scattered throughout each level.\n\nThere's also a bunch of cameos and references to Nerd episodes and Nerd movie which are hilarious.\n\nEach level has a different theme such as NES Ninja Turtles, old school horror games, sci-fi games, japanese games and a Board James themed level!\n\nThey toned down the death blocks from the first game and i can safely say things are a little easier in this game than the first, the bosses in particular are incredibly easy. Graphics look about as good as the first game and the music is ok, I don't think it quite matches up to the brilliant soundtrack of the first game but there's some catchy tunes in there.\n\nSo yeah, if you liked the original game you will love the sequel as it's more of the same but on a bigger scale.\n\nHere's looking forward to Angry Video Game Nerd 3!\n\n","March 29","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a great game plays well and feels great with the controls no matter if your using a keyboard or controller.  comparing it to the first game its a hell of a lot funnier every time a dialouge box pops up i cant help to laugh. The difficulty of this game is hard to explain for the most part its easy but timing is a key aspect to it but the puzzles themselves are easy the first game is probably harder becasue the puzzles themselves were harder to figure out. the bosses are awsome and have great parody names. Some of the items you need are actully hard to find. It was great to see that board james got its own area as well as the character being in the game. Anyone who loves AVGN or wants a decently difficult game give it a try its greatly designed and very humorus. if your new to AVGN this is clearly the better game over the first unless your a fan and want both. I really recommend buying this game and its really fun. also for anyone new heres links to the youtube channel and the cinemassacre website. i would have liked to talk more in depth but dont want to give away spoilers.\n\nThe website\nhttp://cinemassacre.com/\n\nYoutube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0M0rxSz3IF0CsSour1iWmw","March 29","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My personal favorite is when you have to ride a Tanooki that crushes enemies with its testicles and defeat another giant tanooki named Scrotoro.  What sets it apart from the original game are a few new mechanics.  FIrst off, you can wall-slide like in Mega Man X, which is a great feature that's easy to pick up and use.

Apart from that the gameplay is like the first game (Lots of dying).\n\nGraphics:\nAVGN 2, like the first game uses a classic retro art style but unlike the first game AVGN 2 gets a sort of filter over the game, I can't think of a way to describe it but in my opinion it works well and makes the game look even better. In the end, don't expect AAA graphics, it's a retro styled game.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in AVGNA was fantastic, the soundtrack was easily one of the best parts of the game and in my opinion AVGN 2's soundtrack is even better and a remix of one of the songs from the first game is even used is AVGN 2's soundtrack.\n\nFinal Score:\n9.5/10, It's a fun game with challenge and an amazing soundtrack, if you are a fan of the Nerd I recommend this.","March 30","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed the first game you should definitely check this out. Or hell, if you enjoy side scrolling shooters like Mega Man, also check this out. You don't need to be a fan of the Nerd to enjoy this game. I'm a long time fan of the Nerd, absolutely love him and his work, but I'm gonna make this review completely unbiased (afterall I'm reviewing the game, not him, right?). I'll also update this review as I play the game more and more.\n\nThis game is pretty great. Classic side scrolling action. Very well done. This game expands on the first one by quite a bit. New upgrades and weapons change up how the game plays. In the very beginning you unlock wall jumping which you'll really have to master, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time! As the game states, there are less death blocks which is wonderful, however there are still some parts I felt were a little unfair (like running across falling blocks with death blocks ahead of you that only become visible when you're practically an inch away). First game did this too, wasn't a huge fan. Some might say it's not unfair and you just need really good reflexes, but it still feels a little extreme. Other than that, the difficulty feels genuine. The game is pretty dang difficult, so if you're not commited, you will also have a bad time! Boss fights are also much longer and more intense (well, the one boss I fought that is). It was also pretty hilarious, like most of the game. One thing that kinda disappointed me though was the lack of references to the Nerd videos. I didn't see very many at all, unlike the first game where each level was one reference after another and any fan of the series would laugh throughout the whole stage. This game feels more like a "serious" game. Hopefully that changes throughout though.\n\nLike I've said before, you don't need to be a fan of the Nerd to enjoy this game. Whether you are or not though, give this game a shot! It's pretty dang sweet.\n\n","March 30","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way less death blocks too, if that bothered you the first time around.\n\nThe cussing rant generator when you die is sadly gone, but that makes gameplay smoother and less interrupted, since you'd probably mash through that after a while anyway.

If you enjoyed the first game you should definitely check this out. Or hell, if you enjoy side scrolling shooters like Mega Man, also check this out. You don't need to be a fan of the Nerd to enjoy this game. I'm a long time fan of the Nerd, absolutely love him and his work, but I'm gonna make this review completely unbiased (afterall I'm reviewing the game, not him, right?). I'll also update this review as I play the game more and more.\n\nThis game is pretty great. Classic side scrolling action. Very well done. This game expands on the first one by quite a bit. New upgrades and weapons change up how the game plays. In the very beginning you unlock wall jumping which you'll really have to master, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time! As the game states, there are less death blocks which is wonderful, however there are still some parts I felt were a little unfair (like running across falling blocks with death blocks ahead of you that only become visible when you're practically an inch away). First game did this too, wasn't a huge fan. Some might say it's not unfair and you just need really good reflexes, but it still feels a little extreme. Other than that, the difficulty feels genuine. The game is pretty dang difficult, so if you're not commited, you will also have a bad time! Boss fights are also much longer and more intense (well, the one boss I fought that is). It was also pretty hilarious, like most of the game. One thing that kinda disappointed me though was the lack of references to the Nerd videos. I didn't see very many at all, unlike the first game where each level was one reference after another and any fan of the series would laugh throughout the whole stage. This game feels more like a "serious" game. Hopefully that changes throughout though.\n\nLike I've said before, you don't need to be a fan of the Nerd to enjoy this game. Whether you are or not though, give this game a shot! It's pretty dang sweet.\n\n","March 30","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rossmallo/recommended/409660/","rossmallo","Rossmallo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rossmallo/","223 products in account","Okay, I am loving the hell out of this. This game is an improvement in ALMOST every way.\n\nFirst off, the fact that the game is split up into five three-level-one-boss worlds is a lot better than the nine single levels of the original. The benefits are many here - Better artistic cohesion, better music with motifs that can go from level to level, and the ability to space the gags and gimmics out better rather than trying to cram them all into a single themed level. Area 52 is a prime example of this. Different-but-similar music in each, and the levels each working with a different gimmick.\n\nAlso, while it may seem a bit strange that we're down to only the Nerd as opposed to the switchable characters of before, I ended up liking this better, because in the original, some parts of levels could be utterly broken by some characters, so the levels had to accomodate for all of them. Not so with here - With one single character and one single line of upgrades - Yes, there's megaman-style upgrades this time around - the levels can be tuned far better. And they are.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is fantastic, even compared to the original. While there is a bit less variety this time due to the aformentioned themed worlds, they instead re-tweak the music to be different in each world's levels. For instance, Browntown's music gets faster and and harsher in each level. I love it.\n\nHowever, I have three minor complaints about the game.\n\nFirst off...The difficulty. No, not because it's difficult, that's what most people buy into this for...It's the exact oppsite. Normal is as brutal as it was before, but...Easy is an utterly staggering difficulty downstep. Enemies are weaker, you have more lives, and you only take half-bottles (hearts) of damage. So not only does this give you double your normal hp, this makes it so that each bottle of health-restoring beer gives you two hearts back. I found myself able to utterly facetank most of the bosses.\nAnd honestly? Part of me kinda thinks that's okay. Yeah, sure, this game is aimed at hardcore people, but being able to include less skilled people is totally fine. And trust me, no amount of health will help you in the final level. Good god.\n\n...Though note that I said final level, not final boss. Thats my second complaint. Even accounting for me reaching that part on easy (Browntown's boss is too hard for me currently on normal), the final boss is utterly underwhelming, especially compared to the living nightmare that was Fred Fuchs in the original. The preceding level is insane though, so let that be your final challenge.\n\nAnd finally...The music. The music is mostly amazing...But one thing I kinda want... Browntown's music without the fart noises.\nYeah. They incorporate fart noises as parts of the music in two tracks. While it DOES work, I kinda wanna hear it without that. Because those two tracks are wonderful.\n\nAt any rate, TLDR: Great game, better than the original, STRONGLY reccomend you don't go down to Easy unless you utterly have to.","March 31","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While controls are very responsive and fine-tuned, I didn't like it that I had to use Y on the XB1 controller to use the secondary item. I would've preferred the B button, but this is nit-picking.\n\nIf you're a fan of 2D platforming, or just a good challenge, drop the $15 to get this game.","April 1","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If so, you'll love ASSimilation.\nTaking inspiration from several titles belonging to the old 8-bit console ASSimilation comes with several different levels that remind of the old-school titles.\nMovement is fluid and responsive, making the challenges in this game really fun to take.\nThe music perfectly complements the action and gameplay.\nThe difficulty of the game is vastly reduced compared to the first one, this due to the reduced amount of instant death-blocks all over the place. However the game still presents a fun challenge to beat and master. (Make sure to play on Old-school difficulty if you're used to old classics like Megaman on the NES)\n\nBigger and better? The sequel vastly improves over the first tittle, for the most part.\nThe level design really shines this time around having different level mechanics across the 5 different areas of the game. Water levels, gravity shifting, portals, helicopters, something like the mine carts from the Donkey Kong Country series. The levels are more fun to play this time.\nCollectibles on each level, upgrades that make the game more enjoyable and bosses that are not the same enemy with a different sprite!\nNo additional playable characters this time, though. Something that could definitely be a good addition to the game. And I'll admit the collectibles are not that hard to get, don't add that much replay value and the upgrades even when useful, could have been better implemented into the levels. (it took 5 hours to finish the game with all the N.E.R.D collectibles, upgrades and no deaths on each level)\n\nSomething for everybody The game obviously shines on its self-referencing humor, little nudges at several of the AVGN episodes and the staple humor of the Nerd.  But even if you're not a fan of the AVNG, you'll find the game enjoyable on its own right.\n\nLess death-blocks!!… Well, for the most partOne of the biggest complains about the first game was definitely its over-reliance in death-blocks to create cheap deaths and artificial difficulty, this time the game claims to include less of them, which is true for the most part. However, as you keep playing you'll notice that these blocks are still present on great part of the game and sometimes they're all over the place with just a different sprite, sometimes even recurring to old tricks, like those “appearing” blocks on the haunted level from the first game.\nThe problem with the blocks becomes more apparent once you decide to go through the problem of completing levels without dying, a “Perfect” clear as the game calls it. You'll start noticing the placement, hitbox and recurrence actually starts to hinder the challenge making it more of a chore.\n\nWhat about the port? Well, you'll be glad to know that this time you can actually change the control configuration if you're playing it with a keyboard and it's pretty responsive too! You can also use a generic USB gamepad or an Xbox controller. Sadly still no resolution or video quality options.\n\nThe good  Charming graphics and kick ♥♥♥ music.\nDefinitely superior to its predecessor\nIntense and challenging old-school goodness.\nStaple AVGN humor.\nWhat could be improved  Better implementation of the upgrades into the levels\nDeath-blocks. They're almost there, though~\nBring back additional playable characters and expand upon in.\nRecommendedWhile previously lacking an identity and just being nothing more than a weak parody, the games come back and becomes a solid platformer with lots of action and nostalgic value for those who love the challenges from the old 8-bit era. A great improvement over the first title and definitely worth getting, even if you're not an AVGN fan.","May 30","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just like playing all of the old NES games I used to love, but better because they are not the same old levels I have been playing for years. I also like that the levels are challenging like all of the old games, but not too hard. You will have to play them a few times to figure out the pattern, but when you finally get past it you get that nostalgic feeling of being excited that you finally beat the level. Modern games just don't have that anymore. This game is definitely worth the asking price!","May 31","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Less death blocks, level design feels a bit more thought out, and a considerable amount of variety to break up the platforming. If you're a fan of the Nerd, you'll definitely appreciate all the nods and homages, as well as the cameo appearances. There is a considerable amount of lag in some levels where the speed will drop to nearly unplayable, but with patience I got through them. It really needs to be looked into, especially in the Horror and Tokyo themed stages. Other than that though this is a great game and worth checking out whether you like the work of James Rolfe, platformers, or both.","June 3","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is challenging, funny and awesome!\nThere is only one thing, that annoys me to hell: The Wall-Slide/Wall-Grip Mechanic. The first thing that annoys me is, that you hold on to a wall with your feet, not with your hand, which means, if you don't hit the lowest pixel of a wall with the lowest pixel of your foot you won't hold on to it. But what really pisses me off is, that if you let go off the controller you still hold on to the wall. There are several games of this genre with this wall-slide mechanic (the most prominent is Mega Man X). In every one of this games you have to hold the control stick/d-pad against the wall to hold on to it and if you let go, you fall down straight, which is the reason I died 93485793875 times in this game. This rule does not apply in AVGN2 ASSimilation and this sucks ♥♥♥!","June 6","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
