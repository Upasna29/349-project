"http://steamcommunity.com/id/personofguy/recommended/348380/","personofguy","PersonGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/personofguy/","235 products in account","The download was like... 170MB? I bet your average porn video would take longer to download... and would be way more exciting.\n\nAnyways, I wasn't a fan of this game. Here's why:\n\nWhen you launch the game, the settings screen appears, giving you options for the game. It's basic graphic stuff and keybindings, nothing special. The graphic settings range (and I'm not making this up) from Good, to Beautiful, all the way to Fantastic! And, of course, you can change the resolution too and which display you want the game on as well as if you want the game to be windowed or not.\n\nAt the start of this game (if you can even call it that... probably finished it in less than 15 minutes) you are greeted by a somewhat nice looking starting screen. You'll probably be thinking "Golly! The other reviews might just be wrong! Looks like a thrilling indie game ahead!" If this is what you think, then you might as well not play and save whatever is left of your hopes and dreams.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to continue, you'll be greeted by a computer generated voice. But this isn't just any voice, this is that one british voice (Daniel... I think...?). And honestly, throughout the entire game I was expecting him to say "And this is the pro as heck guide to Master Yi". Unfortunately, he never does, and instead starts narrating something... as if it matters. He starts talking about how Adam (I assume this is your character) wants a job and he's going to an interview. After that little bit with him saying stuff, you finally end up in a hallway leading to an office and are given control of you player as well as a tiny black cursor.\n\nNow here's the biggest part of the gameplay right here. What? The interview? No, silly! Battling the ♥♥♥♥♥iest mouse/control scheme in the history of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse/control scheming! They decided to say "Hey! ♥♥♥♥ the sensitivity or having individual conrtols for anything! Lets just combine everything and hope it works! The main camera (this is first person, if it wasn't already apparent) and the cursor are both controlled with the mouse, and to make it even better, they're both at different sensitivities. Like... extremely different. The main sensitivity on a scale from 1 to 10 would be somewhere far beyond 10, as to where the sensitivity for the cursor wouldn't even reach 1. It's great, too, because you're gonna be needing that cursor a whole bunch for when you actually start getting interviewed. Oh wait, there's more! If you cared the least bit about anything in the game you would soon realize that there is no menu! So good luck with that!\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: As I was stating earlier, you're in a hallway and then you go into an office where you are told by our Pro as Heck guy to sit in a red chair. Then, right from the get-go they're trying to push for some mystery in the game by presenting you choices, such as "Where are you? " (As the interviewer isn't in the room) and "Why the red chair?" It's as if this game doesn't know what subtlety is, or that it doesn't care about it, which would be alright, if this game was supposed to be ironic.\n\nAfter some dumb answer to your question that makes it obvious that there's more to their answer than what they just said, you begin answering pointless questions. Over time, though, they slowly porgress from stupid questions to... slightly less stupid ones. And whenever you answer a question, usually, you'll hallucinate for a few seconds. By hallucinate, I mean you teleport to some weird lcd looking vision in a jump scare-esque fashion and return after some creepy music and sounds play. The interviewer will urge you to calm down and whatnot, further pushing the mystery that was never there.\n\nAfter a bit of questioning and struggling with the damn controls, the next phase of the interview begins. And this is where some people probably would perfer a warning or a caution... or anything, really.The next part of the interview basically just rolls a video where you can see a person get assassinated, another person getting hit by a car, and animal cruelty. It didn't really bother me as much as it would other people, but regardless, the game should probably have some type of warning about that, whether it be ingame or in the description.\n\nOnce the video stops, you are then asked even more questions, and this time, nothing even happens for the most part. You are just simply asked questions for a while. That don't mean anyhting. At all. The story doesn't change depending on what you choose. They're really only asked so that that the questions can progress into more serious and "disturbing" ones.\n\nNot wanting to spoil the "wondeful" mystery the game has to offer, I won't tell of what else happens, but I will give you an idea:\n\nAfter the questioning ends, you get to have fun with the walking feature that the game never really let you have fun with until now. That means you get access to super slow walking! And super useful jumping! I hope you can feel the sarcasm, because it's there. However, the greatest part of this game has to be the ending.\n\nAfter all of this mystery and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they tried to throw your way they really get you with the ending. I might have been able to at least be somewhat remotely okay with this game if they could have done this ending right (but, of course, that could never take away from what a travesty this game is.), but no. They really ♥♥♥♥ed it up.\n\nWhen you finally reach the end, after spending half of the playthrough walking, you are greeted with a black screen and some text.\n\nImagine you were reading a detective novel or some ♥♥♥♥, and you were so into it, and on the last chapter you finally get to find out what's really going on and you read this:\n\nJones was the culprit. He stole the stuff. The detective found out because he stole something. He became a famous criminal because he stole that important thing. He was taken to jail. The end.\n\nWell, that's not too far from the ending of this game. I mean, the fact that it's so hilariously blunt that you'll ♥♥♥♥ing laugh your face off, not that he stole something. I mean really, I think I read another review talking about this game's lack of subtlety, but damn, this took it to a whole new low.\n\nI bought this game expecting a horrible product, and what I got in return was something to occupy at least an hour or so of my time (this review :D). I got a game that wanted to be an eerie indie horror(?) game, but instead ended up being clunky waste of data. It gave me a good laugh, though, and now I can tell all my friends that I've possibly encountered the biggest pile of ♥♥♥♥ in my entire life. That, or I can tell them it's a masterpiece and get them to waste 2 bucks on it.\n\nSo the bottom line? Where do I stand? Should you buy it?\n\nHell, buy it if you want. If anything, it'll give you a laugh. Just make sure you have a PC that can run it.\n*(settings sarcasm)*\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos. Well... a lot of typos.","February 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 107 of 122 people (88%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","88","107","122","71","5"

I did not appreciate being shown this without being warned of it before purchasing and playing this game, and I would strongly urge the developer to put a warning label visibly in the description.\n\nI was hoping for something along the lines of The Stanley Parable, which I'm sure was a big inspiration for this game. What I actually got was a pretty badly designed game with extremely awkward controls (the crosshair/dot is not static in the middle and moves to the edge of the screen, which makes it near impossible to select and click on things), a computer voiced narrator, and a story pretending to be clever like Stanley, but missing the mark entirely.\n\nWould not recommend, even if it was free.","February 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 125 of 150 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","125","150","4","10"

Lets just say the longest portion of the game is a shock film that's supposed to make you feel a certain level of digust or displeasure but really is poorly laid out and in like 120p. The game itself well the 10-20 minutes of it are focused around you being interviewed by Microsoft Sam's Ghost. You answer simple questions with 1 of the 2 answers they give you inivitably leading to an end which will absolutely leave you feeling hollow inside as it provides you with noting more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot twist delivered with whatever ♥♥♥♥♥ assets the dev could snatch up for free. The game in and of itself had a semi decent concept yet managed to absolutely booger it up with the way the game plays. So the last thing I want to say is to keep your 2 bucks and spend it elsewhere and if you can still go get a refund I suggest doing so this game is dreadfully boring and certainly not worth your hard earned pocket change. 3/10 Ya ♥♥♥♥ed up interview.

This is not a game - it's more like quiz from Teen magazine but a bit more spooky and much more stupid. Somebody might tell it's "experimental game" but author just mixed unrelated things and tried to be philosopher. This over-priced production is about listening to weird, robotic voice, looking at horrible graphics and getting mad on bugged pointing dot.\n\nYou are forced to make a choice between pointless questions like "You want to be a murderer or a victim?". I think people know enough about themselves so questions like that won't change them. Author is trying to force us to thinking but young players won't be interested in this game and the older ones already have opinion and their own mind.\n\nCompleting the game took me about 10 minutes.

The next part is a short movie which I didn't really like to watch and I spend much time looking at white wall. Movie was a really low-resolution mix of sick, using sublimal stimuli videos, which shows gun shots, human hearth or empty playground.

Game was created by Anothink who created other similar pieces of gaming art excrement which can be found here... http://www.moddb.com/members/anothink/games . This is a poor man's rendition of sending out a meaningless art message in the hope that they drum up a fan base from those who contemplate life after sniffing a empty gasoline can.\n\nThe game starts off with the false premise that you (character named Adam) are in some sort of Job interview. Your presented with various questions which you must answer by simply clicking yes or no, or 1 and 2 on the number pad. Eventually as your presented with ground churning background animation of moving corridors and knives coming through the walls and some snuff video, you will either do 1 of two things. 1) Throw up and look through your barf to try and find $1.99 worth of entertainment or 2) Go outside and listen to the birds singing to try and feel good about breathing again.\n\nThis is 10 minute maximum piece of trash is definitely no David Fincher masterpiece its only redeeming feature is that I can use it to see if Steams new delete this game forever from my library actually works. If not i'll be downloading it onto a disc and have it ready waiting outside on the curb for bin day.\n\nThe game ends with a picture of a blue box. What's inside the Blue Box? Hopefully the head of Anothink and their developing career. Feel free to collect the blue box and take that out for bin day too.","December 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

This game is absolute garbage and i can't suggest anyone to waste your money on this ♥♥♥♥. Theres not much to say about this piece of ♥♥♥♥ of a game. All you do is walk around and press on stuff and thats it. Nothing ever changes. The VO is ♥♥♥♥ing awfull as its just a generic google speak system that voices the game.

Like, a lot of downs. The controls are the worst I've seen in any game ever. You know how the cursor is usually pinned to the middle of the screen in first person games? Yeah, in this one, it moves across the screen with really low sensitivity as you move the camera around. Fortunately, the things you have to click on are very close together, so you don't have to struggle through too much of this. The game has the kind of graphics you'd expect from Unity. Which is to say, my eyes hurt. Despite all of these, the twist ending really did get me. But that stupid credits music... ugh. Ruined the dark, serious mood of the whole game. In fact, it really feels sick and disrespectful to use that kind of music. The other reviews have warnings about this, and I feel I should include one too; This game does have real, actual footage of people dying. Not actors, not a game character, not a 3d model of a person. Real people dying. Anyway, after playing through it once, I was disappointed to find that you get the same results regardless of what choices you make in the game. So, overall, good story, dreadful execution. It frankly would have been better published as a short story or film. If you do buy it, get it on sale.

I would guess that I paid about 25 cents for it. The game took me 11 minutes to complete, with a walk to my kitchen to get some water adding an extra minute or so. As I filled my glass, I glanced over at the calendar and saw that today was "Pi Day". I didn't know that, and I learned something new... true, it's a fact of questionable worth, but still. So all in all, the time spent getting water was productive, hydrating and informative.\n\nI'm sad to say that my trip to the kitchen was in every way a more enjoyable, valuable, moving, fulfilling and emotional experience than "The Interview". I really tried to be forgiving when I thought about what to put in this review... you know, points for uniqueness, the strange and disturbing images, the complete weird nothingness of it all. But in the end, no. The few generated thoughts I had while playing... i.e. maybe this is a government experiment on my character, how will it unfold?... none of those musings came to fruition. The ending felt contrived, the whole thing felt like it had an hour-long development period (and I mean from concept creation to finalized content), and it was ultimately just lame. There's potential for something interesting to come out of this mess, given more thought to the content and result, but as it is it's a wasted concept.\n\nSo.... 25 cents/11 minutes. Worth it, either money-wise or time-wise? No. But if you buy this "game" anyway, I must recommend getting a refreshing beverage while "playing"... it will likely be the highlight of your short experience.","March 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Dont worry, no spoilers here. I can see why this would be marketed as an "experience". I honestly would recommend this game to someone who enjoys a more cerebral passive experience as much as an inter-active one. I would however think that to charge for this is a little absurd. To recieve the same experience as the game, watch a walkthrough (make sure it is recent because the older versions of this game like yammimash's, arent complete) or a lets play.

These are all very short games, and can be considered as low-budget walking simulators, with The Stanley Parable as a source of inspiration. These two games are free on Desura, so you can play them to have an idea what The Interview is like.\n\nThe Interview looks a lot like those two games, but there are two main differences:\n\n1) It offers fake choices that are intended to make the player actually think what he would do in real life, but they offer no changes in the game.\n\n2)  It contains live footage where you can watch murder scenes, war scenes and other horrible things, so this game is obviously not recommended to kids or sensitive people (the other games have horror elements as well, but no live footage of violence)\n\nSo, should you get it? If you are looking for a short (I took 12 minutes to finish it), thrilling and unusual ride, this game, even if it has some gameplay faults (clicking is a bit unresponsive and the mouse cursor is not on the center of the screen), is certainly worth experiencing, and the ending is really nice. Unlike some people might think, just watching this on Youtube would not be the same thing, and I also recommend using earphones to really enjoy this game.\n\nAbout the price? Well, this is up to you, but it certainly will not take long for this game to be on a sale, so get it once the price is good enough for you, considering it will be a very short but interesting ride.","February 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 46 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","16","46","2","0"

You will want to go back to the game and check if choosing any other option might affect the storyline.\n\nI´ve seen too many negative reviews about the game about it being short, but this is a psychological game, not an adventure or plataform game were you would expect at least 9 hours of gameplay. The game itself its a diamond in the rough. There are some bugs with the mouse and the selection system, and it would be great if they could randomize the game experience not only by your choices but a completely random generated amount of events that would make unique gameplays giving an infinite amount of probabilities, and mind♥♥♥♥ing us even more!\n\nBravo for the developers!
