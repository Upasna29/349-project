The highway.  Cubes on the highway.\n\nYou run slowly down the highway in two frame of animaton and avoid the cubes.  There are enemies too but unless you're aiming for a high score you can just ignore them.  The scoreboard doesn't seem to work so don't bother with scoring.\n\nIn the - short - time I played I suspect I've seen all that Dungeon Highway has to offer.  Which does include a lot of pixelated blood and a giant floaty big bad pixel thing.  You'll only see the blood when you die, and you'll generally only die because a cube you've already passed has entirely obscured the rest of the higway in front of it making it impossible to tell where the next cube is.\n\nAll in all this feel like it was written in an afternoon and would be better had it been released for free.","April 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

It's quite literally a very simple game. Cool idea but it tends to cause me to drone out and start to lose my focus on playing. The price is a little high for something with low replay value & I really hate the fixed camera angle. Got me killed several times. If it's on sale though, I say pick it up for an hour or two of an interesting concept. Think temple run but you get to fight back as you run.

It is very fun game that I think anyone could enjoy. You can earn experience to get multiple players, and improve your score to even get on the scoreboards! For me, I think about seven dollars was worth it. I play it all the time and so far, I haven't seen many negative sides to this game. This is a great game, and I would definitely recommend that you buy it.\n","April 1, 2015","true","10.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

There are many playable characters to unlock, all with funny and somewhat creative names. Each character have slightly different attacks. There are also many items you can pick up on the stage as you play it and with many different areas in the game you'll be sure to almost have a different bit of scenery every time for at least the first 50 runs. All around Dungeon Highway is non-expensive, fun game that if you don't mind the graphics and slightly wonky control, can be a very fun experience.","April 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I walked the path of a god. Countless living beings died by my hand, and countless demons were vanquished. I was the god of all things. I was running, killing more of the opposition, protecting my people as I should I had the high-score of a lifetime.... until I was gloating. I was bragging to the dead about how great and powerful I was.... Karma took action instantly. I ran into a stone slab, being sliced in half. My intenstines and other innards flew about, viscera flying in the faces of the enemy. My head toppled to the ground, and rolled in front of the king of all monsters. With a loud, and victorious laugh, he stomped upon my lifeless head, crushing it. Brain matter flew about, bits of skull making soft clicking noises as they hit the stone floor and walls. The great and powerful goddess of all things had died that day. She then proceeded to recommend the game and write a needlessly long review about how she enjoyed the game. The only thing more she'd want is more gore and blood. It wasn't enough gore. She needs more gore. Come on. Gore. MORE.","January 3","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyl0/recommended/353340/","lyl0","...LYLO...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyl0/","7 products in account","Overall Score: 4.5/5 (first impression)\nNote: There are some comments herein about game pickups and character abilities. If you would prefer for them to remain a surprise, then don't read after the 2nd paragraph.\n\n\nLike other reviewers have said, the game does little overall, but I feel it does it rather well. I don't know if the developer continues to actively work on the title or if the game is pretty much a "done deal", but I feel that its current feature set justifies its spot in my library as an addictive little time-waster with a surprising capacity for (albeit rudimentarily) strategic play.\n\nThe game features three difficulties, though I have mostly only played on the normal setting (namely: "Strong Like Ox", or something like that), which seem to vary, by all appearances, in your character's movement speed. Since I started on normal/medium, the speed for me is unbearably slow on easy, so I did not spend much time there. As you progress in the zones, which vary in theme (such snow, woodland, dungeon, &c. &c.) and are accompanied by their own set of enemies, your character gradually picks up speed and the game becomes more frenetic. Each zone has its own randomized name, which seems to mostly (if not unanimously) follow a sort of [Adjective] [Location/Noun] taxonomy, e.g.: Creepy Marsh, Charming Tower, and so on.\n\nThere are plenty of characters to unlock, and as the game description indicates, they ~do~ have unique ability sets, though oftentimes their differences are more akin to nuances, and their intrinsic subtlety might cause some folks to overlook the differences. Perhaps some differences are not really appreciable in any remarkable way. In any case, your character begins each run with a basic ability. You can pick up purple or blue potions along your run, which alter your ability or, more accurately in many cases, swap your ability out for a dissimilar one. Per character, there are only 3 powers. If you run into a red potion, you get your basic ability back. There are slow-mo and speed-boost pickups as well, along with a scroll which transforms a range of enemies into harmless coins, which may be picked up for points. You can also encounter a very useful yellow potion, which lets you get hit an additional time before dying.\n\nI would like to mention that the game invites -- or, to maximize your points, demands! -- you to change up your play strategy. Some characters have abilities which pass through walls, which is perfect for taking out enemies which are hiding right behind them; such enemies can quickly end an otherwise successful run very fast. For characters which share some cosmetically identical abilities, there are slight variances which may fit some playstyles better than others: each character has its own "cooldown", as it were, between its ability volleys, as well as different numbers of casts per volley. Ranges for powers also vary. Sometimes Durthok's bursts of energy with relatively short range and short duration work better than Odin's extremely long-range and long duration purple potion ability, and vice versa.  So far my favorite/best character is Dimli, whose wall-piercing, bomb-like move set lets me take out hidden enemies... not to mention two of his powers have nice splash damage, for destroying groups of enemies quicker.\n\nSuggestions.\n\nThe game's simplicity confers a sort of robustness which has not been fully tapped by the developer, I feel. I think there are many things they could add in order to widen their audiences:\n\n- Game modes\n- Broader spectrum of options, i.e. character lives, more pickups (and thus more abilities), &c. &c.\n- A hotbar for manually consuming pickups (allows for strategic selection of power changes and pickup usage)\n- Achievements\n- More variation in environments and environment themes; differences (beyond pure cosmetics) between enemies\n- More musical selection\n- Melee attacks\n- Stacking pickups\n- Modding and map-making capabilities\n- Better "boss" battles; as of right now, you one-hit a larger monster/enemy (which is stationary like the rest) behind which a trail of coins reside. It might be interesting to have mobile bosses (AND mobile enemies) which actively fight your character.\n- Jumping\n- The highway could also twist/turn, instead of being unidirectional","December 26, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
