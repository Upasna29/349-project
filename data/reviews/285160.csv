"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/285160/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","I'm quite a big fan of the LEGO games, mainly for these three reasons: they're highly replayable, enjoyable and casual. Hours of gameplay can easily be put into a single LEGO game for unlocking extra collectables or other LEGO characters among many other things. Just like in other LEGO games, LEGO The Hobbit is an addictive and light-hearted experience that will take hours for LEGO- and Lord of the Rings-fans alike to complete and perfect, but that's also it's main problem just like with any previous LEGO title... it's more or less the same.\n\nThe Pros:\n· LEGO The Hobbit stays true to the new popular prequel trilogy (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug and the upcoming The Hobbit: There and Back Again) in both story and lore. Just like in LEGO Lord of the Rings you'll play through the three movies (There and Back Again announced to be DLC when the final movie is released) with some added humorous elements, like silly LEGO figurines holding an umbrella above their heads in order to avoid being hit by falling bricks.\n· Didn't get a chance to watch the movies? This game will tell you the same story with entertaining LEGO moments and buildable & destructable LEGO constructions to add a ton of extra content without ever forgetting about the story that needs to be told. Don't let that keep you from buying LEGO The Hobbit if you have already watched The Hobbit movies released so far though! I have seen both movies plenty of times (six times each) and I still find this game just as enjoyable if not a bit more entertaining than watching the movies. It adds an open world LEGO experience that stays true to both LEGO-imagination and the same beautiful world we've seen in The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson.\n· There's a ton of stuff to do, like collecting items for crafting (which is an entertaining new addition to the LEGO series), sidequests, replaying missions with certain characters in order to get all the level-specific collectables (for example: Legolas can create a "staircase" of arrows and dwarves can't) or simply running around destroying constructions to collect LEGO studs that will help to fill up your Master Burglar meter. Still...\n\nThe Cons:\n· That's more or less exactly what we've been doing in the past couple of LEGO games. For those who are not as interrested in the Lord of the Rings universe as I am among many many others, the game(s) can quickly get repetetive and lose their charm. Someone who has played LEGO Marvel Superheroes for example will find lots of simularities. Don't get me wrong, the game offers a lot of content, but if you've spent countless hours collecting every single collectible in any previous LEGO title, I'll doubt you'll want to do the same with LEGO The Hobbit.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· The visuals are quite simular to LEGO Marvel Superheroes, which is a good thing. LEGO The Hobbit is a combination of LEGO-built structures and normal textures (for example, roads and mountains are not (or not always) made from LEGO bricks). The lighting is gorgeous and the animations are charmingly funny. Overal LEGO The Hobbit is another beautiful addition to the LEGO series.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Hardcore LotR-fans and casual gamers alike will definately enjoy LEGO The Hobbit. With a high replayability and even bigger satisfaction, LEGO The Hobbit is a worthy addition to both the LEGO universe and the Lord of the Rings universe. 9/10.","April 11, 2014","true","4.0"," 293 of 321 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","293","321","0","9"

This game was released without the last 1/3 of the story. THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE, AND SHOULD BE ADVERTISED AS UNFINISHED.\n\nThis isn't an "epic adventure across Middle Earth to recapture the Lonely Mountain." Lies, precious! No Mountains were captured in the making (or playing) of this game.\n\nLEGOs n' Tolkien? This is biblical status nerdism! By far one of the most progressive LEGO games to date, LEGO Hobbit is super pretty and cleverly put together. Even with the chaos of dozens of characters, the game is patient & advises you gently, like a priest might. Unfortunately, this LEGO game is like one of those priests I warn parents about because he turns out to be untrustworthy and may make your children cry.\n\nShameful part is, I was happily playing when it ended suddenly. No matter how good your game is, and this WAS A GOOD GAME, you're a buncha dirty cheats if you are using it to distract me so you can jot down my credit card information for later. I'm a diehard Tolkien fan from the time my Dad read me the Hobbit & LOTR as a beautiful series of bedtime stories. Those are some of my fondest childhood memories aside from the beatings, and it's a shame that I can't honestly recommend this lovely game interpretion as it is missing a huge part: the end.\n\nPros:\n\n* Invisible walls seem to be popping up way less, they must've cut the guy whose job that was. Good thing he got that job working on Shadows of Mordor.\n* Purdy scenery & funny NPC dialogue, voice actors & game designers were obviously having fun.\n* New minigames that are forgiving and interesting to watch. I thought the building quests were a great idea.\n* LEGO LOTR never saved a single checkpoint for me, this game worked perfectly in that regard. Thank you, from the people who are overachievers and gotta catch 'em all.\n* Helpful gameplay, lots of advice that you can choose to read or ignore.\n* Improved camera, which still isn't saying much. Better than a sharp stick in the eye?\n* IT IS TOLKIEN Y'ALL\n\nCons:\n\n* No sheep racing. Baaaaaaaaaa-d.\n* Until you beat the whole game, you can't have freeplay in the main world. No changing characters or roaming free for a minute, LEGO Hobbit is here to make you eat your meat before you get to enjoy your pudding.\n* Repetitive gameplay, but to be fair that is what you're signing up for.\n* No cheat codes except for characters. Sad for kids who keep falling or find parts of it too hard. I don't have kids but I can imagine their teary little faces. Heh heh. I mean. Aw.\n* Silence from TT about DLC and updates.\n* May seem picky, but not being able to zoom in and out of the unlabeled map was very frustrating. There are a few parts in the game where they make it impossible for you to go back the way you came, which is a tried & true idea but if you're going for that your map had better be easy to navigate and specific. This was neither. It kind of ruins the epic feel when you can't see a clear image of the entire world.","February 1, 2015","false","68.2"," 192 of 231 people (83%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","83","192","231","35","2"

They added an attempt at a crafting system (extremely rudementary and not very well executed), and they finally allowed us to see what the characters can do as we select them from the big list.  But that's mostly because a majority of the characters are virtually the same.  Which is more the problem with the story than the game.  It has the same type of overworld as Lego LOTR, with questing and such.  Elements of the overworld unlock as you play through the story.\n\nAll in all, on a technical level, the game's a fairly fun Lego game.\n\nBut the failures come in the adaptation.  First off, they chose to model the game after the movies.  Because of course they did, if they followed the book instead people would be confused and scared and not want to give them money again.  So we have crap like the stupid barrel scene, and the really, REALLY badly done Lake-Town bit (and a level in this game that just never seems to end - much like the movie).  And if they had based it on the book, they could have actually FINISHED THE BLOODY STORY!\n\nNo, instead, we get 2/3 of the game.  And that's all there will ever be.  There is no DLC for the third movie (which would be a terrible precedent anyway).  There is no second game (which would be about as sorry as Lego Indiana Jones 2).  What we are left with is an eternally incomplete product because they felt the need to rush this game out the door.\n\nDo not buy it.  There are plenty of other Lego games to play instead.

First, it isn't as epic as Lego LOTR. Second, it's still epic. Third, if you're a fan, buy it. Fourth, Lego has awesome humor. I just beat the story about a half hour ago. The story alone was worth the purchase. I love the unlockable characters and freeplay mode. One annoying feature: the new "crafting" system.

I haven't had a lot of crashes, however, I found most of them were caused by using GeDoSaTo to upscale/downscale.

The open world really makes you feel like you're going on an adventure with Bilbo and the dwarfs in an almost Skyrim esc. manner. The game is very easy and simple to get through but if you want to 100% the game it is surprisingly difficult. Challenges range all the way from escort missions you can't fail to a race around Rivendell that is quite infuriating for all the right reasons. The challenges are quite satisfying to complete and it feels good watching the map get less and less cluttered with quests over time, you really feel like you're making progress. The controls are awful to start but can be changed very quickly to something that makes more sense for your keyboard.

It is a tie-in for The Hobbit movie but it only covers movie 1 and movie 2 but not movie 3 which provides the conclusion for the main draw of the movie which is the dragon Smaug. Overall if you like Lego games I recommend skipping this one because while the game is fun it is rather repetitive and has the samey feeling from start to finish.\n\nNow lets get on to the review. No screenshots due to terrible network.\n\nLego™ The Hobbit	Official Website: http://thehobbit.lego.com/en-us/\nDeveloper: Traveller's Tale[PC], Feral Interactice[MAC]\nDate of Release: 10 April 2014\nGenre: Kids game, Lego, Adventure, Simple Puzzle	What is Lego™ The Hobbit? 	Lego™ The Hobbit follows Lego never ending formula of licensing popular movie, comic, franchise license and remaking the whole thing in the style of Lego bricks and character. This is their whole formula.\n\nLego™ The Hobbit is a movie tie in with The Hobbit movie although I must stress here that it is incomplete and will never be completed with the game only covering part 1 and 2 of the movie without the ending of 3. The game has you moving all over middle earth just like in the movie while interacting with Lego pieces and uncovering the storymode with the usual but less dose of Lego humour. Meanwhile read on. 	Option Menu	Good\n\nGraphical Setting ☑\nResolution ☑\nControls [Rebindeable☑ Deadzone Adjustment for Controller☑] ☑\nAudio, Music And Subtitle ☑\n\nYou will not be in want for sure in Lego™ The Hobbit setting menu since it has all your basic needs covered although do read on the control section for possible issue for KB+M user.	Graphics	Maintaining a steady 60 fps at top setting Lego™ The Hobbit texture looks beautiful enough at High although it does have a bit too much of a sheen and brown for my taste personally.\n\nAny useable object will usually be placed as a Lego piece instead to mark it out. So for my verdict. In a game released in the year 2014 Lego™ The Hobbit is very beautiful albeit a bit brown. 	Music Audio	Average\n\nThey used movie voiceover for this version of Lego and it is good enough even if it lacks the mute charm of earlier Lego games.\n\nFor music and sound effect they mostly reuse it from the whole series with recognizable songs peppered throughout the game.	Controls	Average\n\nKB+M\nForgot about it. The game uses KL;O for camera movement, JHYUI for action stuff and WASD for movement. While the controls can be change in the settings it is still rather awkward using the KB+M for this game especially since the mouse does not serve a function.\n\nController\nMeanwhile on the other hand the series had always emphasize more on using controllers and it shows. The game is more enjoyable when you plug in any compatible controller since the controls and prompt are within fingers reach without having to do the finger yoga maneuver.  	Gameplay	The game has you controlling several of The Hobbit cast as you go through the game in story mode.\n\nEach level has you controlling a specific number of character each with a unique skill needed for the task ahead although once you completed the level you can just switch to any other character you unlocked at any time by using the freeplay mode which is helpful since some of the minikit for collection cannot be obtained via a single playthrough.\n\nAn example of the mechanic  would be switching to the guy with the axe to destroy weak block. Guy with chain to grapple and Elf to jump higher.\n\nAs stated earlier finishing the level once allows you to freeplay it again with any unlocked character.\n\nThe game is a semi open world based where you are funneled into the next area linearly but you could always backtrack and head out to other area for sidequest to complete. Sidequest also unlocks once you clear a level but they are usually quite simplistic utilizing the game forging and find an item process.\n\nOne of the puzzle requires you to quickly find a compatible pieces in a wheel formation for big reward although it does get repetitive fast which is true for most of the sidequest.\n\nAnnoyingly enough the fast travel option only unlocks halfway through the game which makes you not want to do the sidequest. Thankfully the material needed to advance the story are provided as oppose to needing to grind for it.	Conclusion	As a Lego game it is enjoyable but as part of the Lego series in the grand scheme it fell short quite a lot. Reused assets, repetitive gameplay with no breakup in mechanic and too much filler place this quite low on the list of Lego game which I recommend but ultimately the lack of any DLC for episode 3 of the movie prevents me from recommending this game heartedly.\n\nGet it if you like LEGO games but otherwised get the more well established franchise over this one.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-S-Rank: excellent\n-A-Rank: very good\n-B-Rank: solid\n-C-Rank: satisfactory\n-D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: C [An average Lego Experience]\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!	Extra Note	This game only covers Episode 1 and 2 of the trilogy. Episode 3 DLC will NOT be release as confirmed by Warner Bros studios. And no, I have not tried any of the DLC.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/285160/\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","July 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","32","52","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/285160/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Lego The Hobbit was released in April 2014 based on the first two Hobbit films, An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug. This is only my second run through a LEGO game; my first being The Lego Movie so I am still quite an armature when it comes to the LEGO series.\n\nThe game play is lot of features from the previous game including a feature which you build a big Lego object out of bits of broken down objects that you have smashed up in the world. Each of the characters which you play have their own unique ability or weapon that gives them there on use and key element to you finishing each level or finding all of the hidden items in the game.  The game is split into sixteen chapters, each of which are connected by a huge map which you are able to explore in a free roam sort of mode. Between each main chapter's story, you are able to carry out side quests for other Lego characters throughout the world.\n\nStory wise, it basically follows the story lines from the books/films. There are some small modification to fit events into a suitable number of chapters, as well as adding the increasingly well known Lego humor that we all love.  Sadly according to a number of sources across the net, there were plans to bring out some DLC for the final chapter in the story, but the idea appears to have been scraped so we won't get to see the final book/film in this series.\n\nAll of the audio in Lego The Hobbit is taken directly out of the film it self. Christopher Lee has the role of the narrator throughout the whole game as well.\n\nThis game does not carry any difficulty what-so-ever. You have unlimited lives so dying is not an issue. The main aim, apart from finishing the story of course, is to collect Lego bricks on each level in order to be the "Master Builder" along with lots of other little collectibles such as special building kits, which can all be used to unlock hidden characters in the game.\n\nA playthrough the story mode of this game as well as a good portion of side quests took me twelve hours to complete. Once you finish the game you have the option to go back and finish the remaining quests, as well as free roam around all the levels replaying them to find the remaining hidden items and collectibles. This will probably add on another four or five hours worth of game play if you are the completionist sort.\n\nAll in all, Lego: The Hobbit is a brilliant game and is certainly worth the low regular price on Steam of £14,99 - saying that the Lego Games do go on sale quite regularly too, so if you get it for less than that, this is an absolute bargain. I would really recommend anyone who is a fan of the Lego series or The Hobbit to pick this up as I failed to find any real issues with this game.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's pretty much easy entertainment with a few challenges, but nothing you'd really get stuck on.\nI'm not sure if I would enjoy this game all that much just playing it by myself, but it works excellent as a local co-op game and me and my girlfriend had a lot of fun fighting our way through hordes of orcs and other evil doers.\nThe fact that the content of the third movie apparently won't even be released as a DLC really really sucks, but I will still give the game a thumbs up, because the game in itself was a lot of fun.","May 31","true","11.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Though they initially promised to have the last third as a special DLC content - Battle of the Five Armies - they ultimately chose to not include it.\n\nIf you are able to look past this issue - albiet a rather annoying one - then this game is a good fun romp.\n\nThere is nothing too strenuous.  Nothing to rage-inducing.  It is a LEGO Game, plain and simple.  You play levels, you collect stuff, find hidden stuff, break stuff, make stuff, make MORE stuff, and then break it again.  You talk to newly-voiced NPC's and complete quests, forge items, and have a new collection system beyond just the studs you use to buy characters.\n\nThe added bonus of having Christopher Lee voicing in-between cut-scenes as well is a lovely addition, as well as him voicing something known as the Yodeling Sheild...\n\nA good fun game.","March 10","true","28.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Theres not much "talking" in it but its definetly good to play with friends. Style from it is like in any another LEGO game. We have "Pies In Peril" not "Stan Lee In Peril" like in marvel superheroes, and we have another charatchers. The animation is the same, aswell as graphics!\nStory is pretty interesting, the game can be really hard to understand if you're playing LEGO games for first time, I better recommend "LEGO Marvel Superheroes". Of course this game even has freeplay after you do the starting missions. It even has mini quests and the map believe me or not is pretty big. You even can go out of "The Hobbit" town to the wildernes. I enjoy playing this game with friends because you can do CO-OP. Sadly theres no multiplayer for LEGO games, and that annoys me. Still haven't figured out how to switch charatchers in freeplay mode. Btw Im playing with a controller. What I love about this, that its actualy pretty real to "The Hobbit Movie" and it kind of matches.  They even have the "cutscenes" or "movie clips" where they show a small clip.\nAnd I really like that they have added something cool - Minigames. Not talking about the quests or mini quests, but actual minigame like you need to press some buttons to catch the bowl. Lol it sounds pretty weird right now but I loved it!\n\n10/10\nWould pay 15$ for a LEGO game with multiplayer on PC.\n-Anna","April 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","12","20","3","2"

Beside story missions you have access to a large enough open world which you can enjoy and explore (fast travelling is added as an option after a certain story mission). There are collectibles to find, many characters to unlock and studs to collect so you can buy those characters and use them.\n\n# Candy\nLEGO - The Hobbit will provide hours of gameplay, either if you play alone or wth a friend (local co-op!). Its open world is amazing and you can spend a lot of time just wandering around and exploring the world of Middle-earth. Story missions which are well done are following the scenes from the movies and are filled with nice humour and charm. Using a controller is highly recommended (in all LEGO games) but you won't have problems if you are using a keyboard.\n\n# Chilli\nIf you expect the whole trilogy - story missions only cover the first two movies. Disappointing as this may be you also need to know that beside the fact of you knowing that the story missions from the third movie aren't included, this game never feels incomplete nor it affects the open world in any way.  Another thing to consider for those who only played older LEGO games - characters aren't mute and with that said humour is a bit different so to those who loved that in older LEGO games this might be an issue. Last but not least (and something which doesn't have anything to do with this review or the game itself) - you can find in the store three dlc packs. They add nothing to the story and are only character and item packs. You won't miss anything by not having them but if you are still interested I would advise getting on a sale.\n\n# 8.5 LEGO adventures out of 10\nIf the fact that this game doesn't include the third movie is a deal-breaker to you  - skip it. Otherwise, it is a great LEGO game and one of the best in my opinion.\nGreat for kids!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521601781","September 20, 2015","true","51.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/285160/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","LEGO The Hobbit is, first and foremost, a LEGO game. There isn't a great deal different from other LEGO titles, in both bad and good ways. If you've tried LEGO games before and found them dull, I don't think this one will change your mind, but if you have an obsession for collection, this game will probably serve you well.\n\nFirst of all, some gripes. I really don't like how the game forces you to come back later and re-do things when you already have the means to complete them at your disposal, simply locked away. It takes advantage of a child's endless appetite for repetition (Pokemon, anyone?), but as an adult it gets frustrating at times. And speaking of frustrating, the game has some bugs too. I've had characters get stuck, once even in a game-breaking way in the middle of a story mission that locked out all buttons but Start and forced me to quit. The physics on hills and edges get weird sometimes and prevent you from jumping, which can sometimes lead to the stuck thing or lead to death in the middle of a jumping puzzle. I would also get random crashes for a while, which was fixed by turning off Raptr's integration completely, even the Track Gameplay part (the only part I actually use). And the end of the game cuts off at a really bad time, though that's not entirely their fault, since from what I understand the movie does too. Perhaps they should have waited for the third movie to come out to release this. Hopefully they put out some DLC to add in the final climax. It's literally only missing the last chapter or two from the book.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, the game is still fun. It's still cathartic to beat up LEGO objects and watch them explode into fountains of loot and studs. The gradual ramp of power and wealth starts to get quite high near the end, and I feel a bit Smaug looking over my vast collection of items and riches. Okay, I admit that pun was terrible. Moving on. None of the missions, quests, or puzzles are particularly difficult or complex, but are still fun nonetheless. Suitably accessible for a child but still enjoyable for an adult, a good balance. I'm about 28 hours in and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The bits of humor injected into the game here and there are a nice touch as well. My favorite gag is Azog's missing hand actually following him around and constantly taunting him. Great way to add flavor to the original movie script. And the voice acting clips taken from the movie are a nice touch to telling the story as well, as opposed to the silent approach of early LEGO games.\n\nBy no means is LEGO The Hobbit without flaws, but if you're a fan of Traveller's Tales style of collect-a-thon games, this will be a shining Arkenstone in your collection. I picked it up for $5 on sale and more than got my money's worth out of it. Again, if you're tired of the LEGO formula or just really hate Tolkien it's probably a safe pass, but for everyone else, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.\n\nUpdate:The Battle of the Five Armies DLC is confirmed to not be coming[www.gamespot.com]. Consider that sudden ending now a permenant black mark against the game. Still recommended overall, but something to consider.","November 15, 2014","true","29.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

Its a decent amount of content being around 30hrs to 100% however the only downside is the various bugs that are still present in the game. Some game breaking bugs that will force you to restart the game or redo some quests in the overworld.

It has a WAY bigger hub than LEGO LotR and rideable, customizable mounts in the hub. 98 playable characters including cave trolls. I hope there will be some DLC for a few others though, maybe some characters from LotR; Aragorn, Arwen, Celeborn, Gimli... The character customizer is pretty good, you still can't choose their animation though, it would be easy to implement, it seems, (Menu Item: Animation...) and you could choose ANY characters animation, would be very nice for creating females... Anyway, maybe some LEGO game someday will do that, though I wish it was this one, I love The Hobbit and LotR. This is a great game though, as I said, it has a big hub and horses, ponies, and wargs to ride around. And some epic mithril items to forge... Mithril Rhythm Stick, Mithril Dance Boots, and a Red Brick called Middle-earth Carnival... Get the game if you like LEGO games! It's one of the best! I'd say better than LEGO Marvel! Though LMSH is only slightly below it as far as fun to play, I like The Hobbit better than Super Heroes so it ranks high on my list. ;)\n\nI say 9/10. It would be 10/10 if you could choose the acting (animation) of the characters in the character customizer. cx And it would be nice if there was a place where you could watch the cutscenes without replaying the levels...\n\nEdit #2: The DLC packs have been fixed. :)","April 14, 2014","true","272.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is a silly retelling of the story of The Hobbit, with loads of things to do and collect. The significant addition to this game is that you now also collect loot which can be used to build things for certain missions. I rather liked these new building segments where you have to select correct parts to complete a mini kit against the clock, however my partner did not like them.\n\nI am going to digress slightly here but I loved the book as a child and always felt it would make an excellent film. Peter Jackson however decided that he didn't want to make that film, he chose to pad it out with tedium to make three protracted tiresome films. Because this game is based on the films we have to play through the rubbish parts of the films and we don't even get the whole story as at the time of writing the final film has not been released. The conversion to LEGO is enough to redeem them but it does remind me what a missed opportunity the films were.","September 20, 2014","true","34.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But-it is incredibly buggy, which is incredibly frustrating. The game has crashed on me a number of times, and I am now at a part in the story that I honestly don't know how I will get past due to the collosal bug. I need both characters (elves in this case) to pull down an item, so they both need to get to a certain point. Unfortunately, one of them even when I take control automatically goes to the left no matter what I do. She jumps right back onto a swinging bar, and if I try to go further left and then back to the right-she jumps off the edge...over and over and over. Basically, if you buy this game it is the luck of the draw. Either you will be able to do a full playthrough, or a bug will break the game for you. Also, apparently the game doesn't actually finish the story-a friend of mine mentioned this as he was able to finish the game, and that is also not very cool. There are much better lego game options out there, so if you are considering buying a lego game, I would suggest skipping this one.","February 8","false","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idoliside/recommended/285160/","idoliside","Sharkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idoliside/","462 products in account","Basically I can only describe this game as "not as good as Lego Lord Of The Rings". By all means if you a fan of The Hobbit and Lego games in general pick it up. If you have played LotR then a lot of the function and design will be very familiar although sadly with the inclusion of a few more annoying elements.\nI think part of the problem stems from the film. Lego LotR had three films and an epic world to pull information from, and therefore felt rich and entertaining. But The Hobbit feels limited due to the film stretching the source material out too far, the journey from Hobbiton to Erebor doesn't feel half as epic as the one to Mount Doom. You just don't want to explore the world. As sandbox games go this is a limiting factor.\nThe main annoying trait is the "crafting" system. Which now requires you to have to correct elements of lego pieces collected throughout the levels to unlock various upgrades needed to gain other perks. Sadly I found this very tedious and added another layer of banality around it.\nWhat the Lego Hobbit should have been was a single DLC expansion to the Lego LotR and contained within the same world. Sadly we got a large dull world, a dull cast and a thin, stretched out world. Even Lego Marvel which I loved, has a boring open world, but at least has interesting characters that you "want" to unlock. Who really wants "Lake Town" Oin?\n\nPros:\n- Great Lego Story\n- Good recreation of Middle Earth\n\nCons:\n- Tired gameplay\n- Uninteresting World\n- Tedious Crafting\n- Not as good as Lego Lord Of The Rings.","September 29, 2014","false","9.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Seriously. This one came out in 2014. And it's based of only the first two movies of Hobbit series.\nYes, only from the first two movies. Warner Bros promised to whip Travellers Tales into making DLC based on the third movie, but then after a while they went all "eh eh eh not planning to make any videogames based on the third movie".\nYea, store page of a game masterfully avoids any mention that it's not complete.\nIt also came out on consoles that are Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, WiiU. And also had handheld version for 3DS and Vita which is your usual "same idea, different lesser execution" thing. Don't worry, from what I looked the PC version is among top.\n\nTechnically, it's about on same level as recent Lego offerings. Or maybe even worse. You know, bugs, crashes and getting stuck in geometry. I do remember crashing at the end of level 5 personally. And many people complain about some bugs in overworld.\n\nAnyway, it's yet another Lego game. Casual, beat stuff, collect stuff. Watch funny cutscenes with voice overs. Do quests in open roam part. No revolution. Just same evolution of a snail.\n\nLike, this time around a lot of destructable objects now drop additional loot: various materials. And there are some objects into which you must dispense a certain amount of materials that you gathered. Then once done, minigame will happen where the Lego object is being automatically built, then it stops at some point and shows which detail it's going to build next and you have to select it from 8-directional choice. Or else time will run out, which only means that you get less studs. Yea, it still wouldn't make you think.\nOh, and everybody can charge attack. Eh.\n\nLook, this franchise is so painfully stale. I remember Travellers Tales for creating charming games like Galladan, Toy Story for 16-bit and Sonic R. Sad to see that they pretty much turned into yearly licensed Lego games factory. That now makes quite buggy games. And this one isn't even full experience. Not to say that it has much less than others though.\nAnd there was so many games in Lego games that at this point you better approach it different from other sane game franchise: Instead of following Lego franchise, just pick the single game that fits your interest. And then don't care about others.\n\nReally, I know that there are other franchises that don't change things up at all. But the thing is that Lego franchise is designed to not require much thinking. So kids will be able to beat it. Though at times it might be offending even for kids. And thus "almost reskin, more levels" doesn't work here, like, say, with 8-bit Megaman. Just changing little doesn't work. It really gets repetetive for real. No challenge, no new think for each level.\n\nSo eh. It still doesn't stop me from having to recommend it up, rather than down, as it's still a good game with some love and charm still being shown, Travellers Tales style.\nEnjoy your expected cliffhanger!","February 23","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is also a little buggy.

It's well written (outside of the scope of the original story)  and has good voice acting (beyond the movie sound samples...

Many people say that this is a really bad game and that it is not going strictly towards the story line in many parts like bilbo having to construct the answers instead of saying them in the riddle game with gollum and that ori kills the great goblin instead of gandalf! But this way it makes the game in a lego type of way and is also making it as less violent as possible. There are many very, very funny items like a chicken head item which clucks when you move around, mithril dancing boots which makes us dance, a make-up staff which gives anyone we hit a funky wig and some make up. There are also these red bricks which give really cool stuff like 'poo studs' which allows the ability to a mode of ground transport (horses, ponies, wargs) to poop out studs and, my favourite, the 'middle earth carnival' makes the whole of middle earth a very big disco ball area where everyone even animals dance with some cool music with dialogues from the hobbit movies.\n\nThe gameplay is quite good with a lot of new things which makes things interesting. There are also secret areas in some missions which can only be found in freeplay.Cons in the missions are that after you get all minikits and get lots of studs, they are practically useless unlike in lego batman 2 where they lead to a vehicle and in lego marvel where they lead to comic you can read.\n\nFreeroam gameplay is amazing with hundreds of side missions and mithril bricks all around. There are a lot of secret areas and even areas which aren't there in the story to make things interesting. There are also races which are really challenging for inxperienced gamers. Cons are that there is no flying creatures that we control like in lego marvel which i really missed. There are eagles (and flying pigs if you get pig suit item)  which we can use to get to distinct areas with but it really isn't the same.\n\nThere is also this new feature of loot where get 'loot' by breaking stuff, killing enemies and mining (eg. wood and stone from breaking things and meat if u kill enemies). The mining game is a sort of minigame where you can get mineral loot (eg. diamond, gold, emerald). There is also food loot like carrots, bread, fish and meat.\n\nEverything taken into account, I would give this game a 9 out of 10 as it was a great game to play and was pretty interesting.\nIt is very good game for lego fans, tolkein fans and inexperienced gamers alike!!!","May 18, 2014","true","58.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The  amount of weapons available in Free Play is amazing, being able to do something without needing a certain character is a great addition since it was annoying having to wait to finish the game to then complete levels/quests like in the old LEGO game, especially if you're wanting a certain red brick. The new 'Loot' feature is nice too but it can turn the game into a griding game if you don't pick up the loot occasionally.","December 12, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is one of the few actually good tie-ins these days, and Lego seems to be getting really good at that! They added in and changed gameplay systems subtley, they inproved their andmation, graphics and gameplay, plus the fact that this recent from the release date it's at $30 and not $40. All this, plus the fact that it actually does a good job of following the movies (and maybe books, but I wouldn't know, I never read them) with a bit of humour here and there that makes you say "Yup, that's Lego XD", this game is definitely worth your money (it would be, even if it was more expensive) at you should definitely buy it, especially if you're a Lego game fan (like me) or a Hobbit fan (like me).\nEasily 9/10","April 14, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That might explain me being very critical. But I'm not working in the games industry, I'm doing business software. I'm not a native English speaker, either...)\n\n+ The game is (almost always) fun to play! Expect the riddles and "missions" to be at most on par for a 10- to 12-year old, though.\n+ The game works fine for me and my 8-years old daughter playing together (playing on her own she'd most likely be overwhelmed, though). I suspect kids between 10 and 12 years will do between well and very well on their own.\n\n- The testers were either incompetent or were ignored (judging from my own experience my bet's on ignore).\n- The map is sh**. Yes! Sh**! It's almost completely useless; until you hit the bug where you can't use the map at all... because then you have to restart!\n- The path hints are ... uhm ... "not all that good", either.\n- The extras (red bricks benefits) settings are not saved between sessions; that's really annoying!\n- The controller settings are not saved between sessions, either; that's annoying!\n- The "Show hints?" setting regularly shows as "no" even though the (annoying) hints do appear in-game.\n- The game randomly crashes or becomes unusable (e.g. map no longer working for one of the characters, character stuck in an animation loop while transitioning between tiles, player unable to switch character or current character's weapons etc.); this makes other problems -like settings not getting saved- even more aggravating. It's much more pronounced in this game than in Lego Marvel Super Heroes, by the way.\n- There seems to be virtually no PC adaptation at all (e.g. you cannot use the keyboard to name your custom characters, you really have to use the absolutely ridiculous console way). Playing with the keyboard is seriously not recommended, probably altogether impossible in a local co-op setup. Tooltips? Unheard of...\n- Split screen mode settings ("vertical" vs. "dynamic") seem completely untested! If you need to hit something to the far right or left of the walkable content you should not ever use "vertical". Most annoying example I have encountered is in the last regular level. Try hitting the left-most wall hanging with a "vertical" setting...\n- The camera handling sucks. Bleh...\n- Why does a player who started his quick-journey (aka "eagle transfer") later than his buddy arrive significantly earlier than his buddy? Yes, this is a very minor complaint compared to the others but ... well ...\n- Adding an item to a character won't be remembered even in the current level or context. Add "Mithril horseshoes" to Gandalf, switch to Dori and then switch back to Gandalf... Equipping an item/weapon on a character, then behaving in a "sort of default way" will switch to the character's default equipment/weapon, not the last manually equipped item. This is very much at odds with players' expectations. If I -the player- equip a bow, I want the character to use the f****** bow, not switch back to his daggers!\n- After completing a smithing session the "forged items overview" appears (why?) and blocks both players' screens for way too long.\n- After completing a quest the path hints might still show you the way to the obsolete/no longer existing target (I haven't found a repeatable pattern for this, yet). This hint cannot be removed, either. You have to assign a new hint and remove that one.","January 5, 2015","true","61.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","10","20","3","0"

The game covers the entirity of "An Unexpected Journey" and "The Desolation of Smaug" but does not include "The Battle of the Five Armies". There appears to be no plan for the final installment to be produced.\n\nThat being said. The game is fantastic. I bought this game on sale (having played 4 other lego games) to play with my girlfriend. We both enjoy the story aspects and massive collection aspects of the Traveller's Tales lego games, and this one does not fall short. It took roughly 12 hours to complete the story and 38 hours to 100% the game.\n\nIf you have played a Lego game before, expect more of the same. A Collectiontionist/Completionsists wetdream, full of quirky humor fit for any age. It does appear that Traveller's Tales have found a formula that works and continue to capitalise on that making new adjustments with each game to further improve upon it.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up.\n10/10","February 17, 2015","true","49.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But LEGO The Hobbit over-exceeded my expectations. Words cant even describe the amount of work and gameplay features polished from earlier LEGO games. But The Hobbit has a few more tricks up its sleeve to let it differ from the rest of TellTales's library. The LEGO Loot system, sidequests-filled hub world with bright and colorful graphics might i add. And of course, the comedy and silliness mixed in with the tone of the Hobbit movies is amazing and hilarious. Its really hard to dislike this game, and i 100% reccomend this game. If i had one con about it, is that of the Gandalf levels.(Looking For Proof & The Necromancer) These levels are a huge hole in the game and disturb the natural greatness of LEGO The Hobbit. The way Gandalf handles in comabt and overall performance is kind of frustrating mostly. LEGO The Hobbit is a fantastic game with exemplary design, replay value, and fun sidequests. Its just the Gandalf levels, but thats still not too big of a deal. What are you waiting for? Its a LEGO game for Thrain's sake!

Bedanya ada di Storyline dan Fitur.\nAda fitur baru di game lego ini, yaitu, Crafting.\n\nMungkin pertamanya bikin puyeng. Tapi, tenang, kita ngga harus ngehafal crafting recipes. Karena lu tinggal mencari bahan bahan untuk membuat suatu barang tertentu yang dibutuhkan. Setelah ngumpulin, tinggal ke anvil terdekat, bikin deh. Ada juga sistem trading ke merchant/npc.\n\nGw baru main beberapa chapter sama temen gw. Game ini ga cocok buat dimainin pake keyboard (iyalah)\nJadi, enaknya pake controller/stik/joystick.\nSejauh ini, gw enjoy gamenya. Meskipun ada sedikit bagian yang bikin frustrasi.\n\nKalau game ini diskon (biasanya 75%), para penggemar lego adventure, atau penggemar Lord of The Rings/The Hobbit, wajib beli :D\n\nRating : 10/10","January 10, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","5"

They released this game before The Battle of Five Armies, and that will be a seperate game all together, or knowing the gaming market now, it will be a DLC add on or part of a bundle pack. Very little support for the PC gamer, and they make it hard for you to enjoy your game at it's highest settings. It's locked in at 720p 30fps so consoles can look better.

I've completed all of them 100% since the beginning (excluding City Undercover for the Wii U) 'm working my way through this one and MARVEL atm and I can safely say that this one is one of my favourites alongside LotR. The gameplay is the same, which may annoy some people as it doesnt bring much new apart from a couple of new minigames, but TT games have taken the 'don't fix what aint broken' approach, which is a good step in my opinion. The dialogue is taken straight from the films, which is amazing! after watching the films and playing this straight afterwards you can pick out lines and pin point them in the films. Graphics are pretty decent for a LEGO game, probably some of the best I've seen in the franchise, although LEGO Movie looks good from the trailers (another one I havent played yet but intend to). The game is very loyal to the films but also includes area of the map and characcters that are only featured in the books, which is a great touch. My only critisims are that they have changed the map quite a bit scince LotR, I can see why, but as a long term player, it can get quite confusing when trying to navigate as im so used to that previous map, although im sure I will get used to it. My last bug bear with this game is that there is no Online Co-op. There is same system co-op, but I think that TT games should try to incorporate this into their future LEGO games as this would just make this game the best game on the planet (although its pretty damn close as it is). Overall, if you love LEGO and the LotR or Hobbit world, then this is a no brainer. Tbh, even if you dont particularly like LotR, you should still buy this just for the laughs and thrills you will get along the way :)","April 28, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The hobbit laughs and walks under it.\nLego the Hobbit (LtH for short) is another prime example of Lego's continuing creativity. This game has variety, action, adventure, questing, humor--all the things I've come to expect in their recent games. LtH is a decent retelling of the movie, which is a not-so-decent retelling of the original fictional novel by J.R.R Tolkien. Though this game was a pleasurable experience for me, I have to admit that it has some large flaws.\nFirst, the fact that this game only encompasses the first two out of three movies made by New Line Cinema. The Battle of FIve Armies was originally intended to be released as a DLC for this game, but Warner Bros. canceled this development. So now, we have a game that leaves off with a cliff-hanger, and no way to resolve that cliff-hanger besides watching the movies.\nSecond, the character customization. Every modern Lego game has one--a place where you can create your own Lego figure, and play with them in the game. In the past, this was an amazing feature in Lego games. However, in LtH, the character customization is somewhat lacking. This game does not let you equip a weapon or cloak to your custom character (no capes I guess?). This was extremely disappointing to me, as outfitting my character with cool cloaks and weapons had been my favorite part of Lego games in the past. While the customizer in itself has no lack of Lego parts to use on your figure, weapons and cloaks are not allowed >:(\nThird, the difficulty of finding secrets. In the open world, secrets and mysteries abound. In previous Lego games, the variety of secrets was perhaps not as big (except in Lego LOTR), and they could all be obtained with relative ease. In LtH, secrets stay secret if you aren't extremely persistant. Just finding the blacksmith so I could craft mithril items took me the better part of two days. The instructions are rather vague, and certain puzzles and quests are extremely difficult to complete. This will be sure to annoy younger kids after a while.\nAside from these three flaws though, LtH is an extraordinary game for younger kids into the lore of Middle Earth. The story is pretty decent, and the combat is satisfying without being bloody or gory. This is perhaps Lego's strongest point--the ability to create massive-scale battles that young children will be able to partake in without worrying about gory imagery or blood. Overall, this is a good adventure game, but I would recommend waiting until a sale to grab it. The DLCs are ok, but I'd wait until a sale for those ones too.\n8/10 a decent game.","November 9, 2015","true","38.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(TL;DR down the bottom)\n\n(You'll notice that I haven't completed the game on my account. I have, however, on the PS version at a friend's house.)\n\nTT's engine isn't great. It's not bug-free: I've had to restart the level due to glitches such as characters not being usable when they shouldn't, jumping through walls, and the Special Ablities being glitchy.\n\nThe openable caves - which is a fairly good idea - aren't great. They're often really hard. Not hard as in challenging: hard as in boring. I'll take a cave near the Misty Mountains, where you have to jump on spiky platforms which spikes pop up periodically.\nThe problem with this is that failing takes FAR TOO LONG: you have to go AROUND, then up, then back on the platform... *yawn* It'd be easier if they just killed you at the bottom.\nThen there's a set of three spiky platforms in a row. There's no way you can get past this that I've found. Running spends to long, jumping is useless, and as far as I know no character has a speed boost. (Feel free to correct me on this)\n\nNow, I'll go to the bosses. They're far, far better than Lego LoTR (in which EVERY boss has EXACTLY the same attacks), but they're not that great. There's often a key combination which you have to press. The problem is that you have to know the combination: the time it gives you isn't enough. So you have a pain in the rear and no mistake.\nCo-op for these battles is horrible. There is literally NOTHING for the other character to do. Even when you have the sharpest sword of Middle Earth and you're against Azog, who has no armour, you can't hit him. No, the other character is raging at the time that they DON'T give for you to attack him.\n\nThis being said, a boss should not be beatable on the first try. One should have to THINK about it.\nThe problem is that this is taken the wrong way. They're only hittable at certain times: which I can understand, but the other times are simply just a pain.\n\n\nThe cutscenes are pretty good: if you don't like light humour then don't get this game.\nThough, there's no clear way to skip them. Yes, it will come up with 'U' (Skip), but there's no way to control when it will do this. It is a slight nuisance that the Battle of the Five Armies is nonexistent and Erebore is marked by a Loot Dispenser - oh yes. That's the other thing I want to talk about.\n\nMaybe my computer's something I dredged up from the seabed, but I meet the Reccommended Requirements, and even on lowst graphics settings the game still lags. There needs to be a setting: "Special Effects: Off/Low/High" That would save a lot of things.\n\nSo, about this loot. Given the lag, it's IMPOSSIBLE to mine anything as Bofur. I press the key immediately: right in the middle: and it keeps on going. I've had it mine perfectly thanks to the fact that it BOUNCED OFF THE END AND WENT BACK AGAIN.\nYes, my computer meets the Reccommended Requirements. The Reccommended ones.\n\nBack to Loot again: Is there are USE for 1,000 rocks?\nNo?\nOr 10,000 wood?\nNo?\n\nAt least you could sell it at the Dispenser.\n\nThings are also completely unbalanced: Iron is often needed... but it's rarer than diamonds AND emerals, which are never needed except for getting that last Mithril Brick.\nLoot is frankly pointless, and a waste of time. Just make things drop studs and ask the player to input 1,000 studs to unlock something or other... I'm not a dev.\n\nOnto gameplay:\nI can't stress how linear it is. You have 0 freedom.\nI'll take as much of Riddles in the Dark as we were able to complete before it spazzes out (check my screenshots :P).\nYou have to knock down a skeleton to get a head to throw at something.\nHey... I have *checks* 100 rocks.\nWHY CAN'T I JUST USE ONE OF THEM\nOk, so I'd need Dori to pull this down to get a Minikit... I have 50 rope. Can't I just use that?\nYou have a set number of things to do. No freedom. Do this, do this, and do that. Now, I'm not saying that TT should have coded that you could take out the trolls by pushing trees onto them and then attacking them in the face. I'm merely saying that there should be different options. You shouldn't have to go through the level with the game dictating what you can and cannot do.\n\nOnto the Dwarves' ablities.\nI have to say, TT did very well to give nearly all of them something useful.\nExcept for Thorin. He has nothing that he can do that somebody else cannot. Surely he, as the leader, should have the special stuff?\n\nOnto actual gameplay: It's not great.\nAll the special stuff can only be used when the game tells you to. "Buddying up" is a complete waste of time and of patience if it isn't needed to complete the level. Pole Stacks are rather hard to control: you'd think that you'd jump off the pole, but no, you just climb up. Bombur's spring ability never comes out well. It's never used and when it IS, you're groaning that you're Player 2 and thus all the Dwarves are following Player 1, who is far, far away.\nOri's slingshot is similar. It's uselss for attacking (which I'll get to shortly) and is only used when it's needed. At least Dori's morningstar is effective in combat.\n\nThe attacking engine is horrible. By spamming out whatever key it is to attack, you won't get hurt unless it's a boss attack... and even then, that's unlikely. Anything ranged is USELESS. It's so much easier to walk up to the enemy and spam attacks rather than fuddle around with aiming something. Yes, it has an autotarget... but the autotarget seems to like aiming at the farthest away thing possible and not at the thing that is right in front of you hacking you down.\n\nSpeaking of attacking, the Necromancer boss.\nPLEASE\nThis is the buggiest thing in the game.\nYou are a wizard (is far less exciting than it sounds: just like ranged units, but with the disatvantage of not being able to multi-fire and having a useless shield that protects against one attack in the GAME), and you have to shield yourself against the Necromancer's brick blasts. Easy, hey?\nExcept there's one orc that pops out and attacks you. No problem, right? It's just one. It's hardly an army.\nExcept that you as the player can scarcely attack him.  The default is to put the shield up. It's nigh on impossible to actually attack the orc. By the time you have, the Necromancer's launched another brick blast, and the orc is still hacking away at you.\nVery, very, VERY fortunately, there's an area behind the tree on the left. The orc will never attack this space.\n\n\n\nOnto the camera.\n\nHow can I put it nicely... It's like a wild horse on steroids. Very hard to control and rather unpredictable.\nOh, it works most of the time. Oh yes.\nBut the places where it doesn't work are often the places you need it the most. While exploring Middle-Earth you will be able to rotate it. You don't often need to, but it's helpful. However, this gets it to zoom in and out as it tries to get you a view of your character that isn't obscured by rock.\nLevels... levels, now, are a different matter. The camera doesn't rotate.\nIt pans.\nMeaning that it can be impossible to get a good view of what's happening. What I'd give for a nice top view where I can see where all those pesky platforms are... Why can't you just make it rotate? What is the PURPOSE of the pan?\n\n\nSeveral people have bugged about the mouse controls. I'm not fussed about these. So what about the mouse? Do you not know how to use up/down and Enter on a keyboard on a main menu?\nAnd... it even says it down the bottom! Oh yes! 'Up/Down' and 'Enter' (Select)!\n\n\nTL;DR and finishing thoughts:\n\nI've seen that the main reason people are reccomending this is basically because it's The Hobbit. This isn't a bad move: far from it. It's just that to me, the bugs and the pain over the engine make it unworthwhile.\n\nIf you're a Hobbit fan then you'll likely be enraged by the bugs in the engine.\n\nThey're not minor.","September 30, 2014","false","18.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It does a great job of capturing the feeling of adventure, and the battles can feel quite epic and somewhat intense. However it has a few hiccups in which I would only recommend someone to buy this game if on sale so they don't feel cheated. The combat with the wizards can be particularly frustrating since they don't always register how close an enemy is and shoot magic rather than meleeing a target. The boss-ish kind of battles would feel more epic if it was a little more challenging, since upon completion you are left feeling not too satisfied. The biggest gripe I have with the game is how it feels incomplete since it only inculdes the story of the 1st and 2nd movie. Hopefully a free DLC will be released when the time comes, but there are no garentees that one will be released at all. In the end, I would recommend you wait for a sale if you're really interested in this game.","February 6, 2015","false","10.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game play is fun and is about what you would expect, that being said I could not imagine playing this without a controler. This game has plenty of mini games wile there isn't much veriety though they never really get boaring pobably because they are all fairly simple. I would gladly recomend this game to anyone expecialy if the like Lego games and the hobbit.\nI do have a few problems with this game but they are a little nit-picky. First though this may just be my computer or rather back up computer mine is out for repair and the one they gave me one that is sugnificantly less than the one I have (dell lap tops and there affinity for constant repair.) I digress the game seems to slow down where there is a lot going on at the same time. I found that the races were a little longer and mor complex not allowing for any recovery if you make a mistake in other words the are far less forgiving than most of the other games. At times mostly during races the camera will rotate wildly causing you to make mistakes leading ultimatly to frustration. They added a newish build mini-game sometime it is dificult to discern exactly wich peice it wants you to choose and I don't think that they give you enough time to choose the peices either. In this game they added mining wich can lead to farming but won't matter late game. My last complaint is that the game follow the first two movie meaning that it just kind of ends when Smaug flys off to Lake Town wich leaves you felling as though you didn't really accomplish anything.","January 19, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is riddled with glitches which hopefully TT will fix in the near future but definitely still playable (no game killers).  I really like that they kept the level checkpoints and moreover give you direct access to them including a list of available items in said location (e.g. minikits, treasure items, blacksmith designs) making finding your missing piece a bit easier.  The new looting system has its merrits but is overall flawed in my opinion, works great for the buildables but sucks for forging unless you know specifically where to get any one item (Erabor after beating the last level smash the wall behind your characters for a purchase station, 10,000 studs for 5x any item).

I never play anything that's not multi-player / co-op. However, I lucked out by purchasing this title whie it was on sale. I didn't play it for about a month, and then my internet died on me.\n\nThis game was a great time waster, as I suspect now that all the lego games would be. I am life level 40, however im sure this would be very entertaining for children who are fans of the hobbit.\n\nThe cool thing about this and other lego games is that you are pretty much watching the movie and playing out each of the important scenes. For example when bilbo has to free the horses from the trolls.\n\nIt won't pull me from my normal games now that I have my internet back, but do yourself a favor and buy at least one lego title for a rainy day when you wont be able to connect.\n\nNote: Most important if you buy one of these games, buy yourself a usb game controller, they are only $15 - $25 for a decent one. These games are extreamly annoying if your trying to keyboard and mouse it. If you are worried it will take a long time to learn how to use a game controller your wrong, it took me about 30 seconds and I was up and running with this game.\n\nWorth a buy ( even for someone who's not in to this genera of game ) - My first review","November 21, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Even if you finished the story there are alot of side quests, areas that you can explore... The eagle was really nice transport. And you can make your own creature. At some points its abit glitchy\n\n\nStory 9/10 : The story followed the original Hobbit movie but some of the scenes were changed abit (they made them look funnyer) the sad thing is that they wont make the third part of the movie as i mentioned before).\n\n\nGraphic 8/10: Tipical lego graphic\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","May 3, 2015","true","17.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But once you finish the levels, and start on the remaining 3/4, it's just annoying. The camera swoops around at the slightest provocation, so that you either fall off what you were standing on, or can't see anything. Any character you control will automatically target the nearest NPC instead of the lego item you want to smash (Saruman himself is unable to attack anything he is standing next to; you have to walk away, then hope that the other character doesn't move to stand in front of it). Travelling is tedious; you will always start at the far end of the map (where the story ended), and going anywhere is slow and repetitive. Finally, the lego building thing that was so good within levels now slows down everything else you do. You want to forge a mithril item? Have you collected 50 carrots, a bunch of rocks, some copper, and a stack of red gems? Go do that first! You want to help a guy build a thing? Do you have 60 pieces of silver, and some wood, and some green gems?\nSo, initially I'd have given it 8 or 9 out of 10, but my best estimate at this point (31% completion) is that it would be lucky to get a 6 from me.","May 10, 2014","false","32.9"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","3"

A beautiful game, what little I played of it. I quickly found that keyboard play is a disaster of finger dexterity (even if you have 9 or 10 fingers.) I then setup my controller Logitech F710. After configuring my controller, and then reconfiguring again. I sought off, but alas didn't make out of the mountain. I can't hold it against the game that it doesn't know the actual button names I used, but during the anvil mini game it tells me  to click buttons 8, then 7, then 4 then 2. It's like playing rockband on a black and white tv. However I persisted on only to get into another room where Dori swings his flail. I swing away and make contact, then i'm told to tap button 2 (which I have now memorized.) He fails, I try again; fail. I mix it up. I pull left right. I pray to the dark god of Mordor; he finds me wanting. I'm fusterated. Lego games arn't supposed to be fusterating. Luckly I didn't pay much, and this will sit unplayed.

The game does give a great atmosphere as it is played through, however a lot of the game mechanics are very flawed. These flawed game mechanics, (ranged combat/ranged breaking blocks; jumping mechanics, terrible camera panning, etc, etc.) absolutely ruin the game, negating most of the fun that could've been had and replacing it with cancer-inducing stress from having to repeat these tasks over and over until they are finally completed, (after the 50th or so time for each puzzle).

These games are coming out like every 6 months or so, it's getting insane. If only it had some new, refreshing gameplay elements, but guess what ? Nope.\n\nIt's hard to keep recommending these games because they've been pumping out these games for years now and except for the addition of an open world it's the same thing over and over again. Over and over again. Over and over again. Hmm, I can see why they keep copying the same gameplay and just put it in a new coat of paint. It's simple. But so damn lazy, too.\n\nIf this is one of your first Lego games do give it a try. They can definitely be fun. But if you've played them all before then you've practically played this one as well.

R. R. Tolkien para o universo de peças de LEGO , oq eu tenho a dizer... Bem a adaptação dicou Boa. O jeito que foi contada , detalhes , claro que faltou algumas coisas que não podem ser recriadas com a peçinhas , mais no geral o jogo está bom , e agora uma análise minha sobre o game:\n\nEnredo: 9.0/10 (O enredo foi focado nos dois primeiros filme do universo de ''O Hobbit'' sendo eles: ''Uma Jornada Inesperada'' e ''A Desolação de Smaug'', foram bem adaptados e são mostradas as partes mais importantes de ambos os filmes , mais ai me vem a pergunta: Agora com o lançamento do filme ''A Batalha Dos Cinco Exécitos'' como iremos fazer para jogar o terceiro filme no game?, quem já possui o jogo irá ganha-lo como uma DLC gratuita ou teremos que pagar para joga-lo?).\n\nGráficos: 8.5/10 (Os Gráficos estão praticamente os mesmos de outros jogos da LEGO, o game LEGO: The Hobbit é um dos games mais recentes da LEGO, e os gráficos dele são facilmente comparados aos do game LEGO: The Lord of The Rings (Antecessor do game, que conta a história dos 3 filmes do de ''O Senhor dos Anéis''), Houve pouca Melhora Gráfica, mais não posso deixar de falar que houve uma melhora...Porém...muito pequena).\n\nTrilha Sonora: 9.5/10 (Foram Usadas Musicas de ambas as Franquias Tanto as de ''O Senhor dos Anéis'' como a de ''O Hobbit'', e para quem é Fã e já viu os Filmes, Não preciso nem dizer que é uma Trilha Sonora Epica...).\n\nEfeitos Sonoros: 8.0/10 (São bons, como peças de LEGO quebrando e de armas como espadas e arcos... mais nada demais...).\n\nQuantidade de Personagens Jogaveis: 10/10 (Eu zerei primeiro o LEGO: The Hobbit antes de o LEGO: The Lord of The Rings, isso pq aidna estou no comecinho do game sobre ''O Senhor dos Anéis'', e a quantidade de personagens joveis é imensamente superior, em termo de textura, não ha uma diferença muito grande mais ainda assim é um pouco melhor em LEGO: The Hobbit... Oque já era esperado).\n\nLEGO: The Hobbit cumpre com oque promete, traz os dois primeiros filmes ao mundo de peças de LEGO de uma forma muito criativa e inteligente... e sim tem potencial para agradar fãs dos filmes e do livro... Tanto Crianças como adultos.\n\n\nMinha nota final para: LEGO: The Hobbit: 9.0/10\n\n","January 4, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As always with these games there is a wealth of content and an open world to explore. Sound track is beautiful but the voice acting could be better. And there is the problem of the game ending at the end of the events of the second movie in the Hobbit trilogy. I understand the problem of putting the game out before the third instament hit theatres, but doing this makes for an unsatifying ending to the game. Though I have to admit, credit to the company for knowing this problem and promising story missions for the third movie added on as dlc. But still, if I would have been in charge of the project I would have waited tell the third movie aired and released a full game. Reguardless of that problem, it is still a wonderful game worthy of buying whether you are a lego game fan or not.","January 31, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No violence what so ever, no bad words and sexual references.\nYou can play with your friends, your young cousins, and even your parents or grand parents!\n\n2. It's humorous, Lego games have unique sense of humor.\nMost of the games are based on the famous movies, but they re-telll and edit the movie story in more casual and easy way.\n\n3. So many thigns to do!\n(Keep in mind that I bought all the additional packs!)\nThere are almost endless amount of quests, characters, and collections you have to finish/collect.\nI've played this game 9 hours and yet, I only finished around 20% of all the story line!\nNot to mention this game gives you so many freedom! You can choose what you want to do!\nDefinately worth of money and I highly recommand buying the whole additional packs!\n\n\nBad:\n1. For some people, this game could be childish, all those cute characters, and too-easy difficulty.\nIf you want to play a game that is challenging and "MATURE", I think this is not the game for you.\n\n2. Saving system is not good.\nThere is an auto-save system, but it's only one or two per one stage, there is no auto-saving in the middle of the stages.\nEach stage will take about 15 to 20 minutes, and if anything goes wrong, you have to start from the very beginning of the stage.\nOverall, there is very few opportunity to save your game.\n\n3. Too many thing is going on! + Etc.\nToo many things to collect and finish, you might feel like you are lost, and the game itself seems to lack of explanations.\nThere are many icons that I don't understand what it is.\nLastly, control is very, VERY different than the "usual" control system.\nYou will have to practice around 10 minutes to get used to it.\n\nRemeber, this is what I felt, so don't believe my review 100%!\n\nAs for me, however, I am so into these Lego game series! I could definately see myself buying other Lego game series!\nAnyway, thank you for reading this long review, and have a wonerful day!","January 7, 2015","true","75.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On steam I instantly wanted this game- was the top of my wishlist. I was not dissappointed at all! Awesome gameplay that closely follows the 1st two Hobbit movies. A little bit annoyed that they didn't just wait for the 3rd film to come out- then the game would have a complete story. If you played the Lego Lord of the rings, then I can tell you it's similar style, BUT the free roam IS MUCH BETTER!!! The free roam is a lot more open, satisfying and full. Kinda makes the LOTR free roam seem not as good.\n\nAwesome fights, epic adventurous action from some of the best scenes- and all the great soundtracks the are in the films. Also a lot of cool characters to collect and missions to complete- in classic lego fun!\nWould be 9/10 for the fact that they didn't wait for the 3rd film but on the sole basis of the game itself- I give this 10/10!

As always with these games there is a wealth of content and an open world to explore. Sound track is beautiful but the voice acting could be better. And there is the problem of the game ending at the end of the events of the second movie in the Hobbit trilogy. I understand the problem of putting the game out before the third instament hit theatres, but doing this makes for an unsatifying ending to the game. Though I have to admit, credit to the company for knowing this problem and promising story missions for the third movie added on as dlc. But still, if I would have been in charge of the project I would have waited tell the third movie aired and released a full game. Reguardless of that problem, it is still a wonderful game worthy of buying whether you are a lego game fan or not.","January 31, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good sense of humor. Good mechanics. Odd choices on how they broke-up the story. Dialogue from the films is often low quality. The open world part of the game is fantastic, and the side quests are usually good. On my AMD A10 GPU, suffered from tearing during cutscenes. Game also occassionally crashed to desktop, usually at the exact moment of completing a level. Frustratingly, I would then have to do it over. Could use some short, in-game tutorials for more advanced mechanics. Also, the game does not include the third film's story, nor has this DLC been released yet. Nonetheless, a quality product in the end. Looking forward to playing the end.","December 28, 2014","true","37.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't seen the Hobbit movies unlike LOTR I had seen, but it didn't really bother me. It only made it hard to recognize the dwarf characters especially to select the correct dwarf for those ingame puzzles.\n\nCompared to LEGO LOTR this game brought in a few new things like the loot system which is fairly nice addition. Most breakable items drop loot like planks, stones, ropes and such. Also minable stones for minerals and other goods. These loots are used to build up stuff and completeing various side quests.\n\nNegative things about LEGO Hobbit:\n1. The map system is poor compared to LOTR. It is very hard to navigate and find what you want. It's bearable at best.\n2. Guide studs seem to lead you to dead ends more often.\n3. Game speed seems to vary alot like in a badly emulated console games on PC. Sometimes the map navigation magnifying glass goes wayyy too fast to select items from map. Also those lego building minigames the selection is sometimes ridiculously hard to make when the selector goes too fast. Not sure if this is a factor when mining stones, but they seem ok.\n4. Lots of little annoying bugs, like switching character just doesn't work unless you change a scenery by flying or something like that.\n5. Changing day/night time is annoying. First have to find a camp somewhere and then watch a stupid sausage grilling moment that takes too long.\n\nI would rate this game 3.5/5. It is a very good game with some minor bugs here and there.","December 6, 2014","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First reason, the open-world feature. It looks like they were trying to expand upon LEGO The Lord of the Rings (Which I purchased on PC disc before i found Steam) by adding some of the characters from the lord of the rings (Sam and Frodo for example). My favorite thing about this game was the bonus level, Stone Giant Smash, I think. My only complaint is that you can`t be in the bonus level for say, an hour. It is such a fun level and the time limit is 5 minutes the get everything (1 million studs, as always) but the only way you CAN`T get 1 million studs in the first 30 seconds is by not moving, because the rock giant(s) you play as is(are) so huge you crush about 12 trees when you take just 1 step!

I haven't seen the Hobbit movies unlike LOTR I had seen, but it didn't really bother me. It only made it hard to recognize the dwarf characters especially to select the correct dwarf for those ingame puzzles.\n\nCompared to LEGO LOTR this game brought in a few new things like the loot system which is fairly nice addition. Most breakable items drop loot like planks, stones, ropes and such. Also minable stones for minerals and other goods. These loots are used to build up stuff and completeing various side quests.\n\nNegative things about LEGO Hobbit:\n1. The map system is poor compared to LOTR. It is very hard to navigate and find what you want. It's bearable at best.\n2. Guide studs seem to lead you to dead ends more often.\n3. Game speed seems to vary alot like in a badly emulated console games on PC. Sometimes the map navigation magnifying glass goes wayyy too fast to select items from map. Also those lego building minigames the selection is sometimes ridiculously hard to make when the selector goes too fast. Not sure if this is a factor when mining stones, but they seem ok.\n4. Lots of little annoying bugs, like switching character just doesn't work unless you change a scenery by flying or something like that.\n5. Changing day/night time is annoying. First have to find a camp somewhere and then watch a stupid sausage grilling moment that takes too long.\n\nI would rate this game 3.5/5. It is a very good game with some minor bugs here and there.","December 6, 2014","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How many more reasons do you need? Seriously though, its a little different from the other lego games as it has some degree of crafting, such as making keys to open doors, not just the mithril items like in Lego Lord of the Rings. Crafting loot is dropped by mobs and by smashing stuff in the game, sometimes requiring a particular dwarf with a particular tool, such as the pick axe to get jewels. Some puzzels are like lego building mini games, where you have to select the correct brick to complete a lego kit, on a timer. The combat is a little different too, with the buddy-up system, where you can get two dwarfs to join, (they either link arms or sit on shoulders) and then either swing them into the target, or throw them at it, always a giggle.

R. R. Tolkien para o universo de peças de LEGO , oq eu tenho a dizer... Bem a adaptação dicou Boa. O jeito que foi contada , detalhes , claro que faltou algumas coisas que não podem ser recriadas com a peçinhas , mais no geral o jogo está bom , e agora uma análise minha sobre o game:\n\nEnredo: 9.0/10 (O enredo foi focado nos dois primeiros filme do universo de ''O Hobbit'' sendo eles: ''Uma Jornada Inesperada'' e ''A Desolação de Smaug'', foram bem adaptados e são mostradas as partes mais importantes de ambos os filmes , mais ai me vem a pergunta: Agora com o lançamento do filme ''A Batalha Dos Cinco Exécitos'' como iremos fazer para jogar o terceiro filme no game?, quem já possui o jogo irá ganha-lo como uma DLC gratuita ou teremos que pagar para joga-lo?).\n\nGráficos: 8.5/10 (Os Gráficos estão praticamente os mesmos de outros jogos da LEGO, o game LEGO: The Hobbit é um dos games mais recentes da LEGO, e os gráficos dele são facilmente comparados aos do game LEGO: The Lord of The Rings (Antecessor do game, que conta a história dos 3 filmes do de ''O Senhor dos Anéis''), Houve pouca Melhora Gráfica, mais não posso deixar de falar que houve uma melhora...Porém...muito pequena).\n\nTrilha Sonora: 9.5/10 (Foram Usadas Musicas de ambas as Franquias Tanto as de ''O Senhor dos Anéis'' como a de ''O Hobbit'', e para quem é Fã e já viu os Filmes, Não preciso nem dizer que é uma Trilha Sonora Epica...).\n\nEfeitos Sonoros: 8.0/10 (São bons, como peças de LEGO quebrando e de armas como espadas e arcos... mais nada demais...).\n\nQuantidade de Personagens Jogaveis: 10/10 (Eu zerei primeiro o LEGO: The Hobbit antes de o LEGO: The Lord of The Rings, isso pq aidna estou no comecinho do game sobre ''O Senhor dos Anéis'', e a quantidade de personagens joveis é imensamente superior, em termo de textura, não ha uma diferença muito grande mais ainda assim é um pouco melhor em LEGO: The Hobbit... Oque já era esperado).\n\nLEGO: The Hobbit cumpre com oque promete, traz os dois primeiros filmes ao mundo de peças de LEGO de uma forma muito criativa e inteligente... e sim tem potencial para agradar fãs dos filmes e do livro... Tanto Crianças como adultos.\n\n\nMinha nota final para: LEGO: The Hobbit: 9.0/10\n\n","January 4, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I snatched it on a Steam Summer Sale so I can't really agree that today's price is something worth while, although it's better you buy this for PC than for console. It'd be a lot easier on your pocket.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent as you would expect from a licensed video game made by Warner Brothers, Traveller's Tales and Lego. It's graphics are very easy on the hardware and I only have one single fault in that it didn't wait for the third instalment of the film series so you'll only be playing as far as releasing Smaug into the world I'm afraid.\n\nOther than that, it's an excellent game and I can't fault it anywhere else so I highly recommend this purchase. especially if you loved Lego Lord of the Rings or just Lego games in general. It's a brilliant game, trust me.\n\nIt works VERY well with controllers too.","February 17, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an improved Lego lotr game, but the down side is the lotr game has the complete story. This game only goes through the first and second movies, but I'm hoping that they will come out with the rest of the game soon. It should be an update or dlc. I would highly recemend this game to anyone who likes the Hobbit or Lotr. The game play is awsome, but it does have some bugs and glitches. If you have a low performents computer, this game won't run very well, but it works fine on a good mac, except it may freeze up in the start menu like mine. The free roam is awsome, you can explor a lot of northern Middle-Earth from the Grey Havens to Erebor, you can see Mount Doom from buged up spot, but you can't travel there. You can zoom out on the map by using the up and down keys for your camera. The caracters are awsome,you can play Dwarves,Hobbits,Elves,Men,Orcs,Wraiths,Trolls and the Goblin King. You can also ride horses and wargs any were in the world and an eagle takes you were you want to go. It has edles game time (I have played about 130 hrs) and the levels are fun, but some of the bosses are hard to defeat. It is a game for almost all ages and parents will have fun to. All the armor and weapons are awsome and the dlcs are great. The game and dlcs are will worth the money. This is the best Lego ever.

If you played the Lego Lord of the rings, then I can tell you it's similar style, BUT the free roam IS MUCH BETTER!!! The free roam is a lot more open, satisfying and full. Kinda makes the LOTR free roam seem not as good.\n\nAwesome fights, epic adventurous action from some of the best scenes- and all the great soundtracks the are in the films. Also a lot of cool characters to collect and missions to complete- in classic lego fun!\nWould be 9/10 for the fact that they didn't wait for the 3rd film but on the sole basis of the game itself- I give this 10/10!

For example; during the game Gandalf and another wizard split off from the company of dwarves to 'explore'. So until the level was complete it was impossible to access other characters.\n\nAll exploration has to be saved for the end, when you unlock the ability to switch characters on the fly (in the open world, much like a bigger free play).

It feels like they ran out of funding 3/4 of the way through production and shipped what they had.\n\nLego: The Hobbit is not a bad game by Lego game standards - it has continued to progress the formula, including the 'build minigame' from the Lego Movie game, adding team-up attacks between some characters and a resource mechanic (which perpetuates the grind, but is new nonetheless).\n\nWhat this game -doesn't- have is an ending. It just stops after one mission with no conclusion to the plot, then the credits roll. That's it. Now go do the other 75% of the game that is open-world challenges and fetch-quests. You might think the character roster is up to par, but in reality 50% of the listed characters are just alternate costumes - they are no longer stacked per-character like the Harry Potter games - which also leads to having two of the same character in play at once.\n\nLego games are no stranger to bugs, but this is the first game that I've had multiple encounters with game-ending bugs. Be it being permamently stuck in an animation, the fast-travel eagle freezing in mid-air or the forging mini-game being incompleteable. These are not crashes, but event chains simply not working and requiring the game to be quit and restarted. There are also numerious examples of the game temporarily freezing or slowing down, but these don't end the game.\n\nMany other people have said it, so I'll be breif. This game is unfinished. It has polish, the gameplay is as it has ever been, the world is expansive and there certainly isn't a shortage of things to do, but it feels as though the filler content vastly outweighs the structured content, as there are a number of abilities and character-types that simply do not appear in the main story, and only become accessable after you finish what story there is.\n\nIn short, there are better Lego games out there, and better ones will be coming, so you're better off getting one that feels like it's all there.","November 23, 2015","false","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the fourth Lego game I've played and the second one I try in PC. First one was LOTR, and even when this one feels improved, I think that LEGO LOTR is, by far, quite better.\n\nIn first term, I had to fix some problems in order to avoid the game crashing at certain levels. Also, the new construction system is, in my opinion, unnecessary. In addition, it seemed too easy to obtain coins in this game, at least for me.\n\nIf I had to remark the good things... The "Lego" style is, as ever, great. They've included the Spanish voices, what is really good, and it's more "British" than the LOTR game.\n\nI hope they release an update (that's almost dreaming, let's say a DLC) including the Story quests of The Hobbit 3, the main story feels a bit unfinished without an end.\n\nI recommend it? Definitely yes.\nShall you bought it before you've played Lego: LOTR? I don't think so.","December 29, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-orphan-jedi/recommended/285160/","the-orphan-jedi","the-orphan-jedi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-orphan-jedi/","29 products in account","This game is basically Lego Skyrim. Which is awesome. There's an open world map to explore, tons of side quests to do, and lots of weapons and armor pieces available to customize whatever character you play as. Plus the blocky Lego-ness of the game makes it really low-stress to play. There's no blood or tense gameplay here. Just hours of good fun.\n\nOne common complaint about the Lego video games is that after awhile, they all tend to feel the same. In this particular game however, the makers tried to make it feel a little more special than usual by adding a few new gameplay features...like mining, armor/weapon collecting, food/supplies collecting, and smithing (which was also present in the Lego Lord of the Rings game). These features really add to the gameplay, giving you an additional reward beyond money for every bush, tree, boulder, or piece of furniture you smash. The mining feature is not the easiest to use, however, since it relies on really precise timing and an instantly responsive controller. But it still isn't impossible to collect all the elements you need to complete the quests or smith the various items.\n\nIf you enjoy any of the Lego games, I would highly reccommend this one. Like I said, it's like Skyrim, but Lego. 10/10 for Lego Hobbit.","November 28, 2015","true","152.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And there is the problem of the game ending at the end of the events of the second movie in the Hobbit trilogy. I understand the problem of putting the game out before the third instament hit theatres, but doing this makes for an unsatifying ending to the game. Though I have to admit, credit to the company for knowing this problem and promising story missions for the third movie added on as dlc.

How many more reasons do you need? Seriously though, its a little different from the other lego games as it has some degree of crafting, such as making keys to open doors, not just the mithril items like in Lego Lord of the Rings. Crafting loot is dropped by mobs and by smashing stuff in the game, sometimes requiring a particular dwarf with a particular tool, such as the pick axe to get jewels. Some puzzels are like lego building mini games, where you have to select the correct brick to complete a lego kit, on a timer. The combat is a little different too, with the buddy-up system, where you can get two dwarfs to join, (they either link arms or sit on shoulders) and then either swing them into the target, or throw them at it, always a giggle.

Tolkien's Middle-earth.\n\nThe game is buggy and in areas I have become stuck and needed to restart the level.

I bought it without having watched the movie, and having greatly enjoyed the books. I was unable to tell which of the plot changes were made by Jackson, and which by Lego, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I recommend the game. It's the usual funloving romp through Middle Earth that we saw in Lego: LOTR, with the same basic systems, including a large Middle Earth (without the zooming map; :( ). The difference is there are a lot of new minigames, tonnes of new stuff, and even an OP bonus level that will give you about 100000 studs in 3 minutes. If the game has a flaw, it's that Dori is a little too vocal, and, since you have to spend a lot of time playing as him (he has an essential ability) you are always hearing his 'hip' s and 'haw's. Also, Gandelf is terrible in combat, and the new Rage feature doesn't work, because you're not invulnerable while charging it. Otherwise, the combat is the best I've experienced in any Lego game ever. It's just so fluid, that I fell in love with it. Especially after hammer smashing an orc off a cliff.\n\nOh, also, unexpected bonus. I found out you can play as Saroun, so I bought him, headed down to Dolgildur, and gave every annoying quest giver the boot!\n\nGreat game.","June 20, 2015","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, I'm mostly left with negatives.\n\nThe story of LEGO The Hobbit is told like in LLOTR - original movie dialogue is used to voice the characters, while their mostly ridiculous animated behaviour makes for a humorous parody. I found that LEGO the Hobbit can't quite keep up with LOTR in that respect tough, just like the Hobbit movies seemed not quite able to capture what made the LOTR movies great. Luckily, the gameplay holds up just the same.\n\nCompared to LLOTR, this game has some additonal character special abilities. Small characters now buddy up -- or dwarf up if you like -- with a second small party member to destroy particularly tough walls or deal damage to stunned bosses. With the slingshot, there is now another type of ranged weapon to be used in puzzles. Instead of pushing large blocks slows over checkered floors, Dwahlin, your Dwarven heavyweight, will now instead smash boulders along slides. That skill, just like the ability to mine ores, is curiously exclusive to one character throughout the whole story. And while all Dwarves can buddy up, most of them have abilities that only they possess. Combined with the fact that that the character selection wheel now accesses your inventory, you'll spend most of your time in this game swapping around the party. Even tough it's clear from some of the unique animation of the characters, that the developers wanted to give them meaning, some, just like in the movies, are left with a secondary role. One tends to wonder why the three dwarves whose sole special ability is that they can stand on top of each other, cannot fill the role of a second miner, shooter or rope-carrier.\n\nLike in LLOTR, you'll need to make use of these abilities not just during the story missions but also when replaying a mission in free play and when attempting side-quests in the overworld. Compared to LLOTR, your access to the world until the end of the game is even more restricted, as there are seldom more than 5 characters available for you to use. This means you pretty much have to finish the story before attempting the side quests. This means that there are rarely opportunities where you can finish stuff around the world on your way to another mission and basically restricts you to exploring the world after the story is over.\n\nThe last and probably most damning point is, as other user reviews have mentioned, that the game is unfinished. It plays fine until you get to the part which is the end of the second movie and the game does not go on from there. The publisher, Warner Bros., stated that it intended to release an expansion to the game for the third movie. But this expansion is no longer forthcoming. The story ends at a cliffhanger and even though I'm sure most people know the cliffhanger is resolved, (the game being based on a children's book, it's not exaclty difficult) the player is still left with a feeling of incompleteness that will probably keep most people from going into free play mode. The hardcore collectors, however, will find lots of quests and things to do to keep them interested after the story has reached the apparent end.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for more LEGO game action, just like the LEGO titles you've played before, you probably will get some enjoyment from this title. Otherwise, this game will probably miss the mark for you.","June 5, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unfortunate that as you play through the Single campaign, this open map is hardly used with levels teleporting you to the next section, skipping over the wonderful detail of the game. It feels like bad game design, as many places you would have had to walk though (in the book and film) you don't get to see or explore until you go off Piste (and that is normally after you have completed the game already.)\n\nThis wouldn't be so shameful if the main story was solid. It's not. Six hours of playing and the game is over, finishing at the end of the second movie. Selling this game as "the hobbit" is a lie. It's a fraction of the story, and will never be finished.\n\nAnother serious issue is the large amounts of bugs that were found during the 6 hours of main mission. Characters getting impossibly stuck, crashes to windows (that I also had with Lego LOTR and Lego Harry Potter but never have with other games, my system is stable). Some of the quests seemed impossible, and much time was spent wasted trying to solve something to only find out (after searching online) that I had encountered a bug and must set my resolution, vsync, graphics settings etc to something else to try to solve it.\n\nI only play Lego games because of the CO-OP, with my wife, but even she was getting frustrated by some of the bugs, quirks and oddities this game offered. One small example, being how when unlocking a new person you would be "greeted" with all the characters being displayed on the screen for about 20 seconds with no possibility to remove them. 17 seconds too long. Another is how when one character speaks to someone, the other can not view the map. There are many oddities like this that made the experience frustrating.\n\nAnyway, despite the bitter taste of a half completed game, and a bitter taste that the final third of this game will never be released I can still give a half hearted recommendation for this game when it's on sale. Wandering the open world was a lot of fun, despite glitches, and I do love the LOTR universe.\n\nBut anyone who doesn't like collecting loot should avoid this game at all costs, and the main game feels cheap. low 6/10.","January 2","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it without having watched the movie, and having greatly enjoyed the books. I was unable to tell which of the plot changes were made by Jackson, and which by Lego, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I recommend the game. It's the usual funloving romp through Middle Earth that we saw in Lego: LOTR, with the same basic systems, including a large Middle Earth (without the zooming map; :( ). The difference is there are a lot of new minigames, tonnes of new stuff, and even an OP bonus level that will give you about 100000 studs in 3 minutes. If the game has a flaw, it's that Dori is a little too vocal, and, since you have to spend a lot of time playing as him (he has an essential ability) you are always hearing his 'hip' s and 'haw's. Also, Gandelf is terrible in combat, and the new Rage feature doesn't work, because you're not invulnerable while charging it. Otherwise, the combat is the best I've experienced in any Lego game ever. It's just so fluid, that I fell in love with it. Especially after hammer smashing an orc off a cliff.\n\nOh, also, unexpected bonus. I found out you can play as Saroun, so I bought him, headed down to Dolgildur, and gave every annoying quest giver the boot!\n\nGreat game.","June 20, 2015","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those games were great in two ways. They had a lot of replayability for guy like me who likes to unlock all the characters. They also had a great sense of humor in regard to the source material.\n\nLet me explain that sense of humor a little. None of the characters ever spoke. They made sounds and displayed various cute animations thus showing the plot of the movie rather than telling us anything. As a result, those old games were great.\n\nWhile Lego the Hobbit does maintain its replayability, it lacks any of the sense of humor of the original games. Long cutscenes clutter the entire beginning of the game (That's all I've played), all of which are narrated. The narration takes away from the original style and replaces the feel of the original games with something that very clearly feels like I'm just being shown a worse version of the film.\n\nFurthermore, the old Star Wars games cost less than this and covered three movies (and 6 if you got the complete pack).  So if you do the math, $19.99 for a bad game covering 1 movie? Not a good deal.\n\nIn conclusion, I give this 3/10. If you really enjoyed the movie and either read or don't want to read the book, this may be a not awful way for you to get some more out of the franchise maybe? But only if you really must have more. Otherwise, avoid this purchase.","June 10, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the first of the Lego games I can't whole-heartedly recommend. They're all a lot of fun, especially for just casual playing with friends, bit this one lets the side down.\n\nIt builds on Lego Lord of the Rings, with many of the same gameplay mechanics and similar voice acting dubbed in from the movies. As a game, it's mostly playable, but some of the mechanics are a little confusing. The inventory system is marginally harder to use and the system where Dwarves 'buddy up' to complete tasks is not amazingly well implemented. But that's not the biggest issue. By far the biggest issue is that this game doesn't include events from the 3rd Hobbit movie. It just ends with the events of the second one and leaves it at that. This is disappointing because we were led to believe there would be DLC which would patch in the third movie, but that was officially denied by the developers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a competent Lego game with it's own pluses and minuses, but not enough to recommend it. Go get Lego LotR, possibly the best Lego game yet, or Lego Star Wars, missing some of the extra mechanics, but still an absolute classic.","October 9, 2015","false","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, especially on the free play mode.  That has not been the case for me with previous games.  I thought other elements of the game were unique, also -- the mining, construction building, etc.  And they finally found a use for the character customization that was pretty pointless in the other games.  I played this game to 100% with all the achievements.  Would it have been better with the last book added?  Yes, of course.  But it's unfair to make a blanket statement based on that.

It never will be finished. So, it is what it is. Plus you would have to get the game for super cheap (Hopefully below $4.99, but I don't think LEGO games go lower than that).\n\nThe Good:\nI love LEGO games. Each one does a great job combining the original story of the movie it was based on, as well as adding their own spin with LEGO humor. The Hobbit is no exception. I recently started playing The Lord of the Rings, and am able to compare their progression from one to the other. The Hobbit feels a little more refined in gameplay, and they added a few other fun aspects that I felt were done better than The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit does a good job with what was from the first 2 movies, and adding humor to things along the way. They also have a bunch of extra content that will keep you busy for many hours. They even have a day/night cycle. So, when you think you've done all of the extra content, you in fact are only about halfway done with the extra content. There are also a TON of extra characters. 90% of them aren't needed, but they are fun to unlock and run around the world with.\n\nThe Bad:\nAs I mentioned before, this game is not complete.The game ends with Smaug flying towards Laketown to attack it. And....that's it. Roll Credits. Congratulations, you beat The Hobbit. I would have been somewhat happy if they had just included one more mission where you take down Smaug, because it is after all called "The Hobbit" not "...and Battle of the Five Armies". From what I have read online they had every intention of including content from "Battle of the Five Armies". However somewhere down the road someone made the decision to not develop that content. Is that acceptable for a game company to abandon a project 2/3 of the way done and say "Here ya go, this is all you get"? Absolutely not. That's why I recommend only getting the game when it is CHEAP. Cheap development practices should mean they will charge the customer a cheap price. I would not recommend this game to someone new to the LEGO franchise. It may leave a bitter taste in their mouth and leave them questioning "Are all of the LEGO games unfinished like this?".\n\nTL/DR; Get it if it is cheap, you are not new to the LEGO franchise, and you 110% understand that it's not finished. Don't get it if it isn't cheap, you are new to LEGO games, or not completely convinced the game is only 2/3 done.","October 22, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, I'm mostly left with negatives.\n\nThe story of LEGO The Hobbit is told like in LLOTR - original movie dialogue is used to voice the characters, while their mostly ridiculous animated behaviour makes for a humorous parody. I found that LEGO the Hobbit can't quite keep up with LOTR in that respect tough, just like the Hobbit movies seemed not quite able to capture what made the LOTR movies great. Luckily, the gameplay holds up just the same.\n\nCompared to LLOTR, this game has some additonal character special abilities. Small characters now buddy up -- or dwarf up if you like -- with a second small party member to destroy particularly tough walls or deal damage to stunned bosses. With the slingshot, there is now another type of ranged weapon to be used in puzzles. Instead of pushing large blocks slows over checkered floors, Dwahlin, your Dwarven heavyweight, will now instead smash boulders along slides. That skill, just like the ability to mine ores, is curiously exclusive to one character throughout the whole story. And while all Dwarves can buddy up, most of them have abilities that only they possess. Combined with the fact that that the character selection wheel now accesses your inventory, you'll spend most of your time in this game swapping around the party. Even tough it's clear from some of the unique animation of the characters, that the developers wanted to give them meaning, some, just like in the movies, are left with a secondary role. One tends to wonder why the three dwarves whose sole special ability is that they can stand on top of each other, cannot fill the role of a second miner, shooter or rope-carrier.\n\nLike in LLOTR, you'll need to make use of these abilities not just during the story missions but also when replaying a mission in free play and when attempting side-quests in the overworld. Compared to LLOTR, your access to the world until the end of the game is even more restricted, as there are seldom more than 5 characters available for you to use. This means you pretty much have to finish the story before attempting the side quests. This means that there are rarely opportunities where you can finish stuff around the world on your way to another mission and basically restricts you to exploring the world after the story is over.\n\nThe last and probably most damning point is, as other user reviews have mentioned, that the game is unfinished. It plays fine until you get to the part which is the end of the second movie and the game does not go on from there. The publisher, Warner Bros., stated that it intended to release an expansion to the game for the third movie. But this expansion is no longer forthcoming. The story ends at a cliffhanger and even though I'm sure most people know the cliffhanger is resolved, (the game being based on a children's book, it's not exaclty difficult) the player is still left with a feeling of incompleteness that will probably keep most people from going into free play mode. The hardcore collectors, however, will find lots of quests and things to do to keep them interested after the story has reached the apparent end.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for more LEGO game action, just like the LEGO titles you've played before, you probably will get some enjoyment from this title. Otherwise, this game will probably miss the mark for you.","June 5, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Smooth gameplay and the battles handled well. Interesting mechanic around day and night for more gold brick fun. The only negative comments I have are around audio and storyline. The Hobbit and LOTR are among the first I played that used from-movie audio, and it doesn't always work. As well, this game only covers the first two installments of the movie, and so the game ends a bit differently. It is fine, but playing the game after watching all three movies, it just seems like we are missing out.","December 29, 2015","true","59.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unfortunate that as you play through the Single campaign, this open map is hardly used with levels teleporting you to the next section, skipping over the wonderful detail of the game. It feels like bad game design, as many places you would have had to walk though (in the book and film) you don't get to see or explore until you go off Piste (and that is normally after you have completed the game already.)\n\nThis wouldn't be so shameful if the main story was solid. It's not. Six hours of playing and the game is over, finishing at the end of the second movie. Selling this game as "the hobbit" is a lie. It's a fraction of the story, and will never be finished.\n\nAnother serious issue is the large amounts of bugs that were found during the 6 hours of main mission. Characters getting impossibly stuck, crashes to windows (that I also had with Lego LOTR and Lego Harry Potter but never have with other games, my system is stable). Some of the quests seemed impossible, and much time was spent wasted trying to solve something to only find out (after searching online) that I had encountered a bug and must set my resolution, vsync, graphics settings etc to something else to try to solve it.\n\nI only play Lego games because of the CO-OP, with my wife, but even she was getting frustrated by some of the bugs, quirks and oddities this game offered. One small example, being how when unlocking a new person you would be "greeted" with all the characters being displayed on the screen for about 20 seconds with no possibility to remove them. 17 seconds too long. Another is how when one character speaks to someone, the other can not view the map. There are many oddities like this that made the experience frustrating.\n\nAnyway, despite the bitter taste of a half completed game, and a bitter taste that the final third of this game will never be released I can still give a half hearted recommendation for this game when it's on sale. Wandering the open world was a lot of fun, despite glitches, and I do love the LOTR universe.\n\nBut anyone who doesn't like collecting loot should avoid this game at all costs, and the main game feels cheap. low 6/10.","January 2","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is awesome. There's an open world map to explore, tons of side quests to do, and lots of weapons and armor pieces available to customize whatever character you play as. Plus the blocky Lego-ness of the game makes it really low-stress to play. There's no blood or tense gameplay here. Just hours of good fun.\n\nOne common complaint about the Lego video games is that after awhile, they all tend to feel the same. In this particular game however, the makers tried to make it feel a little more special than usual by adding a few new gameplay features...like mining, armor/weapon collecting, food/supplies collecting, and smithing (which was also present in the Lego Lord of the Rings game). These features really add to the gameplay, giving you an additional reward beyond money for every bush, tree, boulder, or piece of furniture you smash. The mining feature is not the easiest to use, however, since it relies on really precise timing and an instantly responsive controller. But it still isn't impossible to collect all the elements you need to complete the quests or smith the various items.\n\nIf you enjoy any of the Lego games, I would highly reccommend this one. Like I said, it's like Skyrim, but Lego. 10/10 for Lego Hobbit.","November 28, 2015","true","152.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like they ran out of funding 3/4 of the way through production and shipped what they had.\n\nLego: The Hobbit is not a bad game by Lego game standards - it has continued to progress the formula, including the 'build minigame' from the Lego Movie game, adding team-up attacks between some characters and a resource mechanic (which perpetuates the grind, but is new nonetheless).\n\nWhat this game -doesn't- have is an ending. It just stops after one mission with no conclusion to the plot, then the credits roll. That's it. Now go do the other 75% of the game that is open-world challenges and fetch-quests. You might think the character roster is up to par, but in reality 50% of the listed characters are just alternate costumes - they are no longer stacked per-character like the Harry Potter games - which also leads to having two of the same character in play at once.\n\nLego games are no stranger to bugs, but this is the first game that I've had multiple encounters with game-ending bugs. Be it being permamently stuck in an animation, the fast-travel eagle freezing in mid-air or the forging mini-game being incompleteable. These are not crashes, but event chains simply not working and requiring the game to be quit and restarted. There are also numerious examples of the game temporarily freezing or slowing down, but these don't end the game.\n\nMany other people have said it, so I'll be breif. This game is unfinished. It has polish, the gameplay is as it has ever been, the world is expansive and there certainly isn't a shortage of things to do, but it feels as though the filler content vastly outweighs the structured content, as there are a number of abilities and character-types that simply do not appear in the main story, and only become accessable after you finish what story there is.\n\nIn short, there are better Lego games out there, and better ones will be coming, so you're better off getting one that feels like it's all there.","November 23, 2015","false","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's enjoyable, well-paced, exciting and fun with a very diverse cast of lego characters and a nice range of levels and backdrops. the game LOOKS great - even the lego pieces have shadows and effects on them, and they really feel a part of the enviroment.\n\nThe sound design is also great, the voice acting is nice if a little repetative (excluding the narrator, who never gets boring) and the music is well-selected, and with one of the red bricks, you can even make the music more "retro".\n\nThe world is massive, suprisingly, and there's a ton of stuff to do from solving puzzles to find bricks or helping people out for the same reason. turning in one of the mithril items you have forged to someone gives you a red brick, a special extra item that gives you a bonus - while not consuming the item itself.\n\nHowever the game does have flaws.\n\nBecause of the treasure system, allowing your character to equip [retty much everything in the game - characters have a problem with not feeling unique or needed. The only TRULY needed character is Saruman and Sauron, as they have specific functions exclusive to them that can only be unlocked through mithril treasure items.\n\nCurrency is also fairly worthless. The problem with studs is, because everything is so cheap, it's almost pointless to grind for money at all - even Sauron, the most unique and one of the most useful characters, costs just 75,000 studs - less than one full missions worth, in certain missions.\n\nThe game also has some notable performance issues. The game will sometimes lag massively, crash and bug out - and it's for some reason incompatible with windows Aero despite coming out in 2014.\n\nFinally, the big characters like the trolls and the ork beserker are pointless. they're only used in the overworld, they can't be used in ANY level, and they only serve as yet ANOTHER mechanic to restrict the player and for no reason either! I do like the trolls design and the idea of using them but, because of the sheer lack of need for them (seriously there's like five things they can interact with) they serve almost no purpose. The game has so MANY mechanics that it dilutes the game severely as a result. Fewer mechanics with a smaller roster, even a mission or two less, would've felt a lot better.\n\nI really enjoyed Lego: The Hobbit, but it;'s not a game i'd reccomend completing. Almost your entire game will be doing the quests, which wil start fun and end up an annoying mess. Buy it, have fun with it, but don't complete it unless you're fine with the above points.","May 11","true","50.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That means it ends rather abruptly at a cliffhanger, just like the second movie did. Given that story mode is only part of the gameplay, with the greater world of puzzles still being good value, I'm almost willing to overlook this fact.\n\nWhat I can't ignore, however, is that some of the world puzzles are buggy or outright broken. Some can be played around, others cannot - in particular the Mithril Megapult schematics puzzle. This one is completely unobtainable for me due to a bug with the cave door it hides behind; it is a well-known bug, and none of the workaround suggestions I've found have fixed the issue I'm having. That means I'll never be able to actually complete the game, and that makes me feel cheated even more than the 'only two of three movies' story mode bit does.\n\nAll in all, a decent game brought down by some really annoying flaws. Given the title's age, I don't think it likely they'll ever be fixed, which is a pity.","April 30","false","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Side characters are bad tho)\n-RPG hoarders heaven, you collect tons of studs (currency), mithril bricks, etc. (Kinda like Ratchet and Clank)\n-Unlockables at every turn. Seriously, constant new character unlocks and such. Loads of content. LOADS.\n-FAST TRAVEL IS SO CONVINIENT, like for real. Select, choose a spot with an eagle statue, done.\n-Splitscreeeeeeeen.\n\n_/Cons\_\n-AWFUL camera movement.\n-Disorienting splitscreen splitting. (Particularly using menus)\n-Gets grindy after about 70% completion. (Farming remaining mithril blocks, red blocks, etc.)\n-All the fun content is SEVERELY hard to discover. I didn't know about so much until the end of the completion.\n-Glitch heaven, though I want to note that any glitches are very minor as the autosave feature kicks butt.","May 2","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really disappointing, so only buy this game when it's on sale super cheap because it isn't worth the full freaking price.

I'm currently at 52% of total completion, and its a fun pastime after the story mode to go around by yourself or with a friend to try to find all the secrets! It's helpful that if you have only one steam controller, one person can play on the controller and  the other on the keyboard. The thing I don't like is that to achieve 100% completion, you have to buy all of the DLC.","June 6","true","55.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
