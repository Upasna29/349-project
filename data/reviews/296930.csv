The game gets progressively more challenging the further you progress and health power-ups are very limited.\n- Combat strategy is thankfully very complex and features parries, counters, and numerous different attack combinations\n- This supports the notion that when the player perishes it is due to their poor play strategy and not the game’s design\n- Progression is similar in method to Risk of Rain, where different characters with different abilities are unlocked by performing certain feats in a play-through\n- I would be remiss not to mention the beautifully colorful artwork and animation that Ascendant contains. A cell-shaded “nature” themed design creates a vibrant and living game world\n- Treasure and loot are bountiful, if the player survives long enough, and contain weapons, currency, stat boosts, spells, and Blessings.\n- The latter of which are really unique and can change how the player continues their play-through\n- Each unlock or new item picked up is logged in a “journal” that describes each item in detail\n- Two-player local coop is a blast and can create some very fun “juggling” mechanics between the two players, plus exploring this beautiful game world with a friend (or child) is exciting\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Lack of networked coop is an extreme bummer. This game is a fantastic experience when shared with another person and to limit it to local multiplayer only is a shame. I understand that the coding required would be difficult, but to be able to play Ascendant with a long-distance friend over Steam would keep it in my library permanently.\n- The User-Interface and presentation could be much more intuitive. A couple examples:\n- The aforementioned unlock “journal” is difficult to navigate as it is tab-based with a full page for each item. This makes it difficult to quickly get to the player’s latest unlock to view it. While there is a copious amount of information for each item/blessing it would have been much cleaner to put them in an icon spreadsheet format which expanded when clicked on. Would potentially have been easier to identify the “new” unlocks too.\n- I may be nit-picking, but transitioning around the game menu is clunky and could be streamlined. Any time the player is returned to the parent title menu the logo animation plays again, which is brief and pretty but can wear on the player the more they navigate the menu.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nYes. The local coop testing I mentioned earlier was based on my play sessions with my 8 year old son. Game violence is on-par with Super Smash Bros. and while the combat strategy is complex, it is also easy to pick up and button mash while still enjoying yourself. We had a blast!\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nNot yet – as mentioned earlier this game is quite difficult and will take awhile for someone to complete all the seasons. I did, however, unlock a handful of characters and greatly enjoyed doing so in my many hours of gameplay.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\nAscendant is a remarkable game that blends together the best parts of a brawler and a rogue-like. Fans of either genre would be doing themselves a disservice by not picking this up. The unique art style and complex mechanics create an unmatched robust gaming experience among a sea of “me too” rogue-likes and PDLs.

No run will ever be same, and there is quite a bit of variation in the layouts every time. This game offers consistent challenge, but with variation every run. And that is the mark of a good rogue-like.\n\nHere's a quick look video of the game if you want to see it in action and what it has to offer. Or if you'd rather read something more concise, just read the review below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/pb_gYupS07s\n\nI'll first begin by explaining the basic mechanics of this game. You play as your selected magic swordsman that's able to slash down foes, launch them with a hard swing Guacamelee style, or fire magic at them. You continue doing this until you reach the boss of the randomly generated dungeon, who can also change every run. If you manage to beat them, then you progress to the next part of the season, or to the next season if you already did so. Each new progression brings a harder challenge than the last with enemies that behave differently and are generally tougher.\n\nBut what makes that so good? It's the way each run feels like something new and the way the game still makes you feel like you're making progression. There's always some new weapon, spell, item, blessing or spirit that you'll come across and want to experiment with, the blessing being the most unique of the bunch. You'll only get them by defeating a boss, and where you equip them (body, sword, or magic) will offer you different boons that change the way way you play. And when you start progressing farther into the game, you'll probably be combining several together to make something that's really interesting and fun to do. I once found blessings that allowed me to slowly fall while casting and that enabled projectiles to bounce off walls. I then stumbled upon a spell that consistently fired off random projectiles every .1 seconds. Needless to say, the mayhem that ensued was a blast.\n\nBut let's break down a few negatives this game comes with.\n*A lot of people may be turned off by the fact it looks like a flash game. A lot of games don't get the chance they deserve because of this.\n*While there is a decent number of enemies that fight differently, a lot of them are simple reskins of others. I would've liked to see different mobs. And it would've also made it less confusing how to handle something when I found melee mobs that that now shot projectiles.\n*Sometimes the random nature can be a bit too harsh. I once had a run where I found 3 keys to enter a shop, but I coudn't for the life of me find money to spend in them. Another time was when I consistently found hearts when I didn't need them, but when I actually did, I hovered on half of one for the longest time until I finally died. There should be some sort of mechanic that favors a certain outcome based on your current state.\n*There's no story at all. While I personally don't mind, some people like a reason behind what they're doing, even if it is something simple like saving the world or your girlfriend.\n\nNow if you can look past those negatives, you'll find a game that's challenging, fun, and even comes with local co-op if you want to bring a bud along. Even when you die, which will probably be often, you'll keep coming back for more and gradually get better. Why is that? Because the game feels fair for the most part. If you got hit, it's because you messed up and didn't dodge or parry in time. There's a high skill-ceiling in this game, and it's satisfying when you're beginning to breeze past the early levels that once gave you once heck of a challenge.\n\nSo to sum up, I recommend this game to all who like challenge. You're going to get exactly that here, and it'll feel like a fresh experience every time.","May 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","0"

The game is artistically beautifully, the characters are unique and offer variation to the gameplay, and the bosses are fun and rewarding. If you like risk of rain or rogue legacy, you will enjoy this game and if you arent a fan, you should become one because this game is great. The game also has an excellent coop (local only) mode and youll likely get more fun out of the two player experience. I've only played it briefly so far, but I think this game is a top contender in its genre. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: I've now beaten the game with every character and I can still say that the game is extremely enjoyable. Each run has been very unique and it feels great to stomp the last boss a couple of times. I highly recommend this game.\n\nEdit 2: Check out the wiki for help with bosses or anything else.

The BGM is gorgeous, no two ways about it.  Vibrant without being twee, atmospheric without devolving into sonic punctuation, Ascendant is an aboslute delight to listen to.\n\nIt's a shame it's not such a delight to play.  The combat is well-executed, if with a somewhat steep learning curve.  In fact, in my first hour or two of play, I found myself wondering why there are so few action-platformers with such fun and engaging combat.  Then you start to notice that the power-ups you're unlocking don't really appear very much, that most of the pots you're smashing (yes, I know) are empty, and that using that cool combat engine in an engaging way is just going to end up with you doing sooner and having to start the whole process over again.  There is very little variety in enemy or level-chunk design on a level by level basis, and it all soon starts to feel less like a game and more like a chore.\n\nI feel like someone of my near-OCD-levels-of-completionism should absolutely love this, but I just don't.  Perhaps if there was more actual platforming (where, at the risk of sounding conceited, I do have the skills) I would find it more engaging, but the platforming is simply window dressing for the fighting, which is a shame, because the fighting is very, very good.  The platforming however, is not even at the level of Rogue Legacy, and certainly nowhere near Strider, Guacamelee or any of the 2D Castlevania games.  I'm not going to say I don't enjoy it at all, because I do, but only in short spurts.  It doesn't have the ability to keep me pinned to my chair for hours the way, to pick an example of a 2D action-platformer on Steam, Valdis Story: Abyssal City did.  I believe Hapa Games should be rewarded and encouraged for the stunning art, beautiful soundtrack and inspired fighting mechanics of this game, and reservedly recommend it on those grounds.  But caveat emptor; this game might not be for you.","September 28, 2014","true","5.7"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VoidInsanity/recommended/296930/","VoidInsanity","VoidInsanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VoidInsanity/","264 products in account","#Intro\nI am not much of a rewiwer, more of an analyst. This review is based on experience both with the game and the genre, at the time of writing sunk 40-50 hours into this game. I will not play a bad game for 40 minutes let alone 40 hours. If you are a fan of the genre buy it, game is excellent. If you would like a more detailed reasoning behind why keep reading, there wil be very very minor gameplay/story spoilers as it is impossible to talk about certain mechanics of the game without referencing them.\n\n#Plot\nThe plot of the game is simple. You are a Demi-god, There is a God, Overthrow the God, Become the new god. Each Demi-god has its own story and reasons for wanting to be God. The level structure is similar to Binding of Issac, there are multiple floors in groups of two with semi randomly generated rooms between you and the boss of each floor. Every odd numbered floor has a random boss from a select pool of possible bosses for that floor, and every even numbered floor has that levels guardian which is the same every time but there are two possible variations of it. Each boss is a challenge in its own right and each has its own set of attacks, attack paterns, weaknesses to exploit and most have multiple phases. Some are more challenging than others and some can end up being trivial if RNGesus loves you but personally that is half the fun.\n\n#Combat\nBefore I begin I will say the game has an excellent Tutorial that covers pretty much everything I am about to cover. If you buy this game play the tutorial, it is not boring and gets straight to the point.\n\nCombat boiled down is - Attacks, launch attacks, Magic Attacks, Parry and evasion. You may also occassionally find a 1 use items called Breaths which offer numberous effects for the room you are in. Most are combat focused but for the most part you'll be depending on either your weapons or magic to clear the path between you and the next room. Attacking an enemy with either magic of spells will also do stagger damage. Stagger damage is a separate  health bar of sorts. Once an enemy has taken enough stagger damage they will glow yellow allowing you to use a launch attack to send them flying across the screen taking massive damage and doing massive damage to anything they collide with. Its a very simple mechanic and very satisfying. Feels very meaty especially if you are able to stagger and ping a larger foe across the room. For survival you can dash left or right through enemy attacks and flank them or parry the attack sending them flying (or in the case of projectiles reflects them). Timing is key, you'll have to be rather skilled at the game to successfully pull it off especially in the late game or against certain bosses but using the room to your advantage is also a viable tactic, You don't have to parry or dash through attacks, you can always jump over, run away, lure foes out of position among other things. It is very well done.\n\nAs for what you'll encounter there is quite a bit of enemy variety but you will not notice it at first since each season is tiered. The first season will always have a mix of melee flies, Grunts, mage grunts, worm brawlers, worm hitters and suicide grunts, The next season will expand this roster adding elite versions ontop of new enemy types with their own elite versions. Many enimes especially later ones are a challenge in their own right and their mere presence can change the whole way you tackle the room. You may also encounter one of many many possible event rooms which range from being ambushed, blessing themed obstacle courses, mini games, gambling and straight up "Here is a awersome free thing, have fun". You won't know until you enter what it is and it took me around 20-25 hours of playing until I was finally able to experience all of them. Adds a lot of depth to each floor if you decide to explore them especially if they are locked costing you a valuable key.\n\n#Progession\nEvery playable Deity in this game (7 in total) has its own strengths/weaknesses which cater to certain playstyles which you'll disvoered as you unlock them. Every floor has at least 1 item room and a shop. Items rooms contain 1 gold chest either locked or unlocked which can provide you with high level stat boosts, breaths, weapons, a chunk of influence (the shop currency) or something else that I won't spoil. Shops on each floor are always locked and always have 4 items for sale and are one of the few ways to get a new spell. Each spell replaces your magic attack with a new one which can range from tripple shots to spread fire or mines.\n\nThere are two levels of passives in this game. First are spirits which are straight up passives, you pick them up and you get a bonus. There are 57 to collect in all and most have a chance of appearing on weapons you'll find to. There is no limit to the amount of passives you can get and they pretty much all stack flawlessly naby offering very cool interactions with each other. Bklessings are the second teir of passive in the game and each Deity can only hold a limited number at a time but they are very powerful. Blessings are rewards for beating the levels boss and can be placed into 1 of 3 body slots augmenting your attacks, magic or passively. Each blessing has its own unique effect depending on where you socket and they all interact with each other. 21 blessings with 63 passives in total to discover and many many combinations and synergies to experiment with. Because of how potent blessings are they will shape your run meaning no two runs end up the same but that should go without saying, its the whole point of the genre.\n\n#Conclusion\nOverall the game is fantasic and a must have if you are a fan of the genre. There is a lot of depth to be had but it will require a little investment since you will have to learn encounters and most likely need to unlock new items before you are able to get a successful completion. It does have a few balance niggles mainly when you encounter a room with multiple shielded enemies which will be very intimidating at first but apart from that the game is paced very well and is very rewarding to play and much more than a simple 1 button combat system that is the fault of many other games in this genre.\n\n#Verdict= Highly Recommended\nThanks to Totalbiscuit for his WTF is...? coverage of this game. If not for him this game would have completely flown under my radar as I am sure it flew under yours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mar3usmc/recommended/296930/","mar3usmc","mar3usmc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mar3usmc/","235 products in account","After about 12 hours in the game here are my thoughts.\n\nInitially I really liked the game.  However, as time past here are the things that have really bothered me and why I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nThere are boss fights that are near impossible to beat unless you are set up just right to beat them.  i.e. luck.  e.g.  Furthest I have gone after 12 hours of play time is late fall.  On the last run I met the son of something and he had an invulnerability shield.  That shield was up about 80% of the time.  No way I could beat him with all the spam he puts out.\n\nVery few people have beaten the game.  Simply put, if only 3% of players are beating your game on normal mode that is a design problem, NOT a player problem.  That 3% is probably attributed mostly to sheer luck, as I am sure it is well within the margin of error for luck in this game considering out random it is.  There are some, what I call, cheap mechanics, in the game, such as that invulnerability shield, or bouncing fire/acid in very tight spaces that can't be destroyed.  Things such as that, are why players die, and also why they give up on the game.  They feel cheated.  For the most part, I like how the levels themselves playout, but I find the boss fights tedious and quite boring, not to mention in some cases cheap.\n\nI would have loved to just see the game as one big tower perhaps, continous in nature, with no boss fights, or perhaps more well thought out bosses.  As it is now I am going to put this one down for a while, and put it under my in development category where it belongs.  I just find the first two parts, Spring early and late, too boring to trudge through over and over again after I die.  There are much better roguelikes out there, with much better balance (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, FTL, Risk of Rain, SotS The Pit, etc....).\n\nI really hope there are future updates to the game that address the issues I mention.  The game has great potential, but I just can't consider this game as finished as the balance is way off (reward/accomplishment system is also near nonexistant).\n\nAdditional Later Review (20141129)\n\nNow 40 hours into this game, and I have beaten it on normal now with all but Midas and the last guy you unlock (forget his name).  I still stand by much of this review.\n\nWhile I actually like the game a bit more now, having gotten really good at parrying many attacks and learned all the boss patterns, and with the additional unlocks making the game difficulty more acceptable, I still have to say that the game difficulty could use some refinement.\n\nI still find the invulnerability shields a horrible idea, and just a easy way to make boss fights harder instead of making the boss fights more interesting.  The boss fights imo are the weakest point of this game.  The last boss types (fighting another character, and that big guy after him), including the final boss are easier than some of the earlier bosses.  They need MAJOR refinement.  Open up the space, have a boss fight on a big area instead of an enclosed space, and use the environment more to make it interesting (spikes for example).\n\nThere is still not much of a risk/reward system in the game, and you are still forced to clear every room you enter (which is against the idea of the roguelike where you DON'T have to fight everything, and probably should not).\n\nSome epic weapons are just too epic, like the twig.  I mean, infinite mana, basically?!  I could see half or a quarter, but zero mana use?!   If you have any decent, not OP, but decent spell combo with twig it is basically game over, you win, unless you get really careless.\n\nSo yea, game still needs more refinement, and I do like the game, but I don't love it.  Sad part is that I want to love this game, but as pointed out above, some things about it just irritate the crap out of me.\n\n@Bluecard:  Perhaps you could come up with something more constructive, or maybe you are just a troll.\n\n@Karob:  I appreciate the comment, but well designed roguelikes, the ones that are succesful and actually have people who continue to play them because they are fun, have some level of structure within the game that tempers the randomness such that the extremes don't occur or occur very rarely.  I completely agree with the journey, not the destination statement.  Problem is I enjoy the journey of this game with moments of severe annoyance, not frustration or displeasure due to losing, but just being annoyed, mostly with the boss fights.  I win most all the boss fights, but I feel they take more away from the game then they give.  They feel forced, and feel like a very different play style from the rest of the game, the part that I actually enjoy.  I just want to enjoy the entire journey the game provides, not just some of it.  I think that can definitely be achieved with some rewrites of the boss fights as mentioned above.","November 6, 2014","false","55.1"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","44","64","0","6"

This game sets itself apart from other games in the genre with action/beat-em-up combat, but the moveset is quite small. Almost all the customization comes from spells and passive abilities, so don't buy this game expecting tons of synergies like Isaac. The combat takes some time to master despite how simple it is, and clearing rooms usually doesn't feel like it all depends on luck. Be warned that this game is difficult; barely anyone who bought it has finished it, and that's not due to the usual Steam mentality of buying games and never playing them.\n\nSadly, the boss battles are where most of the aforementioned things occur. Many of them are much too difficult to beat without a good build, and they are heavily scripted with frequent use of invincibility shields between phases. This essentially means that the player will be stuck dodging difficult attacks for several cycles if the game didn't give them a damaging build. They are frustrating to fight at best and annoying enough to make you not want to do repeated playthroughs at the worst.\n\nThe recent addition of an easier mode makes things more tolerable, but the bosses will still grate on the player's nerves. The unlocking system is standard for the genre, but the way the game is structured means that they don't keep you motivated to keep playing. Most of the unlockable items are in shops, which is rough since the player is pitted against the RNG of both getting enough money to buy the item, and actually having it appear in the shop. Still, this is a decent game for people who want a cheap roguelike that's not afraid to step out of the genre limitations. The developers have hinted at the possibility of more combat, so perhaps these issues will be ironed out eventually. Just don't come into this game expecting to finish it regardless of your experience of the genre, and things should be okay.\n\nOverall, this is an ambitious game for this genre that suffers due to that. Still, it's fun enough to warrant a purchase.","November 23, 2014","true","15.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Think The Binding of Isaac meets Dust and you'll have a good idea of what you're in for. The game's amateurish art and uninspired sound hardly make for the most aesthetically pleasing package, and the steep learning curve will probably lead some to shelve this one prematurely. If you can stick with the game, however, you'll find that it really is a solid platformer with some relatively deep RPG mechanics and an intelligent procedure for generating levels. This game's biggest problem is that it falls into the same trap that a lot of indie games that attempt to implement roguelike elements fall into: Luck trumps skill in a big way. Ascendant is tough, and like The Binding of Isaac, your odds of success are determined almost entirely by how lucky you got with treasure chests early on in the game. There's a lot going against this one, but it still manages to be a pretty good game.","March 20, 2015","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It has fun gameplay mechanics, where you're able to blink to attack enemies from afar, parry attacks, dash, etc., and I've never felt that at any point in time the mechanics in the game weren't important, since certain enemies move faster than your character making the blink important, parrying projectiles one-shots most enemies, and you can avoid enemy fire to get behind them with your dash. The unique positive and negative attributes separate this game from others in the same category, with one positive being a character heals upon boss kills, and a negative attribute for a character is upon picking up health, it has a low chance to fizzle to dust and do nothing. While this game is fun, it's only playable in short bursts due to the soundtrack. Although it fits the theme of the game, the music can detract some from wanting to play it, and because to that I give a warning to those who are easily bothered by repetition to not purchase this game.\n\nI also give a warning to those who are bothered by difficulty, as I personally have only been able to reach the ending credits on baby mode with only a half heart remaining, out of my very extensive health pool of at least 10 heart containers. The game is not a breeze, and should not be taken lightly at first glance.\n\nFor a quick list of all the pros and cons I can think of for people who enjoy those as well:\n\nPros:\n~Quick, exciting gameplay which always keeps you on your toes\n~Fun mechanics which always feel important to the flow of the game\n~Chests spawn after literally every room clear\n~Challenge rooms are generally challenging, but extremely rewarding\n~Unique character attributes\n~Many opportunities for improved weaponry and spells\n~Blessings give game-changing passive benefits, and almost never feel useless\n~Enemy patterns are easy to learn\n~Enemies are NOT immune to spikes\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive sountrack\n-Shields can make certain enemies extremely difficult to attack\n-Bosses have very few attack patterns\n-Certain bosses are extremely easy to dodge, while others are nearly impossible to\n-Specific spells feel unimportant and don't feel as though they work as intended\n-That god damn zypherus challenge room...","December 31, 2014","true","21.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

It is fast, fair but challenging and it feels great and very fluid. There is nothing like dashing towards an opponent hitting him two times knocking him away dashing after him and continue hitting him.\n\nOn top of that there is a huge amount of diffrent weapons, spells, spirits (passive effects) and blessings that you can put on your weapon armor or spells. These blessing also allow many diffrent character builds because depending where on your body you put them you get diffrent effects.\n\nIt has a great soundtrack, a huge amount of replayabilty and very well executed game mechanics.\n\nI really recommend this game to everyone that likes roguelites because this one is the best there is.\n","September 5, 2014","true","44.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It is a true rogue-like game where you can't just rush through maps while mowing down your enemies. You need to do so with careful planning, punch the right badasses and use them to your advantage to kick them towards any other enemies in your surroundings. The first few playthroughs will utterly destroy you and possibly your gamers ego but the more you play, the more you will learn from your previous mistakes.\n\nThe combat system in Ascendant has a nice mixture of melee attacks, ranged spells and dodge and parry attacks than can backfire ranged spells amongst other things to your enemies. Several combo's are prominent in the game and will require some getting used to. Once you're more familiar with the combat and the enemies themselves, you will venture further and further in the rooms, finding various blessings, breaths and weapons that will help you become a fierce but not unbeatable warrior. Luckily there's a shop where you can buy upgrades which uses the influence gained by treasure chests and enemies as a currency to become even stronger. Each new item you will find along the way will be kept in a log split into various categories. This log can be accessed in the main menu but also in the game itself which comes in handy if you want to know more about what powers the blessing, breaths or weapons beholds.\n\nThe replayability in Ascendant is absolutely brilliant as each playthrough will generate a complete new world, with new enemies in each room that are waiting for you. Other items such as the pots and chest will contain different bonuses and often the bosses you will need to face rotate. Each new adventure is a new challenge you have to face as death is final in this game. There are no checkpoints where you can restart from. That being said, the game is merciless and requires the player to have a serious amount of self-control while you study the enemies moves.\n\nVisually the game sets itself apart completely from various other titles in the same subgenre, a feature that will attract many players despite the steep learning curve of the game. It is said that the ancient power struggle between the demigods has begun once more and that is noticeable from the overall graphical features in the game. The characters you get to play share a resemblance to the ancient samurai's with various types of armor and colors. However, it may not be the characters themselves that stun you visually. The backgrounds that create the setting of each room will. The artistic landscapes are pleasing to your eyes and details are not left out. While Ascendant is a beat 'em up game, it is not filled with blood and gore. This makes it a perfect game to play local coop with your kids or your faint of heart friends.\n\nConclusion\nAscendant is the most brutal beat 'em up game that combines features from the brawlers and rogue-like games with elements from platformers. Visually the game is outstanding and the ancient Asian touch can give you a clear sense of the demigod that you supposedly are, if it wasn't for you constantly dying. Thanks to the procedurally generated environments, each playthrough is a complete new challenge. The game is extremely difficult and has a very steep learning curve that may leave you bitter for a while but you will find yourself going back to it sooner or later. Ascendant is a title you should have in your collection, especially if you are addicted to the rogue-like genre.","May 14, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For example the bosses are quite obnoxious as many of them have shields that make them invincible for a period of time while you get beaten senseless by them. Also some of them have attacks that are really hard to dodge. Another problem is that the game is just too difficult at times. There are a lot of enemeis and a lot of them have hard to dodge attacks. On their own its not too bad but when they are stacked up, you are bound to get hit. Add in the little amount of hearts the game gives you and the obnoxious bosses (where you generally get hurt the most) and you will find you die quite a lot.\n\nBut while those points hold the game back, I still had a lot of fun. The game always had me coming back for more because each run felt different and had me going further along in the game. I like the way you power yourself up by gaining blessings from beating bosses or buying them at the shop. Each blessing had a unique power depending on how you used it. Also the weapons were cool and each had a unique effect. I have heard that other people didn't like the controls too much and felt the combat is awkward, and I can't say I disagree, but it didn't ruin the fun for me. While both could be better, they work well enough to enjoy the game. I was originally put off on buying the game due to some of the negative reviews, but I ended up getting this game from a Humble Bundle, and I really enjoyed it. Overall, its a fun game and I do recommend it. It has its problems but if you are not very critical of games or are not too picky, you can learn to overlook them and have fun with what the game does right.","July 26, 2015","true","30.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The melee enemies aren't too tough because just using the light attack to weaken them then satisfyingly smashing them with the launch attack does the trick, but I find the projectile-launching enemies are all just stupidly unpredictable a-holes that make the game a frustrating mess of dodging and pinpoint counterattacking.\n\nLet me get one thing straight: The counterattack works. It DOES work, and is very satisfying when pulled off, but doing so is, to quote JonTron, "like trying to pull the addiction out of a heroin addict: HARD AND FRUSTRATING." The window of time on this counter is TINY. Teeny-tiny. You ever play Smash Bros. and find that the counterattack windows are rather short? Well, this game takes the window of time that someone like Marth would have and crushes it with a STEAMroller (get it?). We're talking probably 4-5 frames of counterattack availability. It's annoying when you're playing a game like this that has a lot of unpredictability in the enemy attack patterns, but to throw in a 5-frame counter window is just unecessarily cruel. The counter window CAN be expanded if you happen to find a 4-leaf clover under a blue moon while a shooting star flies over your head and somehow manage to get the enchantment that does so, but I only got that on one playthrough, and died because a projectile-using enemy knocked me into a pit of spikes and killed me, FANCY THAT.\n\nDon't get me wrong: this game IS fun, it's just hard. We're talking giant T-rex turds hard. Adamantium hard. The kind of hard that even a Metapod couldn't achieve and...yeah this metaphor is over.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, if you're the kind of person who's gotten good at avoiding things in Rogue Legacy, maintaining twitch reflexes in Hotline Miami, and love the roguelike item-collecting enhancement-gaining world of Binding of Isaac, this is your game. Oh yeah, and if you're one of those sadistic f***s that likes Dark Souls, get this game. You'll be (un)pleasantly surprised ;)\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nTL:DR This game is hard, get it if you like roguelikes that are hard and have fast reflexes.","February 26, 2015","true","17.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","4","5","4","0"

Navigation also isn't as straight-forward as one would like, but the maps make finding your way a lot easier.\n\nThere appears to be a wide variety of powerups and abilities that will make the replayability high.

It reminded me of "Binding of Isaac" in some areas and the customization possibilities you got when choosing where to place boss rewards on your character sheet made for interesting choices based on what kind of playstyle you wanted to try.\nDecent flow of combat, nice graphics and all in all it was a decent experience.\nAll of this comes to naught because of one feature in the game, though.\nEvent rooms.\nThere are some rooms that are "event rooms" where you get the chance for a reward if you do something. This could be a simple as jumping unto a pillar that stood in the middle of the room, to beat a swarm of enemies, to feed a hungry shark or to... get killed by spikes.\nActually, the last one is the effect and not the actual event. It sums up to the same thing, though. With one roll of the die, when you enter the room everything you did up till that point is nullified ("the room strips you from your powers"), so your customization and choices doesn't matter. Furthermore, it's not a matter of 'beat this challenge', but 'how long time do you want to spend in this room before suffering the inescapable death'. These 'event spike rooms' stand for the 'instant death' mechanics we should have left in the dark ages, even though the game tries to shine them up as 'hard challlenges'. The end result is the same. your choices and good gameplay before you entered the room doesn't matter and you won't get past the room.\n\nThis was especially annoying when a game session is not a "quick thing" but something that can take hours. Hours of playing well and customization thrown away at the roll of a die. That's not good gameplay.\n\nMy suggestion: Find another roguelike that actually feels rewarding without these 'instant death' rooms.","March 9","false","4.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

For me, is a mix between Binding of isaac and Dust: An Elysian Tail, two of my favourite indie games.\n\nI didn't have this feeling of descovering items, seeing cool combos and customizing randomly your character since the first time I played Isaac.\n\nAscendant is a hard game and I really liked this. You can have an unbelievable start, go to the 3rd world with overpowered stats and powers and you will die if you don't play good. You can go to single stages called events with random stuff happening. For example, you will have to pass a test of skill, with particular skills like double dashing or double jump. Or you will have a free weapon to pick but when you do it, tough enemies will appear. So even if you are strong you can die if you do mistakes.\n\nBosses are hard too. You will need to memorize their attacks and skills, and even if you are overpowered as hell, their shields,  environment or their particular mechanics will kill you. So this is a game in which you have to play perfectly and don't be over-confident because you got incredible stats.\n\nThe items system is really fun too. It's random with some choices. When you kill a boss, or sometimes on events or randomly, you will get something called blessings. Blessings are like runes that you put on your armor, weapon or magic. Every character (there are 2 to start and you can unlock 5 more) has a different number of slots. For example 2 weapon slots, 2 armor slots and 1 magic slot. So a single blessing can be a burning effect if you put it on the weapon,  an explosion when hit on armor and spell explosion on magic. This way you can have totally different characters every time you start a new game depending on the blessings that you get on game and the choices you make. I only saw like 10 blessings and I could do really cool combos.\n\nSo with all the blessings you can unlock, the 1-use items, magics, weapons with their own skills and stats, and the 57 spirits (passive skills like money = damage, low player gravity, low shop prices...) you will play a different game every time you start again. The possibilities are huge.\n\nRecommended 100%","May 17, 2014","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a huge variety of weapons, spells, upgrades, and passives, replay ability is massive. Learning just unlocking everything in the game at least once will take 20+ hours to complete (depending on skill level). The combat in this game is simplistic but feels nice; being able to dodge attacks, parry, use spells, and with the added ability to send weak enemies flying as projectiles for massive damage, pulling off massive battles become very challenging but never unbeatable. Bosses in the game are fun to fight and require many different ways of killing them, With the launching mechanic being a mainstay in many fights.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a challenge, Rogue-lite, or Beat-em-ups.

It might actually turn me into a Rogue-lite fan if a game can keep up with this level of quality.\n\n- Every playthrough is unique and different. I didn't realize random procedural type maps could be fun along with the vast unlockable content to discover.\n\n- Graphics / Audio are beautiful and unique. As soon as I heard the music at the title screen, I immediately felt intrigued in the discovery that awaited me.\n\n- This game is difficult (depending on the boss) for newcomers in the Rogue-lite genre, but it still feels simple enough to pick up and learn due to the beat-em up style of play. If you are a gamer looking for challenge (ie: Dark Souls / Shovel Knight) in a platform environment, do check it out.\n\n- Customizable key controls almost made or broke the game for me, due to my gamepad driver support in Linux being quite lacking. I would request from the developer to allow double key tap for directional dashing. Currently the way I have my keys setup is using my left hand for actions and right hand on the num pad for movement / misc keys. Feels a bit difficult without a controller but it isn't unplayable.","January 4, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That having been said, I'm going to delve into the negatives.  I honestly feel pretty mixed about it.\n\nUnlike Rogue Legacy, there are no real permanent passives that make you stronger as you do runs. The main thing unlocked throughout runs are descriptions of certain buffs/passive slots that are unknown until equipped/picked up. The problem with that is that you may reach a point where you  are capped by skill and can no longer advance and the game won't do anything to assist you unless you get lucky.\n\nThe biggest problem with this model is... the game is too difficult to support it. This game either needs to be toned down in difficulty, or introduce permanent bonuses that will help you if you find yourself stuck.\n\nI wouldn't normally feel this way if I thought that you could beat it using skill, but honestly I feel pretty skill capped.  I ended up beating Baby Mode and while it was rewarding, it was also pretty frustrating to a fault. To beat Baby Mode, I had to choose Ghat, get fairly lucky with drops, and play extremely scared. It's not a good sign when you have to resort to using primarily long range skills to snipe baddies that are off screen in order to maintain your health just to possibly beat Baby Mode.\nOften times when I need hearts I'll get keys and when I need keys I'll get hearts. It's an issue that is exacerbated by the difficulty, the lack of drops, and the inability to gain hearts back easily.\n\nThe combat is nice, but it is overshadowed by the difficulty. I want to fight close, but it's a lot riskier and attacking is somewhat clunky. During an attack animation you will not be able to move, essentially locking you into place. If you swing and miss, there will likely be a follow up attack since you are spamming the attack button, and you probably will be punished for it. The melee swing requires you to be pretty precise too, so it's not very forgiving.\n\nI had fun with this game but it's too frustrating an experience to continue further with no real progression.\nSuggestions for the dev:\nImplement positive progression in the form of stat buffs that persists through death.\nReduce the difficulty of the game's 3 modes. (More drops, lower boss's damage/hp)\n\n","November 27, 2014","false","18.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/296930/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","I don’t really have anything to preface this with other than I ended up being disappointed. Let’s get going.\n\nI – Story [1/10]\n\nAscendant is a roguelike platformer from Hapa Games. The story is as follows: you (the player) assume the role of a demigod who has taken it upon his/herself to invade the realm controlled by your rivals. And that’s all she wrote folks. The premise is decent I suppose, but that premise is all there is.\n\nII – UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface isn’t bad. Health and mana are clearly displayed in the top left corner of the screen. The minimap is located in the top right and, to be fair, is one of the better minimaps I’ve seen in a game lately. It has multiple view styles and the game cycles through them automatically to best suit your needs. This feature was probably my favorite thing about the game as a whole. The menus were good and I had no trouble navigating around them.\n\nIII – Gameplay [3/10]\n\nDespite the gameplay being rather solid for the most part, Ascendant gets old in a hurry. Puzzle solving, a staple aspect of platformers, is weak and scarcely found. The combat is okay.  You’ll cycle through the same few attack animations by mashing either attack button. One is a direct attack and the other can catapult your enemies across the screen in a direction of your predetermination. The magic ability the player has at their disposal is boring. It only has one function and  that is to shoot a projectile in any direction you want. On top of this, while you can parry enemy attacks, it’ll be a cold day in Hell before you can get the timing down.\n\nThere is no persistent upgrade system and the game institutes permadeath. You can take this to mean that every time you die (which may or may not be often) you’ll be starting from scratch. While that doesn’t generally bother me in most roguelike games, it started to irk me after a time in this one.\n\nLevels and items found in the levels are also randomly generated. When done correctly, this is my favorite thing about any given roguelike game, but it almost felt like that was broken in Ascendant. Levels varied slightly, but enemies became overly familiar (especially finding the same bosses repeatedly life after life) and finding the same items over and over. It was unimpressive to say the least.\n\nIV – Content [8/10]\n\nAscendant has a lot of content. Whether you will see it all is iffy, but it is there. There are about 16 different weapons to find/unlock during the course of the game. There were a lot of enemy types, but you may not see many of them. There was even close to 100 other items, which was a decent amount for a game such as this. Also, you had the ability to unlock other characters to play as; reach having their own pros and cons. Although the random generation seems to tamper with the content appearances, I can’t really fault the content itself.\n\nV – Visual [9/10]\n\nThe art of Ascendant was, initially, what grabbed my attention when it came to the game. The graphics are very stylized and unique. It really makes it standout in the genre. The environments can be a bit homely at times, but I was never left wanting with character and enemy designs.\n\nVI – Audio [1/10]\n\nA final weak link in the chain, the music of Ascendant was very much disappointing. While it does change, it’s very quiet and easily drowned out by the sounds of combat and various other sound effects. It also becomes repetitive very quickly. If you were looking for an aural pleasure, you came to the wrong place.\n\nVII – Overall [5.3/10]\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t waste my time with this one. I’m glad I got it out of a Humble Bundle and that I didn’t for over the entire price tag.","February 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately the controls are floaty and imprecise, and combat often feels unfair when you have almost no time to react to offscreen damage. The game is hard, but unnecessarily so. Gamepad support is very poor. The game decided to disable my controller once a game had already begun, and the escape key only opened and closed the menu, forcing me to alt-f4. Upon deleting the game's settings in the registry, the keys remapped themselves to a sensible layout for reasons unknown.\n\nIt seems to be on the verge of a very fun and rewarding experience, but the gameplay demands responsive and crisp controls that are sadly absent. This is especially apparent in the challenge rooms that demand precise movement. Games like Valdis Story do it much, much better.","January 16, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat system is fun at its core, and I like the way it gives you slightly more control over your items than some games, but repetition kills it. You're forced to kill the same enemies so many times that it becomes hollow--especially since you can almost always pick them off a few at a time, and 75% of enemies in every room are either flies or normal grunts. And you're forced to replay the same levels over because the difficulty is very high. And there's not enough bosses either, so you'll face the same ones almost every run; nor are the bosses remotely balanced against each other (one of the early bosses you can kill unscratched on your first try, another one is ludicrously difficult even with great items and a full health bar).\n\nProduction values don't help it--the soundtrack and graphics are both totally forgettable, and you will get bored of the appearance of the early levels very quickly.\n\nIt's plainly, painfully obvious that this game is trying to be The Binding Of Isaac as a sidescroller.

This game gives you simple skill-based combat, platforming which is mostly easy, and the power of gods from around the world.  It has a unique vibrant art style and amazing soundtrack to support the theme of a demigod fighting to become a god.  There are 21 different gods and 3 ways to use each of their powers.  There are also 7 different characters to choose from which all require different play styles.  You unlock the ability to find more blessings, spirits, weapons, and spells as you discover more and defeat more bosses.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is a lack of indication as to how to progress in the fight against a certain boss.  I actually had to search the forums for how to make it come out of its shell so I could hit it.\n\nOverall, Ascendant is a pretty solid game with a lot of replayability through the blessings and character variety.  I would highly recommend this game to fans of rogue-lites, mythology, and challenging games.","May 15, 2015","true","333.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mix of a hacky slashy brawler, but with rouge lite elements. Yes, it's a rouge lite, not like, nerds. At first this mix seemed odd, but so does Kayne West and Kim Kardastian, so i guess it's fine then. The fighting system is fairly simple, click right here, click left there, fling bodies everywhere. The fling bodies everywhere thing is rather unquie to this game, because it has a big focus on juggling baddies, which leads to some moments where you inpale bad guys on spikes. The game is like kirby where it looks cute and lighthearted on the surface it's actually kinda messed up in way, when you send a black bugaboo suicide bomber into his black bugaboo friends, and everyone is blown to bits, and hanging from spikes. It's almost like social commentary, this game should be rated M. Theres also loads of loot you can find, like items, perks, potions, weapons, and power ups, which is a must in rouge LITE game like this. If i have to complain it's that there arent many weapons in the game, and the items don't very the gameplay that much, but it's still fun. It's got great charm, music, combat, a pretty wide selection of charchters to unlock and play as, and plenty of violent ways to kill stuff if your a sadist....or actually liked Haterd.

It incorporates brawler mechanics that keeps the player engaged and consistantly interested; to me it is stronger then the likes of Binding of Isaac, gameplay wise.\n\nThe game also succeeds Aesthetically aswell. I was introduced to ancient mythology through picture books and games like Age of Mythology as a kid. These normally carried with them a more classical interpretation of ancient myth that I've grown accustomed to, with mythical creatures portrayed in a more literal sense, and ancient Gods being represented by rennaissance-inspired, realistic portraits.  However Ascendant tackles it's mythology theme in an abstract way that reminds me of Greek Pottery; grande, fantastic tales brought to life with minimal capabilities... and I think it works. The myths of Theseus and Gilgamesh in this game FEEL mythical.\n\nAside from that, the effort that went into this game oozes out of everything. The Mythological refrences are often abstract and exotic; until playing this game I had never heard of Kamohoalii (The Shark God of Hawaii), or even the existence of an Irish pantheon of dieties which is well represented in this game. Even the tooltip descriptions of blessings and characters are poetic and well written. Clearly the developers put alot of time aside to touch up on the little things and make everything about this game worthy of the players time.\n\nThe only real criticisms I have is that the soundtrack, whilst suiting the visuals most of the time, is repetitive and lacking in variety. Also, the Boss variety is severely lacking. The designs for bosses like The Burrower and The Maw and unique bosses like that are exceptional, but the majority of the bosses are just superstrong versions of regular mobs in the game. Boss rooms being a big part of the game, the lack of variety easily halfs replayability for people who don't have the patience to wait for Son of Grunty's shield to go down for the millionth time.\n\nOverall, I think this game, as a first title, is perfect. There isn't anything missing, and what is there is expertly crafted. That, to me, warrants a sequel with funding that allows for the extreme variety this game deserves.","July 29, 2015","true","45.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I entered the game, confronted with a menu, went trough a tutorial, then the game started. What (or who) is the character?. The game feels hollow and empty, almost without a story. I found the graphics colorful, but dull. The scenarios are not attractive at all, a lot of colorful tree like structures with some lines, but they don't seem alive. Why in the world are you running in this forest killing grunts and those strange flying things?. The music kind of "meh", but repetitive. As someone reviewed, it's forgettable.\n\nAfter playing Guacamelee (in all this forms), I found this game be quite similar (beat em up, colorful, a lot of enemies), but lacks humour, variety and charm. Contrary to Guacamelee, the rooms are randomly generated, and harder, but it's not enough for wanting me to go back if there's no motivation behind.\n\nYeah, I know, I played for less than an hour (probably half an hour). With a enormous backlog, I couldn't find any reason to play more time to see if the game get better. It's strange when you see all the praise (126 positive reviews), but well, maybe makes sense playing more time.\n\nTL; DRBoring, repetitive, hollow and the art forgettable.","December 26, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
