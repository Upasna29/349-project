It's a bit like if the Worms type genre and SSB had a baby. The developer is responsive, nice, and considers ideas and feedback from the community. You can't really go wrong with a purchase here!\n\n======================================\nPros:+ Graphics: Simple but detailed with a vibrant color palette and good effects.\n+ Sound: Fun sound effects match up beautifully with the attacks and animations.\n+ Variety: Multiple maps, gamemodes, and offline/online play to keep things interesting.\n+ UI: The menus are actually quite beautiful.\n+ Gameplay: Frenetic and beautiful. I've had SO many unexpected laughs.\n+ Diversity: Multiple playstyles are possible, from aerial bombing, siege mode bombardments, flying rushes, and vanilla missiles.\n+ Multiplayer: Seems reliable, have run into few to no latency issues.\n\nCons:- Controls: I find it quite strange that the buttons to enter and exit a game versus continue an exit an existing game are reversed.\n- Controls v2: Moving around with a control is so much easier, with an analog stick. WASD is clumsy because it's only A and D, and I am used to using them respectively, IE: A to move down/light when on the right side of a planet.\n- Menu: Currently can't access invite friends button with a controller. (Will be fixed.)\n\nNeutral:± None.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Hello and welcome to this review of Moonshot! A game where you pilot tanks in space, attempting to repeatedly kill your opponents with missiles and bombs. Moonshot has a simple concept and simple gameplay, with some added elements and great execution to make it really shine, so let's talk about how it plays.\n\nGameplay:There are several gamemodes planned for Moonshot, and a few already present with Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Last Man Standing. With two other potential gamemodes I know of in the works, Online/Lan functionality, and AI matches, you'll have tons of options for how and who you want to play with.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, once you get the controls down, you have a flying tank that can fly in the direction you point it, drop 3 aerial bombs once you have been flying long enough to transform, shoot targeted missiles while on the ground, and siege mode while on the ground. Siege mode allows you to charge missiles faster, allowing them straight and fast flight, and a recharging shield that can take 3 hits before going down.\n\nSo to reiterate you can fire charged missiles straight and true, arc less charged missiles, bomb in the opposite direction you are facing, artillery strike in siege mode, or perhaps try to quickly fly to an opponent, land, and hit  them with a missile. If this sounds to you like there's a lot of options for taking your opponents out, and like there will be many missiles flying everywhere, you're right!\n\nThe result is a beautiful frenetic chaos full of explosives and death, and I've never had so many laughs just playing with one other person before, and I'm sure you can imagine, looking at the trailers, how crazy a 4 player match is. Network mode is newly arrived, and improving to feature parity quickly. There are some extra features in gameplay like solar flares, item/powerup drops, gravity of the sun, planets, and asteroids all thwarting to send your tank into the sun or asteroids to blow it up, etc. If your tank gets blown up, it isn't the end! (Unless you flew into the sun.) You will now become a pilot, and have a chance to evade your opponent's attacks to reland, giving you a renewed tank, albeit at the cost of your opponent getting some points. (If they are the reason your tank blew up.)\n\nKeep in mind that when you are flying, you have a limited amount of fuel, so if you get going too fast and use too much at the same time, you will likely find yourself dying off the edge of the screen.\n\nSo this is what Moonshot boils down to: Blow up your friends, laugh at unexpected things constantly, feel like a badass when you pull off awesome kills. The presentation is great, and while the gameplay is simple to execute, the resulting chaos and skill ceiling introduced from the different forms of interaction will keep you on your toes, laughing, and challenged.\n\nOn an ending note, the controls are a bit strange when using WASD, because you only use A/D to control movement of your tank, W and S to fly/brake. With a control, you get a better feel, since left analog acts more like a universal "go where I tell you" movement option, however, it will be much harder to quickly aim missiles. I haven't found a good remedy to both of these issues, but it isn't too hard to adjust the m/kb controls, I just find it worth mentioning a controller may be more comfortable if you aren't playing super competitively.\n\nGraphics:To sum it up breifly the graphics in Moonshot are simple, very stylized, and very beautiful. The UI is a wonderful treat, beautiful and thematic, and elegantly proportioned ... if just a touch clumsy to navigate currently due to the controls.\n\nAudio:The sounds are fairly distinct, and do not lack for the feel of impact or satisfaction, but I do still find myself feeling like something is somehow missing, but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's just that I want my tank to sound like a fully fledged spaceship when hurtling through the air, but either way the music and audio in general is very serviceable, and you won't even notice it much anyway over the voice of your screaming and laughing friends.\n\nConclusion:Moonshot is worth your time, especially if you like party games, or can only play with your friends online. Both are very rewarding experiences. If you have friendships you need to repair (or break) I recommend Moonshot at:\n\nFull price.\n\nIt actually feels fairly generously priced at its current total of $8.00.\n\n======================================If you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.\n======================================","March 1","true","3.3"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","2"

On paper it sounds excellent and gladly in practise, it’s superb fun!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qOKjFYV8LRU\n\nYour objective is to kill the guy inside your opponent’s tanks.  This is done by first destroying the tank and then trying to shoot the ejected pilot before he can land back on a planet and respawn a new tank.  There's a variety of ways to die which keeps things fresh e.g. tank fire, bombs, being rammed by a fast flying tank, being off screen too long, impact to a planet/sun, etc.\n\nThere are a number of weapons at your disposal with more planned and it sounds like there may be possible load out choices in the future.\n\nMain things to consider currently is that the full early-access version is local multiplayer only, but the steam beta version which is easily accessible is online multiplayer.  This seems to be coming along really well and I've been playing games with friends with no problems at all.  I can't imagine it will be very long until online play is implemented into the full version.\n\nI had a previous concern about some of the weapons balancing and the developer has promptly addressed this issue.  Previously the siege mode a tank could turtle into was a bit overpowered meaning the game favoured the defensive player.  The developer has reduced some of the power of this mode and the game seems to now reward risk-taking again.  Great stuff!\n\nThe game plays great with a controller and I believe they have designed the controls so that whether you play KB&M or controller there should be no distinct advantage.  So they've tried to balance things here too and apparently done a good job.\n\nThe physics are nice in the game.  Firing some shots requires either a mix of luck and judgement to account for the gravity pulls from nearby planets.  It's quite possible to actually kill yourself (I do it quite often!) if flying around space too fast and bombs receive a strong gravitational pull from a large planet!\n\nCheck out the video of the gameplay.  If this type of game is your type of thing I have no hesitation recommending buying it.  It's a very fair price and I'm very confident the game will only grow further during it's time in Early Access.\n","March 1","true","4.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

It brings for an amazing amount of local multiplayer fun or fun against the bots. The main objective is to get the most points through gaining the most kills, vehicle destroys or lasting the longest depending on game modes.\n\nPositives:\n+ Audio and Graphics are really good\n+ Local multiplayer is a lot of fun\n+ Controller support\n+ AI's are real fun to play against too\n\nNegatives:\n- Not much content yet\n- Online multiplayer would’ve been a great addition\n- Lack of customisation (i.e changing color, tank)\n- Lack of game mode settings (Cannot change round length for example)\n\nIf you love small party games or games where you  get to play locally against friends this is the game for you. I really enjoyed playing the game although it lacked much content and without no real life friends  it limited my experience and time playing the game a lot. I did eventually manage to get a few friends over to play the game and it was a blast.\n\nI would love to see customisation added and much more content and then the game will be a real solid title. Again it’s only in early access so this is expected.\n\nI would definitely recommend a purchase.\n\n-------------------\n\n* Since the review there has been two more maps and one more game mode added.\n\nThe new game mode added 'Team Deathmatch' is a lot of fun to play and adds a bigger variant to the game instead of every tank for itself. The two new maps are a great addition to the game.\n\n'Detritus' has planets rotating around fast and prove to be a great challenge; 'Nemesis' on the other hand uses the Team Deathmatch mode well and makes for a much more team based map. I am very excited for the content they have planned in the near future.","December 21, 2015","true","1.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/426930/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUpon acquiring Moonshot, I was hoping for a tank wars replica. What I got was an interesting concept that has the potential to be extremely fun if properly done.\n\nMoonshot is a game in which you are a tank and your primary mission is to defeat all other opposing players by force. You are stationed in space and are able to circumnavigate any planet your own. Moonshots uniqueness let's you move about and even thrust off to other planets. So instead of being stuck to one place, you are able to move about freely in a sense in space. The thrust controls take a bit of practice to properly familiarize oneself. Once you get this down, moving from planet to planet while shooting becomes feasible. It can also make for some competitive game play as shooting a moving target is not easy.\n\nThe shooting scheme itself is not that bad. The gravity of the planets can effect your shot depending on weak the power is. Obviously, the more power means less gravitational influence on the shot. Adding more power isn't always necessarily what you want. The advantage is to use the gravity and try to psych out players with shots that are difficult to dodge. If you want to unleash some mayhem, you are able to transform your tank into what's called "siege mode". Siege mode fixates your tank to one position but makes firing a heck of a lot more effective. Pressing both triggers at once will initiate a shield to generate to protect your tank. It's pretty hard at first to remember this feature when you start out as you'll want to bounce everywhere but this can play a very vital role in tactics when used properly. There are power ups that drop in throughout the game. These power ups have some pretty nice visuals and have some crazy damage effects.\n\nWhat I like about the game is it's fluidity. When being shot, you're not completely eliminated from the game entirely. Once your tank is blown up, there is a good chance a space man will start floating around. You have some control of the space man but are extremely vulnerable to enemy fire. He will get back into his tank as soon as you are able to land safely on another moon. The moon's themselves can be chipped away at (which is a great feature) and other "sun" moons (that are on fire) can use their gravity to pull you into your death. The game is quite good at it's function and it's inception. Issue now is taking it to a whole new level. I believe a lot more game modes need to be added with more interactive space debris. I like landing on moons and sometimes asteroids, but what else can you think of? Maybe a space station that rotates or has a death trap on one side? Modes are definitely something worth a look as changing the rules of a game is what can make a game go from good to great.\n\nThe graphics are quite suitable to the game and it's atmosphere. It resembles the game Planets Under Attack. I think some animations could be fine tuned a bit better for smoothness but overall it's appealing. The sounds are good (a little loud at first) but would like to hear variation in shots. The player will be shooting a lot, why not have fun with it even? Maybe have some shots make a duck sound or steam notification sound in different frequencies? Sound diversity can really fine tune a game in the best ways possible and provide for an even immersive experience.\n\nOverall the game is decent at this point. There is a lot of potential but it's going to take some creative thinking to take this game to an immersive level. The price tag is quite stiff and would only recommend buying it if it REALLY appeals to you. Otherwise, it's probably best to wait for a good reasonable sale price.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\nScreenShots :\nNotice how there are trajectory indicators and they even bend to represent gravity\n\nI absolutely love games that give a map of configuration","February 8","true","2.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","3"

It's nice to see an early access multiplayer game with such fully-formed and enjoyable game mechanics. However, there is a bit of a problem, in that multiplayer has yet to be implemented.\n\nI always try to base my reviews on the singleplayer elements alone, but this sort of crazy arcade action game is in dire need of a human element in order to keep the gameplay fresh. The developers have promised that this element is of top priority and will be implemented ASAP (so I'll update my review accordingly), but until then, all the player has to fight are bots. Dumb, slow, suicidal bots.\n\nAt first, I thought the easy setting was just there to introduce new players to the gameplay, but after just a few minutes of play, I was winning flawless deathmatch victories against 3 Hardcore bots. Once the player gets hold of certain powerups like the laser or homing missile, they are pretty much unstoppable. These should either be nerfed, or made harder to get a hold of, perhaps by splitting up the components over a match, which the player needs to collect by traversing from planet to planet, or blowing up opponents that have collected a weapon component they need.\n\nI've pointed out a lot of problems with Moonshot, but only because I want to see it improve. I'm also giving it a positive recommendation because I want to see more of my friends playing it ... so I can crush them 'neath my armoured tread.\n\nThis star system aint big enough for the 4 of us!","January 18","true","0.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Some of my favorite games that I first played on PC over twenty years ago were physics based games. This was headlined by Scorched Earth, a shareware artillery game that was written and developed by Wendell Hicken. It’s really nice to see that modern developers can draw on the inspiration of classics such as Hicken’s in creating and developing new games for modern audiences. Such is the case with Pump Action Games’s exciting new early access game Moonshot.\n\nMoonshot will be released either late in the first quarter or in the second quarter of this year after some fine tuning and the addition of more weapons, maps and modes to play. At this stage of the title’s development everything is in a very playable state and the presentation is already very good. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything abjectly negative about the game in its current state. Some may argue that there isn’t enough variety in game play but that argument is soundly defeated when one factors in the fact that the developers are working hard on adding more content than you can poke a stick at and that the three modes already in the game – deathmatch, team deathmatch and last man standing – have different enough objectives to offer distinctly different modes.  It can be argued that the game needs to be played via multiplayer in order to bring the best out of the game even though the computer AI is intelligent but this has long been a point of difference with this genre. Multiplayer adds longevity and keeps things fresh whereas one can become bored even with the most intelligent of AI systems. Some slight tweaking here and there will perfect them. The power ups can really change the outcome of the game and make those who acquire them unstoppable which can turn games into a race to get the power ups. I anticipate that this will change come the final version of the game. I’d also like to see multiplayer extended to online multiplayer to provide the game extra longevity.\n\nThe physics are, as one would hope, pretty spot on. The presentation is outstanding. I’m a big fan of the futuristic beat music though some may find it becoming repetitive. I also find the graphics featured to be rather charming. They are easy on the eye though at times it can become a little busy. The menu system is easy to understand with the right amount of clarity.  Game play in both multiplayer mode and single player mode is very enjoyable. There is much to like here and not a lot to pick apart. It is what one would hope to find in a physics based game.\n\nGiven the time and effort that Pump Action games continue to put into Moonshot I have no doubt that come full release that the title will be among the best of its kind on Steam. At this point in time we recommend the game for those who have friends to play with locally and those who simply enjoy physics based games.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 28","true","1.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

They're jolly pure fun to be enjoyed with friends and have recently reemerged in popularity with games such as rocket league. Moonshot brings a uniqueness to the genre with playing across a physics based solar system as a siege tank that can fly across the whole solar system in a matter of seconds and it turns out to be quite fun.\n\n\nIn Moonshot initially each player starts on their own planet until they thrust off with their tank's jets or are blown off as someone rains down fire on their planet. When on the planet your tank is able to rotate around the planet to avoid incoming fire. You can also engage your tanks siege mode for more stable aiming and a shield, but you sacrifice all maneuverability as if to take a stand to rain hell on other players from your planet. Shooting takes some getting use to as your missiles are effected by planets gravitational pull and require a more planned aim. Because of this, hitting your target feels like you guided a torpedo into the exhaust port of the death star using the force. Some missiles, unintentionally or not, will be swung right in your direction, so be on the lookout for them. There are power ups such as lasers. When a  player chooses to thrust off a planet or is forced to, they can remain in flight or land on the nearest planet. Remaining in flight can take some work because planets gravity will pull you towards it. You can fire, carpet bomb, and ram other players. As compared to traditional arena games, being able to fly anywhere on the map enables players a lot more options and creativity and in combination with solar system's physics it can make for some great moments. The combat of Moonshot is where the game really stands out. If you're looking for a fresh new gameplay mechanics in an arena shooter look no further.\n\n\nEvery map is a different solar system. Each have different arrangements of planets. Planets will have different sizes, gravitational pull, and rotational speed. Every map has a sun at the center which plays heavily into the combat. If it takes to much damage it will produce a solar flair which will destroy everything that is facing it so you better be on the other side of the planet youre on. Some maps have meteors that you have to be on the look out for, especially when flying. There are also power ups that are revealed when sections of a planet are blown up.\n\n\nThere are multiple game modes. Death match and Team Death Match are chaotic fun, but my favorite is Last Man Standing where each player has only three lives. Last Man Standing makes every decisions  based on risk vs reward. Do I stay behind my planet out of sight and or do i thrust off and cower behind another planet? The hard decisions\n\n\nWith a group of friends Moonshot is like pizza at a birthday party.\n\n\nI look forward to seeing what the team behind Moonshot will be doing with the game as it progresses. No bugs so far. The groundwork for a great game has been more than set.\n\n\n9.5/10 as of now","December 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Mainly because there's no "real" online multiplayer, you can only play with people locally or online with those in your friends list - no lobby and no self-hosted games.\nIf you have 3 friends who want to play often, it could be fun, but for me I am too busy due to life/work, so I just want to jump into a match sometimes.\n\nTherefore I could just play a match against bots, which felt unsatisfying.\n\n\nOther problems imo:\n- controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, but are generally fine.\n\n- Not enough power ups & difference in weapons.\n\n- The automatic zoom is annoying and broken, manual zoom would be much better. Some user reported that he get's killed because the camera zoomed in and therefore he was out of the match area (which kills you after 3 sec).\n\n- No ability to rebind keys, set mouse-sensitivity etc.\n\n- Game menu controls are clunky.\n\n- No timer for your weapons, this is okay with the normal shot but when flying you want to know when you can shoot the carpet bomb to time your shot, which is important because of the gravity.\n\n- Only three maps, not enough variety in them. Could use more different scenery and interactive environmentals (like a black hole, nebula, shooting stars, ..?)\n\n- The sun mechanism is really cool, but feels unsatisfying graphic whise. It should look more fire like and less like a vector graphic.\n\n\nOther than that I have no complains, and I think if all this gets adressed, then this game could be a cool little multiplayer gem.\nPlus the team behind it seems to be very active in the discussion, which is a good sign.\n\nEdit: The developer said they are thinking about adding matchmaking. So keep an eye out for it and definitely check back later. Or buy it if you want to support the developers.","April 26","false","0.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

'But what makes Moonshot so great?', you may be asking? Well that's probably why you are reading this review so let me lay down some facts\nPros:\n•Controller support, Online + Offline Multiplayer, and keyboard play is amazing! No controller needed.\n•Bots are intelligent, and have varying levels of such.\n•Siege mode is a buff, but is balanced for sure.\n•Great gameplay for new and experienced players.\n•Online multiplayer is in the works\n•Developers are some of the kindest people I've met\nCons:\n•Some power ups are OP, the laser is the most overpowering in my opinion.\n•In the online multiplayer, some features are disabled but this is to be expected. Very small issue!\n\n\nAll in all, would I reccomend this game to anyone, whether it was a 75-year old granny or a seven year old child!\nGameplay is great, mechanics are great. The pros drastically weigh out the cons!\nHappy Moonshotting!\n\nEDIT: Please one of the keywords on the storefront. EARLY ACCESS. This means that the game isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close to it. Early Access means exactly what the name implies, the game is in it's toddler stages, and it's about to start kindergarten thanks to multiplayer.

You can start up a match for up to 4 players locally (or AI) in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch or Last Man Standing modes and let the carnage begin. Each player starts on a different planet and the goal is simply to destroy your opponents, but how you do that is up to you. These tanks have three different modes that you can change on the fly:\n\nRover mode - this is the default mode when on the surface of a planet. You can drive around the planet freely, fire the cannon, and activate a reflector shield to send those pesky bullets back where they came from.\n\nFlight mode - use the tanks thrusters to take off and transform into flight mode. Fly around freely and carpet bomb your enemies. Get going fast enough and a shield activates that can be used to block bullets, dislodge a target from a planet, or destroy them outright by crashing down on their head. Which is awesome.\n\nSiege mode - activate this mode while on the surface of a planet to hunker down in a defensive bubble and blast away with more powerful shots.\n\nEach mode is a ton of fun and gives you the opportunity to play how you want. At the time of this writing, there are also 2 powerups that can drop from destroyed tanks or planets: Homing missiles and lasers. Homing missiles are currently pretty overpowered, but the laser is fun too.\n\nThe game perfectly encapsulates the old adage "easy to learn, hard to master" because it is so easy to pick up and play, but with lots of room for skilled players to shine. I was just having a raucous good couple of hours with my nephews, who were able to pick it up pretty quickly.\n\nKeep in mind, though, this is primarily a party game. Tons of fun with 2 - 4 local players, but not a lot for one. However, the devs are planning to add more of everything in future updates including maps, powerups, a wave-based survival mode, and possibly online multiplayer. Get it now to show your support and let the devs know what you want to see more of.\n\nWith that in mind, I heartily recommend Moonshot in it's current state, and it can only get better. It's a must have for any group game night.","December 21, 2015","true","76.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Trash talk your friends as your bullet weaves between asteroids toward them - only to have them reflect your own bullet right back at you at twice the speed!\n\nThis game is like a real-time action version of Worms, but with multiple planets, solar flares, killer asteroid belts and bullets that slingshot around planets for crazy trick shots.  Switch on the fly between three tank modes:  Cruise the planet's surface in driving mode while reflecting bullets with your directional shield.  Anchor into siege mode for a heavy bubble shield and fire high velocity shots.  Or take off in flight mode to drop 3-round bomb barrages underneath you, then pick up speed and slam into a grounded target to detonate them or send them hurtling off-planet -- and yes, that is as awesome as it sounds!\n\nThis game offers casual, crazy fun.  But at the same time, a skilled player can pull off crazy trick shots, shoot down incoming bullets, reflect bullets straight back to sender, or cause solar flares to wipe out enemies on the opposite side of the star.  So far I've played with three of my nephews, my brother, and my girfriend, and we had blast at all ages and skill levels.","December 21, 2015","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you remember when you and your buddies would crowd around the computer for some quick arcade battle action? This brings you right back to that feeling.\n\nIt's kind of a Asteroids meets Scorched Earth, with some clever arenas (solar systems, complete with gravity) to mix it up. It's not turn-based; it's decidely real-time arcade. The game is about shooting, thrusting, and dodging, while hopefully using gravity in your favor. There aren't weapon shops that provide a dizzying array of arms, but there are occasional powerups that appear for an enterprising explorer. Just be carefuly while going after those powerups that you don't get sucked into the sun! (Though I have to say is a pretty awesome effect when it does happen.)\n\nThis game has some amazing moments. The first time you shoot an incoming rocket out of the sky, you will cheer. Nailing an unprotected astronaut flying through space after his tank gets blown up is beyond fulfilling. And forcing an enemy into the sun made me cackle with glee.\n\nThere are multiple modes: deathmatch (timed), team deathmatch (timed), and last player standing. Beyond that, the mechanic is the same. From that sense, the game is spartan. But if the multiplayer battle aspect (with real people or with bots) is what you enjoy, you will love this game.\n\n(This review was written against the Early Access version.)","December 21, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THe mechanics work really well although sometimes it seems the thrusters aren't as powerful as they should be. Much easier to play with mouse/keyboard than gamepad, though the controls reverse when you're shot out of your tank for some reason, I guess to make it easier to fly back to a rock to get your tank back.\n\nThe only thing stopping me from buying is the price. $13cdn early access is a bit steep, though I'm not sure if the full version (vs the free weekend version) has any extra features. I think I'd be more happy to pay about $5 since it's very simple and not much there.","May 7","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played it at pax and really enjoyed it. A little hard to learn, but that may be just because I suck at video games. Really fun once you get the hang of it.","May 16","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Creative fun and highly polished game play experiences.  An indie game with Nintendo level quality.","December 22, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
