Not that there's too much wrong with that, I just thought I'd throw it out there\n\n\nOverall, this game is worth your time if the idea of it interests you. It's fast paced, semi-randomized, and quite a bit of fun. I would recommend that you look up some gameplay on it to see if you are really interested in this sort of game. Right now it's on sale until April 25th, so I highly recommend buying it sooner rather than later.\n\nFirst Impressions Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18M0QqIRI5w","April 18, 2014","true","8.9"," 138 of 184 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","138","184","0","8"

Combat plays automatically while you do the strats (position your party, equip items, use items and skills), and thats the extent of your control aside for a few more minor things. At first that doesn't sound so bad, you might need to do certain things a certain way due to abilities your enemies might have. But this game has dumbed down everything that could potentially be challenging outside of direct combat:\n\n- Each character has a single skill. one. ONE!!!!!!! (I found that each actually has a team buff/debuff, but all of them weren't thought out very well, 2 classes even had the exact same one as well, which is a little bit silly).\n\n- Your characters are selected for you. WHY? Whats worse you need to pay in-game currency for the ability to select your characters? I don't understand what purpose it serves. You could say that it is to ease the player into the game, but that is BS since the game throws a full party of 3 people and those people are randomly selected out of the ones you can use, that doesn't sound like easing in.\n\n- Items stats are boring as f**k. Its a very simple add to damage, and any class can equip any weapon and shield and have it deal more damage than a weapon they would typically hold (I had a mage holding a sword that added 5 to damage. better than his staff).\n\n- A inventory system that I wish never exsisted. When your party picks up an item (which isn't notified very well to the player) it is added to the rather small inventory space, items are queued from the top and once you fill your inventory and find another item, the oldest item in your inventory is removed. What if I wanted to keep a potion? How can I stratergise if you don't give me the means to do so? You can't even remove an item from your inventory to bump a potion back to the top in order to keep. Why can't I do that? Seriously? It just seems a little bit stupid that I have to get rid of a useful potion for a god-awful weapon.\n\nDue to the lack of control the player has and the lack of information about how some of the game's simple game mechanics work during the tutorial, all combined with the simplicity of class and equipment stats and abilities... *sigh*\n\nI can't really say much about this game in its favour other than the visuals are pretty solid and the music isn't too bad, but the game keeps looping the same tracks over and over, so theres that.\n\nThis game is bad, really bad. It's a bore to play and recommend none of you pick this up.","April 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 153 of 212 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","153","212","0","7"

It is not.\n\nQuestRun is a good looking level-based turn based combat action game where you control up to 3 heroes as they fight through a series of waves of enemies. Combat is automatic except for unit positioning (there are 3 lanes, each lane can hold 1 hero and switching can be done at any time) and special abilities that charge up based on hits landed (1 per hero).\nSo far so good (or... So far so "I guess this is alright").\n\nIt starts falling apart when you realize that this is all there is.\nThere are 4 dungeons, which just boil down to a series of combat waves. No exploration of any kind in between.\nBeyond that there are a number of optional quests that you use to unlock alternate forms of your heroes... which boil down to combat waves where your hero roster is predefined.\n\nSuccessfully finishing a level awards you with gold, crowns and crystals (the last one only if it was a dungeon) which are used to buy things in the store, passively unlock dungeons and quests and buy special things in the store respectively.\nIf this sounds like a cash-store model that could support in-app purchases then you would be correct. Even though these features are (fortunately) not present in the Steam version the original Mobile app definitely had it.\nFinishing a level also resets ALL character progress, which within a level takes the form of equipment and a simplistic experience system.\n\nThis means that, assuming you win, your hard work (levels can take well up to half an hour and allows no mid-level saving) will reward you with a measly bag of gold which will net you very little in the game shop.\nTo give an example, dungeon gold gain is 200-300 per victory and a new hero class can easily cost 5000 gold.\nThe currency rate appears to still be on "cash shop" mode, meaning what progress there is is very slow.\n\nOther than the combat there is NOTHING there.\nNo semblance of a plot. No exploration. No backstory for the heroes, the world, the dungeon, the enemies, the quest.\nI was sorely disappointed by this game and do not recommend it.","September 9, 2014","false","3.6"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","0"

The backgrounds are particularly appealing although they felt empty at times. The character design is nice too, having influence from many japanese style games, as well as european history and mythology.\n\nThe game looks bright, cheery and fun, but I really can’t find that anywhere in the actual game.\nIn summary, this game aims high to try show off some good ideas in practice and otherwise attempts to do something very basic in the sense of its mechanics, and potentially have a  really fun game on their hands. But instead this feels as if it just got out of bed minutes before a final assignment is due.","June 25, 2015","false","7.4"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InquisitiveDuck/recommended/286120/","InquisitiveDuck","Inquisitive Duck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InquisitiveDuck/","1194 products in account","Basics\n\nQuestRun: a lite-RPG game with turn-based elements.\n\nFeaturing bright, colorful visuals with appropriate music, QuestRun boasts to be a "Challenging and fast-paced" game that "is unlike anything you have played before." Does it really deliver on that promise? Let's find out.\n\nGameplay is simple, offering only a small handful of attack types (Melee, Ranged, Magic). Both the Melee and Magic weapons attack the enemy directly in front of the user, with Ranged weapons allowing the character to assist an ally when no enemy is in front of them. A simple, but interesting mechanic.\n\nCharacters also get a Special ability which can directly affect combat via team Heals, charming enemies, cast fire spells, or other abilities. Most also get access to a combat Stance, which can toggled on and off to grant a variety of bonus stats (usually at the cost of others).\n\nLittle strategy is really needed due to the game's simple mechanics, with character placement generally being the most important choice you can make. Fortunately, slow combat allows plenty of time to make adjustments during a fight (with an option of 3x game speed for the bored).\n\nThere are a variety of stats that can be utilized to improve your combat experiance; primaries such as Health, Defense, Magic Defense, Attack - and others such as Luck, Speed, Special, and Charisma.\n\nAfter bashing faces in, you can use that hard earned gold in the Meta Shop for stuff such as new characters, pets, and other features.\n\n\nDone Well\n\nGreat Visuals - Clean, colorful graphics make this game visually appealing.\nGameplay - Simple, but fun and enjoyable.\nAchievements - Uninspired kill X or do Y, but something realistic to work towards and easy to understand. Good for completionists.\nMusic - Nothing amazing, but it fits the game's atmosphere and repetative listening from playing the game won't get irritating. Always a plus for a game.\nCards - Despite the store page not being updated, QuestRun does support Steam Trading Cards. A nice addition for those that enjoy them.\n\nWhere it Went Wrong\n\nHere is where the otherwise pleasent experience breaks down and ultimately sways the recommendation into a negative rating.\n\nNo Cloud Saves - QuestRun makes use of Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, but failed to include an important feature such as Cloud Saves, which becomes important when trying to play on multiple devices or preventing data loss.\nOptionless - Complete lack of game options such as sound volume, game resolution, or even fullscreen/window modes (no fullscreen support). Missing such basic functionality makes QuestRun feel like it was ported from a mobile platform, which is surprisingly inaccurate since the game is NOT available on android or iOS.\nPoor Performance - The game suffers from performance issues, often causing severe studdering, slowdowns, frequent freezes, and even memory leaks (that result in crashes)\nMORE Bugs - A handful of other prevelent bugs exist: waves not progressing, characters not attacking, stats not saving, progress being lost, game not installing, game not launching, among others.\n\nBottomline\n\nQuestRun is a simple, yet interesting game that suffers from a lot of game disruptive bugs which detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\nUnless the plethora of problems get addressed, I recommend users avoid QuestRun.","October 8, 2014","false","1.6"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","0"

Sometimes the game just takes a dire turn right on the 1st round because you couldnt think the situation through fast enough. On the other hand if you had, you will end up completing the dungeon really easy. There is a lot of different strategies you can think of. The monsters are different too, even if they look alike they might have different stats. Getting your pets and items is very important as well. Since choosing your crew and everything else is random, you will have to figure out how to make it work. Graphics are very simple and just really enjoyable to see for such simple game. Music fits perfectly too.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=411127848\nThere's not much else to talk about once it comes to QuestRun. Mostly its the strats and your own luck that matters. The game may not be balanced very well, but once you get into it you will realize that it doesnt really matter. There are a lot of combos to try out, plus this game is an easy 100% achievement game!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409351581\nOnce you finish the game, its probably over for you. It will be time to move on.\nIt doesnt mean the game is bad, look at the price - super cheap and quit long, I d say about 10 hours is pretty good.\nTo conclude, this game deserves the price. If there's no sale then just buy it. It will be hard at the beginning but you will get a hang of it quickly enough.

So you can manipulate combat and EXP gains by pulling the ol' switcheroo.\n_ Activate character specials: Very often you'll want to click that ASAP, so not much of a choice.\n_ Use potions/equip new loot: Again, little actual freedom here. Pick the bigger number and heal when health is low.\n_ Pick your Level Up bonus once in a while.\n\nCompare/contrast with what the RNG determines:\n_ The loot you get: Get nothing but 10 +1 swords in a row, fail dungeon. Retry with the same party and stats (and basically the same strategy, since there's little leeway for that), get proper weapons, shields and potions and breeze through the level.\n_ The random events you get: You could get a real good weapon drop from the gnome! Or have to choose between losing 1/3 of your party or all your inventory. Five times in a row.\n_ The stat increases you can pick, out of 3, at level-up time. Need more health, or a stronger special? Why not have more charisma instead, or maybe some magic attack for that knight guy!\n\nSo what you do, what you actually have influence on, matters way too little compared to sheer luck (not the stat, you, the player's luck -- well, maybe if you're into that Quantified Self thing you think of it as a stat) (which is pretty grating, FYI, you NERD).\n\nUI's a bit clumsy too (for instance: only the highest charisma in the party matters, so you have to memorize who that is or pause when you have the option of a charisma increase), and it feels somewhat grind-heavy / free-to-play-ish (you can get pets/merchants to mitigate the RNG, but 1. it's not nearly enough and 2. they cost a looot, and heeey is that a second type of currency?).\n\nAnyway, skip.","July 4, 2014","false","2.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

The music is not terrible, but not great either. Pretty much standard fare. Thing I'd take issue is, theres nothing Ive seen so far for this game to have the tag of "RPG".\n\nTheres no story to speak of (that Ive found yet anyway, granted I've only done 3 missions). Basically, theres a map with different missions you can choose. Choosing a mission gives you a brief description of it. Such as "Protect the princess" or what have you. Then it goes right to the battle.\n\nIt looks like your typical JRPG, with your PCs on one side, enemies on the other. Each PC can only attack the enemy in front of it, except for certain items or abilities allow you to attack others. Each PC has a special ability that it can use based on the type of class it is. Attacks are in real time and keep going whether you want them to or not, as soon as a time bar is filled, the attack is made). Items are randomly dropped into a 4 slot thing at the left, when a new one drops you lose the one in the 4th slot. They are anything from weapons and armor, to scrolls that raise your level (NOT as big of a deal as in a real RPG) and potions with various effects.\n\nSo enemies come in waves, with up to 3 on screen at different time. The final wave is a boss and there is a couple points in each mission where either you get to choose something good (healing, a good random item) or bad (cant gain exp, slowed down ect)\n\nIts an ok tablet-style casual game, but besides the fact that the classes are traditional D&D classes and you gain EXP which makes your characters better, theres *nothing* about this game that could be considered an RPG.\n\nI'd call it casual, maybe strategy. Based on the fact that the fun lies in switching your characters places to take hits and knowing when to use your special skill and who to put items on. But definitely not an RPG at all.\n\nRPG =/= fantasy setting.","April 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 70 of 111 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","70","111","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","I have plenty of other fitting names for this game and one of them would be "Unfair run". This game is not balanced well and in some runs you will die faster than you can yell "Where are the good upgrades?!". If you will have a good run is mostly dependant on luck, as some runs you just don't get upgrades that will help you survive until the very end. It gets  tedious to be near the end and then have one monster literally oneshotting all your characters because none of them got any magical defense.\n\nStill, as frustrating as it is, I have had fun with it. So if you don't like infuriating games due to bad mechanics, then I'd advice you to stay away from this game.\n\nGood Stuff\nColorful graphics\nEven though the characters move as if they are stuck in a constant lag, I still liked the character design and artwork. It's cute with enough detail.\n\nRandomized fun\nGames will hardly feel the same as there are different upgrades per run, making you either superpowerful or struggling to stay alive. It's rewarding when you're strong, and intense when you are on the weak side. There is also a random event where you migt get a bonus or you get something bad happening. This also adds to the game feeling fresh and different on each run.\n\nBad stuff\nFrustration overload\nThis game has wanted me to smash my keyboard more than a thousand times. It's infuriating when you're having a semi good run and BAM! All monsters oneshots you in three seconds and it's game over. There's no possible ways to win certain runs unless you get the exact upgrades you need.\n\nWonky combat system\nWhile hitting the monsters is automatically handled by the characters, you have to rearrange them on the field to make weak characters stay out of powerful enemies way and make casters be able to attack the correct monster. Even though you can slow down the combat to a certain point, it doesn't eliminate the fact that sometimes you have just a few seconds to swap out your characters before they're literally oneshotted by the enemy. Some characters can't survive well against certain monsters, so you literally have to move them within 2 seconds that the monster appears on the screen. Sometimes this happens at the very start of the game. There are so many times where my characters are taking massive hits because I am struggling to manage spellcasting and moving them to the right spot. I wish there had been a setting to turn off the automated system and let you select a choice without a time limit.\nMost fights, I find myself constantly hitting the heal button and tossing potions around, because the characters are taking so massive amount of damage. Sometimes my characters are near death and I just barely manage to get them back up in health. Other times, I miss by half a second and they die. This is my least favorite part of the game.","January 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

I don't recommend this game as a purchase, but if you can get it for free, it's definitely a challenge to play and has a decent presentation. The game offers very little permanent progression, but that adds to the challenge of seeing how far you can get into a quest with the default items or slightly upgraded items from the unlockable shop.  You can also unlock a few extra character choices and a few bonus 'pets' which further enhance the gameplay with many strategy elements.  I personally like the rogue character because he can get tons of items from the enemies.  Keep the rogue at a low damage rating and get a shield character to protect him and you can rack up near endless items for leveling up your characters.\n\nNow, there are some bad points to this game.  The first you'll notice is the lack of an exit button.  Of course, that's no big deal, because you can click the window's close button.  That made me think about full-screen, but it turns out that the game does not allow full-screen mode.  Beyond the technical flaws already mentioned, the gameplay elements aren't as explained as they should be.  Some of the unlockables required a currency that I was not gaining from anything I did in the game, and I had to look up guides to figure out what was required to get that currency.  I quit the game after several hours of repetitively killing the same monsters trying to get characters through the first dungeon and admittedly failing close to the end.  I found it a little frustrating that there was no continue option to start with the same characters at the moment before the level they died on.  It took a lot of experimentation to figure out a strategy to get through the bulk of the first level and I still could not keep my characters alive, so I decided to quit and play something that has more entertainment value rather than keep playing only to grind through the same level over and over again.  That said, I found the game fun for maybe 2 hours, and I would play it again if I didn't have so many other games I want to play which could be a lot more fun.\n\nIf you can get this game for less than $2, it may be worth that price, but otherwise, I suggest you find something more worthwhile.","November 13, 2014","false","4.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I'd advise you to stay away, it is basically a glorified phone game where you just kinda watch little dudes fight. Read my review and decide for yourself.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR "I was fortunate to get this for $2, and I can't even say it's worth that."\n\nAlthough it looks charming, I can't recommend this to anyone. And I thoroughly enjoy Gauntlet and Dynasty Warrior, other often mindless, near objectiveless games.\n\nSure, I don't have much time played, but as is with phone games, you know if you actually want to play something within the first few minutes of playing.\n\nUpon starting the game, I was met with no direction and "Play" and "Shop" buttons. I immediately expected a Cash Shop but luckily it was no such thing. Just an ingame shop to offer the illusion of open endedness and customization.\n\nSo about the "gameplay", if you wanna call it that. The characters are set on an auto attack but you can move them from top to mid to bottom lanes to say, protect them or continue the fight in another lane after one has died. Every so often there is a little event when you hit a milestone in a quest. You level up, you get new gear and you get ♥♥♥♥ on by RNGesus. That is pretty much the game in a nutshell.\n\nAt the top of this page, it says;\n\n"Challenging and fast-paced with a modern twist on old school RPG battle systems, QuestRun is unlike anything you have played before."\n\nThere is no challenge to a game that plays itself and fast-paced is if you have it on fast foward. If by modern they meant "Plays like a cheap cellphone game!" then yeah, I could see that. As far as "old school RPG battle systems" goes, I remember actually getting to choose what my characters did. And that last line? Oh trust me, I have played bad games before.\n\nI was fortunate to get this for $2, and I can't even say it's worth that.","May 17","false","0.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Not only is it difficult, it is unfair, luck-based and has obscure mechanics, making the difficulty a drawback rather than a draw (I love difficult games). The mouse controls are awkward and the keyboard controls are insufficient and insufficiently configurable. Then the gameplay is repetitive and it hardly ever feel like you're making progress.\n\nOn the other hand, the art is cute and the system is original. So it might be the game for you if you don't mind bashing your head against a wall repeatedly until you're lucky enough for the thing to break, or if you don't mind regularly getting wiped through no fault of your own (I don't). You also have to enjoy repetitive micro-management (I do).\n\nIf that's the case, and if you like puzzling out how things work over many failed runs, you should get this. It was carefully crafted and definitely plays differently than most game of Steam (you're more likely to find similar while looking through flash games).","June 20, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Complete missions for bonus powers, and to buy characters and other advantages.  The side quests are tightly balanced, so you won't succeed on the first try or ten, but by the skin of your teeth when you do.\n\nNegatives: feels padded and a bit grindy, for those simple mechanisms.

It's not so much a matter of getting better at the game, as it is getting lucky with random events.\n\nFor example, each time one of your characters levels up, it randomly selects three (out of about ten) skills you can choose from to increase. For each character there are about 2 skills that are vitally important and another 3 that are useful. So you HAVE to get lucky in the skill selections to succeed. You also need to get lucky in item drops.\n\nEven once you know what you are doing, you have at best about a 5% chance of beating a level. If this were closer to 25% it would be tolerable, but as it is it's just terrible.\n\nA Small Revision:\nAfter I found out that you can farm the blue crystals by replaying the first dungeon over and over, the game does become fun.

There's no point in wasting a potion on a weaker character, and no point contnuing once a party is at less than full strength. On top of losing characters during battles, there are between-round "fortunes/misfortunes. You could get an inventory full of potions, or you could lose one of your characters between rounds.\n\nThis game really sets the gamer up to fail.\n\nI've played this","May 25, 2014","false","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you get familiar with the QuestRun, you can't stop playing - unless the art style bothers you. It's really important to check all the stats of your characters and when you're in the fight, alter their positions. Luck is also a very important factor which leads to the victory. If you'll get a nice, powerful item early in the game, most likely you'll win the level. Alter the position of your chars, use special powers often and watch your luck. QuestRun is a nice, casual game which helps me to relax.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/recommended/286120/","KronusX","KronusX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/","266 products in account","Product received for free\n\nQuestrun is advertised as a J-RPG inspired tactical game with rogue-like elements and deep engaging gameplay. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver on both sides. At the first look the game looks very simplistic when you start it up with less than 15 missions. The problem with the game is that it tries too hard to look like a mobile game\n\nIn the same time, the game has massive issues when it comes to customization. You can move units around, have less than 5 types of weapons and shields and three types of potions. The game is essentially move your strongest guy from a position to another and hope he does not miss. The problem with the game is that your characters will miss a lot, and there is no stat to counter this issue.\n\nAnother issue with the game is the shop they have in-game. Essentially before the mission you can buy items and roll characters with the gold bought. The shop itself has a very poor selection and the only way to get better items is basically to grind missions in order to earn more gold to upgrade the shop and get better items before starting another mission.\n\nThe biggest issue this game has is unbalance. The monsters you fight are essentially too strong and they will destroy your heroes even when you have a tank and two supports. The difficulty is even worse since they can dodge your attacks and there is no way to negate the dodge. The enemy mages are also extremely strong and coupled with a couple of events which happen randomly (good or bad, though mostly bad events) taking your potions away, and you will fail the mission.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend the game to anyone, no matter how cheap it is due to all the problems the game has.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group\n","May 25","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought I was buying a casual game, but that's not what I got.\n\nQuest Run is a cute game that doesn't try to be anything grand, and it succeeds at what it does.  You have several different classes of adventurers with limited equipment slots and skills, some ability to maneuver them, and a couple of random events - and that's about it.  The art style is pleasing, and it's easy to pick up in a short time.\n\nHowever, the game is punishing.  I was shocked when, in the middle of a tutorial, my entire party was slaughtered.  That was a taste of things to come: I soon found that trying to go beyond the two tutorial dungeons meant losing every single time - hardly a lot of fun, or what I expected.  You did gain some gold from each attempt, fail or succeed, but that's it - nothing else stayed with you.  There was no sense of levelling up your characters or equipment - in fact, you were assigned different characters in each dungeon, meaning that you didn't really get to know their strengths and weaknesses without replaying the raid.  A lot.\n\nAnd you have to replay a lot: there are some upgrades you can buy, like pets with abilities or additional classes, but they cost thousands of gold pieces - and you get around 150 for finishing a quest.  If you need an upgrade to seize victory, then you're going to have to replay the same raid dozens of times to save up enough - and then hope that it was worth it, since the descriptions are vague at best.\n\nI get the impression that QuestRun is a lot like FTL or Rogue Legacy, both roguelike games in which there is a steep learning curve, and you're not expected to survive to the end of the game until you've put dozens of hours into it.  There certainly is a skill to playing QuestRun, as you come to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each class and try out different strategies.  I just with the game held your hand a little more, or that you had the chance to play through a quest or two that wasn't a tutorial without having your ♥♥♥ handed to you by the game.  Otherwise, you end up feeling like the developer is laughing at your feeble efforts, and that's hard to enjoy.\n\nIn the end, QuestRun is a good game, but not a game I can enjoy.  I wanted something that would be fun from the beginning, and instead I got a game that requires a lot of time and effort.  A lot of people will enjoy that, but I have other games I play when I want that.  I don't feel ripped off, but I wish I'd read the forums before buying.\n","June 21, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My friends will say a game is terrible and i'll defend it,  because I have bad taste.\n\nWith that said, this is a terrible game. I hate to be one of those "omg a mobile app game!!!" because I don't care. That's a dumb complaint and those are dumb threads, so stop posting them, but this is a game where if you made that thread, i'd agree with you.\n\nIt doesn't translate well on a computer at all because gameplay consists of switching spots occassionally with your three characters and waiting for them to ever so slowly kill the thing in their way (It's so bad that even the 3x Speed battles take minutes), only to do the same thing again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nIf you got this game in a bundle, just idle for the cards and delete this game from your harddrive and never look back.\n\nI play these types of games when I am trying to fall asleep since I have sleep issues, but this game is boring it's bad boring.. or maybe badoring. I may call Merriam-Webster to see if I can get that word into the next dictionary.\n\nAnyway. Please don't buy this game. Donate the money to charity instead. Donate it to a Multiple Sclerosis charity... any charity. Just don't buy this game. Even if the Steam sale is 90% off. That money is better going to charity.","August 31, 2014","false","10.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The play style is interesting. First off when you die you lose and start over again, the second thing that makes this game enjoyable is you can swap characters to different positions at will. So if you have a healer and a tank, and your healer is taking too much dammage you can swap places with the tank. Another interesting feature is items, you have 4 slots on the left side of the screen that can hold an item, every round you pass you gain an item. The items quality is based off of a certain stat, which is unique because you can literally upgrade your fighters during battle. There are other aspects to the game that make it unique, I have to admit like others I was dissapointed when my fighters auto attacked, but after playing for a bit I understand why the game was created this way. It can be fast paced and requres your attention at every turn, constant micro management is a must and being forced to tell one of your fighters to attack would be detramental.","April 22, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

After the first 2 quests, you'll die, and die, and die even more.\nIt feels like it's all based on luck, you can make the best strategy with the (always too few) resources you have and still lose without hope.\nThe most annoying thing is that when you level up you can't even chose what skill to enhance. Some quests you have 0 luck and lose all of your items or one of your team dies, others you have 20 luck and happens the same thing.\n\n\nThe game would be surely enjoyable with a MUCH better balance of the quests.

There are main dungeons where you use a randomized group of adventurers, and side dungeons, where you have a preset group designed to challenge you in different ways.\n\nThis game is very passive, so don't pick it up if you like dictating the action.

During a run, random item drops occur after each battle and random events happen after each sections of a run that will influence the difficulity of that run.

I can't say it's false, because technically there are some roguelike elements... But saying that is like saying "there are tetris elements" in Half-Life² because you can move boxes around. The game doesn't feel like a rogue-like (or even roguelite) at all!\nEverything seems pointless : because you only keep your characters for one level, there's no feeling of progression or joy when you level up / got better gear...\nGrinding : I said the game feels like a mobile game and it really does.

It is unambitious.  But what it does is pretty fun for the amount of time you'll spend on it.  The difficulty level is too high to start, so I've only successfully beaten the training missions, and then done the (endless?) dungeon a bunch of times.  I've gotten to the bosses of the 2 side missions available from the early game, but never beaten them.  I've purchased all the upgrades that you can buy with gold from the store, so it isn't like I've slouched.  Those missions are just a tad too difficult for being first missions, in my opinion.  I like hard games, but a little leeway would be nice, in this case.\n\nI believe I got this as part of a bundle, so price wasn't really an issue.

While I really like the graphical style, the game feels a lot like a mobile game (and apparently, it's not, which is really weird).\n\nCons:\nNo options\nRepetitive gameplay\nNo depth (to be honest it's the selling point of the game, but I don't like it at all)\nPoor gameplay : you switch characters around and... that's it... It's basically the only thing you do appart from pushing buttons from time to time (when the cooldown of the unique skill of one hero is ready, when you loot something,...)\nThe store page speaks of rogue-like elements. I can't say it's false, because technically there are some roguelike elements... But saying that is like saying "there are tetris elements" in Half-Life² because you can move boxes around. The game doesn't feel like a rogue-like (or even roguelite) at all!\nEverything seems pointless : because you only keep your characters for one level, there's no feeling of progression or joy when you level up / got better gear...\nGrinding : I said the game feels like a mobile game and it really does. You just grind gold to unlock shop items.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are really pretty\nIt's fun for about 10-15 minutes\n\nIf you like RPG's but don't like the fun elements in it (adventure, humor, progression, story...), this game is made for you.","February 2, 2015","false","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The worse thing is that it gets upscaled fullscreen and that surprisingly makes the game lag. The only old-school in this game is that it almost doesn't depend on you - it depends on random. Once you can finish your dungeon one-shoting your enemies, the other time you won't pass the first line with the same strategy. The all win strategy is to kill 2 of your useless heroes and just grind with the last one. If your luck anything above 3, you will lose, cause you will constantly get useless weapons instead of potions. The only positive thing is that the game has cards, even though it doesn't mention it in the description.

The worse thing is that it gets upscaled fullscreen and that surprisingly makes the game lag. The only old-school in this game is that it almost doesn't depend on you - it depends on random. Once you can finish your dungeon one-shoting your enemies, the other time you won't pass the first line with the same strategy. The all win strategy is to kill 2 of your useless heroes and just grind with the last one. If your luck anything above 3, you will lose, cause you will constantly get useless weapons instead of potions. The only positive thing is that the game has cards, even though it doesn't mention it in the description. Anyways I wouldn't reccomend to buy this game for the full price as there is almost none content to full up few hours (and it wants you to play 10 hours for achievement...).","October 4, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more like watching something happen instead of participating in it. While playing the tutorial I had no idea I was actually playing the game until the 2nd or 3rd wave of monsters. That's not an intended insult, I had absolutely no idea I was actually starting the game. I thought I was watching a tutorial video but nothing really happened then one wave got defeated, then another, until I realized it was actually the game.\n\nThe whole point of this game is to click on an icon in an area and see how many waves of monsters you can clear before you die. Another and more accurate way to describe this game is by comparing it to Final Fantasy; take away all of the moving around, story, or anything that really makes it a game you play, and just focus on the battles without ever leaving the screen.\n\nUse each member's special ability when you can to heal or help the group. After each wave you get loot instantly and disperse it amongst your group the best you can but it's usually not much that will help. You can't control your characters or their stats in any way other than to swap places with other characters on the same screen or when you get limited inconsistant options when they level up.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and based on the amount I played, asking $9 for this game is insanity. If you are really bored and want to buy a game that you don't really have to do much in, this game would be good for you but even then I would only pay under $1 for it.","January 18","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You simply can't cut through the enemies because each wave of foes differ from one another and require specific strategies to defeat them effectively. Managing HOW your heroes level up is the key to winning every battle. Balancing your 3 heroes with the right stat build-up, giving them appropriate equipment and little foresight will ensure victory at every turn.\n\nQuestRun is a fun stat management game that makes every decision truly important. It may look a little silly at first but when you give it a little time and effort, it eventually all feels very rewarding.\n","January 24","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more like watching something happen instead of participating in it. While playing the tutorial I had no idea I was actually playing the game until the 2nd or 3rd wave of monsters. That's not an intended insult, I had absolutely no idea I was actually starting the game. I thought I was watching a tutorial video but nothing really happened then one wave got defeated, then another, until I realized it was actually the game.\n\nThe whole point of this game is to click on an icon in an area and see how many waves of monsters you can clear before you die. Another and more accurate way to describe this game is by comparing it to Final Fantasy; take away all of the moving around, story, or anything that really makes it a game you play, and just focus on the battles without ever leaving the screen.\n\nUse each member's special ability when you can to heal or help the group. After each wave you get loot instantly and disperse it amongst your group the best you can but it's usually not much that will help. You can't control your characters or their stats in any way other than to swap places with other characters on the same screen or when you get limited inconsistant options when they level up.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and based on the amount I played, asking $9 for this game is insanity. If you are really bored and want to buy a game that you don't really have to do much in, this game would be good for you but even then I would only pay under $1 for it.","January 18","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatari/recommended/286120/","Shatari","Shatari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatari/","1665 products in account","I hate giving indie games negative reviews, but this one is extremely overpriced and delivers very little bang for the buck. I honestly can't recommend even buying it on a sale, mainly because you see 90% of the gameplay in the tutorial missions. There's very little content (and even less actual fun content) in this game, and once you've beaten the side missions you effectively run of actual goals to accomplish. Once everything is unlocked the actual dungeons are long and tedious affairs based more on luck than skill, and the game is more frustrating than entertaining. I've rewritten this review about 3 or 4 times now to try and soften the blow, but I just can't think of a nice thing to compliment beyond the art and the music. The gameplay is totally unfun, and outright designed to ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\nFirst and foremost, unlike every RPG or J-RPG ever made, your party doesn't carry over between adventures. You always start from scratch, so there's never a feeling of accomplishment.\n\nNext, the game runs at a break neck pace (especially later on). This is kind of fun at first, until you have to start juggling things like levels ups, equipment management, special abilities, healing, and shifting people to where they need to go. You never have time to think, and the game sadistically punishes you if you blink. Didn't get a useful item out of your inventory the second it appeared? RANDOM EVENT! LOSE ALL YOUR ITEMS! Took a second too long to trigger a special ability? Too bad, your guy is dead now. Didn't realize that one of the enemies is stealing your items whenever he attacks? Awe, I'm sure those potions you were stockpiling weren't completely vital. All of this is especially annoying since you need to keep juggling characters around like crazy. Why? Because their special abilities tend to rely on enemies taking swings at them. If there's no enemy attacking them then they don't charge, and if you aren't careful then puny ones like your healers will die before they're fully charged.\n\nThirdly, most of the unlocks are basic functions that should have been in the game from the getgo. I honestly feel like this was planned as a phone app, since you have to pay to get basic functions. You have to beat 75% of the game just to get the ability to choose which characters you want to use (otherwise you have to play a slot machine style 'click a button until a three characters that work well together come up' game, at ten gold a pop (and ten gold is a pittance, so this is purely to pad gameplay time)). You also have to pay to unlock the stores, which never hold more than three random items. At least one of these should have been unlocked from the start, because playing the main dungeons before buying one is just throwing your time away.\n\nFinally, the random number generator is garbage. Leveled up your magic user? Choose between luck (kind of useless), charisma (completely useless), or physical damage (useless to magic users). Leveled up a brawler? How about luck, charisma, or magic damage? It is a complete crap shoot whether you'll get level ups that actually allow you to kill things, or at least stop them from killing you. It is unbelievably frustrating when a run ends simply because you couldn't get any defensive or offensive power going, due simply to the terribly level up system.\n\nTL;DR: It looks cute, but there's no content or sense of accomplishment here. Often your defeats are because the RNG didn't like you, or else you just couldn't juggle all the balls it throws at you non-stop. And to top it off, it's amazingly short of content for the price range it's in. I don't recommend it even on a sale.","May 24","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
