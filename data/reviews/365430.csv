While it's certainly interesting, it's nothing unique, as we've seen this plenty of times in games like "A Link to the Past", "Soul Reaver", and even Edmund McMillen's, "Time F**k".\n\nHowever, if the only reason we played games was to experience something COMPLETELY unique, then we'd have dismissed so many great games out there for being "Zelda knock-offs" and "Mario clones". It's always fun to see how a different developer would take on certain mechanics, and the way that EBW combines this mechanic with other mechanics seen in games makes it enjoyable.\n\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. Sometimes the level design feels EXTREMELY arbitrary. You will see walls and spikes placed for no reason at all, because unless you're going completely off course, you're not going to come in contact with them. Another flaw I find with it is that there's zero customization. I can't change the controls or even select which level I want to play. It's always "continue".\n\n\nAlso, the game's data seems to all be compiled into one executable so there's no modding support, but that's not really an obligation, so I'm not going to hold that against them. Just putting that out there for "modding enthusiasts".\n\n\n\nOverall 6/10, would recommend playing and beating.","April 23, 2015","true","0.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

The game was challenging and it is a great example of how solid game play and mechanics can make for an interesting experience without great graphical glamour.\n\nThat being said the game is short and very basic so I suggest getting it for cheap.","April 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The game is very simple from the beginning, and has very simple controls. Very quickly however, it turns up the heat with very challenging platforming, and reallly makes you stop and think about your next move. This game really gets you thinking about every single move you make, and very few games now a days do that. It also has a very quirky and awesome soundtrack.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple, yet challenging game for a great price look no further.\n\n8/10  Overall","May 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

I have no idea why, but I would advise you stay away until the problem is fixed.\n\n(Running Windows 7 btw.)","April 4","false","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
