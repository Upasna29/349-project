"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/recommended/396390/","PinkLily","(♥) Pink Lily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLily/","1355 products in account","You and your sisters are running a Puppy Rescue Center. Each has a responsibility.\nBarbie is in charge of doing the actual recue of each puppy in the neighborhood on her bike.\nYou play as her and you get a set of objectives that must be completed. As you progress you play as all the sisters as you work on the objectives in order to get the puppy adopted out.\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nYou get a phone call on your cell phone and this is how each rescue begins!\nEventually you get a map of the town. You are suppose to get on your bike and follow the arrow which guides you roughly where to go. Keep in mind that sometimes it points to an area that you can't ride your bike into. Once you find the puppy you must sometimes are required to lure the puppy to you by watching for what the puppy needs on screen.\n\nRescue Center\nOnce you are able to pick up the puppy you bring it back to the rescue center.\n(You then play as Skipper; Barbies sister) The first thing you have to do is check for a microchip using the scanner, (all this is automatic) if there is none you will be prompted to name the puppy yourself. After that you play minigames including removing fleas in which you get rewarded with 10 bones. Finally the puppy is sent to 1 of 3 kennels, eventually being able to earn 2 more at 400 bones each. Kennel#6 will cost 500 bones!\n\nRescue Center- Kennel\nOnce the puppy is in the kennel there are a series of objectives you must complete. An Example would be training the puppy in a quick time event.  In this event for example you are told which buttons you press at what time in order to perform the requested performance in that course event.\n\nThe puppy needs to be 100% rested before you can move onto the next objective. The last of the objectives is getting the puppy adopted.\n\nGameplay: Breakdown\n\nThe 6 objectives in order are: Note you do 1 in each only and are random for each puppy!\n\n#1: Finding the puppy by going through the town.\nAn example of a place the puppy can be is a construction zone.\n\n#2: Returning to the shelter with puppy OR sometimes you will be prompted with\n(Puppy Rescue) Earn Trust: You must Coaz the puppy to come out of hiding.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579940981\n\n#3: (Puppy Treatment) Vaccination / Remove Fleas\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579941466\nNote: You play as skipper in puppy treatment.\n\n#4: (Puppy Training) Agility Training / Obedience\nNote: You play as Stacie in Puppy Training.\n\n#5: (Puppy Grooming) Bath / Clip Nails / Brush Teeth\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579948489\nNote: You play as Chelsea in grooming the puppies.\n\n#6: (Puppy Adoption) Graduation. Finding the best person to adopt the puppy based\non personality match up.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579955572\n\nYou can also Customize Kennel\nYou can Add or Change stuff for fun and to reduce rest time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579949629\n\nAdoption\nOnce the puppies are adopted you have to find them an owner by looking at people and their compatibility applications at the kennel, being the last step. You have to look at the applications\nto see if they match someone on the list. The game will tell you if they are or not.\nThe person is than called to come meet their new puppy.\n\nSome of the breeds found in game are: Shiba Inus, Labradors, beagles, huskeys, Dalmations\n\nCons- These are based on my experience\nDownsides of the game are that there are that you have to figure out things on your own, the controls are awkward, the camera controls could be better. The game does not tell you what to do with the puppy when you first get one.\n\nPros- The game is cute and loads of puppies to rescue! Once you get past the cons you begin to really enjoy the game. It kinda reminds me of the sims game in the sense of the environment which I found neat. I also think this is a really good game for achievement Hunters! The game should not prove to be that difficult to get 100% for those interested in such task.\n\nRecommendations: Don't lose your bike when in search for the puppy.\nYou will be auto returned once you found the puppy only not if you lose it before.\nDon't spend a lot in upgrading your kenel since you will lose all upgrades once puppy is adopted.\n\nUpdate: They recently added cards! You know what this means? Barbie cards, emoticon and backgrounds!!! @_@!

Fatal errors! Crashes! Broken saves and more. And no it is not my pc, if you look it up on youtube, you will see them get the bluescreen as well!\nBut if you try to ignore all those horrible flaws, like I have and still wanna give it a go. I promise you, you will not play longer than 15 minutes and be bored already!\nBut as you can see I have played  for hours, because I'm a perfectionist and I wanted to unlock all the achievements, but ♥♥♥♥ it! Not worth it! I promise you DEATH is more fun than this game. DEATH!!!

It may seem like it is a casual game but it is not. The minigames are extremely hard to finish and it takes a lot of grinding to finish as well, I reccomend you play and complete Dreamhouse party atleast once before you try and attempt this game. That will teach you the basics of the series.","December 23, 2015","true","5.7"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","76","38","50","31","1"
