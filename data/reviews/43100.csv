Turns out the World of Zoo group was apparently laid off by Blue Fang, leaving half of the PC version incomplete. SOOOOO DON'T EXPECT TO GET THE REST OF THOSE ANIMALS ON PC ANY TIME SOON.\n\nOther than that, if you've got no beef with the above I'd say buy it, it's really fun, I'm just a little peeved I don't get the game I was expecting. Know what you're getting into.\n\nYes I'm mostly upset I can't have a virtual Croc buddy. I was excited due to the fact that I haven't got a Wii and I've wanted this game for a while now.\n\nA little let down, but it is a game meant for children, not 22 year olds with no life and tons of time on their hands. Feeling a little ripped off, glad I didn't buy it at full price, thanks Blue Fang. At least make some DLC for the rest of the animals or somethin?\n","January 4, 2015","false","8.9"," 115 of 126 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","115","126","21","1"

A bit childish, but if you like cute animals or have a young kid to entertain it's a good way to pass the time. There is a nice variety of animals and plenty to do with them, toys to play with, and stuff to feed them. You can even design your own animals (fur pattern, body type, etc) to an extent. My only real wish is that you could rename the animals. Overall, not a bad game if you like cute, casual games. If you have a touchscreen laptop/monitor, it can be even more fun. And it runs fine on Windows 8, if that's what you happen to have.","December 1, 2013","true","2.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

Did they think we wouldn't notice because, perhaps, are kids wouldn't tell us thst half the game is missing. Do they enjoy ripping off small children? With out the additional animals the game can be completed in an hour. Did they think are kids would just keep playing the same game over and over agian? Why do they call it a zoo when they're are only five or six different types of animals to began with? Why did I pay fifteen dollars for half of a game? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A HUGE RIP OFF! I tell you. I don't understand? How hard it would have been to add the rest of the game to the pc when other platforms already have? More people play the pc than any other platforms. This is a serious marketing mistake. The people at Blue Fang should all be fired. No, wait, I'm firing them and will never buy a Blue Fang game agian for the pc.","January 24","false","10.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","0"

It's supposed to be a kid's game, but nothing wrong with getting in touch with your inner child every now and then. Originally bought this for when I watch my 4 year old nephew just to keep him occupied, but I found that I enjoy it as much as he does! Of course I had to operate the controls for him at first, but he caught on pretyy quickly and can play it on his own mostly now. It's  very entertaining for us both, and his reactions to the animals are priceless! Every now and then I'll play a half hour of it myself, kind of a refreshing change of pace from my usual games and a good time killer too. If you have a kid, get it. They will love it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathewmii/recommended/43100/","mathewmii","Mathew Mii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathewmii/","74 products in account","When I decide on games to buy for the Wii, I had one rule that prevent bowing money on bad games: Never buy a game from a third company except Okami.  World of Zoo is a good reason for the rule, even though I payed for this game dirt cheap on Steam instead of buying it for my Wii.  I do praise the game for being gentle on PC parts, temperature wise; I also praise it for including animal customization, believable animal sounds, a fun art style, and the attempt to be educational.  However, the game play is very poor from the controls, mechanics, and a lack of challenge.\n\nI will start with the controls.  I understand that this game is on the Nintendo Wii and the controls were meant for the Wii-Mote pointing at the screen.  The transition from Wii-Mote to mouse and keyboard went well, but I am very concerned about the left-handed people who want to play this.  Unless they go through the control panel, there is no way to play this on left handed mode.  In game, the clicking commands do not work 100% of the time.\n\nThere is another in game issue and those are the mechanics, or how the game works.  The first thing that irks me is the fact that you are a camera stick in one position with the only movement being pivoting from the spot.  This causes some of the clicking command issues I have mentioned earlier.  For example, there was a treasure that was behind a play set structure.  Most of the clicks landed on the structure instead of the treasure spot.  If I had the ability to move my camera around more freely, stuff like that could have been prevented.  The animals also have response issues, especially since there is no ability to pick a specific one for separate commanding.  The last complaint in this department is the use of an annoying video game trope.  I don't know what it is called, but here's how it functions: You keep playing the game to unlock a needed thing, but it is useless because there is no more game play value (Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Time/Darkness is guilty for this, but I can't explain why because it will contain spoilers).  Going back to World of Zoo, the game made me play one enclosure for a long time with 2 animals just to unlock certain parts to create my ideal 3rd creature.  This is indeed optional, but nobody should have to deal with the struggle of staying awake in boredom for a creature that will barely be played with once the player leaves the exhibit.\n\nSpeaking of struggling with wakefulness, the game lacks a good challenge.  Having a "needs" bars like hunger and sleepiness would be a good fix to this issue.  The challenges the game provides are too easy and they are not leveled according to animal count.  I know that this game is meant for kids, but that does not excuse it from this issue.  The Super Mario series are for kids, but they provide fair challenges that even stump some adults.\n\nOverall, this is not a good game to buy because of controls, mechanics, and a lack of challenge.  If you are a parent looking for educational material covering animals for your kids, I would pass this game and have them watch Zaboomafoo instead.","May 25, 2015","false","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

I seriously can’t recommend this to any gamer who is serious about gaming. While the name does bring up some Zoo Tycoon references, it plays absolutely nothing like it. If Nintendogs ever went zoo mode, this would be it.  You spend the entire game poking the animal you are taking care of, while also feeding them enough food to cause diabetes. Each and every animal have the same two personalities; happy because you pamper them and utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you’re a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zoo keeper. Apparently alligators do chase their tails, and lions won’t kill you if you chuck a beach ball at them. Total lack of realism in a flipping zoo game, sorry can’t recommend.","August 8, 2012","false","18.2"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","10","37","0","6"

It has many silly moments and is more of an up close type of sim game that allows players to do many fun things in any almost any order they choose, like playing fetch with or tickling thier zoo animals in a warmly animated habitat versus a top-down corporate task-list execution. I got the game with a THQ bundle years ago. World of zoo is a fun zookeeper simulator that allows you to play with many different animals (over 90 different species) found in most zoos. There is a variety of animals which you can choose from or sort of 'breed' your own by choosing what traits they have, such as fur color, sub-species, tails, ears, etc. It is simple and easy to start out, obviosuly they had kids in mind, and there are tons of activitties to keep your zoo animals, and the players entertained. Some activities are basic like feeding and grooming, but they include closer interactions and "cute"-scenes where the player is inticed to pet or treat, or perfom a medical scan.\n\nAs a player progresses and completes challenges and plays with individual animals they level-up and gain access to more tools, treats, and playset for each animal exhibit. Players also later have the option to add more of the same family of an animal to an exhibit, such as multiple monkies in the "Small Monkies" exihibit or Zebras and wild horses in the "Horses" exihibt. There an online portion too whihc allows for sharing soem content and mutiplayer care-taking with freinds or family, though we have nto really explored that option. I reccomend this game if you have children, or you yourself like to spend some time with a funny warm-hearted virtual animal care-taking environment.","August 15, 2014","true","53.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
