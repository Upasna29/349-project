It has a military theme with tanks, artillery and soldiers to control. Use each types special abilities. Like the Foot Soldiers ability to climb hills and mountains. Play alone against or with AI enemies. Multiplayer is also an option with or against 5 of your friends. Randomized maps with a variety of terrains.\nMultiple game mades to choose from.\n\nhttp://www.steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=613784328","February 24","true","1.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

And it is ok.  The controls work well, the rules function as a concept, the layout simple.  However, this game is boring.  It is not any fun.  A game can work well, but still suck.  The point is to be entertained.  Probably won't ever play it again after about 1.5 hours of giving it my honest effort.","April 10","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll got some serious fun once you understand the rules about resources and how to manage movement and combat phases. Random maps are well built, different terrain tiles and fog of war (god bless it) encourage players to think twice before a move.","February 28","true","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Also can't get the music to shut off without turning all sound off..  Once fixed I will change my rating..\n\n1st Edit.. designers are responding to the first problem, seems to be effecting the "no survivors" game mode. Conquer and decapitation modes seem to work. However, I have not seen a response yet for the inability to turn off the music without turning off all sound.\n\nI will update this review when both are verified fixed.\n\n2nd Edit.. v1.81 fixed the problem with the "no survivors" game mode. Also found out the sound issue was a misunderstanding as the sound controls are a bit confusing. Apparently the music slider scales the sound effects and the speaker slider scales the music.\n\nWith the above.. this is a very good, and simple quick to learn, wargame. Even though there are only 3 units (not including a general in the decapitation mode) there is plenty of strategy and no micromanagement. For a quick and dirty wargame at a reasonable price and with good developer support I would recommend it to the casual wargamer.\n\nThanks.","April 5","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
