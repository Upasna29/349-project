A must have.\n\nCons:\n- it is an AGS game, which means rather pixelated graphics, if you do mind that side of adventure gaming, -\n- and not very comfy interface: scrolling between possible actions means pressing RMB a lot;\n- still, the biggest disadvantage for me was that the game is too mature in its themes, even more than old and racy Sierra games. I have no idea why the authors decided to put so much innuendo into it. There is quite a number of indicencies in 'Al Emmo' - that suit neither the good taste nor the setting of the 19 c. Wild West!\n\nPros:\n- Why, the protagonist! 42-year old 'anti-hero' is somebody you rarely meet in games as your alter ego;\n- Humor is mostly quite good, if you can bear the noted innuendo topics;\n- 2D graphics, voices, and writing are excellent indeed. John Bell who plays the Narrator is especially great;\n- That game has so many details thrown into it that a single walkthrough could possbily show you only 1/10 of the game's capacity! Each location has at least half a dozen of active objects in it, and every single action you perform with any of them gives you a special comment. That's how they used to make games in 1980's, you know...\n- That richness of details gives a whole new light to achievements, which are very interesting here and make you want to play the game again and again while searching for more easter eggs :)","May 12, 2014","true","18.5"," 56 of 71 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","56","71","0","0"

A time when adventure games had lots of screens, many of which were just graphical interludes to walk through. Where your inventory quickly swelled with dozens of items, and visual clues telling you what to pick up were considered patronizing.Al Emmo isn’t just old-school; it’s total old-school immersion that’ll thrill genre-lovers and the pathologically curious. It does its best to be funny, with an every-line-as-joke approach similar to Sam & Max.Interacting with the environment uses a similar method to Full Throttle, where you can interact with anything using your hand (examine), eyes (get/use) or tongue (speak). It’s not as elegant as the LucasArts implementation, but serves its purpose well enough.Puzzles are, with a few exceptions, all inventory-based, although there are a few light action sequences. There are a few clunkers in the bunch, but most of the puzzles that I came up against maintained the right balance between challenging and frustrating. On the music front, there's not much to be said. I found the score fairly negligible, consisting mostly of variations on old west themes that we've heard in pretty much every western game that's come out before this one. While I was quite impressed with the content of the game, Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine is probably one of the tougher games to recommend, as much will depend on what people expect. For those seeking a complete throwback to the classic adventures of old, Al Emmo certainly delivers in many respects.","September 14, 2014","true","30.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

It's full of in-jokes and bad puns, which is a plus to anyone who wants a good laugh. The puzzles are pretty intuitive and with some thought can be easily solved with time. There were a couple minor things that I found mildly offensive, but not enough to diminish my overall experience.

The game was built in Adventure Game Studio, or AGS, back in 2006. This is an enhanced edition of that project, improving the animation and voice acting. It's actually really impressive for an AGS game, especially considering the original game is 8 years old now.\n\nAl Emmo tries very, very hard to emulate the Sierra adventure game formula. If I didn't know better, I'm sure that I could easily be convinced that this is Sierra's "Wild West Quest" It has the Sierra style interface, a snarky narrator that will squabble with Al, and lots of humor.\n\nI've been enjoying the game so far, and if you like quirky humor with the Sierra style of adventure mechanics, you will too!","May 17, 2014","true","1.2"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

Talk to everyone, click on everthing and think outside the box. Unlike todays action games it is not a series of quick mouse clicks and constant explosions.

There are all kinds of unique narrator responses, which makes trying all kinds of silly actions all the more fun.\n\nThe interface is very clear with labeled hotspots and easy to use controls.

At this price you can hardly go wrong.\n\nSome people in the reviews have complained about the risque humor. Well, I liked it.

A retro styled point & click adventure game that takes inspiration from the golden era of Sierra and Lucasarts. While the game is quite old now, I still remember first buying it almost ten years ago when Telltale Games were selling it on their store. I enjoyed it back then and I like the improvements to this new enhanced edition. The game is a very niche title made for adventure game fans from a specific era. The newer generation of gamers who are unaccustomed to this style of old school adventure games may be left scratching their heads and they may not understand what the appeal is. But as a gamer of the golden era I absolutely revel in a game where every single item has a unique description and there's a large, dangerous and very descriptive open land to explore with interesting characters and quests to solve. Yes, this game has all that and more. It's classic Sierra adventure, through and through.\n\nIt's a bold risk on the developer's part to use such a non-heroic character for their protagonist, but I don't think the game suffers for it. In fact I found that I actually got attached to the little guy! A few little quirks here and there can't override a solid adventure gaming experience. It's a thumbs up from me.","September 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It's nice to see that things have been continually improved upon in this new Steam edition with enhancements to both the visuals and voices. I think this is a rather under-rated adventure game, tbh. Game has many throwbacks to retro Sierra adventures. The game world has unique narration vocals for everything you can possibly look, interact and talk with! And every inventory item in the game has NPCs saying unique lines when showing them your items. In an era where most new adventure games trim the fat, so to speak, by limiting interactions and forcing players to use a single 'smart' cursor to cover all interactions, it's refreshing to see this adventure has a very descriptive world where the level of interactive modes and descriptions invites you to explore further instead of just guiding you along a binary path where they can either interact or not interact with a hotspot. The characters were all interesting enough to hold my attention and the story is just 'there', I suppose, but it never left me feeling bored or made my thoughts wander off. This game's sense of humor will probably resonate more with some people than others, as much of the humor is slapstick innuendo. Personally, I liked it and felt the quality of the writing was quite high. Your mileage may vary with the jokes though. Puzzles were well placed and seemed to be set to just the right difficulty. I was never stumped for too long, but also never really felt that anything was unfairly illogical. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Al Emmo and it's a recommend from me.","July 18, 2015","true","6.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BahamutSean/recommended/296850/","BahamutSean","Sean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BahamutSean/","2090 products in account","Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine (AEatLDM) was a point & click adventure game that I honestly didn't think I would bother playing, but I had it from buying bundles it featured in, so I gave it a go while keeping my expectations cautiously low.\n\nSo the narrative revolves around a middle-aged balding virgin named Al Emmo who ventures to a small town to meet his bride.... who he paid for. However, when she meets him and it turns out that he has no cash to his name, she quickly leaves. Emmo is then awestruck by another lady and sets out upon his mission to win her heart through a series of ideas to impress her and also make himself a little cash over the course of 9 chapters of varying length. The entire game hinges on the way this story plays out and Emmo's comedic interactions with everyone around him (and also how the narrator berates Emmo for being a useless human being). The game has many short-comings, but comedy is definitely not one of them. I found the game was able to make me laugh a lot, cringe often, chuckle every few minutes, and it even managed to develop a sort of bond (through pity) for the hapless Emmo. Unfortunately this game suffers almost everywhere outside of the writing though. One of these areas is the way the game is broken down in to chapters, with each chapter being a new day. Some chapters are quite long, but there are a couple where you literally have to find a couple of items and they only take 5 minutes. The pacing of the game never quite feels right because of this.\n\nAs a computer game, AEatLDM plays incredibly slowly... even for a point & click game this plays slowly (which is really saying something). Every animation feels clunky, and Emmo himself moves so painfully slowly that you could die of boredom when transitioning screens. Some items are quite obvious that you can interact with them, but some are part of the pre-rendered background and are not obvious at all which leads to the game feeling padded as you often have to re-visit areas to find items you did not pick up earlier. There is a quick travel system that allows you to go to quickly visit about 5 landmark areas which probably saved me from just quitting this game completely, but even with the fast-travel it still felt like a chore re-visiting old areas. Aside from the slow gameplay, the puzzles are often not very logical. While this is to be expected in a comedic game, it can seriously hamper players trying to progress as answers often do not make sense. While the gameplay itself is tedious, for the most part this does not stop me enjoying point & click adventure games, however the final boss requires some quite precise movement (and timing) which this game simply was not designed for. The final boss ends up being an incredibly messy affair where even if you are doing the right thing you will still end up dying over & over again due to the frustrating movement of Emmo.\n\nNow if you have actually loaded up AEatLDM, you may have noticed something straight away... the game is ugly. The cartoon cut-scenes are actually quite well done, but the game uses low resolution and during gameplay you will be staring at some very pixelated scenes that are usually saturated with yellow sand. The graphics are just about good enough to get by, but there is nothing good to actually say about them (so I wont). You can mostly tell what item is what, and what is actually happening on the screen, but due to the low resolution there are no small details that you can admire. What you see is what you get, and nothing more.\n\nThe sound is at odds to the graphics in that they are actually quite good (mostly). The voice-acting is clear, and every character has a distinct voice. The soundtrack is not particularly inspiring though, which is a little annoying considering there is often a lot of "adventuring" between your conversations. Also, there is one character who has TERRIBLE voice-acting and scripting. The barman, who Emmo meets at least once every day, has some of the worst voice-acting I have ever heard. His scripting does not come across as realistic and his voice sounds like it was recorded in a garage on a 20 year-old microphone. It is a real shame as that one characters brings down the rest of the game when everyone else is actually quite well written and voiced.\n\nThis may sound odd after mostly pointing out the game's various flaws, but I actually enjoyed what time I spent with Emmo. This is not a good game at all, but it is a decent comedy. If you like laughing, and also point & click games, then give this a go. It certainly has a very unique charm.\n\nP.S. a final note of warning to those of you that are achievement hunters: avoid this game.\nThe achievements are mostly very well hidden and rather cryptic. I completed the game and only managed 5 of 20. I dont mind this, but I know some people might find that off-putting.","May 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

I got my eye on you, videogame.","January 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 15 people (7%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","7","1","15","3","0"

It has absolutely terrible animation, one of the worst dialogues I've seen in any game, and introduces a thoroughly unlikeable protagonist. And oh, I could not figure out a way of skipping it. After this experience, I just couldn't find myself playing this game. As a fan of point'n'click adventures, I was all excited to play another one - but now I know it will just sit in my library and wait until I run out of other games to play.\n\nI may update this review in unforseeable future.","May 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 45 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","6","45","0","0"
