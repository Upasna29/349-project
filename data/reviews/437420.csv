"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/437420/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Sara Pennington thought she could breathe a little after defeating the traitor in the Order of Griffins. However, the artefacts she retrieved are unstable and cause damage, eventually killing her father. In order to prevent that fate, she has to go back in time and find the kingdom of King Amedon, Aeronheart...\n\nWhile you didn't really need to play the first game, which isn't on Steam, to understand The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent, I think that it's better to play the sequel before Ancient Times.  But even without the previous knowledge, the game in itself is very understandable. The storyline is also well-done, as many twists are also present and given how the game ended, you know that there will be a fourth game (already released elsewhere). I just hope that Artifex Mundi got also the rights to publish New Horizon (the first game) and Beyond Time (the fourth) so that we will have the whole saga on Steam.\n\nThe gameplay hasn't really changed from the last game: you're still picking items, solving puzzles, clearing list of hidden objects (whether it's a written list or a pictured one). You have also a little helper, a little baby Griffin that can fly and take things for you when you can't access them (unless the game is requiring you to use a ladder...).\n\nThe game is now more oriented towards fantasy, as the famous kindgom, existing towards 3500 ACN, is based on a medevial society with champions and on fantasy as you have dragons and griffins in it. Anyway, you don't know if you're in another world or if you're really in the past. Besides, Cyrus and Zerina, the brother and sister turned evil, are also two sides of a coin: one is living in a palace in the desert and the other was more attracted to an icy landscape. King Amedon was somewhat in the middle...\n\nThe graphics were nice: I loved the mythical realm but you didn't get in it immediately, as you begin first at the HQ of the secret order before visiting London in the 19th century. After that, you're stuck in Aeronheart and the bonus chapter is telling you a tale set directly after your adventure, where, again, the fantasy is the main theme: dwarves, elves and fairies will be in the center of it.\n\nI loved the soundtrack too, even if it was always the same tune whether you were in the desert or in the ice land.\n\nIn other words, The Secret Order 3 is a nice sequel, very well constructed and leaving you with a cliffhanger of some sorts. As usual, Artifex Mundi chose well and I'll be happy if I see in the Upcoming List the fourth game. I don't know if it's an hint from Artifex or if it was already inside when the game was released before Artfiex but there is a banner with Beyond Time inside the game. So, yeah, I do hope that it will arrive in 2016 on Steam.","March 16","true","3.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/437420/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Another ring of the telephone signals danger as our heroine Sara Pennington is called upon to save the day once again. The Secret Order 3: Ancient Times takes place directly after the events of the second game in the series, however, it isn’t necessary to play previous installments to understand the story in this selection. This game is a colorful point-and-click adventure filled with hidden item scenes, plenty of puzzles and an enthralling story that follows Sara through many mystical lands.\n\nWhen you begin the game you get a brief overview of what happened in the second game to bring players up to speed. The main thing to know is there were two artifacts collected filled with immense power that now pose a danger to everyone. Sara is directed to once again travel through time with the goal of going to where the artifacts were created, the Kingdom of Aeronhart, and destroy them to stop present-day events. While at first you travel to London’s past, most of the game is spent in a mystical land called Aeronhart so there isn’t much time travel to be had actually. Once there the game turns more to high fantasy as you fly on griffins and battle against magical powers. Sara must help the people of Aeronhart to forward the story and gain access to the artifacts she’s searching for before time runs out.\n\nEverything is point and click, using your mouse to move from each area of the map and to click on items and people for interactions. You collect items that are used elsewhere, like a rope or crystal that join your inventory. You also have two very useful aids in the game, the first a baby griffin who can help you reach items that are higher up since it can fly. It’s utterly adorable and rests on the lower right side of your screen. The second is a golem’s heart which has magic that can control stone statues. You can power it up more and more throughout the game and use it to control different stone things. Puzzles and hidden object scenes are also a huge feature in this game. Puzzles come in a good bit of variety; there are slide puzzles, matching games, pipe puzzles and a host of other ones. There are two different types of hidden object scenes in the game, the traditional list of words and a scene to find said items in and another type where you have the items at the bottom in a scene.\n\nAll parts of the game come to life with beautiful colors and well drawn scenes. The game does not disappoint visually, except the people themselves. While they’re drawn well, the animation when they talk is a bit odd, their eyes are lifeless and their mouths move unnaturally. That being said, it’s the only visual issue I found in the game and not a major one. The art is good, the hidden object scenes are well done and the items are not blurry or too hard to find if you have bad eyes. The music as well for the game is lovely, the score helps set the mood of the narrative.\n\nThis game is a great addition to the library of any hidden object fan or anyone who is looking to get into the genre. I found some of the puzzles a little easy as well as some of the hidden object scenes however but this may help with those after the achievements. No achievements are based on what difficulty you play under or if you complete everything without hints or skips so it’s not hard to gain all of them. The game also has Steam trading cards and a bonus level that continues Sara’s story a little bit more. While the game may be on the short side -I finished in four hours- it was time well-spent and a satisfying experience. The Secret Order 3: Ancient Times is a great example of strong storytelling mixed with a fun gaming experience.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]","April 6","true","4.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/437420/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","Another very solid casual adventure game published by Artifex Mundi.\n\nIt helps for the start of the story to know the previous game, but you can easily get into the game without having played the prequel. The story is pretty straight forward and most of it is set in a fantasy world.\n\nThe presentation is well done. Just the quality of the videos and the voice acting is sub par. Both don't affect the game much though and the graphics are just beautiful. The music suits the setting and doesn't get annoying.\n\nSome of the puzzles/minigames are way too easy and only consist of matching shapes and/or colors. The achievements in this game are also aimed at a *very* casual audience. The inventory based puzzles are much better though and they easily outweigh the weaker aspects of the game.\n\nThe bonus chapter seems a bit rushed though with a lot of 'find x similar items to use in the next minigame' puzzles. Still the artwork and also the story make it worth at least one playthrough.\n\nOverall another fun casual adventure game that you can sink a couple of hours in.","March 12","true","8.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The puzzles in this game were harder than those in the previous and I ended up skipping four or five of them since I just got so fed up with them. Also, this game has a less linear plot than the last, which is a good thing, though it was not particularly logical. Overall, a fine game, but the second one was much better.","May 13","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
