The combat system is more in line with the Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale games i.e.  Combat is in real time but you can pause the action with the space bar to issue commands.\n\nAs other reviewers have stated the English translation and voice acting are terrible but can often be (unintentionally) amusing.  However bad the translation is it does not prevent you from following the plot or understanding what to do next.\n\nThe minimum spec graphics card for this game is nVIDIA GeForce 6600/ATI Radeon X800, 128 MB.  I have an nVIDIA 8800 GT 512MB and it was working overtime running this game with the default settings.  I recommend changing all graphic settings to Low.  I honestly couldn't see much difference after I did.\n\nDon't go the desktop when the game is running.  When you try to go back to the game it often slows to a crawl and you have to shutdown the game through task manager.\n\nThe game is pretty unforgiving early on so I can offer the following tips to prevent you having to restart like I did.\n* Put all your skill points into melee combat so you can actually hit the enemy\n* Wait until you have earned two perk points then select the Botanist perk (Botanist gives you extra skill points when you level up).\n* Don't complete side quests until you have recruited all of your comrades (the last one being Demon).\n\nI've played through the entire game and didn't encounter any major bugs.\n\nHope this helps.","November 16, 2014","true","107.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Somewhere in-between the Russian version to the English version, the intended gritty setting got lost. However the much lesser English version is now hilariously funny due to the lacking voice work.\nIt's like watching one of those B-movies and having a "good time" by making fun of it, but along the way you find a thing or two you enjoy.\n\nSo if you'd like a laugh, and if you can stand some localization hickups then I'm sure you'll have a mildly good time with it .","April 19, 2014","true","0.9"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","39","53","0","1"

When I regained my consciousness, two men with meat cleavers stood in front of me. Disco music started playing and I killed my first opponent by kicking him in the balls. The next guy took a few punches into his faces, but I won. I took their clothes off and put on a poncho. Suddenly, a man without pants crawled towards me and told me to finish him off. With the words "You like that, scumbag?" he received a kick into his head. Then, I took out my recently acquired meat cleaver and started hitting him, but I kept missing. Finally, he was dead. I proceeded my journey and suddenly there were another two men who wanted to see me dead. They were strong, but luckily I could eat three potatoes just before I died and so I beat them. I carried on and reached a village. The guard in front of the gates shouted "My spear overcomes yours!" and he threw his spear at me. It pierced me but it didn't stop me, and so we ran at each other and with a single hit in the head he went down. Afterwards, I entered the village and I stood in front of three men with assault rifles and shotguns. Even my potatoes couldn't save me this time.\n\nSo far, I had a lot of fun. The game mechanics are alright, the dialogues are cheesy and sometimes you just can't avoid laughing. However, it's laggy. Every second the game freezes for a few frames which is very annoying.\nBut still, Planet Alcatraz is definitely worth a try.\n\nUpdate:\nRule #1 in Russian games: Somewhere, sometime, you are going to find a bottle of vodka. Now I understand why there are so many potatoes in this game.","November 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","20","24","16","0"

A russian baby that couldn't talk but otherwise had the best attributes of both. The gameplay is basically Fallout with RTWP combat, and the story (if you can deciper it) works pretty well (good justification for why gear would ramp up the way it does, and a lot of scrounging).\n\nThe game is surprisingly fun as long as you can ignore the voiceovers and can translate some of the translations. Don't necessarily expect a huge number of non-combat solution to problems (you will be fighting a lot) but there appears to be a large number of alternative resolutions to quests (i.e. who you side with).

You're an imperial soldier sent as an undercover convict to a penal colony on Planet Alzatraz with a mission to sabotage a spacecraft the convicts are building to escape the planet. The landing pod crashes, you are separated from your teammates, get captured and thrown in a labor camp. Because of your excellent build and opportunistic tendencies, you quickly rise through the ranks and become the go-to person for many Planet Alcatraz inhabitants, who have 25 hours' worth of quests for you.\n\nThe RPG-style 3rd person game lets you build your skills, as well as those of the members from your old squad which you pick up along the way. Overall, the game offers 2 major mission campaigns with dozens of places to investigate and clear out, and a final push through 3 extremely difficult areas to reach a shuttle and escape Planet Alcatraz. At one point, you're required to find item F for person E who has unfinished business with person D who first wants person C dead, but they turn out to be dead, and the trail is found with person B last seen at location A but it turns out he's actually held captive at location Z... this is just an example.\n\nPros - Immersive storyline and missions which get you really enthused to level up in the right skills. Fair hit system, smooth gameplay (although the animations are quite wooden), generous XP and money rewards for quests.\n\nCons - The storyline is pretty linear. It gives you the illusion that you can play both sides, but in the end you're left with no choice with regards to your loyalty. The developers could have spent more time developing alternative endings. Graphics aren't the best since the game came out in 2009. There isn't really a big variety of weapons, most are absolutely worthless and there's only 2-3 ones worthwhile keeping. Not many places to go for XP. Enemies can be permanently elimiated, so once you clear out an area it stays clear after re-loading the area.","January 1","true","25.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

That's all I SHOULD say. But I feel the need to explain.\nThe worst voice acting I have ever encountered and I am including Gemini Wars in that comparison. It sounds as if one guy did the voices for all the characters.\nThe character sprites are a mess.\nThe graphics are not TOO bad considering the game as a whole.\nI like RPG games and can forgive them a lot. IF you can get past the voice and the horrific translation work then it is enjoyable but considering this is the same people who brought us Space wolves.... Yeah....\nThe story is there but I have trouble finding it. You know the objective of the game from the start, it sits at the top of your quest log. The problem is you are never given this quest. You simply start with it. You are given no back story for your character, No idea why you are there or what you are supposed to do.\nThe other unfortunate thing is the dire need for a spell checker. A copy and paste into a word processor can solve any number of problems, there are many free programs that would have done the job.\nThe music score is nice though, has a catchy tune I like.\nThe RPG system is a little limiting, almost Spartan in its design. It is a modification of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system used by the FALLOUT games. All they have done is change Endurance for Constitution. It works well and like Fallout you must weigh up what you will need at the games start against what you will need later as more and better weapons become available. It is a tried and tested equation that makes sense.\nThere are a lot of good idea's in this game and some even come to work well, but the game as a whole has just got too many weights around its ankle to stay a float.\n\nStory: Absent presumed dead.\nGraphics: Passable.\nVoice acting:  Monotone and mismatched.\nTranslation: Lost there-in.\nGame play: Relatively straightforward.\nQuest continuity: Following its own tail.","April 18, 2014","false","2.1"," 49 of 113 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","49","113","0","7"
