The game was also later ported to the iOS due to it's popularity on the PC platform.\n\nI am normally not a massive fan of puzzle type games like this as I just find my self aimlessly trying to figure out what to do for hours on end. Thankfully Unmechanical offers puzzles whilst challenging, but also offer a logical resolution to them unlike other games in this genre. You can often work out what you need to do on each puzzle within a few minutes of analyzing the surrounding scene. The puzzles can range from light reflecting puzzles, to memory puzzles. In fact, I have to say, I can't remember (ironic) the last game I played which had memory puzzles in, this game actually made me write notes down on a piece of paper in order for me to progress which again, is something which is commonly not needed in this day and age.\n\nThe graphics and art style in Unmechanical are lovely. It has that mechanical look to it, with some really nice looking textures in the environment, and the animation of everything is just so smooth and faultless.\n\nUnmechanical also offers various endings to the game; which is something I only found out after I had finished the game. Thankfully you can easily access the other endings of the game due to the last save point being just before you make the choice so, allowing you to see them all if you so please.\n\nI wouldn't say Unmechanical is a difficult game as such, you can work out all of the puzzles if you think about it for a few moments, none of them have crazy resolutions that make no sense, and a couple of them are only skill based too.\n\nA playthrough from beginning to end of Unmechanical took me about five hours which is exactly the sort of length I look for in this type of game. I think anymore and it would start to feel drawn out more than it should. However there is no replay ability to it, as I said, you can easily access the other endings, and once you have done all the puzzles once, there is no need to play it again. Thankfully though, the prices reflects this, sitting nicely at £6,99 - which is just the right cost for a game of this length.\n\nI didn't have any technical issues whilst playing. Whilst the graphics look really nice, this game will be able to be played on pretty much any setup.\n\nI'll certainly recommend Unmechanical, if you aren't normally a fan of puzzle based games I would still recommend it, because I'm not normally a fan, but I had a really good time whilst playing. Hardcore puzzle fanatics may well find the puzzles to be a little too easy, but it's still worth the couple of hours of your time to experience this awesome game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Puzzles can be difficult, but never overly frustrating. Achievements can be near impossible to get and some can't be gone back to once passed. Overall, a lovely game with just enough of a storyline to keep you hooked and make the choice at the end a tough one. I recommend using a gamepad, it makes all of the difference on puzzles requiring precision.","October 3, 2013","true","14.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

It's a brief, ambiguous journey that leaves a lot open for player interpretation (occasionally too much), but accomplishes a great deal through context and the brilliantly imaginative environment around you. I had no idea what I would be getting when I first started it up, but by the end was immensely glad I had given it a chance.\n\nThe first surprise came in the form of the fantastic visuals, which put Unreal Engine 3 to use more effectively than I've seen from some AAA games. Gorgeous lighting, a creative and evocative art style, and some very clever use of cinematography make moving through the dark mines a beautiful affair. It also helps infer a lot of the narrative, that without any exposition is impressively well realized if you take the time to take it all in. I do wish the ending was a bit more substantial and obvious when it was coming, but being able to quickly reload and see both alternatives put them both in better context (even if they still feel a tad rushed).\n\nThe second surprise was that despite my prior assumptions, Unmechanical isn't at all a standard physics puzzler. Instead, every puzzle is contextually placed throughout the world making them more meaningful and the world more engrossing, and avoids falling back on the same types of puzzles as each is unique to the area it resides in. None of them are particularly challenging or involved, but the way the all fit so well within the world and manage to loop back around to each other is brilliant, and shows a level or forethought by the developers that's often missed in a lot of games.\n\nMy only real issue is that Unmechanical does a very poor job of conveying where and what you need to do next. Half of this is intentional, as it allows the player to discover things on their own instead of being spoon fed along a linear path, but the other half is simply poor design as paths are often obscured or off screen without any indication you are meant to go back and look for them. This mostly meant I had to rely on the hint system a good deal more than I would have liked, but even then it wasn't entirely effective at guiding me to the next area when I got stuck, which more often than not required me to stumble around and explore every nook and cranny until I found a tunnel I'd missed or a door that had become unlocked.\n\nAside from that frustration, Unmechanical was remarkably enjoyable. Nothing about it is especially memorable, but I was engaged the entire time through and disappointed when it ended so soon. Though it seems to have flown under the radar for most, I hope that this isn't the last we see of Unmechanical, as for the developer's first major release the quality is already impressive and would likely only improve in a more expansive sequel.","August 11, 2014","true","2.7"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hisui/recommended/211180/","hisui","Hisui","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hisui/","1402 products in account","This is one of those games that's right up my alley. Cute little puzzler with no instructions that relies solely on your capacity to pick up visual and logical clues to solve the challenges. ...Allright, there's always the F1 key to give you a small hint, but the game rarely is too difficult as to require you to use it (plus you will miss out on an achievement as well... you wouldn't want to do that..)\n\nThere might be a bit too much saving for my tastes, so that I always knew when I'd done something right. So subjectively, I never had a hard time with the puzzles, but solving them still felt rewarding. I somehow expected a little more out of the latter parts of the game, but the difficulty never really ramped up. I would have liked more physics-based puzzles, for instance. Maybe that is because of the overly simplistic game mechanic (only 1 action throughout), which limits the possibilities of interacting with the environment? I don't know.\n\nBut then I think that it's allright, because I gained the impression that the game places more emphasis on the great atmosphere created by the setting and music than on the actual puzzle challenges. Stunning visuals and good effects, I like. I had a great time indeed from the get-go, which isn't necessarily self-evident with such a premise. I did therefore hope to get a lot out of it, but my first playthrough took me a bit over 4 hours, and the second one only about half an hour to get all the leftover achievements. Which somewhat is a shame, since I think this game has super potential.\n\nAll in all, a great but short experience with little to no challenge.","January 8, 2014","true","6.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/211180/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","Instinct tells me to call this a puzzle-platformer but due to our main character being able to fly with his little rotor-blade he never actually requires platforms and nor does he ever jump.  Our robot character is equipped with a tractor-beam which he can use to move objects about his environment and the physics involved are really quite nice and feel accurate.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SOGzgb_W4Sk\n\nThe game isn’t very long, its maybe somewhere in the three hour range to complete.  There are a couple of puzzles that might cause a few problems, one that caused me a problem was one near the end that I completely overthought.  I started making a spreadsheet in an attempt to calculate the logic behind it.  This wasn’t necessary, I just wasn’t thinking simple enough!!  In general the difficulty starts easy and ramps slowly towards the end making it an extremely pleasurable journey.  Due to this and combined with the nice feel to the game I can see myself replaying it.\n\nThere is an extra DLC which seems to be included at no extra cost and provides an extra world to play.  I have yet to test this part of the game.\n\nGraphics are nice and the screen zooms in and out depending on the environment or puzzle being attempted.  Everything is nice and smooth with the game being made in Unreal Engine.\n\nThe developers have managed to capture quite an excellent atmosphere throughout the game with a great selection of ambient sounds which at times border on actual music being played.\n\nThe menu system is quite basic and doesn’t cater for higher resolutions than 1080p or advanced graphics settings.  This can be changed in a configuration file (check the forums) if you need to.  I played through on 1080p mode wishing I could play on my native resolution of 1440p and then discovered this workaround afterwards.  Bleh!!\n\nI give Unmechanical a strong recommendation to anyone that enjoys puzzle-platform games.  It’s a hidden gem that deserves a lot more attention!!","February 29","true","3.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Maybe its the simple controls making the whole game run smooth as can be? Who knows? The only real issue this game has is that its just a little too easy, most of the puzzles requiring quite simple answers and easy solutions.

Unmechanical is a cute little puzzle platformer with some lovely steampunk graphics and sounds. It's short, about 2,5 hours long, but that's not a dealbreaker. I do wish it was a bit longer though, because the world it is set in is just wonderfully crafted and the puzzles are logical. You won't ever die in this game and the puzzles can be solved without (too much) trial-and-error which makes the whole experience so much better.\n\nThat and the game actually has 2 endings. Which I both love (though I prefer the ending with the scene after the credits). The backstory is done in such a way that it can be interpreted in your own way.

First run took me about 2.5 hours to complete. Second run took about 1 hour plus some extra time wrapping up the achievements I missed on the first run. So yes, this game can end up being really short. But if you don't take time to soak up the surroundings, the backgrounds, the atmosphere, and the music, you'll end up missing out on a lot.\n\nEven though you essentially only have a single ability, the designers manage to offer several different environmental variables that make you use it in vastly different and clever ways. The game provided a charming appeal similar to Machinarium and was definitely worth my time.","March 5, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/byrondoonsblap/recommended/211180/","byrondoonsblap","Biodegradable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/byrondoonsblap/","54 products in account","Unmechanical is a charming and endearing little puzzle/exploration game that started off as a student project before a development team caught eye of the group of students and teamed up to make a full-fledged game. It's built on the Unreal engine, once again proving to still be one of the most superior as the graphics are top-notch and the mechanics are simple and fluid. Not jutters, not frame-rate issues,  just smoooooooooooooooooooooooooooth.\n\nYou play as an adorable little flying robot, who I nicknamed "Ohm" (based on the small noise it makes when it bumps into things), and one day as you're flying about with your family, an odd-looking pipe sprouts out of the ground and sucks you in. After a very long ride down a very long pipe, you wake up in a very strange underground bio-mechanical nexus, and you need to find your way out and reunite with your loved ones. As you venture forth, solving puzzles to pass through obstacles, you will find this place to have a dark and sinister secret.\n\nUnmechanical encourages exploration and outside-the-box thinking as it challenges you with a combination of traditional and environmental puzzles that test your memory and reflexes. Anyone who has ever played games such as Portal, Machinarium or Limbo will feel right at home with this one. It's not very long, though that can depend on your puzzle-solving skills. The game is solely based on its puzzles, so there aren't any enemies to stop you. Much like Portal, you either solve it, or be trapped.\n\nIf you're like me and like a challenge with environmental puzzles like those in Oddworld, Limbo or Portal, you'll love it. If you're more of a traditional puzzler who often plays Sudoku and puzzles those of the likes of Machinarium, there's plenty for you as well. If you consider yourself an expert puzzler who utterly destroys puzzle games though, Unmechanical will probably be pretty easy and you'll breeze through it in an hour. It really depends.\n\nI suppose the only fair criticism that can be thrown at this game is its lack of narrative. The description I gave at the beginning is really just my own interpretation. It's rather ambiguous and interestingly enough, the game has two endings depending on this one action you may or may not decide to do near the very end of the game. Otherwise, you can simply consider it a story about escape. It's kind of like Limbo but you have a clearer idea of what your ultimate goal actually is.\n\nIf you're into any of the games I mentioned above, I recommend this one. Especially to fans of Limbo who enjoy a forboding atmosphere and visuals that'll make them drool with delight.","August 14, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Billed as a puzzler, it's more about exploration, but happens to tie its universe together by letting you interact with different new discoveries, which happen to include many puzzles elements.\n\nHighlights\nIn any other game, lack of lore, history or story would be a let down, but they help add charm to Unmechanical. It never pretends to be anything more than a short fun exploration of a cool, atmospheric world.\n\n* Fantastic use of the Unreal Engine, lighting and the great looking 2.5D elements add tone and depth\n* Pleasant simplicity and a well designed little robot, almost relaxing at times, without being boring\n\nMistakes\n* It's common to not know what the game wants you to do next, or how to progress\n* Some people will be disappointed by a short playtime and an abrupt ending\n\nRecommendationsUnmechanical is £6.99/8.99€/$9.99 on Steam and has a short playtime of around 3 hours and very little reason to play through more than once.

And this is exactly what the game designers for Unmechanical did unbelievably right with how they designed their puzzles.  I have been developing this theory about puzzles in games as having a line dividing them: on the one side are inductive puzzles (puzzles that implicitly communicate their parameters to the player via the environment and leave the player to discover the solution) and deductive puzzles (puzzles that explicitly communicate to the player the rules that govern the parameters of the puzzle and leave the player to deduce the solution).  Now why did I use the word discover with inductive puzzles yet deduce with deductive puzzles?  Could I have used induce instead of discover?  Yes I could have.  Should have I?  No.  Why?  Because discover is much more engaging of a word.  That is exactly the attitude you need when attempting to solve inductive puzzles.  You need to engage every....... single...... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...... object......... because sometimes you never know which one will lead to the solution.  Now I must admit that this strategy is used predominately in adventure games with what I call pixel treasure hunt.  But Unmechanical did an "amazing" job at implicitly communicating the expectations of its puzzles using solely elements from the game.  (If it weren't for this puzzle I would be able to take that amazing out of the parenthesis but leaving the player to figure out how to solve a puzzle can have some backdraft if not properly designed into the environment, as I will now address.)\n\nThe only issue I have seen with the inductive form of puzzle design is that heavy reliance on the environment to communicate the parameters of a puzzle means the designers have to heavily rely on solid environmental design.  It is very easy to make mistakes here simply because humans are not accustomed to this form of communication.  Imagine this: You need to tell your GF that you are going to be late from work.  You can either call her and tell her directly (deductive) or devise a way for her to figure it out as she interacts with her environment (inductive).  The latter is MUCH MUCH MUCH more enjoyable from a game design point of view...IF DONE CORRECTLY!!!!!  However, nothing is more frustrating than knowing the game wants you to do something before progression in the story in allowed yet having no clue what to do.\n\nIn the end though, I applaud the design team behind Unmechanical for taking the inductive route of puzzle design simply because I don't see it often.  Don't get me wrong, both forms of puzzles are wonderfully fun in their own right but too many developers take the easy route of writing a story for a game, then jerking the gamer out of that story every time a puzzle is introduced to explain the rules behind it.  The rule of thumb I would have towards whether a game should have inductive vs deductive puzzles would be - respect the gamer's expectations.  If you have inductive puzzles put every single drop of design juice into the environment to ensure that the gamer is communicated clearly what is expected of him to solve the puzzle without ever being jerked from the story.  If you have deductive puzzles then take advantage of them by making puzzles with interesting rules that require back door logic, or crossword thinking to solve.  DO NOT make a game that doesn't know what it is because the gamer will immediately know it and hate you forever for it.\n\nHere is my Playalyzation of this game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBJxdpXNnt6LMk0EpgQ2gitOjWTd-jXm","October 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And even though such a comparison falls short, I enjoyed it as much as the latter. But what is it all about? Unmechanical is a physics-puzzle game, which means your missions are mostly related to lifting some stones here, dropping some stones there. Good news is that the puzzles are really well-crafted, diverse and entertaining. The game's level design is terrific, and the gameplay is praiseworthy: both keybord and joystick work fine. Perhaps the storyline was the only thing that needed some improvement: we don't know who we are or why we are where we are; and the ending was also a letdown because it came too abruptly. In short, Unmechanical is a great puzzle game and could've been a classic if it had a better character developement.","March 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzle design borders on overly-simplistic (I dont even understand why there's an in-game hint system you can activate) logic puzzles hidden among the lush scenery that changes the deeper into the world you go. Game mechanics are simple and straight forward: you fly around and pick stuff up. The puzzle aspect uses these mechanics very well and to their full force. The story is left open to interpretation (just like all good art) and by the time you finish the game, you emerge with a sense of satisfaction at having completed your quest for freedom (or not, if you chose "the other path".)  Graphics are beautiful, charming and original (where else will you encounter a giant beating heart with a pace-maker underground?). Gameplay, while short (only took me about 3 hours from beginning to end), feels perfect for an adventure puzzler. All in all, a great puzzle game that's lacking slightly in replay value but stands out in visuals and atmosphere.","February 10, 2013","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More than once I had to find a trap door which should have been immediately obvious but was not, time was wasted looking for it.\n3. Slightly buggy as you can get stuck particularly when carrying objects but meh, nothing a quick reload can't fix without losing pretty much anything.\n4. Felt most of the puzzles were too easy. Many puzzles are impossible to solve until you come back later but nothing tells you that is the case which is frustrating.\n\n2.5/5 Get it only if its on a large discount and you want a quick brain teaser.","December 2, 2013","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is not a long game and can probably be finished in a couple of hours - there's no chance for getting stuck and doing something wrong that can't be reversed. Most of the time it is pretty obvious where next to go and what to do - a few of the puzzles and routes are pretty confusing, though.\n\nCons are that the environments in game are similar enough that it can be hard to remember where to go (though it must be said that they are pretty and very atmospheric) - especially when you take a break from the game, which can feel a little 'same-same' in a longer sitting. There were some parts where timing was crucial, which was a little annoying as the controls feel quite heavy and dense making fine maneuvering quite difficult - fortunately they were few and not too frustrating so it ended up only taking a few tries for each.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice little game for taking a break and worth a few Euro, though I would definitely wait for a sale to pick this title up.","November 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Worth every cent despite the criticisms I'm about to level.  Firstly, the game has a very annoying tendancy to make you complete the same puzzle several times before allowing you to continue (eg. making you carry five rocks to a button when one or two will do). This tends to undermine the puzzle aspect and replace it with useless tedium at times. Secondly, it is far to easy to make a mistake and lodge a physics object in a place where it is impossible to recover it. In Portal, for example, you had to put in some serious effort to actually lose a cube because, in most cases, the dispenser would simply provide a replacement; this is not the case in Unmechanical. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is no manual save system, and no way to restart a level from a particular point. It is therefore, very easy to create a situation in which you will be forced to start again from the begining because a rock has landed itself in fron of a door or gotten stuck underwater.\n\nDespite these issues, do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is worth the $10 for the visuals alone.","January 13, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are devilishly simple yet never serve too tarnish or cheapen gameplay. You control an unnamed robot with an unflinching disposition that excels in 4 tasks with unmatched execution: Flight, Transporting Small Objects, Slamming into EVERYTHING, and of course, look like a precious metal child with a propeller cap. The visuals evolve as you progress, following the style of the puzzles. Locals include watery caves that evolve seamlessly into a bizarre fusion of metal and flesh. Musical queues provide confirmation when progress is made, giving a well deserved feeling of relief and fits in just right with the space around you.

Got so into it, so blown away by the beautiful and creative level design that I actually completely the entire thing on one pass, something I don't believe i've ever done before. There was one moment where I was quite tired (it WAS like 3am) and exited, but once I saw an achievement I knew i'd easilly be able to complete, I popped back into the game and ended up going on till the end. 4 Hours total ... which I find is a bit short for a game with such wonderful features. I know it was hard to create and all, but now what? I MAY be able to play the game another time or two, but other than that I'm done. It's all over. I can only hope the game gets good reviews and attention and the studios decide to continue on to a second installment. But that is doubtful considering the genre.\nThe ending was a tad anticlimactic, it didnt even have the wonderful atmospheric music that was at one point in the middle of the game very prominantly featured in a 'scene' that was hinted to in part of the trailer for the game. My point, THAT scene was COOL, and the ending should have at least been that cool or better.\nThe character you control has certain lifelike characteristics, likely part of the idea presented in the title for the game itself. Even the ending had me at least TRY to commit a 'humane' act prior to commiting to something more ... utilitarian? I gather this is exactly what was expected by the game creators. Bravo to them on a great game that makes you think.\nLevel design was phenominal!!! The atmosphere was moody and the special effects, especially when you went under water or into the dark, were an absolute delight and an outstanding use of the technology at hand (running on the impressive Unreal engine). Though a 2D platformer style game, the 3Dimensional effects of the environment was impressive and at times very deep and detailed.\nMusic was atmospheric and beautiful.\nPhysics is an absolutely integral aspect of the game, and it did not dissapoint. I dont know if a PhysX engine (via an Nvidia card) would have introduced anything extra into this game (if they even put extra support/effects for PhysX), but it ran beautifuly on my moderatly powered AMD A8 APU based laptop.\n\nIf you have any love for quality puzzle based games, this game is absolutely a wonder to behold. Though a tad short and questionably lackluster ending leave you wanting more, as a whole I'd say "wanting more" is a very good alternative to anything less.","July 13, 2013","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game makes heavy use of physics, and many of the puzzles involve things like momentum, weight, reflection, etc. Built-in hint system ensures that you won't get stuck, at a loss on how to proceed, for long. The puzzles themselves are fairly varied (none are particularly taxing), and there's a distinct feeling of engagement and connectedness in the way you manipulate your character's actions and the way he interacts with the world.

Worth every cent despite the criticisms I'm about to level.  Firstly, the game has a very annoying tendancy to make you complete the same puzzle several times before allowing you to continue (eg. making you carry five rocks to a button when one or two will do). This tends to undermine the puzzle aspect and replace it with useless tedium at times. Secondly, it is far to easy to make a mistake and lodge a physics object in a place where it is impossible to recover it. In Portal, for example, you had to put in some serious effort to actually lose a cube because, in most cases, the dispenser would simply provide a replacement; this is not the case in Unmechanical. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is no manual save system, and no way to restart a level from a particular point. It is therefore, very easy to create a situation in which you will be forced to start again from the begining because a rock has landed itself in fron of a door or gotten stuck underwater.\n\nDespite these issues, do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is worth the $10 for the visuals alone.","January 13, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
